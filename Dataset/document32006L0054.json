{"celex_id": "32006L0054", "reference": "26.7.2006\nEN\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\nL 204/23\nDIRECTIVE 2006/54/EC OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL\nof 5 July 2006\non the implementation of the principle of equal opportunities and equal treatment of men and women in matters of employment and occupation (recast)\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 141(3) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the Commission,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee (1),\nActing in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty (2),\nWhereas:\n(1)\nCouncil Directive 76/207/EEC of 9 February 1976 on the implementation of the principle of equal treatment for men and women as regards access to employment, vocational training and promotion, and working conditions (3) and Council Directive 86/378/EEC of 24 July 1986 on the implementation of the principle of equal treatment for men and women in occupational social security schemes (4) have been significantly amended (5). Council Directive 75/117/EEC of 10 February 1975 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the application of the principle of equal pay for men and women (6) and Council Directive 97/80/EC of 15 December 1997 on the burden of proof in cases of discrimination based on sex (7) also contain provisions which have as their purpose the implementation of the principle of equal treatment between men and women. Now that new amendments are being made to the said Directives, it is desirable, for reasons of clarity, that the provisions in question should be recast by bringing together in a single text the main provisions existing in this field as well as certain developments arising out of the case-law of the Court of Justice of the European Communities (hereinafter referred to as the Court of Justice).\n(2)\nEquality between men and women is a fundamental principle of Community law under Article 2 and Article 3(2) of the Treaty and the case-law of the Court of Justice. Those Treaty provisions proclaim equality between men and women as a ‘task’ and an ‘aim’ of the Community and impose a positive obligation to promote it in all its activities.\n(3)\nThe Court of Justice has held that the scope of the principle of equal treatment for men and women cannot be confined to the prohibition of discrimination based on the fact that a person is of one or other sex. In view of its purpose and the nature of the rights which it seeks to safeguard, it also applies to discrimination arising from the gender reassignment of a person.\n(4)\nArticle 141(3) of the Treaty now provides a specific legal basis for the adoption of Community measures to ensure the application of the principle of equal opportunities and equal treatment in matters of employment and occupation, including the principle of equal pay for equal work or work of equal value.\n(5)\nArticles 21 and 23 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union also prohibit any discrimination on grounds of sex and enshrine the right to equal treatment between men and women in all areas, including employment, work and pay.\n(6)\nHarassment and sexual harassment are contrary to the principle of equal treatment between men and women and constitute discrimination on grounds of sex for the purposes of this Directive. These forms of discrimination occur not only in the workplace, but also in the context of access to employment, vocational training and promotion. They should therefore be prohibited and should be subject to effective, proportionate and dissuasive penalties.\n(7)\nIn this context, employers and those responsible for vocational training should be encouraged to take measures to combat all forms of discrimination on grounds of sex and, in particular, to take preventive measures against harassment and sexual harassment in the workplace and in access to employment, vocational training and promotion, in accordance with national law and practice.\n(8)\nThe principle of equal pay for equal work or work of equal value as laid down by Article 141 of the Treaty and consistently upheld in the case-law of the Court of Justice constitutes an important aspect of the principle of equal treatment between men and women and an essential and indispensable part of the acquis communautaire, including the case-law of the Court concerning sex discrimination. It is therefore appropriate to make further provision for its implementation.\n(9)\nIn accordance with settled case-law of the Court of Justice, in order to assess whether workers are performing the same work or work of equal value, it should be determined whether, having regard to a range of factors including the nature of the work and training and working conditions, those workers may be considered to be in a comparable situation.\n(10)\nThe Court of Justice has established that, in certain circumstances, the principle of equal pay is not limited to situations in which men and women work for the same employer.\n(11)\nThe Member States, in collaboration with the social partners, should continue to address the problem of the continuing gender-based wage differentials and marked gender segregation on the labour market by means such as flexible working time arrangements which enable both men and women to combine family and work commitments more successfully. This could also include appropriate parental leave arrangements which could be taken up by either parent as well as the provision of accessible and affordable child-care facilities and care for dependent persons.\n(12)\nSpecific measures should be adopted to ensure the implementation of the principle of equal treatment in occupational social security schemes and to define its scope more clearly.\n(13)\nIn its judgment of 17 May 1990 in Case C-262/88 (8), the Court of Justice determined that all forms of occupational pension constitute an element of pay within the meaning of Article 141 of the Treaty.\n(14)\nAlthough the concept of pay within the meaning of Article 141 of the Treaty does not encompass social security benefits, it is now clearly established that a pension scheme for public servants falls within the scope of the principle of equal pay if the benefits payable under the scheme are paid to the worker by reason of his/her employment relationship with the public employer, notwithstanding the fact that such scheme forms part of a general statutory scheme. According to the judgments of the Court of Justice in Cases C-7/93 (9) and C-351/00 (10), that condition will be satisfied if the pension scheme concerns a particular category of workers and its benefits are directly related to the period of service and calculated by reference to the public servant's final salary. For reasons of clarity, it is therefore appropriate to make specific provision to that effect.\n(15)\nThe Court of Justice has confirmed that whilst the contributions of male and female workers to a defined-benefit pension scheme are covered by Article 141 of the Treaty, any inequality in employers' contributions paid under funded defined-benefit schemes which is due to the use of actuarial factors differing according to sex is not to be assessed in the light of that same provision.\n(16)\nBy way of example, in the case of funded defined‐benefit schemes, certain elements, such as conversion into a capital sum of part of a periodic pension, transfer of pension rights, a reversionary pension payable to a dependant in return for the surrender of part of a pension or a reduced pension where the worker opts to take earlier retirement, may be unequal where the inequality of the amounts results from the effects of the use of actuarial factors differing according to sex at the time when the scheme's funding is implemented.\n(17)\nIt is well established that benefits payable under occupational social security schemes are not to be considered as remuneration insofar as they are attributable to periods of employment prior to 17 May 1990, except in the case of workers or those claiming under them who initiated legal proceedings or brought an equivalent claim under the applicable national law before that date. It is therefore necessary to limit the implementation of the principle of equal treatment accordingly.\n(18)\nThe Court of Justice has consistently held that the Barber Protocol (11) does not affect the right to join an occupational pension scheme and that the limitation of the effects in time of the judgment in Case C-262/88 does not apply to the right to join an occupational pension scheme. The Court of Justice also ruled that the national rules relating to time limits for bringing actions under national law may be relied on against workers who assert their right to join an occupational pension scheme, provided that they are not less favourable for that type of action than for similar actions of a domestic nature and that they do not render the exercise of rights conferred by Community law impossible in practice. The Court of Justice has also pointed out that the fact that a worker can claim retroactively to join an occupational pension scheme does not allow the worker to avoid paying the contributions relating to the period of membership concerned.\n(19)\nEnsuring equal access to employment and the vocational training leading thereto is fundamental to the application of the principle of equal treatment of men and women in matters of employment and occupation. Any exception to this principle should therefore be limited to those occupational activities which necessitate the employment of a person of a particular sex by reason of their nature or the context in which they are carried out, provided that the objective sought is legitimate and complies with the principle of proportionality.\n(20)\nThis Directive does not prejudice freedom of association, including the right to establish unions with others and to join unions to defend one's interests. Measures within the meaning of Article 141(4) of the Treaty may include membership or the continuation of the activity of organisations or unions whose main objective is the promotion, in practice, of the principle of equal treatment between men and women.\n(21)\nThe prohibition of discrimination should be without prejudice to the maintenance or adoption of measures intended to prevent or compensate for disadvantages suffered by a group of persons of one sex. Such measures permit organisations of persons of one sex where their main object is the promotion of the special needs of those persons and the promotion of equality between men and women.\n(22)\nIn accordance with Article 141(4) of the Treaty, with a view to ensuring full equality in practice between men and women in working life, the principle of equal treatment does not prevent Member States from maintaining or adopting measures providing for specific advantages in order to make it easier for the under-represented sex to pursue a vocational activity or to prevent or compensate for disadvantages in professional careers. Given the current situation and bearing in mind Declaration No 28 to the Amsterdam Treaty, Member States should, in the first instance, aim at improving the situation of women in working life.\n(23)\nIt is clear from the case-law of the Court of Justice that unfavourable treatment of a woman related to pregnancy or maternity constitutes direct discrimination on grounds of sex. Such treatment should therefore be expressly covered by this Directive.\n(24)\nThe Court of Justice has consistently recognised the legitimacy, as regards the principle of equal treatment, of protecting a woman's biological condition during pregnancy and maternity and of introducing maternity protection measures as a means to achieve substantive equality. This Directive should therefore be without prejudice to Council Directive 92/85/EEC of 19 October 1992 on the introduction of measures to encourage improvements in the safety and health at work of pregnant workers and workers who have recently given birth or are breastfeeding (12). This Directive should further be without prejudice to Council Directive 96/34/EC of 3 June 1996 on the framework agreement on parental leave concluded by UNICE, CEEP and the ETUC (13).\n(25)\nFor reasons of clarity, it is also appropriate to make express provision for the protection of the employment rights of women on maternity leave and in particular their right to return to the same or an equivalent post, to suffer no detriment in their terms and conditions as a result of taking such leave and to benefit from any improvement in working conditions to which they would have been entitled during their absence.\n(26)\nIn the Resolution of the Council and of the Ministers for Employment and Social Policy, meeting within the Council, of 29 June 2000 on the balanced participation of women and men in family and working life (14), Member States were encouraged to consider examining the scope for their respective legal systems to grant working men an individual and non‐transferable right to paternity leave, while maintaining their rights relating to employment.\n(27)\nSimilar considerations apply to the granting by Member States to men and women of an individual and non-transferable right to leave subsequent to the adoption of a child. It is for the Member States to determine whether or not to grant such a right to paternity and/or adoption leave and also to determine any conditions, other than dismissal and return to work, which are outside the scope of this Directive.\n(28)\nThe effective implementation of the principle of equal treatment requires appropriate procedures to be put in place by the Member States.\n(29)\nThe provision of adequate judicial or administrative procedures for the enforcement of the obligations imposed by this Directive is essential to the effective implementation of the principle of equal treatment.\n(30)\nThe adoption of rules on the burden of proof plays a significant role in ensuring that the principle of equal treatment can be effectively enforced. As the Court of Justice has held, provision should therefore be made to ensure that the burden of proof shifts to the respondent when there is a prima facie case of discrimination, except in relation to proceedings in which it is for the court or other competent national body to investigate the facts. It is however necessary to clarify that the appreciation of the facts from which it may be presumed that there has been direct or indirect discrimination remains a matter for the relevant national body in accordance with national law or practice. Further, it is for the Member States to introduce, at any appropriate stage of the proceedings, rules of evidence which are more favourable to plaintiffs.\n(31)\nWith a view to further improving the level of protection offered by this Directive, associations, organisations and other legal entities should also be empowered to engage in proceedings, as the Member States so determine, either on behalf or in support of a complainant, without prejudice to national rules of procedure concerning representation and defence.\n(32)\nHaving regard to the fundamental nature of the right to effective legal protection, it is appropriate to ensure that workers continue to enjoy such protection even after the relationship giving rise to an alleged breach of the principle of equal treatment has ended. An employee defending or giving evidence on behalf of a person protected under this Directive should be entitled to the same protection.\n(33)\nIt has been clearly established by the Court of Justice that in order to be effective, the principle of equal treatment implies that the compensation awarded for any breach must be adequate in relation to the damage sustained. It is therefore appropriate to exclude the fixing of any prior upper limit for such compensation, except where the employer can prove that the only damage suffered by an applicant as a result of discrimination within the meaning of this Directive was the refusal to take his/her job application into consideration.\n(34)\nIn order to enhance the effective implementation of the principle of equal treatment, Member States should promote dialogue between the social partners and, within the framework of national practice, with non-governmental organisations.\n(35)\nMember States should provide for effective, proportionate and dissuasive penalties for breaches of the obligations under this Directive.\n(36)\nSince the objectives of this Directive cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Directive does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives.\n(37)\nFor the sake of a better understanding of the different treatment of men and women in matters of employment and occupation, comparable statistics disaggregated by sex should continue to be developed, analysed and made available at the appropriate levels.\n(38)\nEqual treatment of men and women in matters of employment and occupation cannot be restricted to legislative measures. Instead, the European Union and the Member States should continue to promote the raising of public awareness of wage discrimination and the changing of public attitudes, involving all parties concerned at public and private level to the greatest possible extent. The dialogue between the social partners could play an important role in this process.\n(39)\nThe obligation to transpose this Directive into national law should be confined to those provisions which represent a substantive change as compared with the earlier Directives. The obligation to transpose the provisions which are substantially unchanged arises under the earlier Directives.\n(40)\nThis Directive should be without prejudice to the obligations of the Member States relating to the time limits for transposition into national law and application of the Directives set out in Annex I, Part B.\n(41)\nIn accordance with paragraph 34 of the Interinstitutional agreement on better law‐making (15), Member States are encouraged to draw up, for themselves and in the interest of the Community, their own tables, which will, as far as possible, illustrate the correlation between this Directive and the transposition measures and to make them public,\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:\nTITLE I\nGENERAL PROVISIONS\nArticle 1\nPurpose\nThe purpose of this Directive is to ensure the implementation of the principle of equal opportunities and equal treatment of men and women in matters of employment and occupation.\nTo that end, it contains provisions to implement the principle of equal treatment in relation to:\n(a)\naccess to employment, including promotion, and to vocational training;\n(b)\nworking conditions, including pay;\n(c)\noccupational social security schemes.\nIt also contains provisions to ensure that such implementation is made more effective by the establishment of appropriate procedures.\nArticle 2\nDefinitions\n1.   For the purposes of this Directive, the following definitions shall apply:\n(a)\n‘direct discrimination’: where one person is treated less favourably on grounds of sex than another is, has been or would be treated in a comparable situation;\n(b)\n‘indirect discrimination’: where an apparently neutral provision, criterion or practice would put persons of one sex at a particular disadvantage compared with persons of the other sex, unless that provision, criterion or practice is objectively justified by a legitimate aim, and the means of achieving that aim are appropriate and necessary;\n(c)\n‘harassment’: where unwanted conduct related to the sex of a person occurs with the purpose or effect of violating the dignity of a person, and of creating an intimidating, hostile, degrading, humiliating or offensive environment;\n(d)\n‘sexual harassment’: where any form of unwanted verbal, non-verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature occurs, with the purpose or effect of violating the dignity of a person, in particular when creating an intimidating, hostile, degrading, humiliating or offensive environment;\n(e)\n‘pay’: the ordinary basic or minimum wage or salary and any other consideration, whether in cash or in kind, which the worker receives directly or indirectly, in respect of his/her employment from his/her employer;\n(f)\n‘occupational social security schemes’: schemes not governed by Council Directive 79/7/EEC of 19 December 1978 on the progressive implementation of the principle of equal treatment for men and women in matters of social security (16) whose purpose is to provide workers, whether employees or self-employed, in an undertaking or group of undertakings, area of economic activity, occupational sector or group of sectors with benefits intended to supplement the benefits provided by statutory social security schemes or to replace them, whether membership of such schemes is compulsory or optional.\n2.   For the purposes of this Directive, discrimination includes:\n(a)\nharassment and sexual harassment, as well as any less favourable treatment based on a person's rejection of or submission to such conduct;\n(b)\ninstruction to discriminate against persons on grounds of sex;\n(c)\nany less favourable treatment of a woman related to pregnancy or maternity leave within the meaning of Directive 92/85/EEC.\nArticle 3\nPositive action\nMember States may maintain or adopt measures within the meaning of Article 141(4) of the Treaty with a view to ensuring full equality in practice between men and women in working life.\nTITLE II\nSPECIFIC PROVISIONS\nCHAPTER 1\nEqual pay\nArticle 4\nProhibition of discrimination\nFor the same work or for work to which equal value is attributed, direct and indirect discrimination on grounds of sex with regard to all aspects and conditions of remuneration shall be eliminated.\nIn particular, where a job classification system is used for determining pay, it shall be based on the same criteria for both men and women and so drawn up as to exclude any discrimination on grounds of sex.\nCHAPTER 2\nEqual treatment in occupational social security schemes\nArticle 5\nProhibition of discrimination\nWithout prejudice to Article 4, there shall be no direct or indirect discrimination on grounds of sex in occupational social security schemes, in particular as regards:\n(a)\nthe scope of such schemes and the conditions of access to them;\n(b)\nthe obligation to contribute and the calculation of contributions;\n(c)\nthe calculation of benefits, including supplementary benefits due in respect of a spouse or dependants, and the conditions governing the duration and retention of entitlement to benefits.\nArticle 6\nPersonal scope\nThis Chapter shall apply to members of the working population, including self-employed persons, persons whose activity is interrupted by illness, maternity, accident or involuntary unemployment and persons seeking employment and to retired and disabled workers, and to those claiming under them, in accordance with national law and/or practice.\nArticle 7\nMaterial scope\n1.   This Chapter applies to:\n(a)\noccupational social security schemes which provide protection against the following risks:\n(i)\nsickness,\n(ii)\ninvalidity,\n(iii)\nold age, including early retirement,\n(iv)\nindustrial accidents and occupational diseases,\n(v)\nunemployment;\n(b)\noccupational social security schemes which provide for other social benefits, in cash or in kind, and in particular survivors' benefits and family allowances, if such benefits constitute a consideration paid by the employer to the worker by reason of the latter's employment.\n2.   This Chapter also applies to pension schemes for a particular category of worker such as that of public servants if the benefits payable under the scheme are paid by reason of the employment relationship with the public employer. The fact that such a scheme forms part of a general statutory scheme shall be without prejudice in that respect.\nArticle 8\nExclusions from the material scope\n1.   This Chapter does not apply to:\n(a)\nindividual contracts for self-employed persons;\n(b)\nsingle-member schemes for self-employed persons;\n(c)\ninsurance contracts to which the employer is not a party, in the case of workers;\n(d)\noptional provisions of occupational social security schemes offered to participants individually to guarantee them:\n(i)\neither additional benefits,\n(ii)\nor a choice of date on which the normal benefits for self-employed persons will start, or a choice between several benefits;\n(e)\noccupational social security schemes in so far as benefits are financed by contributions paid by workers on a voluntary basis.\n2.   This Chapter does not preclude an employer granting to persons who have already reached the retirement age for the purposes of granting a pension by virtue of an occupational social security scheme, but who have not yet reached the retirement age for the purposes of granting a statutory retirement pension, a pension supplement, the aim of which is to make equal or more nearly equal the overall amount of benefit paid to these persons in relation to the amount paid to persons of the other sex in the same situation who have already reached the statutory retirement age, until the persons benefiting from the supplement reach the statutory retirement age.\nArticle 9\nExamples of discrimination\n1.   Provisions contrary to the principle of equal treatment shall include those based on sex, either directly or indirectly, for:\n(a)\ndetermining the persons who may participate in an occupational social security scheme;\n(b)\nfixing the compulsory or optional nature of participation in an occupational social security scheme;\n(c)\nlaying down different rules as regards the age of entry into the scheme or the minimum period of employment or membership of the scheme required to obtain the benefits thereof;\n(d)\nlaying down different rules, except as provided for in points (h) and (j), for the reimbursement of contributions when a worker leaves a scheme without having fulfilled the conditions guaranteeing a deferred right to long-term benefits;\n(e)\nsetting different conditions for the granting of benefits or restricting such benefits to workers of one or other of the sexes;\n(f)\nfixing different retirement ages;\n(g)\nsuspending the retention or acquisition of rights during periods of maternity leave or leave for family reasons which are granted by law or agreement and are paid by the employer;\n(h)\nsetting different levels of benefit, except in so far as may be necessary to take account of actuarial calculation factors which differ according to sex in the case of defined-contribution schemes; in the case of funded defined-benefit schemes, certain elements may be unequal where the inequality of the amounts results from the effects of the use of actuarial factors differing according to sex at the time when the scheme's funding is implemented;\n(i)\nsetting different levels for workers' contributions;\n(j)\nsetting different levels for employers' contributions, except:\n(i)\nin the case of defined-contribution schemes if the aim is to equalise the amount of the final benefits or to make them more nearly equal for both sexes,\n(ii)\nin the case of funded defined-benefit schemes where the employer's contributions are intended to ensure the adequacy of the funds necessary to cover the cost of the benefits defined;\n(k)\nlaying down different standards or standards applicable only to workers of a specified sex, except as provided for in points (h) and (j), as regards the guarantee or retention of entitlement to deferred benefits when a worker leaves a scheme.\n2.   Where the granting of benefits within the scope of this Chapter is left to the discretion of the scheme's management bodies, the latter shall comply with the principle of equal treatment.\nArticle 10\nImplementation as regards self-employed persons\n1.   Member States shall take the necessary steps to ensure that the provisions of occupational social security schemes for self-employed persons contrary to the principle of equal treatment are revised with effect from 1 January 1993 at the latest or for Member States whose accession took place after that date, at the date that Directive 86/378/EEC became applicable in their territory.\n2.   This Chapter shall not preclude rights and obligations relating to a period of membership of an occupational social security scheme for self-employed persons prior to revision of that scheme from remaining subject to the provisions of the scheme in force during that period.\nArticle 11\nPossibility of deferral as regards self-employed persons\nAs regards occupational social security schemes for self-employed persons, Member States may defer compulsory application of the principle of equal treatment with regard to:\n(a)\ndetermination of pensionable age for the granting of old-age or retirement pensions, and the possible implications for other benefits:\n(i)\neither until the date on which such equality is achieved in statutory schemes,\n(ii)\nor, at the latest, until such equality is prescribed by a directive;\n(b)\nsurvivors' pensions until Community law establishes the principle of equal treatment in statutory social security schemes in that regard;\n(c)\nthe application of Article 9(1)(i) in relation to the use of actuarial calculation factors, until 1 January 1999 or for Member States whose accession took place after that date until the date that Directive 86/378/EEC became applicable in their territory.\nArticle 12\nRetroactive effect\n1.   Any measure implementing this Chapter, as regards workers, shall cover all benefits under occupational social security schemes derived from periods of employment subsequent to 17 May 1990 and shall apply retroactively to that date, without prejudice to workers or those claiming under them who have, before that date, initiated legal proceedings or raised an equivalent claim under national law. In that event, the implementation measures shall apply retroactively to 8 April 1976 and shall cover all the benefits derived from periods of employment after that date. For Member States which acceded to the Community after 8 April 1976, and before 17 May 1990, that date shall be replaced by the date on which Article 141 of the Treaty became applicable in their territory.\n2.   The second sentence of paragraph 1 shall not prevent national rules relating to time limits for bringing actions under national law from being relied on against workers or those claiming under them who initiated legal proceedings or raised an equivalent claim under national law before 17 May 1990, provided that they are not less favourable for that type of action than for similar actions of a domestic nature and that they do not render the exercise of rights conferred by Community law impossible in practice.\n3.   For Member States whose accession took place after 17 May 1990 and which were on 1 January 1994 Contracting Parties to the Agreement on the European Economic Area, the date of 17 May 1990 in the first sentence of paragraph 1 shall be replaced by 1 January 1994.\n4.   For other Member States whose accession took place after 17 May 1990, the date of 17 May 1990 in paragraphs 1 and 2 shall be replaced by the date on which Article 141 of the Treaty became applicable in their territory.\nArticle 13\nFlexible pensionable age\nWhere men and women may claim a flexible pensionable age under the same conditions, this shall not be deemed to be incompatible with this Chapter.\nCHAPTER 3\nEqual treatment as regards access to employment, vocational training and promotion and working conditions\nArticle 14\nProhibition of discrimination\n1.   There shall be no direct or indirect discrimination on grounds of sex in the public or private sectors, including public bodies, in relation to:\n(a)\nconditions for access to employment, to self-employment or to occupation, including selection criteria and recruitment conditions, whatever the branch of activity and at all levels of the professional hierarchy, including promotion;\n(b)\naccess to all types and to all levels of vocational guidance, vocational training, advanced vocational training and retraining, including practical work experience;\n(c)\nemployment and working conditions, including dismissals, as well as pay as provided for in Article 141 of the Treaty;\n(d)\nmembership of, and involvement in, an organisation of workers or employers, or any organisation whose members carry on a particular profession, including the benefits provided for by such organisations.\n2.   Member States may provide, as regards access to employment including the training leading thereto, that a difference of treatment which is based on a characteristic related to sex shall not constitute discrimination where, by reason of the nature of the particular occupational activities concerned or of the context in which they are carried out, such a characteristic constitutes a genuine and determining occupational requirement, provided that its objective is legitimate and the requirement is proportionate.\nArticle 15\nReturn from maternity leave\nA woman on maternity leave shall be entitled, after the end of her period of maternity leave, to return to her job or to an equivalent post on terms and conditions which are no less favourable to her and to benefit from any improvement in working conditions to which she would have been entitled during her absence.\nArticle 16\nPaternity and adoption leave\nThis Directive is without prejudice to the right of Member States to recognise distinct rights to paternity and/or adoption leave. Those Member States which recognise such rights shall take the necessary measures to protect working men and women against dismissal due to exercising those rights and ensure that, at the end of such leave, they are entitled to return to their jobs or to equivalent posts on terms and conditions which are no less favourable to them, and to benefit from any improvement in working conditions to which they would have been entitled during their absence.\nTITLE III\nHORIZONTAL PROVISIONS\nCHAPTER 1\nRemedies and enforcement\nSection 1\nRemedies\nArticle 17\nDefence of rights\n1.   Member States shall ensure that, after possible recourse to other competent authorities including where they deem it appropriate conciliation procedures, judicial procedures for the enforcement of obligations under this Directive are available to all persons who consider themselves wronged by failure to apply the principle of equal treatment to them, even after the relationship in which the discrimination is alleged to have occurred has ended.\n2.   Member States shall ensure that associations, organisations or other legal entities which have, in accordance with the criteria laid down by their national law, a legitimate interest in ensuring that the provisions of this Directive are complied with, may engage, either on behalf or in support of the complainant, with his/her approval, in any judicial and/or administrative procedure provided for the enforcement of obligations under this Directive.\n3.   Paragraphs 1 and 2 are without prejudice to national rules relating to time limits for bringing actions as regards the principle of equal treatment.\nArticle 18\nCompensation or reparation\nMember States shall introduce into their national legal systems such measures as are necessary to ensure real and effective compensation or reparation as the Member States so determine for the loss and damage sustained by a person injured as a result of discrimination on grounds of sex, in a way which is dissuasive and proportionate to the damage suffered. Such compensation or reparation may not be restricted by the fixing of a prior upper limit, except in cases where the employer can prove that the only damage suffered by an applicant as a result of discrimination within the meaning of this Directive is the refusal to take his/her job application into consideration.\nSection 2\nBurden of proof\nArticle 19\nBurden of proof\n1.   Member States shall take such measures as are necessary, in accordance with their national judicial systems, to ensure that, when persons who consider themselves wronged because the principle of equal treatment has not been applied to them establish, before a court or other competent authority, facts from which it may be presumed that there has been direct or indirect discrimination, it shall be for the respondent to prove that there has been no breach of the principle of equal treatment.\n2.   Paragraph 1 shall not prevent Member States from introducing rules of evidence which are more favourable to plaintiffs.\n3.   Member States need not apply paragraph 1 to proceedings in which it is for the court or competent body to investigate the facts of the case.\n4.   Paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 shall also apply to:\n(a)\nthe situations covered by Article 141 of the Treaty and, insofar as discrimination based on sex is concerned, by Directives 92/85/EEC and 96/34/EC;\n(b)\nany civil or administrative procedure concerning the public or private sector which provides for means of redress under national law pursuant to the measures referred to in (a) with the exception of out-of-court procedures of a voluntary nature or provided for in national law.\n5.   This Article shall not apply to criminal procedures, unless otherwise provided by the Member States.\nCHAPTER 2\nPromotion of equal treatment — dialogue\nArticle 20\nEquality bodies\n1.   Member States shall designate and make the necessary arrangements for a body or bodies for the promotion, analysis, monitoring and support of equal treatment of all persons without discrimination on grounds of sex. These bodies may form part of agencies with responsibility at national level for the defence of human rights or the safeguard of individuals' rights.\n2.   Member States shall ensure that the competences of these bodies include:\n(a)\nwithout prejudice to the right of victims and of associations, organisations or other legal entities referred to in Article 17(2), providing independent assistance to victims of discrimination in pursuing their complaints about discrimination;\n(b)\nconducting independent surveys concerning discrimination;\n(c)\npublishing independent reports and making recommendations on any issue relating to such discrimination;\n(d)\nat the appropriate level exchanging available information with corresponding European bodies such as any future European Institute for Gender Equality.\nArticle 21\nSocial dialogue\n1.   Member States shall, in accordance with national traditions and practice, take adequate measures to promote social dialogue between the social partners with a view to fostering equal treatment, including, for example, through the monitoring of practices in the workplace, in access to employment, vocational training and promotion, as well as through the monitoring of collective agreements, codes of conduct, research or exchange of experience and good practice.\n2.   Where consistent with national traditions and practice, Member States shall encourage the social partners, without prejudice to their autonomy, to promote equality between men and women, and flexible working arrangements, with the aim of facilitating the reconciliation of work and private life, and to conclude, at the appropriate level, agreements laying down anti-discrimination rules in the fields referred to in Article 1 which fall within the scope of collective bargaining. These agreements shall respect the provisions of this Directive and the relevant national implementing measures.\n3.   Member States shall, in accordance with national law, collective agreements or practice, encourage employers to promote equal treatment for men and women in a planned and systematic way in the workplace, in access to employment, vocational training and promotion.\n4.   To this end, employers shall be encouraged to provide at appropriate regular intervals employees and/or their representatives with appropriate information on equal treatment for men and women in the undertaking.\nSuch information may include an overview of the proportions of men and women at different levels of the organisation; their pay and pay differentials; and possible measures to improve the situation in cooperation with employees' representatives.\nArticle 22\nDialogue with non‐governmental organisations\nMember States shall encourage dialogue with appropriate non-governmental organisations which have, in accordance with their national law and practice, a legitimate interest in contributing to the fight against discrimination on grounds of sex with a view to promoting the principle of equal treatment.\nCHAPTER 3\nGeneral horizontal provisions\nArticle 23\nCompliance\nMember States shall take all necessary measures to ensure that:\n(a)\nany laws, regulations and administrative provisions contrary to the principle of equal treatment are abolished;\n(b)\nprovisions contrary to the principle of equal treatment in individual or collective contracts or agreements, internal rules of undertakings or rules governing the independent occupations and professions and workers' and employers' organisations or any other arrangements shall be, or may be, declared null and void or are amended;\n(c)\noccupational social security schemes containing such provisions may not be approved or extended by administrative measures.\nArticle 24\nVictimisation\nMember States shall introduce into their national legal systems such measures as are necessary to protect employees, including those who are employees' representatives provided for by national laws and/or practices, against dismissal or other adverse treatment by the employer as a reaction to a complaint within the undertaking or to any legal proceedings aimed at enforcing compliance with the principle of equal treatment.\nArticle 25\nPenalties\nMember States shall lay down the rules on penalties applicable to infringements of the national provisions adopted pursuant to this Directive, and shall take all measures necessary to ensure that they are applied. The penalties, which may comprise the payment of compensation to the victim, must be effective, proportionate and dissuasive. The Member States shall notify those provisions to the Commission by 5 October 2005 at the latest and shall notify it without delay of any subsequent amendment affecting them.\nArticle 26\nPrevention of discrimination\nMember States shall encourage, in accordance with national law, collective agreements or practice, employers and those responsible for access to vocational training to take effective measures to prevent all forms of discrimination on grounds of sex, in particular harassment and sexual harassment in the workplace, in access to employment, vocational training and promotion.\nArticle 27\nMinimum requirements\n1.   Member States may introduce or maintain provisions which are more favourable to the protection of the principle of equal treatment than those laid down in this Directive.\n2.   Implementation of this Directive shall under no circumstances be sufficient grounds for a reduction in the level of protection of workers in the areas to which it applies, without prejudice to the Member States' right to respond to changes in the situation by introducing laws, regulations and administrative provisions which differ from those in force on the notification of this Directive, provided that the provisions of this Directive are complied with.\nArticle 28\nRelationship to Community and national provisions\n1.   This Directive shall be without prejudice to provisions concerning the protection of women, particularly as regards pregnancy and maternity.\n2.   This Directive shall be without prejudice to the provisions of Directive 96/34/EC and Directive 92/85/EEC.\nArticle 29\nGender mainstreaming\nMember States shall actively take into account the objective of equality between men and women when formulating and implementing laws, regulations, administrative provisions, policies and activities in the areas referred to in this Directive.\nArticle 30\nDissemination of information\nMember States shall ensure that measures taken pursuant to this Directive, together with the provisions already in force, are brought to the attention of all the persons concerned by all suitable means and, where appropriate, at the workplace.\nTITLE IV\nFINAL PROVISIONS\nArticle 31\nReports\n1.   By 15 February 2011, the Member States shall communicate to the Commission all the information necessary for the Commission to draw up a report to the European Parliament and the Council on the application of this Directive.\n2.   Without prejudice to paragraph 1, Member States shall communicate to the Commission, every four years, the texts of any measures adopted pursuant to Article 141(4) of the Treaty, as well as reports on these measures and their implementation. On the basis of that information, the Commission will adopt and publish every four years a report establishing a comparative assessment of any measures in the light of Declaration No 28 annexed to the Final Act of the Treaty of Amsterdam.\n3.   Member States shall assess the occupational activities referred to in Article 14(2), in order to decide, in the light of social developments, whether there is justification for maintaining the exclusions concerned. They shall notify the Commission of the results of this assessment periodically, but at least every 8 years.\nArticle 32\nReview\nBy 15 February 2011 at the latest, the Commission shall review the operation of this Directive and if appropriate, propose any amendments it deems necessary.\nArticle 33\nImplementation\nMember States shall bring into force the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive by 15 August 2008 at the latest or shall ensure, by that date, that management and labour introduce the requisite provisions by way of agreement.

Member States shall take all necessary steps to be able to guarantee the results imposed by this Directive. They shall forthwith communicate to the Commission the texts of those measures.\nWhen Member States adopt these measures, they shall contain a reference to this Directive or be accompanied by such reference on the occasion of their official publication. They shall also include a statement that references in existing laws, regulations and administrative provisions to the Directives repealed by this Directive shall be construed as references to this Directive. Member States shall determine how such reference is to be made and how that statement is to be formulated.\nThe obligation to transpose this Directive into national law shall be confined to those provisions which represent a substantive change as compared with the earlier Directives.

opportunities and equal treatment of men and women in matters of employment and occupation\nWHAT IS THE AIM OF THE DIRECTIVE?\n              \nThe aim of this directive is to consolidate several directives on gender equality by simplifying, modernising and improving European Union (EU) legislation in the area of equal treatment for men and women in employment.\nKEY POINTS\n              \nEquality between men and women is a fundamental principle of EU law that applies to several aspects of life in society, including to the world of work.\nEquality in employment and working conditions\nThis directive prohibits direct* or indirect discrimination* between men and women concerning the conditions of:\nrecruitment, access to employment and self-employment;\nworking conditions, including pay and dismissals;\nvocational training and promotion;\nmembership of workers’ or employers’ organisations.\nIn addition, Article 157 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union prohibits discrimination on the grounds of sex on matters of pay for the same work or work of equal value. This principle also applies to job classification systems used for determining pay.\nHowever, exceptionally, different treatment for men and women may be justified by reason of the nature of the particular occupational activity, if the measures taken are legitimate and proportionate.\nEU Member States must encourage employers to act against discrimination (both direct and indirect) on the grounds of sex, and particularly against harassment* and sexual harassment*.\nEquality in social protection\nWomen and men are treated equally under occupational social security schemes, particularly concerning:\nthe scope and conditions of access to the schemes;\nthe contributions;\nthe calculation of benefits, including supplementary benefits, and the conditions governing the duration and retention of entitlement.\nThis principle applies to the whole working population, including:\nself-employed workers, however, for this category Member States may provide for different treatment concerning the pensionable age;\nworkers whose activity is interrupted by illness, accident or involuntary unemployment;\npersons seeking employment, retired and disabled workers, and those claiming under them.\nMaternal, paternal and adoption leave\nAt the end of maternal, paternal or adoption leave, employees have the right to:\nreturn to their jobs or to equivalent posts on conditions that are no less favourable to them;\nbenefit from any improvement in working conditions, to which they would have been entitled during their absence.\nDefence of rights\nMember States must put remedies in place for employees who have been victims of discrimination, such as conciliation and judicial procedures. In addition, Member States must take the necessary measures to protect employees and their representatives against adverse treatment by the employer as a reaction to a complaint within the company or to any legal proceedings.\nThey must establish penalties and reparation or compensation possibilities in relation to the damage sustained.\nIn the case of legal proceedings, the burden of proof is shared between the person who lodges the discrimination complaint and the party accused of discrimination. If the complainant presents facts to the court that can create a presumption of discrimination (e.g. all women in the company have lower salaries than men), then the plaintiff must prove that there has been no breach of the principle of equal treatment (e.g. their jobs are different or they work part-time).\nPromoting equal treatment\nMember States appoint bodies whose role is to promote, analyse and monitor equal treatment to ensure that the legislation is being followed and to provide independent support to victims of discrimination.\nFROM WHEN DOES THE DIRECTIVE APPLY?\n              \nIt has applied since 15 August 2006. It had to become law in the Member States by 15 August 2008.\nBACKGROUND\n              \nFor further information, see:\nGender equality (European Commission)\nGender Statistics Database (European Institute for Gender Equality).\nKEY TERMS\n              \nDirect discrimination. Where one person is treated less favourably than another person is, has been or would be treated in a comparable situation on the grounds of sex.\nIndirect discrimination. Where an apparently neutral provision, criterion or practice would put persons of one sex at a particular disadvantage compared to persons of another sex (unless that provision, criterion or practice is objectively justified by a legitimate aim, and the means of achieving that aim are appropriate and necessary).\nHarassment. Where unwanted conduct related to the sex of a person occurs with the purpose or effect of violating the dignity of a person, and of creating an intimidating, hostile, degrading, humiliating or offensive environment.\nSexual harassment. Where any form of unwanted verbal, non-verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature occurs, with the purpose or effect of violating the dignity of a person, in particular when creating an intimidating, hostile, degrading, humiliating or offensive environment.\nMAIN DOCUMENT\n            \nDirective 2006/54/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 5 July 2006 on the implementation of the principle of equal opportunities and equal treatment of men and women in matters of employment and occupation (recast) (OJ L 204, 26.7.2006, pp. 23–36).\nlast update 03.02.2022", "tags": ["employment policy", "anti-discriminatory measure", "gender equality", "social security", "equal treatment", "working conditions"], "subjects": ["Approximation of laws", "Protocol on Ireland/Northern Ireland", "Social provisions", "Free movement of workers"], "split": "train", "reference_annotations": {}, "summary_annotations": {}}
