{"celex_id": "32014D0913", "reference": "17.12.2014\nEN\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\nL 360/44\nCOUNCIL DECISION 2014/913/CFSP\nof 15 December 2014\nin support of the Hague Code of Conduct and ballistic missile non-proliferation in the framework of the implementation of the EU Strategy against Proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on European Union, and in particular Article 26(2) thereof,\nWhereas:\n(1)\nOn 12 December 2003, the European Council adopted the EU Strategy against the Proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction (‘the Strategy’), Chapter III of which contains a list of measures that need to be taken both within the Union and in third countries to combat such proliferation.\n(2)\nThe EU is actively implementing the Strategy and giving effect to the measures listed in Chapters II and III thereof, for example by releasing financial resources to support specific projects leading to the enhancement of a multilateral non-proliferation system and multilateral confidence building measures. The Hague Code of Conduct against ballistic missile proliferation (‘the Code’ or ‘HCoC’) and the Missile Technology Control Regime (‘MTCR’) are integral parts of that multilateral non-proliferation system. The Code and the MTCR aim to prevent and curb the proliferation of ballistic missile systems capable of delivering weapons of mass destruction (‘WMD’) and related technologies.\n(3)\nOn 17 November 2003, the Council adopted Common Position 2003/805/CFSP (1). That Common Position calls, inter alia, for the promotion of the subscription of as many countries as possible to the Code, especially those with ballistic missile capabilities, as well as for the further development and implementation of the Code, especially its confidence-building measures, and for the promotion of a closer relationship between the Code and the UN multilateral non-proliferation system.\n(4)\nOn 8 December 2008, the Council adopted its conclusions and a document entitled ‘New lines for action by the European Union in combating the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their delivery systems’. The document states, inter alia, that proliferation of WMD and their delivery systems continue to constitute one of the greatest security challenges and that non-proliferation policy constitute an essential part of Common Foreign and Security Policy. In the light of progress made and of ongoing efforts in the implementation of the ‘new lines for action’, the Council agreed in December 2010 to prolong their implementation period until the end of 2012.\n(5)\nOn 18 December 2008, the Council adopted Decision 2008/974/CFSP (2) in support of the Code in the framework of the implementation of the Strategy.\n(6)\nOn 23 July 2012, the Council adopted Decision 2012/423/CFSP (3). That Decision has allowed the successful promotion of the universality of the Code and compliance with its principles. It is a priority of the Union to continue dialogue among subscribing and non-subscribing States with the aim of further promoting the universality of the Code as well as its better implementation and enhancement. This Decision should contribute to this process.\n(7)\nMore generally, the continued proliferation of ballistic missiles capable of delivering WMD constitutes a cause of growing concern for the international community, in particular ongoing missiles programmes in the Middle-East, North-East Asia and South-East Asia, including Iran, Syria and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (‘DPRK’).\n(8)\nThe UN Security Council emphasised in UNSCR 1540 (2004) and recalled in UNSCR 1977 (2011) that the proliferation of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons, as well as their means of delivery, constituted a threat to international peace and security and obliged States, inter alia, to refrain from supporting by any means non-State actors from developing, acquiring, manufacturing, possessing, transporting, transferring or using nuclear, chemical or biological weapons and their delivery systems. The threat caused by nuclear, chemical and biological weapons and their means of delivery to international peace and security was reaffirmed in UNSCR 1887 (2009) on nuclear non-proliferation and nuclear disarmament. Furthermore, the UN Security Council decided in UNSCRs 1929 (2010) and 1718 (2006), based inter alia on UNSC resolutions 1540 (2004), 1977 (2011) and 1887 (2009), that Iran and the DPRK should not undertake any activity related to ballistic missiles capable of delivering nuclear weapons, including launches using ballistic missile technology, and that States should take all necessary measures to prevent the transfer of technology or technical assistance to Iran and DPRK related to such activities.\n(9)\nThis Decision should serve, more generally, to support a range of activities aimed to fight against the proliferation of ballistic missiles,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\nArticle 1\n1.   For the purposes of ensuring the continuous and practical implementation of certain elements of the Strategy, as referred to in the Annex, the Union shall:\n(a)\nsupport activities in support of the Code and the MTCR, in particular with the aim to:\n(i)\npromote the universality, and in particular the subscription to the Code by all States with ballistic missile capabilities;\n(ii)\nsupport the implementation and reinforcing the visibility of the Code;\n(iii)\npromote adherence to the MTCR guidelines and the Annex thereto;\n(b)\nmore generally, support a range of activities to fight against the proliferation of ballistic missiles, aimed in particular at raising awareness of this threat, stepping up efforts to increase the effectiveness of multilateral instruments, building up support to initiatives to address these specific challenges and helping interested countries to reinforce nationally their relevant export control regimes.\n2.

OBJECTIVES\nThe Union is a strong promoter of missile non-proliferation. Its efforts in this regard include the Strategy and Common Position 2003/805/CFSP. In addition, the Council has endorsed ‘New lines for action by the European Union in combating the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their delivery systems’, and the EU supported UNSC Resolution 1540 (2004), which has since been recalled in UNSC resolution 1977 (2010).\nThe Union considers the MTCR an important multilateral instrument which aims at curbing the proliferation of ballistic missile systems and related technologies and know-how through the establishment and the implementation of export control regulations on sensitive materials. 19 Member States are members of the MTCR and all Member States are implementing the MTCR export control list through Council Regulation (EC) No 428/2009 (1).\nThe Union has also strongly supported the Code from its inception and has expressed regular concern over ballistic missile proliferation. The Union considers the Code as a central transparency and confidence building measure. All Member States have subscribed to the Code and are implementing the Code in good faith.\nIn the past, the Union tried to overcome the remaining loopholes in the implementation of the Code and in its universality by organising workshops, expert meetings and regional awareness seminars. Those activities, which have been organised under Decision 2008/974/CFSP and implemented by the FRS, have proved their efficiency and relevance.\nEncouraged by the outcome of those events, the Union has pursued its initiative and supported three aspects of the Code as follows:\n(a)\nuniversality of the Code;\n(b)\nimplementation of the Code;\n(c)\nenhancement and improved functioning of the Code.\nThis action was undertaken under Decision 2012/423/CFSP, which allowed the development of several initiatives in support of HCoC including:\n(a)\nthe development of a dedicated secure website;\n(b)\nthe organisation of several side-events aimed at promoting the Code vis-à-vis non-subscribing States in Vienna, Geneva and New York;\n(c)\nawareness raising workshop for African and Middle Eastern Countries in Paris;\n(d)\nregional seminars in Singapore, Abu Dhabi and Lima;\n(e)\npreparation of food-for-thought papers.\nDecision 2012/423/CFSP has contributed to raising awareness about the Code and to its promotion vis-à-vis third countries. Through that Decision, the Union has supported Costa Rica, France, Hungary, Japan, Peru and Romania in their activities as HCoC Chairs. By raising the profile of the HCoC, it has facilitated the adherence of new members to the Code.\nIn view of the results achieved, and of the continued proliferation of ballistic missiles capable of delivering WMD which constitute a cause of growing concern for the international community, in particular ongoing missile programmes in the Middle-East, North-East Asia and South-East Asia, including Iran and the DPRK, the following actions will be carried out:\n(a)\nproject 1, information and communication;\n(b)\nproject 2, strengthening the ballistic missile non-proliferation;\n(c)\nproject 3, universalisation of the HCoC — Outreach activities;\nGoing beyond the sole promotion of adherence to the Code and the MTCR, this Decision allows for the deepening of the international debate over missile proliferation and engaging new regional areas and new communities.\n2.   DESCRIPTION OF THE PROJECT\n2.1.   Project 1: Information and Communication\n2.1.1.   Objective of the project\nThe Code represents an important instrument for curbing the proliferation of ballistic missiles and related technologies through confidence-building and transparency measures. However, more needs to be done to support it, in particular with the aim of:\n(a)\npromoting the universality of the Code, and in particular the subscription to the Code by all States with ballistic missile and space capabilities;\n(b)\nsupporting the implementation of the Code in all its aspects;\n(c)\nreinforcing the visibility of the Code.\n2.1.2.   Description of the project\nThe project provides for three types of activities:\n(a)\npreparing, designing, printing and distributing up to 1 500 leaflets describing Union support for the Code. The leaflet will also include:\n(i)\na description of the HCoC;\n(ii)\nthe objectives of the HCoC;\n(iii)\na description of the annual declarations, the pre-launch notifications and the voluntary observation visits;\n(iv)\nthe European strategy towards the HCoC and the proliferation of WMD means of delivery;\n(v)\ndemarches to be fulfilled in order to subscribe to the Code;\n(vi)\ncontact details for non-subscribing States;\n(b)\npreparing, designing, printing and distributing up to 1 000‘welcome package’ printed booklets and a USB stick for outreach activities towards non-subscribing States, also recalling obligations for subscribing States. It will also be available online, covering all the necessary information about the Code and the relevant points of contact. The ‘welcome package’ will include the leaflet described in point (a);\n(c)\nsupporting and updating the HCoC secure Internet-based information and communication mechanism (‘electronic Immediate Central Contact’ — e-ICC), including through technical enhancement of the website in close cooperation with the Austrian Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n2.1.3.   Expected results of the project/indicators\n(a)\nthrough wide distribution of the ‘welcome package’ during the various events, greater awareness achieved amongst partners of the value added of the HCoC, and of the role of the Union;\n(b)\nmore secure HCoC website enables improved exchange of relevant information amongst partners;\n(c)\nuse of the ‘welcome package’ by the HCoC Chair, the Austrian Secretariat (‘Immediate Central Contact’ (‘ICC’)), the Union and other partners as necessary in their outreach activities.\n2.1.4.   Beneficiaries of the project\nThe beneficiaries of the project are both States subscribing to the HCoC and non-subscribing States.\n2.2.   Project 2: strengthening the ballistic missile non-proliferation\n2.2.1.   Purpose of the project\nThe continued proliferation and operational use of ballistic missiles capable of delivering WMD constitutes a cause of growing concern for the international community, in particular ongoing missiles programmes in the Middle-East, North-East Asia and South-East Asia, including Iran and the DPRK.\nMore generally, the project will support a range of activities to fight against the proliferation of ballistic missiles, aimed in particular at raising awareness of the threat, stepping up efforts to increase the effectiveness of multilateral instruments, building support to initiatives to address those specific challenges and helping interested countries to reinforce nationally their relevant export control regimes.\n2.2.2.   Description of the project\nThe publication of two food-for-thought papers per year (4 for the duration of the project). Possible subjects could include:\n(a)\nthe use of the existing WMD free zones as an example and a potential framework for further initiatives banning ballistic missiles;\n(b)\nfurther multilateral steps to prevent the threat of missile proliferation and to promote disarmament efforts in the field of ballistic missiles, focusing in particular on possible confidence-building measures;\n(c)\nexport and transit control mechanisms;\n(d)\nthe role of Intangible Transfer of Technology (ITT) in the area of ballistic missiles.\n2.2.3.   Expected results of the project/indicators\n(a)\nPromoting multilateral efforts curbing missile proliferation including the HCoC and the MTCR increases the EU influence in the field of missile non-proliferation;\n(b)\nencouraging the debate on new initiatives to strengthen the Code and the MTCR and open the door for further initiatives;\n(c)\nfostering missile non-proliferation;\n(d)\nat least 4 food-for-thought papers to be published;\n(e)\nraising awareness about dual-use technology and knowledge transfer issues prevents unintentional transfer among Member States and increase global awareness of export control mechanism.\n2.2.4.   Project beneficiaries\nThe Union and the Member States will benefit from the food-for-thought papers; wider distribution will be decided by the HR in close consultation with Member States in the framework of the competent Council Working Party. The final decision will be based on proposals by the implementing entity in accordance with Article 2(2) of this Decision.\n2.3.   Project 3: Universalisation of the HCoC — Outreach activities\n2.3.1.   Purpose of the project\nThe project will raise awareness of both missile non-proliferation and the HCoC by organising several events aimed at engaging non-subscribing States. To this end, events will be organised in Vienna and New York to engage the UN delegations in the margins of relevant events.\n2.3.2.   Project description\nThe project will provide for three types of events:\n(a)\nFinancing of four outreach events (2 in each city) in support of both the HCoC and ballistic missile non-proliferation that will take place in two cities:\n(i)\nin New York, in the margins of the UN General Assembly First Committee meetings or of the non-Proliferation Treaty Preparatory Committees meetings;\n(ii)\nin Vienna, in the margins of the HCoC or other relevant activities of the UN in Vienna.\nRegarding the organisation of the seminars:\n(i)\neach seminar will last half a day and will gather up to 80 participants from UN missions in New York and Vienna around a selected group of speakers and EU officials;\n(ii)\nup to 6 speakers will be invited;\n(iii)\nthe HCoC acting Chair will be invited;\n(iv)\nrestricted lunches or dinners aimed at engaging senior officials from selected countries led by an EU senior representative and experts will be organised and funded under this Decision.\nTo this end, the implementing entity will propose for each event a list of countries, some of which will be non-subscribing States. This will allow the convening of senior representatives who deal with non-proliferation issues.\n(b)\nFinancing of three regional outreach seminars that could take place in Latin America (e.g. Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Mexico or a non-member in the Caribbean region), the Middle East (e.g. the Gulf countries, Bahrain, Qatar or Saudi Arabia) and Asia (e.g. Indonesia or Vietnam). The choice of the location will be made in agreement with the HR, in close consultation with Member States in the framework of the competent Council Working Party. The seminar will be dedicated to trends in missile proliferation and a focus on regional issues and will address the HCoC and practical information about being a subscribing State. Subscribing States of the region will be invited at governmental level in order to share their experience with non-subscribing States. The HCoC acting Chair will also be invited to deliver a statement and chair the session. The attendance could include officials, diplomats, military staff, international organisation representatives, EU representatives, academics, etc.\nRegarding the organisation of the seminars:\n(i)\neach seminar will last one day;\n(ii)\nup to 50 persons could be invited to attend;\n(iii)\nthe HCoC acting Chair will be invited to deliver a statement.\n(c)\nUp to 10 targeted expert missions for non-subscribing States. They will mainly target the relevant industries, scientific community, export control experts and civil society representatives. In coordination with the European Union Centres of Excellence, two experts on ballistic missile non-proliferation from the implementing agency and an EU expert will conduct field missions in targeted countries. Possible destinations could include, but are not limited to Algeria, Bahrain, Bolivia, Brazil, China, Egypt, India, Indonesia, Israel, Malaysia, Mexico, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, South Africa and Thailand. The final list of countries will be decided in close cooperation with the HR, as well as the opportunity of joint demarches with the UN 1540 Committee outreach efforts. The attendance could include officials, diplomats, military staff, academics, industry, researchers, etc. from the visited country. Priority will be given to officials and political deciders, diplomats, relevant military staff, etc.\nRegarding the organisation of the seminars:\n(i)\neach seminar will last one day;\n(ii)\nup to 25 persons could be invited;\n(iii)\n3 experts will be invited;\n(iv)\nthe HCoC acting Chair will be invited.\n2.3.3.   Expected results of the project/ indicators\n(a)\nAt least 4 outreach events to be organised in New York and Vienna;\n(b)\nthe 3 regional events have gathered an important diplomatic and academic community and allowed new perspectives on adhesions;\n(c)\n10 expert's missions were conducted in order to enhance the universalisation of the HCoC. Those missions have gathered at least 20 decision-makers and officials and increased the level of commitment from the officials and decision-makers in the visited countries;\n(d)\nraising awareness of missile proliferation trends and more particularly on the Code with regard to non-subscribing States promote discussions on further efforts to curb missile proliferation;\n(e)\nthe project fosters the debate within and outside the Union on future initiatives;\n(f)\nthe project raises the profile of missile proliferation as a strategic challenge.\n2.3.4.   Beneficiaries of the project\nThe main focus of these events will be non-subscribing States, although subscribing States might be associated with some events for policy reasons. Participants should be primarily governmental experts and senior officials.\nThe final choice of the beneficiary States will be made in consultation between the implementing entity and the HR in close consultation with Member States in the framework of the competent Council Working Party.\n3.   DURATION\nThe total estimated duration of the implementation of the projects is 30 months.\n4.   IMPLEMENTING ENTITY\n(a)\nThe FRS will be entrusted with the technical implementation of the projects;\n(b)\nco-funding will depend on the FRS;\n(c)\nthe implementing entity will prepare:\n(i)\nquarterly reports on the implementation of the projects;\n(ii)\na final report not later than one month after the end of the implementation of the projects;\n(d)\nreports will be sent to the HR;\n(e)\nthe FRS will ensure the visibility of the Union contribution, appropriate to its size.\n5.   THIRD-PARTY PARTICIPANTS\nThe projects will be financed in their entirety under this Decision. Experts from States subscribing to the Code or from non-subscribing States may be considered as third-party participants. They will work in accordance with the standard rules of the FRS.\n(1)  Council Regulation (EC) No 428/2009 of 5 May 2009 setting up a Community regime for the control of exports, transfer, brokering and transit of dual-use items (OJ L 134, 29.5.2009, p. 1).", "summary": "Ballistic missile non-proliferation measures\nBallistic missile non-proliferation measures\nThe act supports international action against the proliferation of ballistic missiles.\nACT\n                  \nCouncil Decision 2014/913/CFSP of 15 December 2014 in support of the Hague Code of Conduct and ballistic missile non-proliferation in the framework of the implementation of the EU strategy against proliferation of weapons of mass destruction\nSUMMARY\nWHAT DOES THIS DECISION DO?\n                     \nIt provides EU support:\nspecifically, for the Hague Code of Conduct (HCoC) and the missile technology control regime (MTCR);\ngenerally to promote non-proliferation worldwide.\nThe decision implements measures in the EU’s strategy against the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, which aims to tackle the weapons of mass destruction (WMD) proliferation by working with international organisations and key countries.\nKEY POINTS\n                     \nThe decision provides €990 000 of funding for projects by the Fondation pour la recherche stratégique to:\nraise awareness of the threat of proliferation;\nincrease international organisations’ ability to deal with the threat;\nencourage all countries with ballistic missile capabilities to subscribe to the Hague Code;\nsupport implementation of the code and promote adherence to MTCR guidelines.\nSpecifically the projects will produce or organise the following.\nOutreach events:\n4 seminars in the margins of Hague Code meetings and relevant UN events;\nseminars in 3 key regions, especially the Middle East, North-East Asia and South-East Asia;\nexpert missions to 10 key countries, targeting industry, scientists, export control experts and military.\nPromotional material for the Hague Code (1 000 booklets, 1 500 leaflets and website).\n4 expert papers (examining confidence-building measures, controls on exports, knowledge transfer, etc.).\nBACKGROUND\nMTCR - voluntary association of countries aiming to restrict the proliferation of systems capable of carrying WMDs.\nHague Code - rules of conduct for ballistic missiles, e.g. requirements for subscriber countries to declare their ballistic missile policies and issue notifications before testing.\nREFERENCES\nAct\nEntry into force\nDeadline for transposition in the Member States\nOfficial Journal\nDecision 2014/913/CFSP\n15.12.2014\n-\nOJ L 360, 17.12.2014, pp. 44-52\nlast update 20.08.2015", "tags": ["weapon of mass destruction", "ballistic missile", "code of conduct", "arms control", "non-proliferation of arms"], "subjects": ["Common foreign and security policy"], "split": "train", "reference_annotations": {}, "summary_annotations": {}}
