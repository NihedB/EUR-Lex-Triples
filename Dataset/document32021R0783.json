{"celex_id": "32021R0783", "reference": "17.5.2021\nEN\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\nL 172/53\nREGULATION (EU) 2021/783 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL\nof 29 April 2021\nestablishing a Programme for the Environment and Climate Action (LIFE), and repealing Regulation (EU) No 1293/2013\n(Text with EEA relevance)\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 192(1) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee (1),\nHaving regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions (2),\nActing in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure (3),\nWhereas:\n(1)\nEnvironmental, climate and relevant energy legislation and policy of the Union have delivered substantial improvements to the state of the environment. However, major environmental and climate challenges remain, which, if left unaddressed, will have significant negative consequences for the Union and the well-being of its citizens.\n(2)\nThe Programme for the Environment and Climate Action (LIFE), established by Regulation (EU) No 1293/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council (4), for the period 2014 to 2020, is the latest in a series of Union programmes since 1992 which support the implementation of environmental and climate legislation and policy priorities. LIFE was assessed positively in a recent mid-term evaluation as being on track to be effective, efficient and relevant. The 2014-2020 LIFE Programme should, therefore, be continued with certain modifications identified in the mid-term evaluation and subsequent assessments. Accordingly, the Programme for the Environment and Climate Action (LIFE) (the 'LIFE Programme') should be established for a period of seven years to align its duration with that of the multiannual financial framework laid down in Council Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2020/2093 (5).\n(3)\nIn pursuing the achievement of the objectives and targets set by environmental, climate and relevant energy legislation, policy and plans, in particular the objectives set out in the communication of the Commission of 11 December 2019 on the European Green Deal (the 'European Green Deal'), and international commitments of the Union, the LIFE Programme should contribute to a just transition towards a sustainable, circular, energy-efficient, renewable energy-based, climate-neutral and -resilient economy, to the protection, restoration and improvement of the quality of the environment, including the air, water and soil, and of health, and to halting and reversing biodiversity loss, including by supporting the implementation and management of the Natura 2000 network and tackling the degradation of ecosystems, either through direct interventions or by supporting the integration of those objectives in other policies. The LIFE Programme should also support the implementation of the general action programmes adopted in accordance with Article 192(3) Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), such as the 7th Environment Action Programme (6) and any subsequent Union environment action programme.\n(4)\nThe Union is committed to developing a comprehensive response to the Sustainable Development Goals of the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which highlight the intrinsic connection between the management of natural resources to ensure their long-term availability and ecosystem services, and the link of both to human health and sustainable and socially inclusive economic growth. In this spirit, the LIFE Programme should reflect the principles of solidarity, while making a material contribution to both economic development and social cohesion.\n(5)\nWith a view to promoting sustainable development, environmental and climate protection requirements should be integrated into the definition and implementation of all Union policies and activities. Synergies and complementarity with other Union funding programmes should, therefore, be promoted, including by facilitating the funding of activities that complement strategic integrated projects and strategic nature projects and support the uptake and replication of solutions developed under the LIFE Programme. Coordination is required to prevent double funding. The Commission and Member States should take steps to prevent administrative overlap and an administrative burden on project beneficiaries, arising from reporting obligations from different financial instruments.\n(6)\nThe LIFE Programme should contribute to sustainable development and to the achievement of the objectives and targets of the environmental, climate and relevant energy legislation, strategies, plans and international commitments of the Union, in particular as regards the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the Convention on Biological Diversity (7) and the Paris Agreement adopted under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (8) (the 'Paris Agreement on Climate Change'), and, inter alia, the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) Convention on Access to Information, public participation in decision-making and access to justice in environmental matters (9) (the 'Aarhus Convention'), the UNECE Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution, the UN Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and their Disposal, the UN Rotterdam Convention on the Prior Informed Consent Procedure for Certain Hazardous Chemicals and Pesticides in International Trade, and the UN Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants.\n(7)\nThe Union attaches great importance to the long-term sustainability of the results of projects funded by the LIFE Programme, and to the capacity to secure and maintain those results after project implementation, inter alia by project continuation or by replication or transfer of results.\n(8)\nComplying with the Union's commitments under the Paris Agreement on Climate Change requires the transformation of the Union into a sustainable, circular, energy-efficient, renewable energy-based, climate-neutral and -resilient society. Such transformation in turn requires action, with a special focus on sectors that contribute most to the current levels of greenhouse gas emissions and pollution, promoting energy efficiency and renewable energy, as well as contributing to the implementation of the 2030 energy and climate policy framework and the Member States' Integrated National Energy and Climate Plans and to the implementation of the Union's long-term climate and energy strategy, in line with the long-term objectives of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change. The LIFE Programme should also include measures that contribute to the implementation of the Union's climate adaptation policy for decreasing vulnerability to the adverse effects of climate change.\n(9)\nProjects under the new 'Clean Energy Transition' subprogramme of the LIFE Programme should focus on the creation of capacity building and diffusion of knowledge, skills, innovative techniques, methods and solutions for reaching the objectives of Union legislation and policy on the transition to renewable energy and to increased energy efficiency. Such capacity building and diffusion are typically coordination and support actions of high added-value at Union level that are aimed at breaking market barriers that hamper the socio-economic transition to sustainable energy, and mainly involve small and medium-sized entities as well as multiple actors, including local and regional public authorities and non-profit organisations. Such actions bring multiple co-benefits, such as tackling energy poverty, improved indoor air quality, reducing local pollutants thanks to energy efficiency improvements and increased distributed renewable energies, and contributing to positive local economic effects and more socially inclusive growth.\n(10)\nIn order to contribute to the mitigation of climate change and to the Union's international commitments as regards decarbonisation, the transformation of the energy sector needs to be accelerated. Actions for capacity-building that support energy efficiency and renewable energy, funded until 2020 under Horizon 2020 (10), should be integrated into the new 'Clean Energy Transition' subprogramme of the LIFE Programme, since their objective is not to fund excellence and generate innovation, but to facilitate the uptake of already available technology for renewable energy and energy efficiency, which will contribute to climate mitigation. The LIFE Programme should involve all stakeholders and sectors involved in clean energy transition. The inclusion of such capacity-building actions in the LIFE Programme offers potential for synergies between the subprogrammes and increases the overall coherence of Union funding. Data should, therefore, be collected and disseminated on the uptake of existing research and innovation solutions in the projects of the LIFE Programme, including from the Horizon Europe programme established under Regulation (EU) 2021/695 of the European Parliament and of the Council (11) ('Horizon Europe') and its predecessors.\n(11)\nThe impact assessment accompanying the Commission proposal for Directive (EU) 2018/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council (12), which amended Directive 2012/27/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council (13), estimates that meeting the Union's 2030 energy targets will require additional investment of EUR 177 billion annually in the period 2021to 2030. The biggest gaps relate to investment in the decarbonisation of buildings to increase energy efficiency and the use of small-scale renewable energy sources, where capital needs to be channelled towards projects of a highly distributed nature. One of the objectives of the 'Clean Energy Transition' subprogramme, which covers energy efficiency and rapid deployment of renewable energy, is to build capacity for the development and aggregation of such projects, thereby also helping to absorb funds from the European Structural and Investment Funds and act as a catalyst for investments in renewable energy and energy efficiency, also using the financial instruments provided under Regulation (EU) 2021/523 of the European Parliament and of the Council (14).\n(12)\nThe LIFE programme is the only programme dedicated specifically to the environment and climate action, and therefore plays a crucial role in supporting the implementation of Union legislation and policies in those areas.\n(13)\nSynergies with Horizon Europe should facilitate identifying and establishing research and innovation needs as regards tackling environmental, climate and energy challenges within the Union during Horizon Europe's strategic research and innovation planning process. The LIFE Programme should continue to act as a catalyst for implementing environmental, climate and relevant energy legislation and policy of the Union, including by taking up and applying research and innovation results from Horizon Europe and helping to deploy them on a larger scale if this can help address environmental, climate or energy transition issues. Horizon Europe's European Innovation Council can provide support to scale up and commercialise new breakthrough ideas that could result from the implementation of LIFE projects. Similarly, synergies with the Innovation Fund under the Emission Trading System, established under Directive 2003/87/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (15), should also be taken into account.\n(14)\nAn action that has received a contribution from the LIFE Programme should also be able to receive a contribution from other Union programmes, provided that such contributions do not cover the same costs. Actions that receive cumulative financing from different Union programmes should be audited only once and in a manner that covers all Union programmes involved and their respective applicable rules.\n(15)\nThe communication of the Commission of 3 February 2017 on the EU Environmental Implementation Review: Common challenges and how to combine efforts to deliver better results (EIR) indicates that significant progress is required to accelerate the implementation of the Union environment acquis and to enhance the integration and mainstreaming of environmental and climate objectives into other policies. The LIFE Programme should, therefore, act as a catalyst for the tackling of horizontal, systemic challenges, as well as the root causes of implementation deficiencies identified in the EIR, and for achieving the requisite progress by developing, testing and replicating new approaches; supporting policy development, monitoring and review; improving governance on environmental, climate change and related energy transition matters, including by enhancing stakeholder involvement at all levels, capacity-building, communication and awareness; mobilising investments from Union investment programmes or other financial sources, and by supporting actions to overcome the various obstacles to the effective implementation of key plans required by environmental legislation.\n(16)\nHalting and reversing biodiversity loss and the degradation of ecosystems, including in marine ecosystems, requires support for the development, implementation, enforcement and assessment of relevant Union legislation and policy, including communication of the Commission of 20 May 2020 on the EU Biodiversity Strategy for 2030 – Bringing nature back into our lives, Council Directive 92/43/EEC (16), Directive 2009/147/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (17) and Regulation (EU) No 1143/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council (18), in particular by developing the knowledge base for policy development and implementation and by developing, testing, demonstrating and applying best practice and solutions, such as effective management, on a small scale or tailored to specific local, regional or national contexts, including integrated approaches for the implementation of the prioritized action frameworks adopted pursuant to Directive 92/43/EEC. This Regulation should contribute to mainstreaming biodiversity action in the Union's policies and to the achievement of the overall ambition of providing 7,5 % of annual spending under the multiannual financial framework to biodiversity objectives in 2024 and 10 % of annual spending under the multiannual financial framework to biodiversity objectives in 2026 and in 2027, while considering the existing overlaps between climate and biodiversity goals.\nThe Union and Member States should track their biodiversity-related expenditure to fulfil their reporting obligations under the Convention on Biological Diversity. Requirements for tracking provided for in other relevant Union legislation should also be met. Biodiversity-related Union expenditure should be tracked in accordance with an effective, transparent and comprehensive methodology to be set out by the Commission, in cooperation with the European Parliament and the Council, as referred to in the Interinstitutional Agreement of 16 December 2020 between the European Parliament, the Council of the European Union and the European Commission on budgetary discipline, on cooperation in budgetary matters and on sound financial management, as well as on new own resources, including a roadmap towards the introduction of new own resources (19)\n(17)\nRecent evaluations and assessments, including the mid-term review of the EU Biodiversity Strategy to 2020 and the Fitness Check of Nature legislation, indicate that one of the main underlying causes for insufficient implementation of Union legislation on nature and of the biodiversity strategy is the lack of adequate financing.\nThe main Union funding instruments, including the European Regional Development Fund established under Regulation (EU) No 1301/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council (20) (the 'European Regional Development Fund') and the Cohesion Fund established under Regulation (EU) No 1300/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council (21) (the 'Cohesion Fund'), the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development established under Regulation (EU) No 1305/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council (22) (the 'European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development') and the European Maritime, Fisheries and Aquaculture Fund established under a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the European Maritime, Fisheries and Aquaculture Fund and repealing Regulation (EU) No 508/2014 (the 'European Maritime, Fisheries and Aquaculture Fund'), could make a significant contribution towards meeting those needs, on a complementary basis. The LIFE Programme could further improve the efficiency of such mainstreaming through strategic nature projects dedicated to acting as a catalyst for the implementation of Union nature and biodiversity legislation and policy, including the actions set out in the prioritized action frameworks adopted pursuant to Directive 92/43/EEC. The strategic nature projects should support programmes of actions in Member States aimed at the mainstreaming of relevant nature and biodiversity objectives into other policies and funding programmes, thus ensuring that appropriate funds are mobilised for implementing those policies.\nMember States should be allowed to decide, within their Strategic Plan for the Common Agricultural Policy, to use a certain share of the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development allocation in order to leverage support for actions that complement strategic nature projects as defined under this Regulation.\n(18)\nPromoting the circular economy and resource efficiency requires a shift in the manner materials and products, including plastics, are designed, produced, consumed, repaired, reused, recycled and disposed of and a focus on the whole lifecycle of products. The LIFE Programme should contribute to the transition to a circular economy model through financial support that targets a variety of actors such as businesses, public authorities and consumers, in particular by applying, developing, and replicating best technology, practice and solutions tailored to specific local, regional or national contexts, including through integrated approaches for the application of the waste hierarchy and the implementation of waste management and prevention plans. By supporting the implementation of the communication of the Commission of 16 January 2018 on a European Strategy for Plastics in a Circular Economy, action could be taken to address the problem of marine litter in particular.\n(19)\nA high level of environmental protection is of fundamental importance for the health and well-being of Union citizens. The LIFE Programme should support the Union's objectives as regards producing and using chemicals in ways that lead to the minimisation of significant adverse effects on human health and the environment, with a view to reaching the objective of a non-toxic environment in the Union. The LIFE Programme should also support activities to facilitate the implementation of Directive 2002/49/EC of the Parliament and of the Council (23) in order to achieve noise levels that do not give rise to significant negative impacts on and risks to human health.\n(20)\nThe Union's long-term objective as regards air policy is to achieve levels of air quality that do not cause significant negative impacts on and risks to human health and the environment, while reinforcing the synergies between air quality improvements and greenhouse gas emissions reduction. Public awareness about air pollution is high and citizens expect authorities to act, in particular in areas where the population and ecosystems are exposed to high levels of air pollutants. Directive (EU) 2016/2284 of the European Parliament and of the Council (24) stresses the role Union funding can play in achieving clean air objectives. The LIFE Programme should, therefore, support projects, including strategic integrated projects, which have the potential to leverage public and private funds, to showcase best practice, and to act as a catalyst for the implementation of air quality plans and legislation at local, regional, multi-regional, national and trans-national level.\n(21)\nDirective 2000/60/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (25) established a framework for the protection of the Union's surface waters, coastal waters, transitional waters and groundwater. The objectives of that Directive would be supported by better implementation and integration of water policy objectives into other policy areas. The LIFE Programme should, therefore, support projects that contribute to the effective implementation of Directive 2000/60/EC and of other relevant Union water legislation that contributes to the achievement of good status of the Union's water bodies by applying, developing and replicating best practice, as well as by mobilising complementary actions under other Union programmes or financial sources.\n(22)\nThe protection and restoration of the marine environment is one of the overall aims of the Union's environment policy. The LIFE Programme should support the following: the management, conservation, restoration and monitoring of biodiversity and marine ecosystems, in particular in Natura 2000 marine sites, and the protection of species in accordance with the prioritized action frameworks adopted pursuant to Directive 92/43/EEC; the achievement of Good Environmental Status in line with Directive 2008/56/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (26); the promotion of clean and healthy seas; the implementation of the communication of the Commission of 16 January 2018 on a European Strategy for Plastics in a Circular Economy, addressing in particular the problem of lost fishing gear and marine litter; and the promotion of the Union's involvement in international ocean governance, which is essential for achieving the goals of the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and to guarantee healthy oceans for future generations. The LIFE Programme's strategic integrated projects and strategic nature projects should include relevant actions aimed at the protection of the marine environment.\n(23)\nThe improvement of governance on environmental, climate change and related energy transition matters requires the involvement of civil society by raising public awareness, including through a communication strategy that takes into account new media and social networks, consumer engagement, and the broadening of stakeholder involvement, including non-governmental organisations (NGOs), in consultations on and implementation of related policies at all levels. It is, therefore, appropriate that the LIFE Programme support a broad range of NGOs as well as networks of non-profit-making entities that pursue an aim which is of general Union interest, and that are primarily active in the area of the environment or climate action, by awarding, in a competitive and transparent manner, operating grants, in order to help such NGOs, networks and entities, to make effective contributions to Union policy, and to build and strengthen their capacity to become more efficient partners.\n(24)\nWhilst improving governance at all levels should be a cross-cutting objective for all subprogrammes of the LIFE Programme, the LIFE Programme should support the development, implementation and enforcement of, and compliance with, the environment and climate acquis, in particular the horizontal legislation on environmental governance, including the legislation implementing the Aarhus Convention.\n(25)\nThe LIFE Programme should prepare market players for, and support them in, the shift towards a sustainable, circular, energy-efficient, renewable energy-based, climate-neutral and -resilient economy by testing new business opportunities, upgrading professional skills, facilitating consumers' access to sustainable products and services, engaging and empowering influencers, and testing novel methods of adapting existing processes and the business landscape. To support a broader market uptake of sustainable solutions, general public acceptance and consumer engagement should be promoted.\n(26)\nThe LIFE Programme is designed to support the demonstration of techniques, approaches and best practices that can be replicated and upscaled. Innovative solutions would contribute to the improvement of environmental performance and sustainability, in particular for the development of sustainable farming practices in the areas active in the fields of climate, water, soil, biodiversity and waste. Synergies with other programmes and policies, such as the European Innovation Partnership for Agricultural Productivity and Sustainability and the EU Eco-Management and Audit Scheme, should be emphasised in this regard.\n(27)\nAt Union level, large investments in environment and climate actions are primarily funded by major Union funding programmes. It is therefore imperative to step up mainstreaming efforts to ensure sustainability, biodiversity proofing and climate proofing of activities under other Union funding programmes and the integration of sustainability safeguards in all Union instruments. In the context of their role as a catalyst, strategic integrated projects and strategic nature projects to be developed under the LIFE Programme should leverage financing opportunities under those funding programmes and other sources of funding, such as national funds, and create synergies.\n(28)\nThe success of strategic nature projects and strategic integrated projects depends on close cooperation between national, regional and local authorities and the non-State actors affected by the objectives of the LIFE Programme. The principles of transparency and disclosure regarding decisions on the development, implementation, assessment and monitoring of projects should, therefore, be applied, in particular in the case of mainstreaming or when multiple funding sources are involved.\n(29)\nReflecting the importance of tackling climate change in a coordinated and ambitious manner, in line with the Union's commitments to implement the Paris Agreement on Climate Change and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, the LIFE Programme will contribute to mainstreaming climate actions and to the achievement of an overall target of at least 30 % of the EU budget expenditure supporting climate objectives. Actions under the LIFE Programme are expected to contribute 61 % of the overall financial envelope of the LIFE Programme to climate objectives. Relevant actions will be identified during the LIFE Programme's preparation and implementation, and reassessed in the context of the relevant evaluations and review processes. In line with the European Green Deal, actions under the LIFE programme should respect the 'do no harm' principle.\n(30)\nIn the implementation of the LIFE Programme, due consideration should be given to the strategy for outermost regions, contained in the communication of the Commission of 24 October 2017 on a stronger and renewed strategic partnership with the EU's outermost regions, in view of Article 349 TFEU and the specific needs and vulnerabilities of those regions. Union policies other than environmental, climate and relevant energy policies should also be taken into account.\n(31)\nIn support of the implementation of the LIFE Programme, the Commission should collaborate with the LIFE Programme's National Contact Points network to stimulate cooperation aimed at improving and making National Contact Point services across the Union more effective, in order to increase the overall quality of submitted proposals, organise seminars and workshops, publish lists of projects funded under the LIFE Programme or undertake other activities, such as media campaigns, so as to better disseminate project results and to facilitate exchange of experience, knowledge and best practice and the replication of project results across the Union, thus promoting cooperation and communication. Such activities should in particular target Member States in which there is a low uptake of funds and should facilitate communication and cooperation between beneficiaries, applicants and stakeholders of completed or ongoing projects in the same field. It is essential that such communication and cooperation activities be addressed to regional and local authorities and to stakeholders.\n(32)\nQuality should be the criterion governing the project evaluation and award process in the LIFE Programme. In order to facilitate the implementation of the objectives of the LIFE Programme across the Union and to promote high quality in project proposals, funding for technical assistance projects that are aimed at effective participation in the LIFE Programme should be made available. The Commission should pursue effective, quality-based geographical coverage across the Union, including by supporting Member States to increase the quality of projects through capacity building. Low effective participation, eligible activities and award criteria of the LIFE Programme should be specified in the Multiannual Work Programme guided by the participation and success rate of applicants from the relevant Member States, taking into account, inter alia, population and population density, the total area of Natura 2000 sites for each Member State expressed as a proportion of the total area of Natura 2000, and the proportion of a Member State's territory covered by Natura 2000 sites. Eligible activities should be of a nature such that they are aimed at improving the quality of project applications.\n(33)\nIn accordance with the communication of the Commission of 18 January 2018 on EU actions to improve environmental compliance and governance, the European Union Network for the Implementation and Enforcement of Environmental Law (IMPEL), the European Network of Prosecutors for the Environment (ENPE), and the European Union Forum of Judges for the Environment (EUFJE) have been created to facilitate collaboration between Member States and to play a unique role in the enforcement of Union environmental legislation. They provide a substantial contribution to reinforcing consistency in the implementation and enforcement of Union environmental legislation across the Union, to avoiding distortions of competition and to improving the quality of the environmental inspection and the law enforcement mechanisms through a networking system at both, Union and Member State level, and provide for the exchange of information and experience at different administrative levels, through training and in-depth discussions on environmental issues and enforcement aspects, including monitoring and permitting processes. In view of their contribution to the objectives of the LIFE Programme, it is appropriate to authorise the award of grants to IMPEL, ENPE and EUFJE without a call for proposals so as to continue to provide support to the activities of those bodies. In addition, in other cases, a call might not be required pursuant to the general requirements of Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2018/1046 of the European Parliament and of the Council (27) (the 'Financial Regulation'), for example for bodies designated by Member States and operating under their responsibility, where those Member States are identified as beneficiaries of a grant by a legislative act of the Union.\n(34)\nIt is appropriate to lay down a financial envelope for the LIFE Programme which is to constitute the prime reference amount, within the meaning of point 18 of the Interinstitutional Agreement of 16 December 2020 between the European Parliament, the Council of the European Union and the European Commission on budgetary discipline, on cooperation in budgetary matters and on sound financial management, as well as on new own resources, including a roadmap towards the introduction of new own resources, for the European Parliament and the Council during the annual budgetary procedure.\n(35)\nThe maximum co-financing rates of grants financed under the LIFE Programme should be set at levels such as are necessary to maintain the effective level of support provided by the LIFE Programme. In order to take into account the necessary adaptability that is needed to respond to the existing range of actions and entities, specific co-financing rates should facilitate certainty, while maintaining a degree of flexibility commensurate to specific needs or requirements. The specific co-financing rates should always be subject to the established relevant maximum co-financing rates.\n(36)\nThe Financial Regulation adopted by the European Parliament and the Council on the basis of Article 322 TFEU applies to this Regulation. The Financial Regulation lays down rules on the implementation of the Union budget, including the rules on grants, prizes, procurement, indirect management, financial instruments, budgetary guarantees, financial assistance and the reimbursement of external experts, and provides for checks on the responsibility of financial actors. Rules adopted on the basis of Article 322 TFEU also include a general regime of conditionality for the protection of the Union budget.\n(37)\nIn accordance with the Financial Regulation, Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 883/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council (28), Council Regulations (EC, Euratom) No 2988/95 (29), (Euratom, EC) No 2185/96 (30) and (EU) 2017/1939 (31), the financial interests of the Union are to be protected by means of proportionate measures, including measures relating to the prevention, detection, correction and investigation of irregularities, including fraud, to the recovery of funds lost, wrongly paid or incorrectly used, and, where appropriate, the imposition of administrative penalties. In particular, in accordance with Regulations (Euratom, EC) No 2185/96 and (EU, Euratom) No 883/2013, the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) has the power to carry out administrative investigations, including on-the-spot checks and inspections, with a view to establishing whether there has been fraud, corruption or any other illegal activity affecting the financial interests of the Union.\nThe European Public Prosecutor's Office (EPPO) is empowered, in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2017/1939, to investigate and prosecute offences against the Union's financial interests as provided for in Directive (EU) 2017/1371 of the European Parliament and of the Council (32). In accordance with the Financial Regulation, any person or entity receiving Union funds is to fully cooperate in the protection of the financial interests of the Union, grant the necessary rights and access to the Commission, OLAF, the Court of Auditors, and, in respect of those Member States participating in enhanced cooperation pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2017/1939, the EPPO, and to ensure that any third parties involved in the implementation of Union funds grant equivalent rights.\n(38)\nThe types of financing and the methods of implementation of the budget of the LIFE Programme should be chosen on the basis of their ability to achieve the specific objectives of the actions and to deliver results, taking into account, in particular, the costs of controls, the administrative burden, and the expected risk of non-compliance. For grants, the use of lump sums, flat rates and scales of unit costs should be considered. The Commission should ensure that implementation is easy to understand, and should promote genuine simplification for project developers.\n(39)\nWhere appropriate, the policy objectives of the LIFE Programme should be addressed through financial instruments and budgetary guarantees under Regulation (EU) 2021/523, including through the allocated amount from the LIFE Programme, as specified in the multiannual work programmes under that Programme.\n(40)\nPursuant to Article 94 of Council Decision 2013/755/EU (33), entities established in overseas countries and territories are eligible for funding subject to the rules and objectives of the LIFE Programme and to possible arrangements applicable to the Member State to which the relevant overseas country or territory is linked. The participation of such entities in the LIFE Programme should focus primarily on projects that fall under the subprogramme 'Nature and Biodiversity'.\n(41)\nThe voluntary scheme for Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services in Territories of European Overseas (BEST) promotes the conservation of biodiversity, including marine biodiversity, and sustainable use of ecosystem services, including ecosystem-based approaches to climate change adaptation and mitigation, in the Union's Outermost Regions and Overseas Countries and Territories. Through the BEST preparatory action adopted in 2011 and the subsequent BEST 2.0 Programme and BEST RUP project, BEST has helped to raise awareness of the ecological importance of the Outermost Regions and Overseas Countries and Territories and their key role in conserving global biodiversity. The Commission estimates that the need for financial support for projects on the ground in those territories is EUR 8 million per year. In their Ministerial Declarations in 2017 and 2018, Overseas Countries and Territories expressed their appreciation for this small-grant scheme for biodiversity. It is therefore appropriate for the LIFE Programme to finance small grants for biodiversity, including capacity building and actions that have a catalytic effect, in both the Outermost Regions and the Overseas Countries and Territories.\n(42)\nThe LIFE Programme should be open to third countries in accordance with the agreements between the Union and those countries establishing the specific conditions for their participation.\n(43)\nThird countries which are members of the European Economic Area (EEA) may participate in Union programmes in the framework of the cooperation established under Agreement on the European Economic Area (34), which provides for the implementation of the programmes on the basis of a decision adopted under that Agreement. Third countries may also participate on the basis of other legal instruments. A specific provision should be introduced in this Regulation requiring third countries to grant the necessary rights for and access required for the authorising officer responsible, OLAF and the Court of Auditors to comprehensively exercise their respective competences.\n(44)\nPursuant to paragraphs 22 and 23 of the Inter-institutional agreement of 13 April 2016 on Better Law-Making (35), the LIFE Programme should be evaluated on the basis of information collected through specific monitoring requirements, while avoiding an administrative burden, in particular on Member States, and overregulation. Those requirements, where appropriate, should include measurable indicators as a basis for evaluating the effects of the LIFE Programme on the ground. The full impact of the LIFE Programme accrues through indirect, long-term and difficult-to-measure contributions towards achieving the full range of Union environment and climate objectives. For monitoring of the LIFE Programme, direct output indicators and tracking requirements set out in this Regulation should be complemented by aggregation of specific project level indicators to be described in multiannual work programmes or calls for proposals, inter alia regarding Natura 2000 and emissions of certain atmospheric pollutants.\n(45)\nIn order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of this Regulation relating to the adoption of the multiannual work programmes, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission. Those powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council (36).\n(46)\nIn order to ensure that support from and implementation of the LIFE Programme is consistent with the policies and priorities of the Union, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 TFEU should be delegated to the Commission, in order to amend this Regulation by reviewing or complementing the indicators or to supplement this Regulation by defining specific indicators for each subprogramme and type of project and by establishing a monitoring and evaluation framework. It is of particular importance that the Commission carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level, and that those consultations be conducted in accordance with the principles laid down in the Interinstitutional Agreement of 13 April 2016 on Better Law-Making. In particular, to ensure equal participation in the preparation of delegated acts, the European Parliament and the Council receive all documents at the same time as Member States' experts, and their experts systematically have access to meetings of Commission expert groups dealing with the preparation of delegated acts.\n(47)\nSince the objectives of this Regulation, namely to contribute to a high level of environmental protection and ambitious climate action, to sustainable development and to the achievement of the objectives and targets of environmental, biodiversity, climate, circular economy, relevant renewable energy and energy efficiency legislation, strategies, plans and international commitments of the Union, through good governance and a multi-stakeholder approach, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States but can rather, by reason of the scale and effects of this Regulation, be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union. In accordance with the principle of proportionality as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives.\n(48)\nRegulation (EU) No 1293/2013 should therefore be repealed.\n(49)\nIt is appropriate to ensure a smooth transition without interruption between the previous Programme for the Environment and Climate Action (LIFE) and the LIFE Programme, and to align the start of the LIFE Programme with that of the multiannual financial framework as laid down in Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2020/2093. Therefore, this Regulation should enter into force as a matter of urgency and should apply with retroactive effect from 1 January 2021,\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nCHAPTER I\nGeneral provisions\nArticle 1\nSubject matter\nThis Regulation establishes a Programme for the Environment and Climate Action (LIFE) (the 'LIFE Programme') for the period of the multiannual financial framework 2021 to 2027.
