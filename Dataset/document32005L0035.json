{"celex_id": "32005L0035", "reference": "30.9.2005\nEN\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\nL 255/11\nDIRECTIVE 2005/35/EC OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL\nof 7 September 2005\non ship-source pollution and on the introduction of penalties for infringements\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 80(2) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the Commission,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee (1),\nAfter consulting the Committee of the Regions,\nActing in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty (2),\nWhereas:\n(1)\nThe Community's maritime safety policy is aimed at a high level of safety and environmental protection and is based on the understanding that all parties involved in the transport of goods by sea have a responsibility for ensuring that ships used in Community waters comply with applicable rules and standards.\n(2)\nThe material standards in all Member States for discharges of polluting substances from ships are based upon the Marpol 73/78 Convention; however these rules are being ignored on a daily basis by a very large number of ships sailing in Community waters, without corrective action being taken.\n(3)\nThe implementation of Marpol 73/78 shows discrepancies among Member States and there is thus a need to harmonise its implementation at Community level; in particular the practices of Member States relating to the imposition of penalties for discharges of polluting substances from ships differ significantly.\n(4)\nMeasures of a dissuasive nature form an integral part of the Community's maritime safety policy, as they ensure a link between the responsibility of each of the parties involved in the transport of polluting goods by sea and their exposure to penalties; in order to achieve effective protection of the environment there is therefore a need for effective, dissuasive and proportionate penalties.\n(5)\nTo that end it is essential to approximate, by way of the proper legal instruments, existing legal provisions, in particular on the precise definition of the infringement in question, the cases of exemption and minimum rules for penalties, and on liability and jurisdiction.\n(6)\nThis Directive is supplemented by detailed rules on criminal offences and penalties as well as other provisions set out in Council Framework Decision 2005/667/JHA of 12 July 2005 to strengthen the criminal law framework for the enforcement of the law against ship-source pollution (3).\n(7)\nNeither the international regime for the civil liability and compensation of oil pollution nor that relating to pollution by other hazardous or noxious substances provides sufficient dissuasive effects to discourage the parties involved in the transport of hazardous cargoes by sea from engaging in substandard practices; the required dissuasive effects can only be achieved through the introduction of penalties applying to any person who causes or contributes to marine pollution; penalties should be applicable not only to the shipowner or the master of the ship, but also the owner of the cargo, the classification society or any other person involved.\n(8)\nShip-source discharges of polluting substances should be regarded as infringements if committed with intent, recklessly or by serious negligence. These infringements are regarded as criminal offences by, and in the circumstances provided for in, Framework Decision 2005/667/JHA supplementing this Directive.\n(9)\nPenalties for discharges of polluting substances from ships are not related to the civil liability of the parties concerned and are thus not subject to any rules relating to the limitation or channelling of civil liabilities, nor do they limit the efficient compensation of victims of pollution incidents.\n(10)\nThere is a need for further effective cooperation among Member States to ensure that discharges of polluting substances from ships are detected in time and that the offenders are identified. For this reason, the European Maritime Safety Agency set up by Regulation (EC) No 1406/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 June 2002 (4) has a key role to play in working with the Member States in developing technical solutions and providing technical assistance relating to the implementation of this Directive and in assisting the Commission in the performance of any task assigned to it for the effective implementation of this Directive.\n(11)\nIn order better to prevent and combat marine pollution, synergies should be created between enforcement authorities such as national coastguard services. In this context, the Commission should undertake a feasibility study on a European coastguard dedicated to pollution prevention and response, making clear the costs and benefits. This study should, if appropriate, be followed by a proposal on a European coastguard.\n(12)\nWhere there is clear, objective evidence of a discharge causing major damage or a threat of major damage, Member States should submit the matter to their competent authorities with a view to instituting proceedings in accordance with Article 220 of the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.\n(13)\nThe enforcement of Directive 2000/59/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 November 2000 on port reception facilities for ship-generated waste and cargo residues (5) is, together with this Directive, a key instrument in the set of measures to prevent ship-source pollution.\n(14)\nThe measures necessary for the implementation of this Directive should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission (6).\n(15)\nSince the objectives of this Directive, namely the incorporation of the international ship-source pollution standards into Community law and the establishment of penalties — criminal or administrative — for violation of them in order to ensure a high level of safety and environmental protection in maritime transport, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Directive does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives.\n(16)\nThis Directive fully respects the Charter of fundamental rights of the European Union; any person suspected of having committed an infringement must be guaranteed a fair and impartial hearing and the penalties must be proportional,\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:\nArticle 1\nPurpose\n1.   The purpose of this Directive is to incorporate international standards for ship-source pollution into Community law and to ensure that persons responsible for discharges are subject to adequate penalties as referred to in Article 8, in order to improve maritime safety and to enhance protection of the marine environment from pollution by ships.\n2.   This Directive does not prevent Member States from taking more stringent measures against ship-source pollution in conformity with international law.\nArticle 2\nDefinitions\nFor the purpose of this Directive:\n1.\n‘Marpol 73/78’ shall mean the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, 1973 and its 1978 Protocol, in its up-to-date version;\n2.\n‘polluting substances’ shall mean substances covered by Annexes I (oil) and II (noxious liquid substances in bulk) to Marpol 73/78;\n3.\n‘discharge’ shall mean any release howsoever caused from a ship, as referred to in Article 2 of Marpol 73/78;\n4.\n‘ship’ shall mean a seagoing vessel, irrespective of its flag, of any type whatsoever operating in the marine environment and shall include hydrofoil boats, air-cushion vehicles, submersibles and floating craft.\nArticle 3\nScope\n1.

This Directive shall apply to discharges of polluting substances from any ship, irrespective of its flag, with the exception of any warship, naval auxiliary or other ship owned or operated by a State and used, for the time being, only on government non-commercial service.\nArticle 4\nInfringements\nMember States shall ensure that ship-source discharges of polluting substances into any of the areas referred to in Article 3(1) are regarded as infringements if committed with intent, recklessly or by serious negligence. These infringements are regarded as criminal offences by, and in the circumstances provided for in, Framework Decision 2005/667/JHA supplementing this Directive.\nArticle 5\nExceptions\n1.   A discharge of polluting substances into any of the areas referred to in Article 3(1) shall not be regarded as an infringement if it satisfies the conditions set out in Annex I, Regulations 9, 10, 11(a) or 11(c) or in Annex II, Regulations 5, 6(a) or 6(c) of Marpol 73/78.\n2.   A discharge of polluting substances into the areas referred to in Article 3(1)(c), (d) and (e) shall not be regarded as an infringement for the owner, the master or the crew when acting under the master's responsibility if it satisfies the conditions set out in Annex I, Regulation 11(b) or in Annex II, Regulation 6(b) of Marpol 73/78.\nArticle 6\nEnforcement measures with respect to ships within a port of a Member State\n1.   If irregularities or information give rise to a suspicion that a ship which is voluntarily within a port or at an off-shore terminal of a Member State has been engaged in or is engaging in a discharge of polluting substances into any of the areas referred to in Article 3(1), that Member State shall ensure that an appropriate inspection, taking into account the relevant guidelines adopted by the International Maritime Organisation (IMO), is undertaken in accordance with its national law.\n2.   In so far as the inspection referred to in paragraph 1 reveals facts that could indicate an infringement within the meaning of Article 4, the competent authorities of that Member State and of the flag State shall be informed.\nArticle 7\nEnforcement measures by coastal States with respect to ships in transit\n1.   If the suspected discharge of polluting substances takes place in the areas referred to in Article 3(1)(b), (c), (d) or (e) and the ship which is suspected of the discharge does not call at a port of the Member State holding the information relating to the suspected discharge, the following shall apply:\n(a)\nIf the next port of call of the ship is in another Member State, the Member States concerned shall cooperate closely in the inspection referred to in Article 6(1) and in deciding on the appropriate measures in respect of any such discharge;\n(b)\nIf the next port of call of the ship is a port of a State outside the Community, the Member State shall take the necessary measures to ensure that the next port of call of the ship is informed about the suspected discharge and shall request the State of the next port of call to take the appropriate measures in respect of any such discharge.\n2.   Where there is clear, objective evidence that a ship navigating in the areas referred to in Article 3(1)(b) or (d) has, in the area referred to in Article 3(1)(d), committed an infringement resulting in a discharge causing major damage or a threat of major damage to the coastline or related interests of the Member State concerned, or to any resources of the areas referred to in Article 3(1)(b) or (d), that State shall, subject to Part XII, Section 7 of the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and provided that the evidence so warrants, submit the matter to its competent authorities with a view to instituting proceedings, including detention of the ship, in accordance with its national law.\n3.   In any event, the authorities of the flag State shall be informed.\nArticle 8\nPenalties\n1.   Member States shall take the necessary measures to ensure that infringements within the meaning of Article 4 are subject to effective, proportionate and dissuasive penalties, which may include criminal or administrative penalties.\n2.   Each Member State shall take the measures necessary to ensure that the penalties referred to in paragraph 1 apply to any person who is found responsible for an infringement within the meaning of Article 4.\nArticle 9\nCompliance with international law\nMember States shall apply the provisions of this Directive without any discrimination in form or in fact against foreign ships and in accordance with applicable international law, including Section 7 of Part XII of the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, and they shall promptly notify the flag State of the vessel and any other State concerned of measures taken in accordance with this Directive.\nArticle 10\nAccompanying measures\n1.   For the purposes of this Directive, Member States and the Commission shall cooperate, where appropriate, in close collaboration with the European Maritime Safety Agency and taking account of the action programme to respond to accidental or deliberate marine pollution set up by Decision No 2850/2000/EC (7) and if appropriate, of the implementation of Directive 2000/59/EC in order to:\n(a)\ndevelop the necessary information systems required for the effective implementation of this Directive;\n(b)\nestablish common practices and guidelines on the basis of those existing at international level, in particular for:\n—\nthe monitoring and early identification of ships discharging polluting substances in violation of this Directive, including, where appropriate, on-board monitoring equipment,\n—\nreliable methods of tracing polluting substances in the sea to a particular ship, and\n—\nthe effective enforcement of this Directive.\n2.

According to the directive, this relates to discharges of oil or other polluting substances from vessels. Minor discharges are not automatically considered as offences, except where repeated discharges lead to a deterioration in water quality.\nThe persons responsible for discharging polluting substances may be subject to criminal penalties, if they have acted with intent, recklessly* or with serious negligence. The act of inciting or aiding and abetting a person to discharge a polluting substance may also lead to criminal penalties.\nThe directive applies to all types of vessels, irrespective of their flag.\nPolluting discharges are forbidden in:\nthe internal waters, including ports, of an EU country;\nthe territorial waters of an EU country;\nstraits used for international navigation subject to the right of transit passage, as laid down in the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea;\nthe exclusive economic zone (EEZ)* of an EU country;\nthe high seas.\nExceptions\nThis regime does not apply to discharges from warships or other ships owned or operated by a state and used only on government non-commercial service.\nExceptions to the ban on discharges of polluting substances may be applied where human safety or that of the ship is in danger.\nLegal persons\nDirective 2009/123/EC amended Directive 2005/35/EC to improve rules on ship-source pollution and to ensure that those responsible for discharges of polluting substances are subject to adequate penalties. It requires EU countries to introduce rules on the liability of legal persons under private law* such as companies.\nCompanies may be subject to criminal penalties if an individual in a leading position within the company has committed a criminal offence for their benefit, whether this person has acted either individually or as part of the company.\nThe company is also responsible for offences committed by an individual through oversight, specifically through a lack of supervision or control.\nThe liability of the company must not exclude criminal proceedings against the individuals involved.\nApplying penalties\nDirective 2009/123/EC also requires EU countries’ national authorities to ensure that effective, proportionate and dissuasive penalties are applied, including for minor cases. They must cooperate when a vessel is found guilty of illegal discharging in their area of responsibility before the vessels calls at the port of another EU country.\nFROM WHEN DOES THE DIRECTIVE APPLY?\n              \nIt has applied since 1 October 2005. EU countries had to incorporate it into national law by 1 April 2007.\nBACKGROUND\n              \nThe sinking of the Prestige in November 2002 and of the Erika in December 1999 highlighted the need to tighten the net in relation to ship-source pollution. However, accidents are not the main source of pollution: most of it is the result of deliberate discharges (tank-cleaning operations and waste oil disposal).\nThese rules incorporate into EU law parts of the 1973 International Convention on the Prevention of Pollution from Ships and its 1978 Protocol (known as the Marpol Convention). This makes it possible to harmonise application of the rules of this convention.\nKEY TERMS\n* Reckless action: action taken with the knowledge that it is likely to result in damage.\n* Exclusive economic zone (EEZ): it is generally understood to arise when a country assumes jurisdiction over the exploration and exploitation of marine resources off its coast. This section is normally considered to be a band extending 200 miles from the shore.\n* Legal persons under private law: all legal entities, such as companies, with the exception of states, public bodies and international public organisations.\nACTS\n            \nDirective 2005/35/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 7 September 2005 on ship-source pollution and on the introduction of penalties for infringements (OJ L 255, 30.9.2005, pp. 11–21).\nSuccessive amendments to Directive 2005/35/CE have been incorporated in the basic text.
