{"celex_id": "32010L0063", "reference": "20.10.2010\nEN\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\nL 276/33\nDIRECTIVE 2010/63/EU OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL\nof 22 September 2010\non the protection of animals used for scientific purposes\n(Text with EEA relevance)\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 114 thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European Commission,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee (1),\nAfter consulting the Committee of the Regions,\nActing in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure (2),\nWhereas:\n(1)\nOn 24 November 1986 the Council adopted Directive 86/609/EEC (3) in order to eliminate disparities between laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States regarding the protection of animals used for experimental and other scientific purposes. Since the adoption of that Directive, further disparities between Member States have emerged. Certain Member States have adopted national implementing measures that ensure a high level of protection of animals used for scientific purposes, while others only apply the minimum requirements laid down in Directive 86/609/EEC. These disparities are liable to constitute barriers to trade in products and substances the development of which involves experiments on animals. Accordingly, this Directive should provide for more detailed rules in order to reduce such disparities by approximating the rules applicable in that area and to ensure a proper functioning of the internal market.\n(2)\nAnimal welfare is a value of the Union that is enshrined in Article 13 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU).\n(3)\nOn 23 March 1998 the Council adopted Decision 1999/575/EC concerning the conclusion by the Community of the European Convention for the protection of vertebrate animals used for experimental and other scientific purposes (4). By becoming party to that Convention, the Community acknowledged the importance of the protection and welfare of animals used for scientific purposes at international level.\n(4)\nThe European Parliament in its resolution of 5 December 2002 on Directive 86/609/EEC called for the Commission to come forward with a proposal for a revision of that Directive with more stringent and transparent measures in the area of animal experimentation.\n(5)\nOn 15 June 2006, the Fourth Multilateral Consultation of Parties to the European Convention for the protection of vertebrate animals used for experimental and other scientific purposes adopted a revised Appendix A to that Convention, which set out guidelines for the accommodation and care of experimental animals. Commission Recommendation 2007/526/EC of 18 June 2007 on guidelines for the accommodation and care of animals used for experimental and other scientific purposes (5) incorporated those guidelines.\n(6)\nNew scientific knowledge is available in respect of factors influencing animal welfare as well as the capacity of animals to sense and express pain, suffering, distress and lasting harm. It is therefore necessary to improve the welfare of animals used in scientific procedures by raising the minimum standards for their protection in line with the latest scientific developments.\n(7)\nAttitudes towards animals also depend on national perceptions, and there is a demand in certain Member States to maintain more extensive animal-welfare rules than those agreed upon at the level of the Union. In the interests of the animals, and provided it does not affect the functioning of the internal market, it is appropriate to allow the Member States certain flexibility to maintain national rules aimed at more extensive protection of animals in so far as they are compatible with the TFEU.\n(8)\nIn addition to vertebrate animals including cyclostomes, cephalopods should also be included in the scope of this Directive, as there is scientific evidence of their ability to experience pain, suffering, distress and lasting harm.\n(9)\nThis Directive should also cover foetal forms of mammals, as there is scientific evidence showing that such forms in the last third of the period of their development are at an increased risk of experiencing pain, suffering and distress, which may also affect negatively their subsequent development. Scientific evidence also shows that procedures carried out on embryonic and foetal forms at an earlier stage of development could result in pain, suffering, distress or lasting harm, should the developmental forms be allowed to live beyond the first two thirds of their development.\n(10)\nWhile it is desirable to replace the use of live animals in procedures by other methods not entailing the use of live animals, the use of live animals continues to be necessary to protect human and animal health and the environment. However, this Directive represents an important step towards achieving the final goal of full replacement of procedures on live animals for scientific and educational purposes as soon as it is scientifically possible to do so. To that end, it seeks to facilitate and promote the advancement of alternative approaches. It also seeks to ensure a high level of protection for animals that still need to be used in procedures. This Directive should be reviewed regularly in light of evolving science and animal-protection measures.\n(11)\nThe care and use of live animals for scientific purposes is governed by internationally established principles of replacement, reduction and refinement. To ensure that the way in which animals are bred, cared for and used in procedures within the Union is in line with that of the other international and national standards applicable outside the Union, the principles of replacement, reduction and refinement should be considered systematically when implementing this Directive. When choosing methods, the principles of replacement, reduction and refinement should be implemented through a strict hierarchy of the requirement to use alternative methods. Where no alternative method is recognised by the legislation of the Union, the numbers of animals used may be reduced by resorting to other methods and by implementing testing strategies, such as the use of in vitro and other methods that would reduce and refine the use of animals.\n(12)\nAnimals have an intrinsic value which must be respected. There are also the ethical concerns of the general public as regards the use of animals in procedures. Therefore, animals should always be treated as sentient creatures and their use in procedures should be restricted to areas which may ultimately benefit human or animal health, or the environment. The use of animals for scientific or educational purposes should therefore only be considered where a non-animal alternative is unavailable. Use of animals for scientific procedures in other areas under the competence of the Union should be prohibited.\n(13)\nThe choice of methods and the species to be used have a direct impact on both the numbers of animals used and their welfare. The choice of methods should therefore ensure the selection of the method that is able to provide the most satisfactory results and is likely to cause the minimum pain, suffering or distress. The methods selected should use the minimum number of animals that would provide reliable results and require the use of species with the lowest capacity to experience pain, suffering, distress or lasting harm that are optimal for extrapolation into target species.\n(14)\nThe methods selected should avoid, as far as possible, death as an end-point due to the severe suffering experienced during the period before death. Where possible, it should be substituted by more humane end-points using clinical signs that determine the impending death, thereby allowing the animal to be killed without any further suffering.\n(15)\nThe use of inappropriate methods for killing an animal can cause significant pain, distress and suffering to the animal. The level of competence of the person carrying out this operation is equally important. Animals should therefore be killed only by a competent person using a method that is appropriate to the species.\n(16)\nIt is necessary to ensure that the use of animals in procedures does not pose a threat to biodiversity. Therefore, the use of endangered species in procedures should be limited to a strict minimum.\n(17)\nHaving regard to the present state of scientific knowledge, the use of non-human primates in scientific procedures is still necessary in biomedical research. Due to their genetic proximity to human beings and to their highly developed social skills, the use of non-human primates in scientific procedures raises specific ethical and practical problems in terms of meeting their behavioural, environmental and social needs in a laboratory environment. Furthermore, the use of non-human primates is of the greatest concern to the public. Therefore the use of non-human primates should be permitted only in those biomedical areas essential for the benefit of human beings, for which no other alternative replacement methods are yet available. Their use should be permitted only for basic research, the preservation of the respective non-human primate species or when the work, including xenotransplantation, is carried out in relation to potentially life-threatening conditions in humans or in relation to cases having a substantial impact on a personâ€™s day-to-day functioning, i.e. debilitating conditions.\n(18)\nThe use of great apes, as the closest species to human beings with the most advanced social and behavioural skills, should be permitted only for the purposes of research aimed at the preservation of those species and where action in relation to a life-threatening, debilitating condition endangering human beings is warranted, and no other species or alternative method would suffice in order to achieve the aims of the procedure. The Member State claiming such a need should provide information necessary for the Commission to take a decision.\n(19)\nThe capture of non-human primates from the wild is highly stressful for the animals concerned and carries an elevated risk of injury and suffering during capture and transport. In order to end the capturing of animals from the wild for breeding purposes, only animals that are the offspring of an animal which has been bred in captivity, or that are sourced from self-sustaining colonies, should be used in procedures after an appropriate transition period. A feasibility study should be carried out to that effect and the transition period adopted if necessary. The feasibility of moving towards sourcing non-human primates only from self-sustaining colonies as an ultimate goal should also be examined.\n(20)\nThere is a need for certain species of vertebrate animals used in procedures to be bred specifically for that purpose so that their genetic, biological and behavioural background is well-known to persons undertaking the procedures. Such knowledge both increases the scientific quality and reliability of the results and decreases the variability, ultimately resulting in fewer procedures and reduced animal use. Furthermore, for reasons of animal welfare and conservation, the use of animals taken from the wild in procedures should be limited to cases where the purpose of the procedures cannot be achieved using animals bred specifically for use in procedures.\n(21)\nSince the background of stray and feral animals of domestic species is not known, and since capture and placement into establishments increases distress for such animals, they should not, as a general rule, be used in procedures.\n(22)\nTo enhance transparency, facilitate the project authorisation, and provide tools for monitoring compliance, a severity classification of procedures should be introduced on the basis of estimated levels of pain, suffering, distress and lasting harm that is inflicted on the animals.\n(23)\nFrom an ethical standpoint, there should be an upper limit of pain, suffering and distress above which animals should not be subjected in scientific procedures. To that end, the performance of procedures that result in severe pain, suffering or distress, which is likely to be long-lasting and cannot be ameliorated, should be prohibited.\n(24)\nWhen developing a common format for reporting purposes, the actual severity of the pain, suffering, distress or lasting harm experienced by the animal should be taken into account rather than the predicted severity at the time of the project evaluation.\n(25)\nThe number of animals used in procedures could be reduced by performing procedures on animals more than once, where this does not detract from the scientific objective or result in poor animal welfare. However, the benefit of reusing animals should be balanced against any adverse effects on their welfare, taking into account the lifetime experience of the individual animal. As a result of this potential conflict, the reuse of animals should be considered on a case-by-case basis.\n(26)\nAt the end of the procedure, the most appropriate decision should be taken as regards the future of the animal on the basis of animal welfare and potential risks to the environment. The animals whose welfare would be compromised should be killed. In some cases, animals should be returned to a suitable habitat or husbandry system or animals such as dogs and cats should be allowed to be rehomed in families as there is a high level of public concern as to the fate of such animals. Should Member States allow rehoming, it is essential that the breeder, supplier or user has a scheme in place to provide appropriate socialisation to those animals in order to ensure successful rehoming as well as to avoid unnecessary distress to the animals and to guarantee public safety.\n(27)\nAnimal tissue and organs are used for the development of in vitro methods. To promote the principle of reduction, Member States should, where appropriate, facilitate the establishment of programmes for sharing the organs and tissue of animals that are killed.\n(28)\nThe welfare of the animals used in procedures is highly dependent on the quality and professional competence of the personnel supervising procedures, as well as of those performing procedures or supervising those taking care of the animals on a daily basis. Member States should ensure through authorisation or by other means that staff are adequately educated, trained and competent. Furthermore, it is important that staff are supervised until they have obtained and demonstrated the requisite competence. Non-binding guidelines at the level of the Union concerning educational requirements would, in the long run, promote the free movement of personnel.\n(29)\nThe establishments of breeders, suppliers and users should have adequate installations and equipment in place to meet the accommodation requirements of the animal species concerned and to allow the procedures to be performed efficiently and with the least distress to the animals. The breeders, suppliers and users should operate only if they are authorised by the competent authorities.\n(30)\nTo ensure the ongoing monitoring of animal-welfare needs, appropriate veterinary care should be available at all times and a staff member should be made responsible for the care and welfare of animals in each establishment.\n(31)\nAnimal-welfare considerations should be given the highest priority in the context of animal keeping, breeding and use. Breeders, suppliers and users should therefore have an animal-welfare body in place with the primary task of focusing on giving advice on animal-welfare issues. The body should also follow the development and outcome of projects at establishment level, foster a climate of care and provide tools for the practical application and timely implementation of recent technical and scientific developments in relation to the principles of replacement, reduction and refinement, in order to enhance the life-time experience of the animals. The advice given by the animal-welfare body should be properly documented and open to scrutiny during inspections.\n(32)\nIn order to enable competent authorities to monitor compliance with this Directive, each breeder, supplier and user should maintain accurate records of the numbers of animals, their origins and fate.\n(33)\nNon-human primates, dogs and cats should have a personal history file from birth covering their lifetimes in order to be able to receive the care, accommodation and treatment that meet their individual needs and characteristics.\n(34)\nThe accommodation and care of animals should be based on the specific needs and characteristics of each species.\n(35)\nThere are differences in the requirements for the accommodation and care of animals between Member States, which contribute to the distortion of the internal market. Furthermore, some of those requirements no longer reflect the most recent knowledge on the impacts of accommodation and care conditions on both the animal welfare and the scientific results of procedures. It is therefore necessary to establish in this Directive harmonised requirements for accommodation and care. These requirements should be updated on the basis of scientific and technical development.\n(36)\nTo monitor compliance with this Directive, Member States should carry out regular inspections of breeders, suppliers and users on a risk basis. To ensure public confidence and promote transparency, an appropriate proportion of the inspections should be carried out without prior warning.\n(37)\nTo assist the Member States in the enforcement of this Directive and on the basis of the findings in the reports on the operation of the national inspections, the Commission should, when there is reason for concern, carry out controls of the national inspection systems. Member States should address any weaknesses identified in the findings of these controls.\n(38)\nComprehensive project evaluation, taking into account ethical considerations in the use of animals, forms the core of project authorisation and should ensure the implementation of principles of replacement, reduction and refinement in those projects.\n(39)\nIt is also essential, both on moral and scientific grounds, to ensure that each use of an animal is carefully evaluated as to the scientific or educational validity, usefulness and relevance of the expected result of that use. The likely harm to the animal should be balanced against the expected benefits of the project. Therefore, an impartial project evaluation independent of those involved in the study should be carried out as part of the authorisation process of projects involving the use of live animals. Effective implementation of a project evaluation should also allow for an appropriate assessment of the use of any new scientific experimental techniques as they emerge.\n(40)\nDue to the nature of the project, the type of species used and the likelihood of achieving the desired objectives of the project, it might be necessary to carry out a retrospective assessment. Since projects may vary significantly in terms of complexity, length, and the time period for obtaining the results, it is necessary that the decision on retrospective assessment should be made taking those aspects fully into account.\n(41)\nTo ensure that the public is informed, it is important that objective information concerning projects using live animals is made publicly available. This should not violate proprietary rights or expose confidential information. Therefore, users should provide anonymous non-technical summaries of those projects, which Member States should publish. The published details should not breach the anonymity of the users.\n(42)\nTo manage risks to human and animal health and the environment, the legislation of the Union provides that substances and products can be marketed only after appropriate safety and efficacy data have been submitted. Some of those requirements can be fulfilled only by resorting to animal testing, hereinafter referred to as â€˜regulatory testingâ€™. It is necessary to introduce specific measures in order to increase the use of alternative approaches and to eliminate unnecessary duplication of regulatory testing. For that purpose Member States should recognise the validity of test data produced using test methods provided for under the legislation of the Union.\n(43)\nTo reduce the administrative workload and enhance the competitiveness of research and industry in the Union, it should be possible to authorise multiple generic projects when carried out using established methods for testing, diagnostic or production purposes under one group authorisation, albeit without exempting any of these procedures from the project evaluation.\n(44)\nTo ensure effective examination of authorisation applications and to enhance the competitiveness of research and industry in the Union, a time-limit should be set for the competent authorities to evaluate project proposals and take decisions on the authorisation of such projects. In order not to compromise the quality of the project evaluation, additional time might be required for more complex project proposals due to the number of disciplines involved, the novel characteristics and more complex techniques of the proposed project. However, the extension of deadlines for project evaluation should remain the exception.\n(45)\nGiven the routine or repetitive nature of certain procedures, it is appropriate to provide for a regulatory option whereby the Member States could introduce a simplified administrative procedure for the evaluation of projects containing such procedures, provided certain requirements laid down in this Directive are complied with.\n(46)\nThe availability of alternative methods is highly dependent on the progress of the research into the development of alternatives. The Community Framework Programmes for Research and Technological Development provided increasing funding for projects which aim to replace, reduce and refine the use of animals in procedures. In order to increase competitiveness of research and industry in the Union and to replace, reduce and refine the use of animals in procedures, the Commission and the Member States should contribute through research and by other means to the development and validation of alternative approaches.\n(47)\nThe European Centre for the Validation of Alternative Methods, a policy action within the Joint Research Centre of the Commission, has coordinated the validation of alternative approaches in the Union since 1991. However, there is an increasing need for new methods to be developed and proposed for validation, which requires a reference laboratory of the Union for the validation of alternative methods to be established formally. This laboratory should be referred to as the European Centre for the Validation of Alternative Methods (ECVAM). It is necessary for the Commission to cooperate with the Member States when setting priorities for validation studies. The Member States should assist the Commission in identifying and nominating suitable laboratories to carry out such validation studies. For validation studies that are similar to previously validated methods and in respect of which a validation represents a significant competitive advantage, ECVAM should be able to collect charges from those who submit their methods for validation. Such charges should not be prohibitive of healthy competition in the testing industry.\n(48)\nThere is a need to ensure a coherent approach to project evaluation and review strategies at national level. Member States should establish national committees for the protection of animals used for scientific purposes to give advice to the competent authorities and animal-welfare bodies in order to promote the principles of replacement, reduction and refinement. A network of national committees should play a role in the exchange of best practice at the level of the Union.\n(49)\nTechnical and scientific advancements in biomedical research can be rapid, as can the increase in knowledge of factors influencing animal welfare. It is therefore necessary to provide for a review of this Directive. Such review should examine the possible replacement of the use of animals, and in particular non-human primates, as a matter of priority where it is possible, taking into account the advancement of science. The Commission should also conduct periodic thematic reviews concerning the replacement, reduction and refinement of the use of animals in procedures.\n(50)\nIn order to ensure uniform conditions for implementation, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission to adopt guidelines at the level of the Union on the requirements with regard to education, training and competence of breedersâ€™, suppliersâ€™ and usersâ€™ staff, to adopt detailed rules regarding the Union Reference Laboratory, its duties and tasks and the charges it may collect, to establish a common format for submitting the information by Member States to the Commission on the implementation of this Directive, statistical information and other specific information, and for the application of safeguard clauses. According to Article 291 TFEU, rules and general principles concerning mechanisms for the control by Member States of the Commissionâ€™s exercise of implementing powers shall be laid down in advance by a regulation adopted in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure. Pending the adoption of that new regulation, Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission (6) continues to apply, with the exception of the regulatory procedure with scrutiny, which is not applicable.\n(51)\nThe Commission should be empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 TFEU in respect of the following: modifications of the list of species falling under the obligation of being specifically bred for use in procedures; modifications of the care and accommodation standards; modifications of methods of killing, including their specifications; modifications of the elements to be used for the establishment by Member States of requirements with regard to education, training and competence of breedersâ€™, suppliersâ€™ and usersâ€™ personnel; modifications of certain obligatory elements of the application for authorisation; modifications regarding the Union Reference Laboratory, its duties and tasks; as well as modifications of examples of different types of procedures assigned to each of the severity categories on the basis of factors related to the type of procedure. It is of particular importance that the Commission carry out appropriate consultation during its preparatory work, including at expert level.\n(52)\nMember States should lay down rules on penalties applicable to infringements of the provisions of this Directive and ensure that they are implemented. Those penalties should be effective, proportionate and dissuasive.\n(53)\nDirective 86/609/EEC should therefore be repealed. Certain modifications introduced by this Directive have a direct impact on the application of Regulation (EC) No 1069/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 October 2009 laying down health rules as regards animal by-products and derived products not intended for human consumption (7). It is therefore appropriate to amend a provision of that Regulation accordingly.\n(54)\nBenefits to animal welfare from applying project authorisation retrospectively, and the related administrative costs, can only be justified for long term ongoing projects. Therefore, it is necessary to include transitional measures for ongoing short and medium term projects to avoid the need for retrospective authorisation with only limited benefits.\n(55)\nIn accordance with paragraph 34 of the Interinstitutional Agreement on better law-making, Member States are encouraged to draw up, for themselves and in the interests of the Union, their own tables, which will, as far as possible, illustrate the correlation between this Directive and the transposition measures, and to make them public.\n(56)\nSince the objective of this Directive, namely the harmonisation of legislation concerning the use of animals for scientific purposes, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore, by reason of its scale and effects, be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Directive does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve that objective,\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:\nCHAPTER I\nGENERAL PROVISIONS\nArticle 1\nSubject matter and scope\n1.   This Directive establishes measures for the protection of animals used for scientific or educational purposes.\nTo that end, it lays down rules on the following:\n(a)\nthe replacement and reduction of the use of animals in procedures and the refinement of the breeding, accommodation, care and use of animals in procedures;\n(b)\nthe origin, breeding, marking, care and accommodation and killing of animals;\n(c)\nthe operations of breeders, suppliers and users;\n(d)\nthe evaluation and authorisation of projects involving the use of animals in procedures.\n2.

Member States may, while observing the general rules laid down in the TFEU, maintain provisions in force on 9 November 2010, aimed at ensuring more extensive protection of animals falling within the scope of this Directive than those contained in this Directive.\nBefore 1 January 2013 Member States shall inform the Commission about such national provisions. The Commission shall bring them to the attention of other Member States.\n2.   When acting pursuant to paragraph 1, a Member State shall not prohibit or impede the supply or use of animals bred or kept in another Member State in accordance with this Directive, nor shall it prohibit or impede the placing on the market of products developed with the use of such animals in accordance with this Directive.\nArticle 3\nDefinitions\nFor the purposes of this Directive the following definitions shall apply:\n1.\nâ€˜procedureâ€™ means any use, invasive or non-invasive, of an animal for experimental or other scientific purposes, with known or unknown outcome, or educational purposes, which may cause the animal a level of pain, suffering, distress or lasting harm equivalent to, or higher than, that caused by the introduction of a needle in accordance with good veterinary practice.\nThis includes any course of action intended, or liable, to result in the birth or hatching of an animal or the creation and maintenance of a genetically modified animal line in any such condition, but excludes the killing of animals solely for the use of their organs or tissues;\n2.\nâ€˜projectâ€™ means a programme of work having a defined scientific objective and involving one or more procedures;\n3.\nâ€˜establishmentâ€™ means any installation, building, group of buildings or other premises and may include a place that is not wholly enclosed or covered and mobile facilities;\n4.\nâ€˜breederâ€™ means any natural or legal person breeding animals referred to in Annex I with a view to their use in procedures or for the use of their tissue or organs for scientific purposes, or breeding other animals primarily for those purposes, whether for profit or not;\n5.\nâ€˜supplierâ€™ means any natural or legal person, other than a breeder, supplying animals with a view to their use in procedures or for the use of their tissue or organs for scientific purposes, whether for profit or not;\n6.\nâ€˜userâ€™ means any natural or legal person using animals in procedures, whether for profit or not;\n7.\nâ€˜competent authorityâ€™ means an authority or authorities or bodies designated by a Member State to carry out the obligations arising from this Directive.\nArticle 4\nPrinciple of replacement, reduction and refinement\n1.   Member States shall ensure that, wherever possible, a scientifically satisfactory method or testing strategy, not entailing the use of live animals, shall be used instead of a procedure.\n2.   Member States shall ensure that the number of animals used in projects is reduced to a minimum without compromising the objectives of the project.\n3.   Member States shall ensure refinement of breeding, accommodation and care, and of methods used in procedures, eliminating or reducing to the minimum any possible pain, suffering, distress or lasting harm to the animals.\n4.   This Article shall, in the choice of methods, be implemented in accordance with Article 13.\nArticle 5\nPurposes of procedures\nProcedures may be carried out for the following purposes only:\n(a)\nbasic research;\n(b)\ntranslational or applied research with any of the following aims:\n(i)\nthe avoidance, prevention, diagnosis or treatment of disease, ill-health or other abnormality or their effects in human beings, animals or plants;\n(ii)\nthe assessment, detection, regulation or modification of physiological conditions in human beings, animals or plants; or\n(iii)\nthe welfare of animals and the improvement of the production conditions for animals reared for agricultural purposes;\n(c)\nfor any of the aims in point (b) in the development, manufacture or testing of the quality, effectiveness and safety of drugs, foodstuffs and feed-stuffs and other substances or products;\n(d)\nprotection of the natural environment in the interests of the health or welfare of human beings or animals;\n(e)\nresearch aimed at preservation of the species;\n(f)\nhigher education, or training for the acquisition, maintenance or improvement of vocational skills;\n(g)\nforensic inquiries.\nArticle 6\nMethods of killing\n1.

Member States shall ensure that animals are killed in the establishment of a breeder, supplier or user, by a competent person.\nHowever, in the case of a field study an animal may be killed by a competent person outside of an establishment.\n3.   In relation to the animals covered by Annex IV, the appropriate method of killing as set out in that Annex shall be used.\n4.   Competent authorities may grant exemptions from the requirement in paragraph 3:\n(a)\nto allow the use of another method provided that, on the basis of scientific evidence, the method is considered to be at least as humane; or\n(b)\nwhen, on the basis of scientific justification, the purpose of the procedure cannot be achieved by the use of a method of killing set out in Annex IV.\n5.   Paragraphs 2 and 3 shall not apply where an animal has to be killed in emergency circumstances for animal-welfare, public-health, public-security, animal-health or environmental reasons.\nCHAPTER II\nPROVISIONS ON THE USE OF CERTAIN ANIMALS IN PROCEDURES\nArticle 7\nEndangered species\n1.   Specimens of those endangered species listed in Annex A to Council Regulation (EC) No 338/97 of 9 December 1996 on the protection of species of wild fauna and flora by regulating trade therein (9), which do not fall within the scope of Article 7(1) of that Regulation, shall not be used in procedures, with the exception of those procedures meeting the following conditions:\n(a)\nthe procedure has one of the purposes referred to in points (b)(i), (c) or (e) of Article 5 of this Directive; and\n(b)\nthere is scientific justification to the effect that the purpose of the procedure cannot be achieved by the use of species other than those listed in that Annex.\n2.   Paragraph 1 shall not apply to any species of non-human primates.\nArticle 8\nNon-human primates\n1.   Subject to paragraph 2, specimens of non-human primates shall not be used in procedures, with the exception of those procedures meeting the following conditions:\n(a)\nthe procedure has one of the purposes referred to in\n(i)\npoints (b)(i) or (c) of Article 5 of this Directive and is undertaken with a view to the avoidance, prevention, diagnosis or treatment of debilitating or potentially life-threatening clinical conditions in human beings; or\n(ii)\npoints (a) or (e) of Article 5;\nand\n(b)\nthere is scientific justification to the effect that the purpose of the procedure cannot be achieved by the use of species other than non-human primates.\nA debilitating clinical condition for the purposes of this Directive means a reduction in a personâ€™s normal physical or psychological ability to function.\n2.   Specimens of non-human primates listed in Annex A to Regulation (EC) No 338/97, which do not fall within the scope of Article 7(1) of that Regulation, shall not be used in procedures, with the exception of those procedures meeting the following conditions:\n(a)\nthe procedure has one of the purposes referred to in:\n(i)\npoints (b)(i) or (c) of Article 5 of this Directive and is undertaken with a view to the avoidance, prevention, diagnosis or treatment of debilitating or potentially life-threatening clinical conditions in human beings; or\n(ii)\nArticle 5(e);\nand\n(b)\nthere is scientific justification to the effect that the purpose of the procedure cannot be achieved by the use of species other than non-human primates and by the use of species not listed in that Annex.\n3.   Notwithstanding paragraphs 1 and 2, great apes shall not be used in procedures, subject to the use of the safeguard clause in Article 55(2).\nArticle 9\nAnimals taken from the wild\n1.   Animals taken from the wild shall not be used in procedures.\n2.   Competent authorities may grant exemptions from paragraph 1 on the basis of scientific justification to the effect that the purpose of the procedure cannot be achieved by the use of an animal which has been bred for use in procedures.\n3.   The capture of animals in the wild shall be carried out only by competent persons using methods which do not cause the animals avoidable pain, suffering, distress or lasting harm.\nAny animal found, at or after capture, to be injured or in poor health shall be examined by a veterinarian or another competent person and action shall be taken to minimise the suffering of the animal. Competent authorities may grant exemptions from the requirement of taking action to minimise the suffering of the animal if there is scientific justification.\nArticle 10\nAnimals bred for use in procedures\n1.   Member States shall ensure that animals belonging to the species listed in Annex I may only be used in procedures where those animals have been bred for use in procedures.\nHowever, from the dates set out in Annex II, Member States shall ensure that non-human primates listed therein may be used in procedures only where they are the offspring of non-human primates which have been bred in captivity or where they are sourced from self-sustaining colonies.\nFor the purposes of this Article a â€˜self-sustaining colonyâ€™ means a colony in which animals are bred only within the colony or sourced from other colonies but not taken from the wild, and where the animals are kept in a way that ensures that they are accustomed to humans.\nThe Commission shall, in consultation with the Member States and stakeholders, conduct a feasibility study, which shall include an animal health and welfare assessment, of the requirement laid down in the second subparagraph. The study shall be published no later than 10 November 2017. It shall be accompanied, where appropriate, by proposals for amendments to Annex II.\n2.

The physical facilities\n1.1.   Functions and general design\n(a)\nAll facilities shall be constructed so as to provide an environment which takes into account the physiological and ethological needs of the species kept in them. Facilities shall also be designed and managed to prevent access by unauthorised persons and the ingress or escape of animals.\n(b)\nEstablishments shall have an active maintenance programme to prevent and remedy any defect in buildings or equipment.\n1.2.   Holding rooms\n(a)\nEstablishments shall have a regular and efficient cleaning schedule for the rooms and shall maintain satisfactory hygienic standards.\n(b)\nWalls and floors shall be surfaced with a material resistant to the heavy wear and tear caused by the animals and the cleaning process. The material shall not be detrimental to the health of the animals and shall be such that the animals cannot hurt themselves. Additional protection shall be given to any equipment or fixtures so that they are not damaged by the animals nor do they cause injury to the animals themselves.\n(c)\nSpecies that are incompatible, for example predator and prey, or animals requiring different environmental conditions, shall not be housed in the same room nor, in the case of predator and prey, within sight, smell or sound of each other.\n1.3.   General and special purpose procedure rooms\n(a)\nEstablishments shall, where appropriate, have available laboratory facilities for the carrying out of simple diagnostic tests, post-mortem examinations, and/or the collection of samples that are to be subjected to more extensive laboratory investigations elsewhere. General and special purpose procedure rooms shall be available for situations where it is undesirable to carry out the procedures or observations in the holding rooms.\n(b)\nFacilities shall be provided to enable newly-acquired animals to be isolated until their health status can be determined and the potential health risk to established animals assessed and minimised.\n(c)\nThere shall be accommodation for the separate housing of sick or injured animals.\n1.4.   Service rooms\n(a)\nStore-rooms shall be designed, used and maintained to safeguard the quality of food and bedding. These rooms shall be vermin and insect-proof, as far as possible. Other materials, which may be contaminated or present a hazard to animals or staff, shall be stored separately.\n(b)\nThe cleaning and washing areas shall be large enough to accommodate the installations necessary to decontaminate and clean used equipment. The cleaning process shall be arranged so as to separate the flow of clean and dirty equipment to prevent the contamination of newly-cleaned equipment.\n(c)\nEstablishments shall provide for the hygienic storage and safe disposal of carcasses and animal waste.\n(d)\nWhere surgical procedures under aseptic conditions are required there shall be provision for one or more than one suitably equipped room, and facilities provided for postoperative recovery.\n2.   The environment and control thereof\n2.1.   Ventilation and temperature\n(a)\nInsulation, heating and ventilation of the holding room shall ensure that the air circulation, dust levels, and gas concentrations are kept within limits that are not harmful to the animals housed.\n(b)\nTemperature and relative humidity in the holding rooms shall be adapted to the species and age groups housed. The temperature shall be measured and logged on a daily basis.\n(c)\nAnimals shall not be restricted to outdoor areas under climatic conditions which may cause them distress.\n2.2.   Lighting\n(a)\nWhere natural light does not provide an appropriate light/dark cycle, controlled lighting shall be provided to satisfy the biological requirements of the animals and to provide a satisfactory working environment.\n(b)\nIllumination shall satisfy the needs for the performance of husbandry procedures and inspection of the animals.\n(c)\nRegular photoperiods and intensity of light adapted to the species shall be provided.\n(d)\nWhen keeping albino animals, the lighting shall be adjusted to take into account their sensitivity to light.\n2.3.   Noise\n(a)\nNoise levels including ultrasound, shall not adversely affect animal welfare.\n(b)\nEstablishments shall have alarm systems that sound outside the sensitive hearing range of the animals, where this does not conflict with their audibility to human beings.\n(c)\nHolding rooms shall where appropriate be provided with noise insulation and absorption materials.\n2.4.   Alarm systems\n(a)\nEstablishments relying on electrical or mechanical equipment for environmental control and protection, shall have a stand-by system to maintain essential services and emergency lighting systems as well as to ensure that alarm systems themselves do not fail to operate.\n(b)\nHeating and ventilation systems shall be equipped with monitoring devices and alarms.\n(c)\nClear instructions on emergency procedures shall be prominently displayed.\n3.   Care of animals\n3.1.   Health\n(a)\nEstablishments shall have a strategy in place to ensure that a health status of the animals is maintained that safeguards animal welfare and meets scientific requirements. This strategy shall include regular health monitoring, a microbiological surveillance programme and plans for dealing with health breakdowns and shall define health parameters and procedures for the introduction of new animals.\n(b)\nAnimals shall be checked at least daily by a competent person. These checks shall ensure that all sick or injured animals are identified and appropriate action is taken.\n3.2.   Animals taken from the wild\n(a)\nTransport containers and means of transport adapted to the species concerned shall be available at capture sites, in case animals need to be moved for examination or treatment.\n(b)\nSpecial consideration shall be given and appropriate measures taken for the acclimatisation, quarantine, housing, husbandry, care of animals taken from the wild and, as appropriate, provisions for setting them free at the end of procedures.\n3.3.   Housing and enrichment\n(a)   Housing\nAnimals, except those which are naturally solitary, shall be socially housed in stable groups of compatible individuals. In cases where single housing is allowed in accordance with article 33(3) the duration shall be limited to the minimum period necessary and visual, auditory, olfactory and/or tactile contact shall be maintained. The introduction or re-introduction of animals to established groups shall be carefully monitored to avoid problems of incompatibility and disrupted social relationships.\n(b)   Enrichment\nAll animals shall be provided with space of sufficient complexity to allow expression of a wide range of normal behaviour. They shall be given a degree of control and choice over their environment to reduce stress-induced behaviour. Establishments shall have appropriate enrichment techniques in place, to extend the range of activities available to the animals and increase their coping activities including physical exercise, foraging, manipulative and cognitive activities, as appropriate to the species. Environmental enrichment in animal enclosures shall be adapted to the species and individual needs of the animals concerned. The enrichment strategies in establishments shall be regularly reviewed and updated.\n(c)   Animal enclosures\nAnimal enclosures shall not be made out of materials detrimental to the health of the animals. Their design and construction shall be such that no injury to the animals is caused. Unless they are disposable, they shall be made from materials that will withstand cleaning and decontamination techniques. The design of animal enclosure floors shall be adapted to the species and age of the animals and be designed to facilitate the removal of excreta.\n3.4.   Feeding\n(a)\nThe form, content and presentation of the diet shall meet the nutritional and behavioural needs of the animal.\n(b)\nThe animalsâ€™ diet shall be palatable and non-contaminated. In the selection of raw materials, production, preparation and presentation of feed, establishments shall take measures to minimise chemical, physical and microbiological contamination.\n(c)\nPacking, transport and storage shall be such as to avoid contamination, deterioration or destruction. All feed hoppers, troughs or other utensils used for feeding shall be regularly cleaned and, if necessary, sterilised.\n(d)\nEach animal shall be able to access the food, with sufficient feeding space provided to limit competition.\n3.5.   Watering\n(a)\nUncontaminated drinking water shall always be available to all animals.\n(b)\nWhen automatic watering systems are used, they shall be regularly checked, serviced and flushed to avoid accidents. If solid-bottomed cages are used, care shall be taken to minimise the risk of flooding.\n(c)\nProvision shall be made to adapt the water supply for aquaria and tanks to the needs and tolerance limits of the individual fish, amphibian and reptile species.\n3.6.   Resting and sleeping areas\n(a)\nBedding materials or sleeping structures adapted to the species shall always be provided, including nesting materials or structures for breeding animals.\n(b)\nWithin the animal enclosure, as appropriate to the species, a solid, comfortable resting area for all animals shall be provided. All sleeping areas shall be kept clean and dry.\n3.7.   Handling\nEstablishments shall set up habituation and training programmes suitable for the animals, the procedures and length of the project.\nSection B:   Species-specific section\n1.   Mice, rats, gerbils, hamsters and guinea pigs\nIn this and subsequent tables for mice, rats, gerbils, hamsters and guinea pigs, â€˜enclosure heightâ€™ means the vertical distance between the enclosure floor and the top of the enclosure and this height applies over more than 50 % of the minimum enclosure floor area prior to the addition of enrichment devices.\nWhen designing procedures, consideration shall be given to the potential growth of the animals to ensure adequate space is provided (as detailed in Tables 1.1 to 1.5) for the duration of the study.\nTable 1.1.\nMice\nBody weight\n(g)\nMinimum enclosure size\n(cm2)\nFloor area per animal\n(cm2)\nMinimum enclosure height\n(cm)\nDate referred to in Article 33(2)\nIn stock and during procedures\nup to 20\n330\n60\n12\n1 January 2017\nover 20 to 25\n330\n70\n12\nover 25 to 30\n330\n80\n12\nover 30\n330\n100\n12\nBreeding\n330\nFor a monogamous pair (outbred/inbred) or a trio (inbred).

Fish\n11.1.   Water supply and quality\nAdequate water supply of suitable quality shall be provided at all times. Water flow in re-circulatory systems or filtration within tanks shall be sufficient to ensure that water quality parameters are maintained within acceptable levels. Water supply shall be filtered or treated to remove substances harmful to fish, where necessary. Water-quality parameters shall at all times be within the acceptable range that sustains normal activity and physiology for a given species and stage of development. The water flow shall be appropriate to enable fish to swim correctly and to maintain normal behaviour. Fish shall be given an appropriate time for acclimatisation and adaptation to changes in water-quality conditions.\n11.2.   Oxygen, nitrogen compounds, pH, and salinity\nOxygen concentration shall be appropriate to the species and to the context in which the fish are held. Where necessary, supplementary aeration of tank water shall be provided. The concentrations of nitrogen compounds shall be kept low.\nThe pH level shall be adapted to the species and kept as stable as possible. The salinity shall be adapted to the requirements of the fish species and to the life stage of the fish. Changes in salinity shall take place gradually.\n11.3.   Temperature, lighting, noise\nTemperature shall be maintained within the optimal range for the fish species concerned and kept as stable as possible. Changes in temperature shall take place gradually. Fish shall be maintained on an appropriate photoperiod. Noise levels shall be kept to a minimum and, where possible, equipment causing noise or vibration, such as power generators or filtration systems, shall be separate from the fish-holding tanks.\n11.4.   Stocking density and environmental complexity\nThe stocking density of fish shall be based on the total needs of the fish in respect of environmental conditions, health and welfare. Fish shall have sufficient water volume for normal swimming, taking account of their size, age, health and feeding method. Fish shall be provided with an appropriate environmental enrichment, such as hiding places or bottom substrate, unless behavioural traits suggest none is required.\n11.5.   Feeding and handling\nFish shall be fed a diet suitable for the fish at an appropriate feeding rate and frequency. Particular attention shall be given to feeding of larval fish during any transition from live to artificial diets. Handling of fish shall be kept to a minimum.\n(1)  Post-weaned mice may be kept at these higher stocking densities for the short period after weaning until issue, provided that the animals are housed in larger enclosures with adequate enrichment, and these housing conditions do not cause any welfare deficit such as increased levels of aggression, morbidity or mortality, stereotypes and other behavioural deficits, weight loss, or other physiological or behavioural stress responses.\n(2)  In long-term studies, if space allowances per individual animal fall below those indicated above towards the end of such studies, priority shall be given to maintaining stable social structures.\n(3)  Post-weaned rats may be kept at these higher stocking densities for the short period after weaning until issue, provided that the animals are housed in larger enclosures with adequate enrichment, and these housing conditions do not cause any welfare deficit such as increased levels of aggression, morbidity or mortality, stereotypes and other behavioural deficits, weight loss, or other physiological or behavioural stress responses.\n(4)  Post-weaned hamsters may be kept at these higher stocking densities, for the short period after weaning until issue provided that the animals are housed in larger enclosures with adequate enrichment, and these housing conditions do not cause any welfare deficit such as increased levels of aggression, morbidity or mortality, stereotypes and other behavioural deficits, weight loss, or other physiological or behavioural stress responses.\n(5)  Council Directive 98/58/EC of 20 July 1998 concerning the protection of animals kept for farming purposes (OJ L 221, 8.8.1998, p. 23).\n(6)  Floor area excluding shelves.\n(7)  Animals shall be kept singly only in exceptional circumstances.\n(8)  The top of the enclosure shall be at least 1,8 m from the floor.\n(9)  Animals shall be kept singly only in exceptional circumstances.\n(10)  Animals shall be kept singly only in exceptional circumstances.\n(11)  An enclosure of minimum dimensions may hold up to three animals.\n(12)  An enclosure of minimum dimensions may hold up to two animals.\n(13)  In breeding colonies no additional space/volume allowance is required for young animals up to 2 years of age housed with their mother.\n(14)  Animals shall be kept singly only in exceptional circumstances.\n(15)  An enclosure of minimum dimensions may hold up to 2 animals.\n(16)  In breeding colonies no additional space/volume allowance is required for young animals up to 2 years of age housed with their mothers.\n(17)  Council Directive 91/629/EEC of 19 November 1991 laying down minimum standards for the protection of calves (OJ L 340, 11.12.1991, p. 28).\n(18)  Council Directive 91/630/EEC of 19 November 1991 laying down minimum standards for the protection of pigs (OJ L 340, 11.12.1991, p. 33).\n(19)  Pigs may be confined in smaller enclosures for short periods of time, for example by partitioning the main enclosure using dividers, when justified on veterinary or experimental grounds, for example where individual food consumption is required.\n(20)  To ensure adequate space is provided, space allowances for each individual animal shall be based on height to withers (WH).\n(21)  Council Directive 1999/74/EC of 19 July 1999 laying down minimum standards for the protection of laying hens (OJ L 203, 3.8.1999, p. 53).\n(22)  Council Directive 2007/43/EC of 28 June 2007 laying down minimum rules for the protection of chickens kept for meat production (OJ L 182, 12.7.2007, p. 19).\n(23)  This shall include a pond of minimum area 0,5 m2 per 2 m2 enclosure with a minimum depth of 30 cm. The pond may contribute up to 50 % of the minimum enclosure size.\n(24)  Pre-fledged birds may be held in enclosures with a minimum height of 75 cm.\n(25)  Pond sizes are per 2 m2 enclosure. The pond may contribute up to 50 % of the minimum enclosure size.\n(26)  Measured from snout to vent.\n(27)  These conditions apply to holding (i.e. husbandry) tanks but not to those tanks used for natural mating and super-ovulation for reasons of efficiency, as the latter procedures require smaller individual tanks. Space requirements determined for adults in the indicated size categories; juveniles and tadpoles shall either be excluded, or dimensions altered according to the scaling principle.\n(28)  Measured from snout to vent.\n(29)  Measured from snout to vent.\n(30)  One-third land division, two-thirds water division sufficient for animals to submerge.\n(31)  Measured from the surface of the land division up to the inner part of the top of the terrarium; furthermore, the height of the enclosures shall be adapted to the interior design.\n(32)  Measured from snout to vent.\n(33)  Two-thirds land division, one-third water division sufficient for animals to submerge.\n(34)  Measured from the surface of the land division up to the inner part of the top of the terrarium; furthermore, the height of the enclosures shall be adapted to the interior design.\n(35)  Measured from snout to vent.\n(36)  Two-thirds land division, one-third pool division sufficient for animals to submerge.\n(37)  Measured from the surface of the land division up to the inner part of the top of the terrarium; furthermore, the height of the enclosures shall be adapted to the interior design.\n(38)  Measured in a straight line from the front edge to the back edge of the shell.\n(39)  Measured from snout to tail.\n(40)  Measured from the surface of the land division up to the inner part of the top of the terrarium; furthermore, the height of the enclosure shall be adapted to the interior design.\nANNEX IV\nMETHODS OF KILLING ANIMALS\n1.

development, validation, regulatory acceptance, international recognition, and application of alternative approaches.\n3.\nThe Union Reference Laboratory shall participate in the validation of alternative approaches.\nANNEX VIII\nSEVERITY CLASSIFICATION OF PROCEDURES\nThe severity of a procedure shall be determined by the degree of pain, suffering, distress or lasting harm expected to be experienced by an individual animal during the course of the procedure.\nSection I:   Severity categories\nNon-recovery:\nProcedures which are performed entirely under general anaesthesia from which the animal shall not recover consciousness shall be classified as â€˜non-recoveryâ€™.\nMild:\nProcedures on animals as a result of which the animals are likely to experience short-term mild pain, suffering or distress, as well as procedures with no significant impairment of the well-being or general condition of the animals shall be classified as â€˜mildâ€™.\nModerate:\nProcedures on animals as a result of which the animals are likely to experience short-term moderate pain, suffering or distress, or long-lasting mild pain, suffering or distress as well as procedures that are likely to cause moderate impairment of the well-being or general condition of the animals shall be classified as â€˜moderateâ€™.\nSevere:\nProcedures on animals as a result of which the animals are likely to experience severe pain, suffering or distress, or long-lasting moderate pain, suffering or distress as well as procedures, that are likely to cause severe impairment of the well-being or general condition of the animals shall be classified as â€˜severeâ€™.\nSection II:   Assignment criteria\nThe assignment of the severity category shall take into account any intervention or manipulation of an animal within a defined procedure. It shall be based on the most severe effects likely to be experienced by an individual animal after applying all appropriate refinement techniques.\nWhen assigning a procedure to a particular category, the type of procedure and a number of other factors shall be taken into account. All these factors shall be considered on a case-by-case basis.\nThe factors related to the procedure shall include:\nâ€”\ntype of manipulation, handling,\nâ€”\nnature of pain, suffering, distress or lasting harm caused by (all elements of) the procedure, and its intensity, the duration, frequency and multiplicity of techniques employed,\nâ€”\ncumulative suffering within a procedure,\nâ€”\nprevention from expressing natural behaviour including restrictions on the housing, husbandry and care standards.\nExamples are given in Section III of procedures assigned to each of the severity categories on the basis of factors related to the type of the procedure alone. They shall provide the first indication as to what classification would be the most appropriate for a certain type of procedure.\nHowever, for the purposes of the final severity classification of the procedure, the following additional factors, assessed on a case-by-case basis, shall also be taken into account:\nâ€”\ntype of species and genotype,\nâ€”\nmaturity, age and gender of the animal,\nâ€”\ntraining experience of the animal with respect to the procedure,\nâ€”\nif the animal is to be reused, the actual severity of the previous procedures,\nâ€”\nthe methods used to reduce or eliminate pain, suffering and distress, including refinement of housing, husbandry and care conditions,\nâ€”\nhumane end-points.\nSection III:\nExamples of different types of procedure assigned to each of the severity categories on the basis of factors related to the type of the procedure\n1.   Mild:\n(a)\nadministration of anaesthesia except for the sole purpose of killing;\n(b)\npharmacokinetic study where a single dose is administered and a limited number of blood samples are taken (totalling < 10 % of circulating volume) and the substance is not expected to cause any detectable adverse effect;\n(c)\nnon-invasive imaging of animals (e.g. MRI) with appropriate sedation or anaesthesia;\n(d)\nsuperficial procedures, e.g. ear and tail biopsies, non-surgical subcutaneous implantation of mini-pumps and transponders;\n(e)\napplication of external telemetry devices that cause only minor impairment to the animals or minor interference with normal activity and behaviour;\n(f)\nadministration of substances by subcutaneous, intramuscular, intraperitoneal routes, gavage and intravenously via superficial blood vessels, where the substance has no more than mild impact on the animal, and the volumes are within appropriate limits for the size and species of the animal;\n(g)\ninduction of tumours, or spontaneous tumours, that cause no detectable clinical adverse effects (e.g. small, subcutaneous, non-invasive nodules);\n(h)\nbreeding of genetically altered animals, which is expected to result in a phenotype with mild effects;\n(i)\nfeeding of modified diets, that do not meet all of the animalsâ€™ nutritional needs and are expected to cause mild clinical abnormality within the time-scale of the study;\n(j)\nshort-term (< 24h) restraint in metabolic cages;\n(k)\nstudies involving short-term deprivation of social partners, short-term solitary caging of adult rats or mice of sociable strains;\n(l)\nmodels which expose animals to noxious stimuli which are briefly associated with mild pain, suffering or distress, and which the animals can successfully avoid;\n(m)\na combination or accumulation of the following examples may result in classification as â€˜mildâ€™:\n(i)\nassessing body composition by non-invasive measures and with minimal restraint;\n(ii)\nmonitoring ECG with non-invasive techniques with minimal or no restraint of habituated animals;\n(iii)\napplication of external telemetry devices that are expected to cause no impairment to socially adapted animals and do not interfere with normal activity and behaviour;\n(iv)\nbreeding genetically altered animals which are expected to have no clinically detectable adverse phenotype;\n(v)\nadding inert markers in the diet to follow passage of digesta;\n(vi)\nwithdrawal of food for < 24h in adult rats;\n(vii)\nopen field testing.\n2.   Moderate:\n(a)\nfrequent application of test substances which produce moderate clinical effects, and withdrawal of blood samples (> 10 % of circulating volume) in a conscious animal within a few days without volume replacement;\n(b)\nacute dose-range finding studies, chronic toxicity/carcinogenicity tests, with non-lethal end-points;\n(c)\nsurgery under general anaesthesia and appropriate analgesia, associated with post surgical pain, suffering or impairment of general condition. Examples include: thoracotomy, craniotomy, laparotomy, orchidectomy, lymphadenectomy, thyroidectomy, orthopaedic surgery with effective stabilisation and wound management, organ transplantation with effective management of rejection, surgical implantation of catheters, or biomedical devices (e.g. telemetry transmitters, minipumps etc.);\n(d)\nmodels of induction of tumours, or spontaneous tumours, that are expected to cause moderate pain or distress or moderate interference with normal behaviour;\n(e)\nirradiation or chemotherapy with a sublethal dose, or with an otherwise lethal dose but with reconstitution of the immune system. Adverse effects would be expected to be mild or moderate and would be short-lived (< 5 days);\n(f)\nbreeding of genetically altered animals which are expected to result in a phenotype with moderate effects;\n(g)\ncreation of genetically altered animals through surgical procedures;\n(h)\nuse of metabolic cages involving moderate restriction of movement over a prolonged period (up to 5 days);\n(i)\nstudies with modified diets that do not meet all of the animalsâ€™ nutritional needs and are expected to cause moderate clinical abnormality within the time-scale of the study;\n(j)\nwithdrawal of food for 48 hours in adult rats;\n(k)\nevoking escape and avoidance reactions where the animal is unable to escape or avoid the stimulus, and are expected to result in moderate distress.\n3.   Severe:\n(a)\ntoxicity testing where death is the end-point, or fatalities are to be expected and severe pathophysiological states are induced. For example, single dose acute toxicity testing (see OECD testing guidelines);\n(b)\ntesting of device where failure may cause severe pain, distress or death of the animal (e.g. cardiac assist devices);\n(c)\nvaccine potency testing characterised by persistent impairment of the animalâ€™s condition, progressive disease leading to death, associated with long-lasting moderate pain, distress or suffering;\n(d)\nirradiation or chemotherapy with a lethal dose without reconstitution of the immune system, or reconstitution with production of graft versus host disease;\n(e)\nmodels with induction of tumours, or with spontaneous tumours, that are expected to cause progressive lethal disease associated with long-lasting moderate pain, distress or suffering. For example tumours causing cachexia, invasive bone tumours, tumours resulting in metastatic spread, and tumours that are allowed to ulcerate;\n(f)\nsurgical and other interventions in animals under general anaesthesia which are expected to result in severe or persistent moderate postoperative pain, suffering or distress or severe and persistent impairment of the general condition of the animals. Production of unstable fractures, thoracotomy without adequate analgesia, or trauma to produce multiple organ failure;\n(g)\norgan transplantation where organ rejection is likely to lead to severe distress or impairment of the general condition of the animals (e.g. xenotransplantation);\n(h)\nbreeding animals with genetic disorders that are expected to experience severe and persistent impairment of general condition, for example Huntingtonâ€™s disease, Muscular dystrophy, chronic relapsing neuritis models;\n(i)\nuse of metabolic cages involving severe restriction of movement over a prolonged period;\n(j)\ninescapable electric shock (e.g. to produce learned helplessness);\n(k)\ncomplete isolation for prolonged periods of social species e.g. dogs and non-human

"summary": "Protection of laboratory animals\nProtection of laboratory animals\nSUMMARY OF:\nDirective 2010/63/EU on protecting animals used for scientific purposes\nWHAT IS THE AIM OF THE DIRECTIVE?\n              \nIt sets out measures designed to protect animals used for scientific purposes, especially basic or applied research, particularly for the production of medical products.\nIt also introduces protective measures for animals used for educational purposes.\nIt replaces and repeals Directive 86/609/EEC.\nKEY POINTS\n              \nIn order to protect laboratory animals and enable research to advance further, these measures aim at limiting animal testing to an absolute minimum and setting up compulsory standards concerning their use, housing and care. High animal welfare standards benefit both the animals and science.\nScope\nThe directive applies to all live, non-human vertebrate animals and also to certain invertebrates which are likely to feel pain (cuttlefish, octopus, etc.).The use for testing of non-human primates is subject to restrictions and the use of great apes (chimpanzees, bonobos, gorillas and orang-utans) is forbidden.\nFields subject to animal testingAnimal testing is authorised only in procedures for which the purpose is:\nbasic research;\ntranslational and applied research aimed at the prevention, diagnosis or treatment of human or animal diseases;\nthe development, manufacture or testing of the quality, effectiveness and safety of drugs, food and animal feed, chemicals, etc. for any of the aims above;\nprotecting the natural environment in the interests of human or animal health;\nresearch directed at species conservation;\nhigher education or training;\nforensic investigations.\nEvaluation of projects involving experimentation on animals\nThe use of animals for experimental purposes is authorised in cases where no satisfactory substitute method exists.\nProjects involving experiments on live animals must be assessed by the competent authority. They may not begin until they have received a positive assessment, demonstrating that the use of animals is justified and that the expected advantages outweigh the harm caused to the animal, taking into account ethical considerations.\nThe number of animals used in a project must be reduced to a minimum without however compromising the objectives of the project.\nThe living conditions and methods used in the procedures must minimise any unnecessary pain, suffering or distress to the animals.\nAnimal welfare\nAnimals used for experimental purposes must:\nreceive appropriate care and treatment;\nbe housed in cages big enough for them and in an environment adapted to each species, in accordance with the standards listed in the directiveâ€™s Annex III.\nEstablishments should ensure:\nanimals are housed in cages which are big enough for them and in an environment which is adapted to each species, in accordance with the standards listed in Annex III to the directive;\nsocial animals should be housed in cages and â€˜enrichmentâ€™ techniques are used to increase the range of activities possible for the animal, particularly encouraging physical exercise, exploration and cognitive activities in line with their natural behaviour;\nthey set up an animal welfare body to provide advice on animal-welfare issues and on new ways to â€˜replace, reduce and refineâ€™ the animal use (known as the â€˜Three Rsâ€™ principle). This body should include the person responsible for the welfare of animals and be advised by a designated veterinarian. Their work is supported by national committees set up in each EU country for the protection of animals used.\nMethods of killing must limit the pain, suffering and distress felt by the animals. Animals may be killed only by a person with the required skills in the establishment of the breeder, supplier or user, in accordance with the methods listed in the directiveâ€™s Annex IV.\nMore generally, all individuals who interact with the animals should have the appropriate training and practice and should have had their competence assessed before working without supervision.\nProceduresThe only authorised procedures are those which have been approved as part of an authorised project.\nProcedures are:\nclassified according to their degree of severity, based on the directiveâ€™s Annex VIII;\nto be carried out under anaesthesia or using another method (analgesia, etc.) except if that is not appropriate or if anaesthesia is judged to be more traumatic to the animal than the procedure itself.\nAs far as possible, the life of the animal must be spared. The procedures are designed to result in the death of as few animals as possible and to reduce the duration and intensity of suffering.Reusing an animal is a way of reducing the total number of laboratory animals. Before reusing an animal, the actual severity of the cumulated procedures, the health of the animal and the opinion of the veterinarian must be taken into account.\nAt the end of a procedure, the veterinarian or a competent person must decide if the animal can be kept alive. Animals kept alive must receive appropriate care and accommodation as defined in Annex III.\nAuthorisation\nBreeders, suppliers and users and their establishments must be authorised by a competent authority and must be registered with it.Authorised establishments must have installations and equipment adapted to the species of animals housed and the performance of the procedures (where they are carried out).They should have records in which they register all developments in information on the animals, their origin and purpose. These records are kept for 5 years and made available to the public.Furthermore, each dog, cat and non-human primate must have an individual identification and history file containing relevant reproductive, veterinary and social information on the individual animal and the projects in which it has been used.\nInspections\nThe competent authorities carry out regular inspections of all breeders, suppliers and users and their establishments in order to ensure compliance with the requirements of this directive.The frequency of inspections is determined by the risks specific to each establishment. However, at least one-third of the establishments of users are inspected each year and a proportion of these are without prior warning.Breeders, suppliers and users of non-human primates are inspected at least once a year.\nTransparency\nTo ensure a better understanding of where and how animals are used, every year, EU countries must collect and make publicly available statistical information on the use of animals in procedures, including information on the actual severity of the procedures and on the origin and species of non-human primates used in procedures. This may be in the form of non-technical summaries of authorised projects which do not breach the anonymity of the users.\nFROM WHEN DOES THE DIRECTIVE APPLY?\n              \nIt entered into force on 9 November 2010 and had to apply in the EU countries from 1 January 2013.\nBACKGROUND\n              \nThe EU's ultimate objective is to put an end to experiments on animals by replacing such experiments with a substitute, non-animal, approaches. However, given current scientific knowledge, it is not yet feasible to replace all animal experiments. For this reason, the legislation seeks to ensure that the situation of animals which are still used for experiments is improved and in accordance with the rule that tests on animals must be replaced, reduced and refined wherever possible.\nFor more information, see:\nAnimals in scientific research (European Commission).\nMAIN DOCUMENT\n            \nDirective 2010/63/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 September 2010 on the protection of animals used for scientific purposes (OJ L 276, 20.10.2010, pp. 33-79)\nRELATED DOCUMENTS\n            \nCommission Implementing Decision 2012/707/EU of 14 November 2012 establishing a common format for the submission of the information pursuant to Directive 2010/63/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council on the protection of animals used for scientific purposes (OJ L 320, 17.11.2012, pp. 33-50)\nSuccessive amendments to Decision 2012/707/EU have been incorporated in the original text.
