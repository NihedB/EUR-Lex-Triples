In such cases the Contracting Party in question shall take due account of the interests of the other Contracting Party. To this end the Contracting Parties may consult each other within the Joint Committee.Article 11Protocol No 3 lays down the rules of origin.Article 12A Contracting Party which is considering the reduction of the effective level of its duties or charges having equivalent effect applicable to third countries benefiting from most favoured-nation treatment, or which is considering the suspension of their application, shall, as far as may be practicable, notify the Joint Committee not less than thirty days before such reduction or suspension comes into effect.

Such prohibitions or restrictions must not, however, constitute a means of arbitrary discrimination or a disguised restriction on trade between the Contracting Parties.Article 21Nothing in the Agreement shall prevent a Contracting Party from taking any measures:(a) which it considers necessary to prevent the disclosure of information contrary to its essential security interests;(b) which relate to trade in arms, munitions or war materials or to research, development or production indispensable for defence purposes, provided that such measures do not impair the conditions of competition in respect of products not intended for specifically military purposes;(c) which it considers essential to its own security in time of war or serious international tension.Article 221. The Contracting Parties shall refrain from any measure likely to jeopardize the fulfilment of the objectives of the Agreement.2. They shall take any general or specific measures required to fulfil their obligations under the Agreement.If either Contracting Party considers that the other Contracting Party has failed to fulfil an obligation under the Agreement, it may take appropriate measures under the conditions and in accordance with the procedures laid down in Article 27.Article 231. The following are incompatible with the proper functioning of the Agreement in so far as they may affect trade between the Community and Switzerland:(i) all agreements between undertakings, decisions by associations of undertakings and concerted practices between undertakings which have as their object or effect the prevention, restriction or distortion of competition as regards the production of or trade in goods;(ii) abuse by one or more undertakings of a dominant position in the territories of the Contracting Parties as a whole or in a substantial part thereof;(iii) any public aid which distorts or threatens to distort competition by favouring certain undertakings or the production of certain goods.2. Should a Contracting Party consider that a given practice is incompatible with this Article, it may take appropriate measures under the conditions and in accordance with the procedures laid down in Article 27.Article 24Where an increase in imports of a given product is or is likely to be seriously detrimental to any production activity carried on in the territory of one of the Contracting Parties and where this increase is due to:(i) the partial or total reduction in the importing Contracting Party, as provided for in the Agreement, of customs duties and charges having equivalent effect levied on the product in question; and(ii) the fact that the duties or charges having equivalent effect levied by the exporting Contracting Party on imports of raw materials or intermediate products used in the manufacture of the product in question are significantly lower than the corresponding duties or charges levied by the importing Contracting Party;the Contracting Party concerned may take appropriate measures under the conditions and in accordance with the procedures laid down in Article 27.Article 25If one of the Contracting Parties finds that dumping is taking place in trade with the other Contracting Party, it may take appropriate measures against this practice in accordance with the Agreement on implementation of Article VI of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, under the conditions and in accordance with the procedures laid down in Article 27.Article 26If serious disturbances arise in any sector of the economy or if difficulties arise which could bring about serious deterioration in the economic situation of a region, the Contracting Party concerned may take appropriate measures under the conditions and in accordance with the procedures laid down in Article 27.Article 271. In the event of a Contracting Party subjecting imports of products liable to give rise to the difficulties referred to in Articles 24 and 26 to an administrative procedure, the purpose of which is to provide rapid information on the trend of trade flows, it shall inform the other Contracting Party.2. In the cases specified in Articles 22 to 26, before taking the measures provided for therein or, in cases to which paragraph 3(d) applies, as soon as pos sible the Contracting Party in question shall supply the Joint Committee with all relevant information required for a thorough examination of the situation with a view to seeking a solution acceptable to the Contracting Parties.In the selection of measures, priority must be given to those which least disturb the functioning of the Agreement.The safeguard measures shall be notified immediately to the Joint Committee and shall be the subject of periodical consultations within the Committee, particularly with a view to their abolition as soon as circumstances permit.3. For the implementation of paragraph 2, the following provisions shall apply:(a) As regards Article 23, either Contracting Party may refer the matter to the Joint Committee if it considers that a given practice is incompatible with the proper functioning of the Agreement within the meaning of Article 23 (1).The Contracting Parties shall provide the Joint Committee with all relevant information and shall give it the assistance it requires in order to examine the case and, where appropriate, to eliminate the practice objected to.If the Contracting Party in question fails to put an end to the practice objected to within the period fixed by the Joint Committee, or in the absence of agreement in the Joint Committee within three months of the matter being referred to it, the Contracting Party concerned may adopt any safeguard measures it considers necessary to deal with the serious difficulties resulting from the practices in question; in particular it may withdraw tariff concessions.(b) As regards Article 24, the difficulties arising from the situation referred to in that Article shall be referred for examination to the Joint Committee, which may take any decision needed to put an end to such difficulties.If the Joint Committee or the exporting Contracting Party has not taken a decision putting an end to the difficulties within thirty days of the matter being referred, the importing Contracting Party is authorized to levy a compensatory charge on the product imported.The compensatory charge shall be calculated according to the incidence on the value of the goods in question of the tariff disparities in respect of the raw materials or intermediate products incorporated therein.(c) As regards Article 25, consultation in the Joint Committee shall take place before the Contracting Party concerned takes the appropriate measures.(d) Where exceptional circumstances requiring immediate action make prior examination impossible, the Contracting Party concerned may, in the situations specified in Articles 24, 25 and 26 and also in the case of export aids having a direct and immediate incidence on trade, apply forthwith the precautionary measures strictly necessary to remedy the situation.Article 28Where one or more Member States of the Community or Switzerland is in difficulties or is seriously threatened with difficulties as regards its balance of payments, the Contracting Party concerned may take the necessary safeguard measures. It shall inform the other Contracting Party forthwith.Article 291. A Joint Committee is hereby established, which shall be responsible for the administration of the Agreement and shall ensure its proper implementation.

This condition shall not apply, however, to products which, within the meaning of this Protocol, originate in Switzerland;2. products originating in Switzerland:(a) products wholly obtained in Switzerland,(b) products obtained in Switzerland in the manufacture of which products other than those referred to in (a) are used, provided that the said products have undergone sufficient working or processing within the meaning of Article 5. This condition shall not apply, however, to products which, within the meaning of this Protocol, originate in the Community.The products in List C shall be temporarily excluded from the scope of this Protocol.Article 21. Inasmuch as trade between the Community and Austria, Finland, Iceland, Portugal and Sweden and between Switzerland and the latter five countries and also between each of those five countries themselves is governed by agreements containing rules identical to those in this Protocol, the following products shall also be considered as:A. products originating in the Community: those products referred to in Article 1(1) which, after being exported from the Community, have undergone no working or processing in any of those five countries or have not undergone sufficient working or processing there to confer on them the status of products originating in any of those countries by virtue of provisions corresponding to those of Article l(l)(b) or (2)(b) of this Protocol contained in the agreements referred to above, provided that:(a) only products originating in any of those five countries or in the Community or in Switzerland have been used in the course of the working or processing,(b) where a percentage rule limits, in the Lists A or B referred to in Article 5, the proportion in value of non-originating products that can be incorporated under certain cirumstances, the added value has been acquired in each of the countries in accordance with the percentage rules and with the other rules contained in the said lists without any possibility of cumulation from one country to another;B. products originating in Switzerland: those products referred to in Article 1(2) which, after being exported from Switzerland, have undergone no working or processing in any one of these five countries or have undergone working or processing insufficient to confer on them the status of products originating in any of those countries by virtue of provisions corresponding to those of Article l(l)(b) or (2)(b) of this Protocol contained in the agreements referred to above, provided that:(a) only products originating in any one of those five countries or in the Community or in Switzerland have been used in the course of the working or processing,(b) where a percentage rule limits, in the Lists A or B referred to in Article 5, the proportion in value of non-originating products that can be incorporated under certain circumstances, the added value has been acquired in each of the countries in accordance with the percentage rules and with the other rules contained in the said lists without any possibility of cumulation from one country to another.2. For the purpose of implementing paragraph 1(A)(a) and (B)(a), the fact that products other than those referred to in that paragraph are used in a proportion not exceeding in total value 5 % of the value of the products obtained and imported into Switzerland or the Community does not affect the determination of origin of the latter products, provided that they would not have caused the products exported from the Community or Switzerland in the first place to lose their status of products originating in the Community or in Switzerland had they been incorporated there.3. In the cases referred to in paragraph l(A)(b) and (B)(b) and paragraph 2, no non-originating product may be incorporated if it only undergoes the working or processing provided for in Article 5(3).Article 3Notwithstanding the provisions of Article 2 and provided that all the conditions laid down in that article are nevertheless fulfilled, the products obtained shall not continue to be considered as products originating in the Community or in Switzerland respectively unless the value of the products worked or processed originating in the Community or in Switzerland represents the highest percentage of the value of the products obtained. If this is not so, the latter products are considered as originating in the country where the added value acquired represents the highest percentage of their value.Article 4The following shall be considered as wholly obtained either in the Community or in Switzerland within the meaning of Article l(l)(a) and (2)(a):(a) Mineral products extracted from their soil or from their seabed;(b) Vegetable products harvested there;(c) Live animals born and raised there;(d) Products from live animals raised there;(e) Products obtained by hunting or fishing conducted there;(f) Products of sea fishing and other products taken from the sea by their vessels;(g) Products made aboard their factory ships exclusively from products referred to in subparagraph (f);(h) Used articles collected there fit only for the recovery of raw materials;(i) Waste and scrap resulting from manufacturing operations conducted there;(j) Goods produced there exclusively from products specified in subparagraphs (a) to (i).Article 51. For the purpose of implementing Article 1(1) (b) and (2)(b) the following shall be considered as sufficient working or processing:(a) working or processing as a result of which the goods obtained receive a classification under a tariff heading other than that covering each of the products worked or processed, except, however, working or processing specified in List A, where the special provisions of that list apply;(b) working or processing specified in List B.\"Sections\", \"Chapters\" and \"tariff headings\" shall mean the Sections, Chapters and tariff headings in the Brussels Nomenclature for the Classification of Goods in Customs Tariffs.2. When, for a given product obtained, a percentage rule limits in List A and in List B the value of the materials and parts which can be used, the total value of these materials and parts, whether or not they have changed tariff heading in the course of the working, processing or assembly within the limits and under the conditions laid down in each of those two lists, may not exceed, in relation to the value of the product obtained, the value corresponding either to the common rate, if the rates are identical in both lists, or to the higher of the two if they are different.3. For the purpose of implementing Article l(l)(b) and (2)(b), the following shall still be considered as insufficient working or processing to confer the status of originating product, whether or not there is a change of tariff heading:(a) operations to ensure the preservation of merchandise in good condition during transport and storage (ventilation, spreading out, drying, chilling, placing in salt, sulphur dioxide or other aqueous solutions, removal of damaged parts, and like operations);(b) simple operations consisting of removal of dust, sifting or screening, sorting, classifying, matching (including the making up of sets of articles), washing, painting, cutting up;(c) (i) changes of packing and breaking up and assembly of consignments;(ii) simple placing in bottles, flasks, bags, cases, boxes, fixing on cards or boards, etc., and all other simple packing operations;(d) affixing marks, labels or other like distinguishing signs on products or their packaging;(e) simple mixing of products, whether or not ofdifferent kinds, where one or more components of the mixtures do not meet the conditions laid down in this Protocol to enable them to be considered as originating either in the Community or in Switzerland;(f) simple assembly of parts of articles to constitute a complete article;(g) a combination of two or more operations specified in subparagraphs (a) to (f);(h) slaughter of animals.Article 61. Where the Lists A and B referred to in Article 5 provide that goods obtained in the Community or in Switzerland shall be considered as originating therein only if the value of the products worked or processed does not exceed a given percentage of the value of the goods obtained, the values to be taken into consideration for determining such percentage shall be:- on the one hand,as regards products whose importation can be proved: their customs value at the time of importation;as regards products of undetermined origin: the earliest ascertainable price paid for such products in the territory of the Contracting Party where manufacture takes place;- and on tne other hand,the ex-works price of the goods obtained, less internal taxes refunded or refundable on exportation.This Article also applies for the implementation of Articles 2 and 3.2. Where Articles 2 and 3 apply, \"added value acquired\" shall be understood as meaning the difference between the ex-works price of the goods obtained, less internal taxes refunded or refundable on exportation from the country concerned or from the Community and the customs value of all the products imported and worked or processed in that country or in the Community.Article 7Goods originating in Switzerland or in the Community and constituting one single shipment which is not split up may be transported through territory other than that of the Community, Switzerland, Austria, Finland, Iceland, Portugal or Sweden, with should the occasion arise, transhipment or temporary warehousing in such territory, provided that the crossing of the latter territory is justified for geographical reasons, that the goods have remained under the surveillance of the Customs authorities in the country of transit or of warehousing, that they have not entered into the commerce of such countries nor been delivered for home use there and have not undergone operations other than unloading, reloading or any operation designed to preserve them in good condition.TITLE IIArrangements for administrative cooperationArticle 81. Originating products within the meaning of Article 1 of this Protocol shall, on import into the Community or into Switzerland, benefit from the provisions of the Agreement upon submission of an A.CH.l movement certificate, a specimen of which is given in Annex V to this Protocol, issued by the Customs authorities of Switzerland or of the Member States of the Community.2. Where Article 2 and, where appropriate, Article 3 are applied A.W.1 movement certificates, a specimen of which is given in Annex VI to this Protocol, shall be used. They shall be issued by the Customs authorities of each of the countries concerned where the goods have either been held before their re-exportation in the same state or undergone the working or processing referred to in Article 2, upon presentation of the movement certificates issued previously.3. In order that the Customs authorities may satisfy themselves as to the conditions in which the goods have been kept in the territory of each of the countries concerned in cases where they have not been placed in a bonded warehouse and are to be re-exported in the same state, the movement certificates issued earlier and presented on importation of the goods shall, at the request of the holder of the goods, be duly endorsed at the time of importation and thereafter every six months by the said authorities.4.

The Community and Switzerland shall admit goods sent as small packages to private persons or forming part of travellers' personal luggage, as originating products benefiting from the Agreement without requiring the production of a movement certificate provided that such goods are not imported by way of trade and have been declared as meeting the conditions required for the application of these provisions, and where there is no doubt as to the veracity of such declaration.2. Importations which are occasional and consist solely of goods for the personal use of the recipients or travellers or their families shall not be considered as importations by way of trade if it is evident from the nature and quantity of the goods that no commercial purpose is in view. Furthermore, the total value of these goods must not exceed 60 units of account in the case of small packages or 200 units of account in the case of the contents of travellers' personal luggage.3. The unit of account (UA) has a value of 0,88867088 grams of fine gold. Should the unit of account be changed, the Contracting Parties shall make contact with each other at Joint Committee level to re-define the value in terms of gold.Article 151. Goods sent from the Community or from Switzerland for exhibition in a country other thanthose referred to in Article 2 and sold after the exhibition for importation into Switzerland or into the Community shall benefit on importation from the provisions of the Agreement on condition that the goods meet the requirements of this Protocol entitling them to be recognized as originating in the Community or in Switzerland and provided that it is shown to the satisfaction of the Customs authorities that:(a) an exporter has consigned these goods from the Community or from Switzerland to the country in which the exhibition is held and has exhibited them there;(b) the goods have been sold or otherwise disposed of by that exporter to someone in Switzerland or in the Community;(c) the goods have been consigned during the exhibition or immediately thereafter to Switzerland or to the Community in the state in which they were sent for exhibition;(d) the goods have not, since they were consigned for exhibition, been used for any purpose other than demonstration at the exhibition.2.

This rule does not, however, apply where the products used are those referred to in Article 25(1) of this Protocol.4. In this and the following articles, the term \"customs duties\" also means charges having an effect equivalent to customs duties.Article 241. Movement certificates may, where appropriate, be required to indicate that the products to which they relate have acquired the status of originating products and have undergone any additional processing solely in Switzerland or in Denmark, Norway, the United Kingdom or the other five countries specified in Article 2 of this Protocol until the dare from which the customs duties applicable to the said products are abolished between the Community as originally constituted and Ireland on the one hand, and Switzerland on the other hand.2.

For the purpose of implementing Article 2(1) (B) of this Protocol, any product originating in one of the five countries referred to in that Article shall be treated as a non-originating product during the period or periods in which the Community applies the rate of duty applicable to third countries to that product in respect of the said country under the Agreement concluded by the Community with that country.Article 28The Joint Committee may decide to amend the provisions of Title I, Article 5(3), of Title II, of Title III, Articles 23, 24 and 25 and of Annexes I, II, III, V and VI to this Protocol. It shall, in particular, be authorized to take any measures necessary to adapt them to the particular requirements of specific goods or certain forms of transport.--------------------------------------------------ANNEX IEXPLANATORY NOTESNote 1 — Article 1The terms \"the Community\" or \"Switzerland\" shall also cover the territorial waters of the Member States of the Community or of Switzerland respectively.Vessels operating on the high seas, including factory ships, on which the fish caught is worked or processed shall be considered as part of the territory of the State to which they belong provided that they satisfy the conditions set out in Explanatory Note 5.Note 2 — Articles 1, 2 and 3In order to determine whether goods originate in a Member State or in Switzerland or in one of the countries specified in Article 2, it shall not be necessary to establish whether the power and fuel, plant and equipment, and machines and tools used to obtain such goods originate in third countries or not.Note 3 — Articles 2 and 5For the purpose of implementing the provisions of Article 2 paragraph 1 (A) (b) and (B) (b), the percentage rule must be observed by referring, for the added value acquired, to the provisions contained in Lists A and B. Where the product obtained appears in List A, the percentage rule therefore constitutes a criterion additional to that of change of tariff heading for any non-originating product used. Likewise the provisions ruling out the possibility of cumulating the percentages shown in Lists A and B for any one product obtained are applicable in each country for the added value acquired.Note 4 — Articles 1, 2 and 3Packing shall be considered as forming a whole with the goods contained therein. This provision, however, shall not apply to packing which is not of the normal type for the article packed and which has intrinsic utilization value and is of a durable nature, apart from its function as packing.Note 5 — Article 4(f)The term \"their vessels\" shall apply only to vessels:(a) which are registered or recorded in a Member State of the Community or in Switzerland;(b) which sail under the flag of a Member State of the Community or of Switzerland;(c) which are at least 50 % owned by nationals of Member States of the Community or of Switzerland, or by a company with its head office in one of those States, of which the manager or managers, chairman of the board of directors or of the supervisory board, and the majority of the members of such boards are nationals of the Member States of the Community or of Switzerland, and of which, in addition, in the case of partnerships or limited companies, at least half the capital belongs to those States or to public bodies or nationals of the said States;(d) of which the captain and officers are all nationals of the Member States of the Community or of Switzerland;(e) of which at least 75 % of the crew are nationals of the Member States of the Community or of Switzerland.Note 6 — Article 6\"Ex-works price\" shall mean the price paid to the manufacturer in whose undertaking the last working or processing is carried out, provided the price includes the value of all the products used in manufacture.\"Customs value\" shall be understood as meaning the customs value laid down in the Convention concerning the Valuation of Goods for Customs Purposes signed in Brussels on 15 December 1950.Note 7 — Article 8The Customs authorities which endorse movement certificates in accordance with the conditions laid down in Article 8(3) have the right to undertake verification of the goods in accordance with the laws and regulations in force in the State concerned.Note 8 — Article 10Where a movement certificate relates to goods originally imported from a Member State of the Community or from Switzerland, and re-exported in the same state, the new certificates issued by the re-exporting State must, without prejudice to the provisions of Article 24, show in which State the original movement certificate was issued. Where the goods have not been placed in a bonded warehouse, the certificates must also show that the endorsements provided for in Article 8(3) have duly been made.Note 9 — Articles 16 and 22Where a movement certificate has been issued under the conditions laid down in Article 8(2) or (4) and relates to goods re-exported in the same state, the Customs authorities of the country of destination must be able to obtain, by means of administrative cooperation, true copies of the movement certificate or certificates issued previously relating to those goods.Note 10 — Articles 23 and 25\"Tariff provisions in force\" small mean the duty applied on 1 January 1973 in Denmark, Norway, the United Kingdom or Switzerland to the products referred to in Article 25(1) or the duty which, in accordance with the provisions of the Agreement, will be subsequently applied to the said products whenever this duty is lower than that applied to other products originating in the Community or in Switzerland.Note 11 — Article 23\"Drawback or remission of any kind granted from customs duties\" shall mean any arrangement for refund or remission, partial or complete, of customs duties applicable to products used in manufacture, provided that the said provision concedes, expressly or in effect, this repayment or non-charging or the non-imposition when goods obtained from the said products are exported but not when they are retained for home use.Note 12 — Articles 24 and 25Article 24(1) and Article 25(1) shall mean, in particular, that application has not been made:(i) either of the provisions of the last sentence of Article l(2)(b) for products of the Community as originally constituted and of Ireland that have been worked or processed in Switzerland;(ii) or of any provisions corresponding to this sentence contained in the agreements referred to in Article 2 for products of the Comunity as originally constituted and of Ireland that are worked or processed in any of the five countries.Note 13 — Article 25Where originating products not fulfilling the conditions laid down in Article 25(1) are imported into Denmark, Norway or the United Kingdom, the duty which serves as a basis for the tariff reductions provided for in Article 3(2) of the Agreement is that actually applied on 1 January 1972 by the importing country in respect of third countries.--------------------------------------------------ANNEX IILIST AList of working or processing operations which result in a change of tariff heading without conferring the status of
