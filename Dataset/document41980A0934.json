The rules of this Convention shall apply to contractual obligations in any situation involving a choice between the laws of different countries.\n2.   They shall not apply to:\n(a)\nquestions involving the status or legal capacity of natural persons, without prejudice to Article 11;\n(b)\ncontractual obligations relating to:\n—\nwills and succession,\n—\nrights in property arising out of a matrimonial relationship,\n—\nrights and duties arising out of a family relationship, parentage, marriage or affinity, including maintenance obligations in respect of children who are not legitimate;\n(c)\nobligations arising under bills of exchange, cheques and promissory notes and other negotiable instruments to the extent that the obligations under such other negotiable instruments arise out of their negotiable character;\n(d)\narbitration agreements and agreements on the choice of court;\n(e)\nquestions governed by the law of companies and other bodies corporate or unincorporate such as the creation, by registration or otherwise, legal capacity, -internal organization or winding up of companies and other bodies corporate or unincorporate and the personal liability of officers and members as such for the obligations of the company or body;\n(f)\nthe question whether an agent is able to bind a principal, or an organ to bind a company or body corporate or unincorporate, to a third party;\n(g)\nthe constitution of trusts and the relationship between settlors, trustees and beneficiaries;\n(h)\nevidence and procedure, without prejudice to Article 14.\n3.   The rules of this Convention do not apply to contracts of insurance which cover risks situated in the territories of the Member States of the European Economic Community. In order to determine whether a risk is situated in these territories the court shall apply its internal law.\n4.   The preceding paragraph does not apply to contracts of re-insurance.\nArticle 2\nApplication of law of non-contracting States\nAny law specified by this Convention shall be applied whether or not it is the law of a Contracting State.\nTITLE II\nUNIFORM RULES\nArticle 3\nFreedom of choice\n1.   A contract shall be governed by the law chosen by the parties. The choice must be expressed or demonstrated with reasonable certainty by the terms of the contract or the circumstances of the case. By their choice the parties can select the law applicable to the whole or a part only of the contract.\n2.   The parties may at any time agree to subject the contract to a law other than that which previously governed it, whether as a result of an earlier choice under this Article or of other provisions of this Convention. Any variation by the parties of the law to be applied made after the conclusion of the contract shall not prejudice its formal validity under Article 9 or adversely affect the rights of third parties.\n3.   The fact that the parties have chosen a foreign law, whether or not accompanied by the choice of a foreign tribunal, shall not, where all the other elements relevant to the situation at the time of the choice are connected with one country only, prejudice the application of rules of the law of that country which cannot be derogated from by contract, hereinafter called ‘mandatory rules’.\n4.   The existence and validity of the consent of the parties as to the choice of the applicable law shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of Articles 8, 9 and 11.\nArticle 4\nApplicable law in the absence of choice\n1.   To the extent that the law applicable to the contract has not been chosen in accordance with Article 3, the contract shall be governed by the law of the country with which it is most closely connected. Nevertheless, a severable part of the contract which has a closer connection with another country may by way of exception be governed by the law of that other country.\n2.   Subject to the provisions of paragraph 5 of this Article, it shall be presumed that the contract is most closely connected with the country where the party who is to effect the performance which is characteristic of the contract has, at the time of conclusion of the contract, his habitual residence, or, in the case of a body corporate or unincorporate, its central administration. However, if the contract is entered into in the course of that party's trade or profession, that country shall be the country in which the principal place of business is situated or, where under the terms of the contract the performance is to be effected through a place of business other than the principal place of business, the country in which that other place of business is situated.\n3.   Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 2 of this Article, to the extent that the subject matter of the contract is a right in immovable property or a right to use immovable property it shall be presumed that the contract is most closely connected with the country where the immovable property is situated.\n4.   A contract for the carriage of goods shall not be subject to the presumption in paragraph 2. In such a contract if the country in which, at the time the contract is concluded, the carrier has his principal place of business is also the country in which the place of loading or the place of discharge or the principal place of business of the consignor is situated, it shall be presumed that the contract is most closely connected with that country. In applying this paragraph single voyage charter-parties and other contracts the main purpose of which is the carriage of goods shall be treated as contracts for the carriage of goods.\n5.   Paragraph 2 shall not apply if the characteristic performance cannot be determined, and the presumptions in paragraphs 2, 3 and 4 shall be disregarded if it appears from the circumstances as a whole that the contract is more closely connected with another country.\nArticle 5\nCertain consumer contracts\n1.   This Article applies to a contract the object of which is the supply of goods or services to a person (‘the consumer’) for a purpose which can be regarded as being outside his trade or profession, or a contract for the provision of credit for that object.\n2.   Notwithstanding the provisions of Article 3, a choice of law made by the parties shall not have the result of depriving the consumer of the protection afforded to him by the mandatory rules of the law of the country in which he has his habitual residence:\n—\nif in that country the conclusion of the contract was preceded by a specific invitation addressed to him or by advertising, and he had taken in that country all the steps necessary on his part for the conclusion of the contract, or\n—\nif the other party or his agent received the consumer's order in that country, or\n—\nif the contract is for the sale of goods and the consumer travelled from that country to another country and there gave his order, provided that the consumer's journey was arranged by the seller for the purpose of inducing the consumer to buy.\n3.   Notwithstanding the provisions of Article 4, a contract to which this Article applies shall, in the absence of choice in accordance with Article 3, be governed by the law of the country in which the consumer has his habitual residence if it is entered into in the circumstances described in paragraph 2 of this Article.\n4.   This Article shall not apply to:\n(a)\na contract of carriage;\n(b)\na contract for the supply of services where the services are to be supplied to the consumer exclusively in a country other than that in which he has his habitual residence.\n5.   Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 4, this Article shall apply to a contract which, for an inclusive price, provides for a combination of travel and accommodation.\nArticle 6\nIndividual employment contracts\n1.   Notwithstanding the provisions of Article 3, in a contract of employment a choice of law made by the parties shall not have the result of depriving the employee of the protection afforded to him by the mandatory rules of the law which would be applicable under paragraph 2 in the absence of choice.\n2.   Notwithstanding the provisions of Article 4, a contract of employment shall, in the absence of choice in accordance with Article 3, be governed:\n(a)\nby the law of the country in which the employee habitually carries out his work in performance of the contract, even if he is temporarily employed in another country; or\n(b)\nif the employee does not habitually carry out his work in any one country, by the law of the country in which the place of business through which he was engaged is situated;\nunless it appears from the circumstances as a whole that the contract is more closely connected with another country, in which case the contract shall be governed by the law of that country.\nArticle 7\nMandatory rules\n1.   When applying under this Convention the law of a country, effect may be given to the mandatory rules of the law of another country with which the situation has a close connection, if and in so far as, under the law of the latter country, those rules must be applied whatever the law applicable to the contract. In considering whether to give effect to these mandatory rules, regard shall be had to their nature and purpose and to the consequences of their application or non-application.\n2.   Nothing in this Convention shall restrict the application of the rules of the law of the forum in a situation where they are mandatory irrespective of the law otherwise applicable to the contract.\nArticle 8\nMaterial validity\n1.   The existence and validity of a contract, or of any term of a contract, shall be determined by the law which would govern it under this Convention if the contract or term were valid.\n2.   Nevertheless a party may rely upon the law of the country in which he has his habitual residence to establish that he did not consent if it appears from the circumstances that it would not be reasonable to determine the effect of his conduct in accordance with the law specified in the preceding paragraph.\nArticle 9\nFormal validity\n1.   A contract concluded between persons who are in the same country is formally valid if it satisfies the formal requirements of the law which governs it under this Convention or of the law of the country where it is concluded.\n2.   A contract concluded between persons who are in different countries is formally valid if it satisfies the formal requirements of the law which governs it under this Convention or of the law of one of those countries.\n3.   Where a contract is concluded by an agent, the country in which the agent acts is the relevant country for the purposes of paragraphs 1 and 2.\n4.   An act intended to have legal effect relating to an existing or contemplated contract is formally valid if it satisfies the formal requirements of the law which under this Convention governs or would govern the contract or of the law of the country where the act was done.\n5.   The provisions of the preceding paragraphs shall not apply to a contract to which Article 5 applies, concluded in the circumstances described in paragraph 2 of Article 5. The formal validity of such a contract is governed by the law of the country in which the consumer has his habitual residence.\n6.   Notwithstanding paragraphs 1 to 4 of this Article, a contract the subject matter of which is a right in immovable property or a right to use immovable property shall be subject to the mandatory requirements of form of the law of the country where the property is situated if by that law those requirements are imposed irrespective of the country where the contract is concluded and irrespective of the law governing the contract.\nArticle 10\nScope of the applicable law\n1.   The law applicable to a contract by virtue of Articles 3 to 6 and 12 of this Convention shall govern in particular:\n(a)\ninterpretation;\n(b)\nperformance;\n(c)\nwithin the limits of the powers conferred on the court by its procedural law, the consquences of breach, including the assessment of damages in so far as it is governed by rules of law;\n(d)\nthe various ways of extinguishing obligations, and prescription and limitation of actions;\n(e)\nthe consequences of nullity of the contract.\n2.   In relation to the manner of performance and the steps to be taken in the event of defective performance regard shall be had to the law of the country in which performance takes place.\nArticle 11\nIncapacity\nIn a contract concluded between persons who are in the same country, a natural person who would have capacity under the law of that country may invoke his incapacity resulting from another law only if the other party to the contract was aware of this incapacity at the time of the conclusion of the contract or was not aware thereof as a result of negligence.\nArticle 12\nVoluntary assignment\n1.   The mutual obligations of assignor and assignee under a voluntary assignment of a right against another person (‘the debtor’) shall be governed by the law which under this Convention applies to the contract between the assignor and assignee.\n2.   The law governing the right to which the assignment relates shall determine its assignability, the relationship betweeen the assignee and the debtor, the conditions under which the assignment can be invoked against the debtor and any question whether the debtor's obligations have been discharged.\nArticle 13\nSubrogation\n1.   Where a person (‘the creditor’) has a contractual claim upon another (‘the debtor’), and a third person has a duty to satisfy the creditor, or has in fact satisfied the creditor in discharge of that duty, the law which governs the third person's duty to satisfy the creditor shall determine whether the third person is entitled to exercise against the debtor the rights which the creditor had against the debtor under the law governing their relationship and, if so, whether he may do so in full or only to a limited extent.\n2.   The same rule applies where several persons are subject to the same contractual claim and one of them has satisfied the creditor.\nArticle 14\nBurden of proof, etc.\n1.   The law governing the contract under this Convention applies to the extent that it contains, in the law of contract, rules which raise presumptions of law or determine the burden of proof.\n2.   A contract or an act intended to have legal effect may be proved by any mode of proof recognized by the law of the forum or by any of the laws referred to in Article 9 under which that contract or act is formally valid, provided that such mode of proof can be administered by the forum.\nArticle 15\nExclusion of renvoi\nThe application of the law of any country specified by this Convention means the application of the rules of law in force in that country other than its rules of private international law.\nArticle 16\n‘Ordre public’\nThe application of a rule of the law of any country specified by this Convention may be refused only if such application is manifestly incompatible with the public policy (‘ordre public’) of the forum.\nArticle 17\nNo retrospective effect\nThis Convention shall apply in a Contracting State to contracts made after the date on which this Convention has entered into force with respect to that State.\nArticle 18\nUniform interpretation\nIn the interpretation and application of the preceding uniform rules, regard shall be had to their international character and to the desirability of achieving uniformity in their interpretation and application.\nArticle 19\nStates with more than one legal system\n1.   Where a State comprises several territorial units each of which has its own rules of law in respect of contractual obligations, each territorial unit shall be considered as a country for the purposes of identifying the law applicable under this Convention.\n2.   A State within which different territorial units have their own rules of law in respect of contractual obligations shall not be bound to apply this Convention to conflicts solely between the laws of such units.\nArticle 20\nPrecedence of Community law\nThis Convention shall not affect the application of provisions which, in relation to particular matters, lay down choice of law rules relating to contractual obligations and which are or will be contained in acts of the institutions of the European Communities or in national laws harmonized in implementation of such acts.\nArticle 21\nRelationship with other conventions\nThis Convention shall not prejudice the application of international conventions to which a Contracting State is, or becomes, a party.\nArticle 22\nReservations\n1.   Any Contracting State may, at the time of signature, ratification, acceptance or approval, reserve the right not to apply:\n(a)\nthe provisions of Article 7 (1);\n(b)\nthe provisions of Article 10 (1) (e).\n2.   Any Contracting State may also, when notifying an extension of the Convention in accordance with Article 27 (2), make one or more of these reservations, with its effect limited to all or some of the territories mentioned in the extension.\n3.   Any Contracting State may at any time withdraw a reservation which it has made; the reservation shall cease to have effect on the first day of the third calendar month after notification of the withdrawal.\nTITLE III\nFINAL PROVISIONS\nArticle 23\n1.

OF:\nConvention 80/934/EEC on the law applicable to contractual obligations opened for signature in Rome on 19 June 1980\nWHAT IS THE AIM OF THE CONVENTION?\n              \nThe convention establishes uniform rules concerning the law applicable to contractual obligations in the EU.\nKEY POINTS\n              \nThe convention on the law applicable to contractual obligations was opened for signature in Rome on 19 June 1980 for the then 9 European Economic Community (EEC) countries now EU. It entered into force on 1 April 1991. In due course, all the new members of the EEC signed the convention. When the convention was signed by Austria, Finland and Sweden, a consolidated version was drawn up and published in the Official Journal in 1998. A further consolidated version was published in the Official Journal in 2005, following the accession of 10 new countries to the convention.\nThe Convention was replaced, among all EU countries except Denmark, by Regulation (EC) No 593/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 June 2008 on the law applicable to contractual obligations (Rome I Regulation). The Rome Convention continues to apply to Denmark. It continues to apply to contractual obligations concluded before the entry into application of the Rome I Regulation.\nThe convention applies to contractual obligations in situations involving a choice between national laws — even where the law it designates is that of a non-contracting country — with the exception of:\nquestions involving the status or legal capacity of natural persons;\ncontractual obligations relating to wills, matrimonial property rights or other family relationships;\nobligations arising under negotiable instruments (bills of exchange, cheques, promissory notes, etc.);\narbitration agreements and agreements on the choice of court;\nquestions governed by the law of companies and other corporate and unincorporated bodies;\nthe question of whether an agent is able to bind a principal to a third party (or an organ to bind a company, or a corporate or unincorporated body);\nthe constitution of trusts and questions relating to their organisation;\nevidence and procedure;\ncontracts of insurance that cover risks in the territories of the EU countries (excluding reinsurance contracts).\nThe signatories to a contract may choose the law applicable to the whole or a part of the contract, and select the court that will have jurisdiction over disputes. By mutual agreement, they may change the law applicable to the contract at any time (principle of freedom of choice).\nIf the parties have not made an explicit choice of applicable law, the contract is governed by the law of the country with which it is most closely connected, according to, for example, the place of habitual residence or place of central administration of the party performing the contract, or the principal place of business or another place of business of the party performing the contract.\nHowever:\nwhere the contract concerns immovable property, the law applicable by default is that of the country in which the property is situated;\nwhere the contract concerns the transport of goods, the applicable law is determined according to the place of loading or unloading, or the principal place of business of the consignor.\nTo protect the rights of the consumer, the supply of goods or services to a person is covered by special conditions, according to the principle of the protection of the weaker party. Unless the parties decide otherwise, such contracts are governed by the law of the consumer’s country of residence. In no circumstances may the choice of law disadvantage the consumer or deprive him or her of the protection of more favourable law in his or her country of residence. These rules do not apply to contracts of carriage or contracts for the supply of services in a country other than the consumer’s country of residence.\nIn the case of employment contracts, one of the following will apply:\nthe law of the country in which the employee habitually carries out his work;\nthe law of the country in which the company that employed the worker has its place of business;\nthe law of the country with which the employment contract is most closely associated.\nIf the parties decide to select another law to apply to the contract, this choice may not be at the expense of the protection of the worker.\nFROM WHEN DOES THE CONVENTION APPLY?\n              \nIt has applied since 1 January 1991.\nMAIN DOCUMENTS\n            \nConvention 80/934/EEC on the law applicable to contractual obligations opened for signature in Rome on 19 June 1980 (OJ L 266, 9.10.1980, pp. 1-19)\nCorrigendum to the Convention on the law applicable to contractual obligations opened for signature in Rome on 19 June 1980 (OJ L 58, 5.3.1983, p. 14)\nRELATED DOCUMENTS\n            \nRegulation (EC) No 593/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 June 2008 on the law applicable to contractual obligations (Rome I) (OJ L 177, 4.7.2008, pp. 6-16)\nSuccessive amendments to Regulation (EC) No 593/2008 have been incorporated in the original text.
