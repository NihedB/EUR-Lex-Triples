Since further amendments are to be made, it should be recast in the interests of clarity.\n(2)\nThe management of the Community's fishery resources requires accurate and timely statistics on the catches by Member States' vessels fishing in the north-east Atlantic.\n(3)\nThe Convention on Future Multilateral Cooperation in the North-East Atlantic Fisheries, approved by Council Decision 81/608/EEC (4) and establishing the North-East Atlantic Fisheries Commission, requires the Community to supply that Commission with the available statistics that it may request.\n(4)\nAdvice received from the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea under the Cooperation Agreement between that organisation and the Community (5) will be enhanced by the availability of statistics on the activities of the Community fishing fleet.\n(5)\nThe Convention for the Conservation of Salmon in the North Atlantic Ocean, approved by Council Decision 82/886/EEC (6) and establishing the North Atlantic Salmon Conservation Organisation (Nasco), requires the Community to supply Nasco with the available statistics that it may request.\n(6)\nSeveral Member States have requested the submission of data in a different form or through a different medium from that specified in Annex IV (the equivalent of the Statlant questionnaires).\n(7)\nThere is a need for fuller definitions and descriptions used in fishery statistics and in the management of the fisheries of the north-east Atlantic.\n(8)\nThe measures necessary for the implementation of this Regulation should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission (7).\n(9)\nIn particular, the Commission should be empowered to adapt the lists of species and statistical fishing regions, the descriptions of those fishing regions and the permitted degree of aggregation of data. Since those measures are of general scope and are designed to amend non-essential elements of this Regulation, they must be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny provided for in Article 5a of Decision 1999/468/EC,\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nArticle 1\nEach Member State shall submit to the Commission data on the annual nominal catches by vessels registered in or flying the flag of that Member State fishing in the north-east Atlantic.\nThe nominal catch data shall include all fishery products landed or transhipped at sea in no matter what form but shall exclude quantities which, subsequent to capture, are discarded at sea, consumed on board or used as bait on board. Aquaculture production shall be excluded. The data shall be recorded as the live weight equivalent of the landings or transhipments, to the nearest tonne.\nArticle 2\n1.   The data to be submitted shall be the nominal catches of each of the species listed in Annex I in each of the statistical fishing regions listed in Annex II and defined in Annex III.\n2.   The data for each calendar year shall be submitted within six months of the end of the year. No submissions shall be required for species/fishing region combinations for which no catches were recorded in the annual period of the submission. The data for species of minor importance in a Member State need not be individually identified in the submissions but may be included in an aggregated item provided that the weight of the products thus recorded does not exceed 10 % by weight of the total catch in that Member State in that month.\n3.   The Commission may amend the lists of species and statistical fishing regions, the descriptions of those fishing regions and the permitted degree of aggregation of data.\nThose measures, designed to amend non-essential elements of this Regulation, shall be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny referred to in Article 5(2).\nArticle 3\nExcept where provisions adopted under the common fisheries policy dictate otherwise, a Member State shall be permitted to use sampling techniques to derive catch data for those parts of the fishing fleet for which the complete coverage of the data would involve the excessive application of administrative procedures. The details of the sampling procedures, together with details of the proportion of the total data derived by such techniques, must be included by the Member State in the report submitted pursuant to Article 6(1).\nArticle 4\nMember States shall fulfil their obligations to the Commission pursuant to Articles 1 and 2 by submitting the data on magnetic medium, the format of which is given in Annex IV.\nMember States may submit data in the format detailed in Annex V.\nWith the prior approval of the Commission, Member States may submit data in a different form or on a different medium.\nArticle 5\n1.   The Commission shall be assisted by the Standing Committee for Agricultural Statistics, set up by Council Decision 72/279/EEC (8), hereinafter referred to as ‘the Committee’.\n2.   Where reference is made to this paragraph, Article 5a(1) to (4) and Article 7 of Decision 1999/468/EC shall apply, having regard to the provisions of Article 8 thereof.\nArticle 6\n1.   By 1 January 1993 Member States shall submit a detailed report to the Commission describing how the data on catches are derived and specifying the degree of representativeness and reliability of those data. The Commission, in collaboration with the Member States, shall draw up a summary of those reports.\n2.   Member States shall inform the Commission of any modifications to the information provided under paragraph 1 within three months of their introduction.\n3.   Methodological reports, data availability and data reliability referred to in paragraph 1 and other relevant issues connected with the application of this Regulation shall be examined once a year within the competent Working Party of the Committee.\nArticle 7\n1.   Regulation (EEC) No 3880/91 is hereby repealed.\n2.   References to the repealed Regulation shall be construed as references to this Regulation and shall be read in accordance with the correlation table in Annex VII.\nArticle 8\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on the 20th day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.\nDone at Strasbourg, 11 March 2009.\nFor the European Parliament\nThe President\nH.-G.

The reporting of nominal catches of the remaining species is optional as concerns the identification of the individual species. However, where data for individual species are not submitted the data shall be included in aggregate categories. Member States may submit data for species not in the list provided that the species are clearly identified.\nNote\n:\n‘n.e.i.’ is the abbreviation for ‘not elsewhere identified’.\nEnglish

The data are recorded as the live weight equivalent of the landings (the fish brought ashore) or transhipments* to the nearest tonne.\nEach regulation specifies the deadline by which EU countries must supply the required data to the Commission (Eurostat) and the formats in which the data should be transmitted.\nAs far as fishing in the north-west Atlantic is concerned, Regulation (EC) No 217/2009 additionally requires data on catches and corresponding fishing activity subdivided by calendar month of capture, fishing gear, vessels size and main species sought. If the country in question has not fished in the north-west Atlantic in the preceding calendar year, it has to inform the Commission of this.\nThe Commission may amend the lists of species and statistical fishing regions, the descriptions of those fishing regions and the permitted degree of aggregation of data.\nExcept where rules adopted under the EU’s common fisheries policy require otherwise, EU countries may use sampling techniques to obtain catch data for those parts of the fleet for which the complete coverage of the data would involve the excessive application of administrative procedures.\nEU countries had to submit reports to the Commission providing:\ndetails of how their data were obtained,\nany sampling procedures used,\nthe proportion of the total data obtained by sampling and\nspecifying the degree of representativeness and reliability of those data\nThese reports must be submitted by:\n1 January 1993 (Regulation (EC) No 218/2009),\n28 July 1994 (Regulation (EC) No 217/2009) and\n14 November 1996 (Regulation (EC) No 216/2009).\nFROM WHEN DO THE REGULATIONS APPLY?\n              \nThey apply from 20 April 2009.\nBACKGROUND\n              \nFor more information, see:\nFishery statistics (Eurostat).\nKEY TERMS\n              \nNominal catches: include all fishery products landed or transhipped at sea in no matter what form but exclude quantities which, subsequent to capture, are discarded at sea, consumed on board or used as bait on board.\nTranshipments: the transfer of a catch from a smaller fishing boat to a larger one which then incorporates it into a larger batch for shipment.\nMAIN DOCUMENTS\n            \nRegulation (EC) No 216/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 2009 on the submission of nominal catch statistics by Member States fishing in certain areas other than those of the North Atlantic (recast) (OJ L 87, 31.3.2009, pp. 1-41)\nSuccessive amendments to Regulation (EC) No 216/2009 have been incorporated into the original document.
