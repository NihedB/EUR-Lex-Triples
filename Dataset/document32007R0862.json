This included a number of important changes designed to improve the completeness and degree of harmonisation of these statistics. Under the Action Plan, the Commission aimed to propose legislation on Community statistics on migration and asylum.\n(3)\nThe Thessaloniki European Council of 19 and 20 June 2003 concluded that more effective mechanisms were needed for the collection and analysis of information on migration and asylum in the European Union.\n(4)\nThe European Parliament in its resolution of 6 November 2003 (3) on the abovementioned Communication from the Commission noted that legislation was required to ensure the production of comprehensive statistics necessary for the development of fair and effective Community policies on migration. The resolution supports the Commission's plans to propose legislation for migration and asylum statistics.\n(5)\nEnlargement of the European Union has brought an added geographical and political dimension to the scale of the phenomena associated with migration. It has also brought a further impetus to the demand for accurate, timely and harmonised statistical information. There is also an increasing need for statistical information regarding the profession, education, qualifications and type of activity of migrants.\n(6)\nHarmonised and comparable Community statistics on migration and asylum are essential for the development and monitoring of Community legislation and policies relating to immigration and asylum, and to the free movement of persons.\n(7)\nThere is a need to reinforce the exchange of statistical information on asylum and migration and to improve the quality of Community statistical collections and outputs which have, hitherto, taken place on the basis of a series of ‘gentlemen's agreements’.\n(8)\nIt is essential that information be available, throughout the European Union, for the purposes of monitoring the development and implementation of Community legislation and policy. In the main, current practice does not sufficiently ensure, in a uniform manner, regular, timely and rapid delivery and dissemination of harmonised data.\n(9)\nThis Regulation does not cover estimates of the number of persons illegally resident in the Member States. Member States should not provide such estimates or data on such persons to the Commission (Eurostat), although they may be included in population stocks due to surveys.\n(10)\nWherever possible, the definitions used for the purposes of this Regulation are taken from the United Nations Recommendations on Statistics of International Migration, the United Nations Recommendations for the Censuses of Population and Housing in the ECE Region or EC legislation, and should be updated following the relevant procedures.\n(11)\nNew Community needs on statistics on migration and asylum render obsolete the provisions of Council Regulation (EEC) No 311/76 of 9 February 1976 on the compilation of statistics on foreign workers (4).\n(12)\nRegulation (EEC) No 311/76 should therefore be repealed.\n(13)\nSince the objective of this Regulation to establish common rules for the collection and compilation of Community statistics on migration and international protection cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore, by reason of the scale of the action, be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve that objective.\n(14)\nCouncil Regulation (EC) No 322/97 of 17 February 1997 on Community Statistics (5) constitutes the reference framework for the provisions of this Regulation. In particular, it requires conformity to standards of impartiality, reliability, objectivity, scientific independence, cost-effectiveness and statistical confidentiality.\n(15)\nThe measures necessary for the implementation of this Regulation should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission (6).\n(16)\nIn particular, the Commission should be empowered to update the definitions, to decide on the groupings of data and additional disaggregations and to lay down the rules on accuracy and quality standards. Since those measures are of general scope and are designed to amend non-essential elements of this Regulation and to supplement it by the addition of new non-essential elements, they should be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny laid down in Article 5a of Decision 1999/468/EC.\n(17)\nThe Statistical Programme Committee, established by Council Decision 89/382/EEC, Euratom of 19 June 1989 establishing a Committee on the Statistical Programmes of the European Communities (7), has been consulted in accordance with Article 3 of that Decision,\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nArticle 1\nSubject matter\nThis Regulation establishes common rules for the collection and compilation of Community statistics on:\n(a)\nimmigration to and emigration from the Member State territories, including flows from the territory of one Member State to that of another Member State and flows between a Member State and the territory of a third country;\n(b)\nthe citizenship and country of birth of persons usually resident in the territory of the Member States;\n(c)\nadministrative and judicial procedures and processes in the Member States relating to immigration, granting of permission to reside, citizenship, asylum and other forms of international protection and the prevention of illegal immigration.\nArticle 2\nDefinitions\n1.
