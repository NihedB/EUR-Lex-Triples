The committee assisting the Commission should meet, as necessary, in two distinct formations depending on the agenda.\n(6)\nSince the objective of this Decision, namely the development of a common VIS, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore, by reason of the scale and impact of the action, be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Decision does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve this objective.\n(7)\nThis Decision respects the fundamental rights and observes the principles recognised in particular by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union.\n(8)\nIn accordance with Articles 1 and 2 of the Protocol on the position of Denmark, annexed to the Treaty on European Union and the Treaty establishing the European Community, Denmark is not taking part in the adoption of this Decision and is therefore not bound by it or subject to its application. As this Decision builds upon the Schengen acquis under the provisions of Title IV of Part Three of the Treaty establishing the European Community, Denmark shall, in accordance with Article 5 of the said Protocol, decide within a period of six months after the Council has adopted this Decision whether or not it will transpose it into its national law.\n(9)\nAs regards Iceland and Norway, this Decision constitutes a development of provisions of the Schengen acquis within the meaning of the Agreement concluded by the Council of the European Union and the Republic of Iceland and the Kingdom of Norway concerning the association of those two States with the implementation, application and development of the Schengen acquis (2), which fall within the area referred to in Article 1, point B of Council Decision 1999/437/EC (3) on certain arrangements for the application of that Agreement.\n(10)\nAn arrangement has to be made to allow representatives of Iceland and Norway to be associated with the work of committees assisting the Commission in the exercise of its implementing powers. Such an arrangement has been contemplated in the Exchange of Letters between the Community and Iceland and Norway (4), annexed to the abovementioned Agreement.\n(11)\nThis Decision constitutes a development of provisions of the Schengen acquis in which the United Kingdom does not take part, in accordance with Council Decision 2000/365/EC of 29 May 2000 concerning the request of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland to take part in some of the provisions of the Schengen acquis (5); the United Kingdom is therefore not taking part in its adoption and is not bound by it or subject to its application.\n(12)\nThis Decision constitutes a development of provisions of the Schengen acquis in which Ireland does not take part, in accordance with Council Decision 2002/192/EC of 28 February 2002 concerning Ireland's request to take part in some of the provisions of the Schengen acquis (6); Ireland is therefore not taking part in its adoption and is not bound by it or subject to its application,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\nArticle 1\n1.

The VIS is based on a centralised architecture and consists of a central information system on visas and an interface in each Member State . It is the Commission’s responsibility, through the comitology procedures, to develop the central information system and the national interfaces.\nACT\nCouncil Decision 2004/512/EC of 8 June 2004 establishing the Visa Information System (VIS).\nSUMMARY\nThe Visa Information System (VIS) is based on a centralised architecture. It consists of a central information system, the Central Visa Information System (CS-VIS), of an interface in each Member State, the National Interfaces (NI-VIS) that provide the connection to the relevant central national authorities of the respective Member States, and of a communication infrastructure between the Central Visa Information System and the National Interfaces.\nThe Commission is responsible for developing the:\nCentral Visa Information System;\nNational Interface in each Member State ;\ncommunication infrastructure between the Central Visa Information System and the National Interfaces.\nThe national infrastructures are adapted by the Member States.\nThe measures to be developed by the Commission are adopted in accordance with the advisory procedure of the comitology Decision 1999/468/EC for matters relating to the:\ndesign of the physical architecture of the system;\ntechnical aspects that have a bearing on the protection of personal data;\ntechnical aspects that have serious financial implications for the budgets of the Member States or that have serious technical implications for the national systems of the Member States;\ndevelopment of security requirements, including biometric aspects.\nOther necessary measures are adopted using the management procedure of the comitology Decision.\nThe Commission will submit a yearly progress report to the European Parliament and the Council, starting in the year following the signing of the contract for the development of the VIS.\nContext\nThe Seville European Council on 21 and 22 June 2002 considered the establishment of a common identification system for visa data a top priority and called for its introduction as soon as possible. In response to this request, the Commission presented a feasibility study in May 2003. The Council welcomed the study in June 2003 and invited the Commission to continue its preparatory work on the development of the VIS.\nThis Decision constitutes the required legal basis to allow for the inclusion of the necessary appropriations for the development of the VIS in the general budget of the EU. The Decision follows from the European Council in Thessaloniki on 19 and 20 June 2003, which deemed that orientations should be determined with regard to the planning for the development of the VIS, together with the appropriate legal basis permitting its establishment and the engagement of the necessary financial means.\nREFERENCES\nAct\nEntry into force\nDeadline for transposition in the Member States\nOfficial Journal\nDecision 2004/512/EC\n5.7.2004\n-\nOJ L 231 of 15.6.2004\nRELATED ACTS\nCommission Decision 2008/602/EC of 17 June 2008 laying down the physical architecture and requirements of the national interfaces and of the communication infrastructure between the central VIS and the national interfaces for the development phase [Official Journal L 194 of 23.7.2008].\nThe Annex to this Decision establishes the design of the physical architecture and the network requirements for the NI-VIS and for the communication infrastructure between the NI-VIS and the CS-VIS.\nReport from the Commission to the European Parliament and the Council on the development of the Visa Information System (VIS) in 2012. [ COM(2013)232 final - not published in the Official Journal].\nThis report covers the work carried out by the Commission in 2012 and is the ninth and final report foreseen under Article 6 of Council Decision 2004/512/EC.\nThe main points covered in the report are:\nThe Final System Acceptance (FSA) was granted in August 2012 when the contractor was considered to have completed the development of the system and released from its contractual obligations in the project development. This important step marked the end of the development of the system in the sense of Council Decision 2004/512/EC and therefore the end of the yearly progress reports referred to in its Article 6.\nThe VIS was successfully deployed in two more geographical regions: the Near East and the Gulf region. The successful and incident-free deployment of VIS in these regions covering 14 countries indicates that the system has matured to a very satisfactory level and that it can sustain operations in subsequent regions.\nThe VIS Mail Communication Mechanism allows for the transmission of messages between Member States using the VIS network infrastructure. During the reporting period, work was focused on preparing the so-called Phase 2 of the VIS Mail, which will replace the Schengen consultation network (VISION system, under Council management) once the worldwide deployment of the VIS is completed.\nThe Biometric Matching System (BMS) became operational together with the VIS, on 11 October 2011. The BMS, which provides fingerprint matching services to the VIS, was granted Final System Acceptance in March 2012 after 5 months of operations without incident.\nA contract was awarded in 2012 to cater for the technical maintenance of the VIS under working conditions and to improve the performance of the system over time, taking into account the increasing amount of data that will be inserted in the VIS in the coming years.\nThe EU IT Agency eu-LISA took over the operational responsibility of VIS from the Commission on 1 December 2012.\nAs of 22 November 2012, the VIS had successfully processed close to 1.9 million visa applications, of which 1.5 million resulted in Schengen visas issued, while close to 235 000 visas were refused. The central system had dealt with almost 40 million operations received from consulates around the world and border crossing points.\nLast updated: 11.02.2014", "tags": ["information system", "data transmission", "EU visa policy", "exchange of information", "Schengen Information System"], "subjects": ["Free movement of persons"], "split": "train", "reference_annotations": {}, "summary_annotations": {}}
