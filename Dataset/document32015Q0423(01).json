Rules\n66\nRULES OF PROCEDURE OF THE GENERAL COURT\nTHE GENERAL COURT,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on European Union, and in particular Article 19 thereof,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular the fifth paragraph of Article 254 thereof,\nHaving regard to the Treaty establishing the European Atomic Energy Community, and in particular Article 106a(1) thereof,\nHaving regard to the Protocol on the Statute of the Court of Justice of the European Union, and in particular the sixth paragraph of Article 19, Article 63 and the second paragraph of Article 64 thereof,\nWhereas:\n(1)\nThe Rules of Procedure of 2 May 1991 have been amended numerous times in order to equip the General Court gradually with provisions enabling it to deal under the best possible conditions with different kinds of cases falling within increasingly varied areas.\n(2)\nFull revision of the text is necessary in order to give this set of rules a new coherence, to promote consistency in the procedural provisions governing proceedings brought before the Courts of the European Union, to preserve the capacity of the General Court to rule on cases within a reasonable time, to clarify parties' rights, to specify the General Court's expectations regarding the parties' representatives and to adjust a certain number of provisions to take account of certain changes, including technological changes, in relation to the lodging and service of procedural documents, and of difficulties encountered in their implementation.\n(3)\nActions brought in the field of intellectual property and appeals lodged against decisions of the European Union Civil Service Tribunal must, on account of their specific nature, be subject to particular procedural rules set out in special titles, while being otherwise governed by the procedural provisions applicable to direct actions. The rules relating to direct actions, actions in the field of intellectual property and appeals therefore constitute the framework of these Rules.\n(4)\nIn the light of experience, it is also necessary to supplement or to clarify for the benefit of litigants the rules that apply to each procedure. The rules in question concern, in particular, the extent of the rights conferred on the main parties and that of the rights afforded to interveners or, in intellectual property cases, the acquisition of the status of intervener and the extent of his rights. Observance of the adversarial principle and the need, in certain situations, to preserve the confidentiality of sensitive information which is relevant to the outcome of the proceedings are the subject of specific provisions. With regard to appeals against decisions of the Civil Service Tribunal, a clearer distinction must in addition be drawn between appeals and cross-appeals following the service of an appeal. A similar distinction must be drawn, with regard to cases in the field of intellectual property, between the original action and the cross-claim brought by an intervener, following service of the application initiating proceedings.\n(5)\nThe excessive complexity of certain procedures has come to light on their implementation. It is appropriate, therefore, to simplify them. On that basis, the rules for determining the language of the case in intellectual property cases ensure greater predictability of situations for the benefit of those concerned and a ‘light touch’ by the General Court. The rules relating to the default procedure are intended to enable cases to be disposed of more promptly, in the interests of the applicant, who, if successful, is exposed to the risk of the defendant applying for the judgment in default to be set aside.\n(6)\nIn the interests of making the Rules easier to understand, all requests and applications relating to judgments and orders, currently to be found in a number of separate titles and chapters of the Rules of Procedure, should be brought together in the title relating to direct actions. Similarly, to assist the reader, the procedures following referral by the Court of Justice, either after a decision has been set aside, or after review, are set out in a single title.\n(7)\nAlthough required to deal with an ever-increasing caseload, the General Court must continue to deliver its rulings within a reasonable time. It is therefore essential to continue the efforts undertaken to reduce the duration of proceedings before the General Court, in particular by providing for the written part of the procedure in intellectual property cases to be limited to a single exchange of pleadings, managing applications to modify the form of order sought in the application, reducing certain legal time limits, simplifying the rules on intervention by removing as a category of intervention those which may be allowed after expiry of the legal time limit following publication in the Official Journal of the European Union, making provision for the General Court to be able to rule without an oral part of the procedure in direct actions if none of the main parties has requested a hearing and if it considers that it has sufficient information available to it from the material in the file in the case, and to be able to rule without an oral part of the procedure in appeals, increasing the decision-making powers of the Presidents of Chambers and, lastly, increasing the circumstances in which a ruling is to be given by means of a simple decision.\n(8)\nWith the same objective, provisions have been added to the title relating to the organisation of the General Court with a view, in particular, to specifying the circumstances in which a case may be reassigned and extending the powers of a single Judge so as to enable him to hear and determine intellectual property cases.\n(9)\nThe fact that proceedings are to be conducted in accordance with the adversarial principle is confirmed by the affirmation of that principle in a specific article and by a strict set of rules governing the circumstances in which preservation of the confidentiality of certain information provided by a main party which is necessary in order for the General Court to rule in the case justifies, exceptionally, the non-communication of that information to the other main party. New provisions also provide the General Court with a formal framework in the event of a Judge's withdrawal from a case or of his being excused. The reform is also intended to elevate to the status of rules of procedure provisions which were previously contained in practice directions to parties, such as that relating to the length of pleadings, or in instructions to the registrar of the General Court, such as the provision concerning anonymity and that specifying the circumstances in which a third party may be given access to the file in the case.\n(10)\nLastly, the text has been made easier to read by the removal of certain rules which are outdated or not applied, the numbering of every paragraph of the articles in these Rules, the addition of a specific heading for each article and the harmonisation of terminology,\nWith the agreement of the Court of Justice,\nWith the approval of the Council given on 10 February 2015,\nHAS ADOPTED THESE RULES OF PROCEDURE:\nINTRODUCTORY PROVISIONS\nArticle 1\nDefinitions\n1.

If the documents referred to in paragraphs 2 and 3 are not lodged, the Registrar shall prescribe a reasonable time limit within which the party concerned is to produce them. If the party concerned fails to produce the required documents within the time limit prescribed, the General Court shall decide whether the non-compliance with that procedural requirement renders the application or written pleadings formally inadmissible.\nSection 2\nRights and obligations of parties' representatives\nArticle 52\nPrivileges, immunities and facilities\n1.

If the General Court considers that the conduct of an agent, adviser or lawyer before the General Court, the President, a Judge or the Registrar is incompatible with the dignity of the General Court or with the requirements of the proper administration of justice, or that such agent, adviser or lawyer is using his rights for purposes other than those for which they were granted, it shall inform the person concerned. The General Court may inform the competent authorities to whom the person concerned is answerable. A copy of the letter sent to those authorities shall be forwarded to the person concerned.\n2.

Where, for technical reasons or on account of the nature or size of the document, service of the document in accordance with the procedures laid down in paragraph 1 is impossible or impracticable, the document shall be served at the address of the representative of the party concerned by registered post with a form for acknowledgement of receipt or by personal delivery of the copy against a receipt. The addressee shall be so informed by the method referred to in paragraph 4 or by telefax. Service shall then be deemed to have been effected on the addressee by registered post on the tenth day following the lodging of the registered letter at the post office of the place in which the General Court has its seat, unless it is shown by the acknowledgement of receipt that the letter was received on a different date or the addressee informs the Registrar, within three weeks of being informed by the method referred to in paragraph 4 or by telefax, that the document to be served has not reached him.\n3.   The Registrar shall prepare and certify the copies of documents to be served pursuant to paragraph 2, save where the parties themselves supply the copies in accordance with Article 73(2).\n4.

Where the decision to stay the proceedings does not fix the length of stay, it shall end on the date indicated in the decision to resume the proceedings or, in the absence of such indication, on the date of the latter decision.\n4.   From the date of the resumption of proceedings following a stay, any suspended procedural time limits shall be replaced by new time limits and time shall begin to run from the date of that resumption.\nChapter 2\nPROCEDURAL DOCUMENTS\nArticle 72\nCommon rules for the lodging of procedural documents\n1.   A procedural document shall be lodged at the Registry either in paper form, where appropriate after transmission of a copy of the original of that document by telefax in accordance with Article 73(3), or by the method referred to in the decision of the General Court adopted pursuant to Article 74.\n2.

By way of derogation from the second sentence of Article 72(2), the date on and time at which a full copy of the signed original of a procedural document, including the schedule of items referred to in Article 72(3), is received at the Registry by telefax shall be deemed to be the date and time of lodgement for the purposes of compliance with the procedural time limits, provided that the signed original of the procedural document, accompanied by the annexes and copies referred to in paragraph 2, is lodged at the Registry no later than 10 days thereafter. Article 60 shall not apply to that time limit of 10 days.\nArticle 74\nElectronic lodgement\nThe General Court may, by decision, determine the criteria for a procedural document sent to the Registry by electronic means to be deemed to be the original of that document.

The application initiating proceedings and the defence may be supplemented by a reply from the applicant and by a rejoinder from the defendant unless the General Court decides that a second exchange of pleadings is unnecessary because the contents of the file in the case are sufficiently comprehensive.\n2.   Where the General Court decides that a second exchange of pleadings is unnecessary it may authorise the main parties to supplement the file in the case if the applicant presents a reasoned request to that effect within two weeks from the service of that decision.\n3.   The President shall prescribe the time limits within which those procedural documents are to be produced. He may specify the matters to which the reply or the rejoinder should relate.\nChapter 4\nPLEAS IN LAW, EVIDENCE AND MODIFICATION OF THE APPLICATION\nArticle 84\nNew pleas in law\n1.

Where the matters of law or of fact justifying the introduction of new pleas in law are known after the second exchange of pleadings or after it has been decided not to authorise a second exchange of pleadings, the main party concerned shall introduce the new pleas in law as soon as those matters come to his knowledge.\n3.   Without prejudice to the decision to be taken by the General Court on the admissibility of the new pleas in law, the President shall give the other parties an opportunity to respond to those pleas.\nArticle 85\nEvidence produced or offered\n1.   Evidence produced or offered shall be submitted in the first exchange of pleadings.\n2.   In reply or rejoinder a main party may produce or offer further evidence in support of his arguments, provided that the delay in the submission of such evidence is justified.\n3.

If that measure is not produced, the Registrar shall prescribe a reasonable time limit within which the applicant is to produce it. If the applicant fails to produce the measure within the time limit prescribed, the General Court shall decide whether the non-compliance with that requirement renders the statement modifying the application inadmissible.\n5.   Without prejudice to the decision to be taken by the General Court on the admissibility of the statement modifying the application, the President shall prescribe a time limit within which the defendant may respond to the statement of modification.\n6.   The President shall, where appropriate, prescribe a time limit within which any interveners may supplement their statements in intervention in the light of the statement modifying the application and the statement in response.

A measure of inquiry referred to in Article 91(b) may be ordered only where the party concerned by the measure has not complied with a measure of organisation of procedure previously adopted to that end, or where expressly requested by the party concerned by the measure and that party explains the need for such a measure to be in the form of an order for a measure of inquiry. The order prescribing the measure of inquiry may provide that inspection by the parties' representatives of information and material obtained by the General Court in consequence of that order may take place only at the Registry and that no copies may be made.\n4.

After the witness has given his evidence the President may, at the request of one of the parties or of his own motion, put questions to him.\n3.   The other Judges and the Advocate General may do likewise.\n4.   Subject to the control of the President, questions may be put to witnesses by the representatives of the parties.\n5.   Subject to the provisions of Article 97, the witness shall, after giving his evidence, take the following oath:\n‘I swear that I have spoken the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth.’\n6.   The General Court may, after hearing the main parties, exempt a witness from taking the oath.\nArticle 95\nDuties of witnesses\n1.   Witnesses who have been duly summoned shall obey the summons and attend for examination.\n2.   If, without good reason, a witness who has been duly summoned fails to appear before the General Court, the General Court may impose upon him a pecuniary penalty not exceeding EUR 5 000 and may order that a further summons be served on the witness at his own expense.\n3.   The same penalty may be imposed upon a witness who, without good reason, refuses to give evidence or to take the oath.\nArticle 96\nExpert's report\n1.   The order appointing the expert shall define his task and set a time limit within which he is to submit his report.\n2.

At the request of one of the parties or of his own motion, the President may put questions to the expert.\n3.   The other Judges and the Advocate General may do likewise.\n4.   Subject to the control of the President, questions may be put to the expert by the representatives of the parties.\n5.   Subject to the provisions of Article 97, the expert shall, after making his report, take the following oath before the General Court:\n‘I swear that I have conscientiously and impartially carried out my task.’\n6.

An objection to a witness or an expert shall be raised within two weeks after service of the order summoning the witness or appointing the expert; the statement of objection must set out the grounds of objection and indicate the nature of any evidence offered.\nArticle 100\nWitnesses' and experts' costs\n1.   Where the General Court orders the examination of witnesses or an expert's report, it may request the main parties or one of them to lodge security for the witnesses' costs or the costs of the expert's report.\n2.   Witnesses and experts shall be entitled to reimbursement of their travel and subsistence expenses. The cashier of the General Court may make an advance payment towards these expenses.\n3.

The order shall contain the name, description and address of the witness or expert, set out the facts on which the witness or expert is to be examined, name the parties, their representatives, indicate their addresses and briefly describe the subject-matter of the proceedings.\n3.   The Registrar shall send the order to the competent authority named in the Rules supplementing the Rules of Procedure of the Court of Justice of the Member State in whose territory the witness or expert is to be examined. Where necessary, the order shall be accompanied by a translation into the official language or languages of the Member State to which it is addressed.\n4.   The authority named pursuant to paragraph 3 shall transmit the order to the judicial authority which is competent according to its national law.\n5.   The competent judicial authority shall give effect to the letters rogatory in accordance with its national law. After implementation the competent judicial authority shall transmit to the authority named pursuant to paragraph 3 the order embodying the letters rogatory, any documents arising from the implementation and a detailed statement of costs.

The minutes shall be served on the parties.\nSection 3\nTreatment of confidential information, items and documents produced in the context of measures of inquiry\nArticle 103\nTreatment of confidential information and material\n1.   Where it is necessary for the General Court to examine, on the basis of the matters of law and of fact relied on by a main party, the confidentiality, vis-à-vis the other main party, of certain information or material produced before the General Court following a measure of inquiry referred to in Article 91(b) that may be relevant in order for the General Court to rule in a case, that information or material shall not be communicated to that other party at the stage of such examination.\n2.   Where the General Court concludes in the examination provided for in paragraph 1 that certain information or material produced before it is relevant in order for it to rule in the case and is confidential vis-à-vis the other main party, it shall weigh that confidentiality against the requirements linked to the right to effective judicial protection, particularly observance of the adversarial principle.\n3.   After weighing up the matters referred to in paragraph 2, the General Court may decide to bring the confidential information or material to the attention of the other main party, making its disclosure subject, if necessary, to the giving of specific undertakings, or it may decide not to communicate such information or material, specifying, by reasoned order, the procedures enabling the other main party, to the greatest extent possible, to make his views known, including ordering the production of a non-confidential version or a non-confidential summary of the information or material, containing the essential content thereof.\n4.   The procedural regime in this Article shall not apply to the cases referred to in Article 105.\nArticle 104\nDocuments to which access has been denied by an institution\nWhere, following a measure of inquiry referred to in Article 91(c), a document to which access has been denied by an institution has been produced before the General Court in proceedings relating to the legality of that denial, that document shall not be communicated to the other parties.\nChapter 7\nINFORMATION OR MATERIAL PERTAINING TO THE SECURITY OF THE UNION OR THAT OF ONE OR MORE OF ITS MEMBER STATES OR TO THE CONDUCT OF THEIR INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS\nArticle 105\nTreatment of information or material pertaining to the security of the Union or that of one or more of its Member States or to the conduct of their international relations\n1.   Where, contrary to the adversarial principle set out in Article 64 under which all information and material must be fully communicated between the parties, a main party intends to base his claims on certain information or material but submits that its communication would harm the security of the Union or that of one or more of its Member States or the conduct of their international relations, he shall produce that information or material by a separate document. The information or material thus produced shall be accompanied by an application for confidential treatment thereof, setting out the overriding reasons which, to the extent strictly required by the exigencies of the situation, justify the confidentiality of that information or material being preserved and which militate against its communication to the other main party. The application for confidential treatment shall also be submitted by a separate document and shall not contain anything which is confidential. Where the information or material in respect of which confidential treatment is sought has been transmitted to the main party by one or more Member States, the overriding reasons put forward by the main party to justify the confidential treatment of that information or material may include those provided by the Member State(s) concerned.\n2.   The production of information or material the confidential nature of which is based on the overriding reasons referred to in paragraph 1 may be requested by the General Court in the form of a measure of inquiry. Formal note shall be taken of any refusal. By way of derogation from Article 103, the procedural regime applicable to such information or material produced following a measure of inquiry shall be that of the present Article.\n3.   While the information or material produced by a main party in accordance with paragraph 1 or 2 is being examined as to its relevance to the General Court's ruling in the case and as to its confidential nature vis-à-vis the other main party, that information or material shall not be communicated to the other main party.\n4.   Where the General Court decides, after the examination provided for in paragraph 3, that the information or material produced before it is relevant in order for it to rule in the case and is not confidential for the purposes of the proceedings before the General Court, it shall ask the party concerned to authorise the communication of that information or material to the other main party. If the first party objects to such communication within a period prescribed by the President, or fails to reply by the end of that period, that information or material shall not be taken into account in the determination of the case and shall be returned to that party.\n5.   Where the General Court decides, after the examination provided for in paragraph 3, that certain information or material produced before it is relevant in order for it to rule in the case and is confidential vis-à-vis the other main party, it shall not communicate that information or material to that main party. It shall then weigh the requirements linked to the right to effective judicial protection, particularly observance of the adversarial principle, against the requirements flowing from the security of the Union or of one or more of its Member States or the conduct of their international relations.\n6.   After weighing up the matters referred to in paragraph 5, the General Court shall make a reasoned order specifying the procedures to be adopted to accommodate the requirements referred to in paragraph 5, such as the production by the party concerned, for subsequent communication to the other main party, of a non-confidential version or a non-confidential summary of the information or material, containing the essential content thereof and enabling the other main party, to the greatest extent possible, to make its views known.\n7.   The information or material that is confidential vis-à-vis the other main party may be withdrawn, wholly or in part, by the main party who produced it in accordance with paragraph 1 or 2, within two weeks after service of the decision taken pursuant to paragraph 5. The information or material withdrawn shall not be taken into account in the determination of the case and shall be returned to the main party concerned.\n8.   Where the General Court considers that information or material which, owing to its confidential nature, has not been communicated to the other main party in accordance with the procedures referred to in paragraph 6 is essential in order for it to rule in the case, it may, by way of derogation from Article 64 and confining itself to what is strictly necessary, base its judgment on such information or material. When assessing that information or material, the General Court shall take account of the fact that a main party has not been able to make his views on it known.\n9.   The General Court shall ensure that confidential matters contained in the information or material produced by a main party in accordance with paragraph 1 or 2 which have not been communicated to the other main party are not disclosed in the order made pursuant to paragraph 6 or in the decision which closes the proceedings.\n10.   The information or material referred to in paragraph 5 shall be returned to the party concerned as soon as the decision closing the proceedings before the General Court is adopted.\n11.   The General Court shall determine, by decision, the security rules for protecting the information or material produced in accordance with paragraph 1 or paragraph 2, as the case may be. That decision shall be published in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nChapter 8\nORAL PART OF THE PROCEDURE\nArticle 106\nOral part of the procedure\n1.   The procedure before the General Court shall include, in the oral part, a hearing arranged either of the General Court's own motion or at the request of a main party.\n2.   Any request for a hearing made by a main party must state the reasons for which that party wishes to be heard. It must be submitted within three weeks after service on the parties of notification of the close of the written part of the procedure. That time limit may be extended by the President.\n3.   If there is no request as referred to in paragraph 2, the General Court may, if it considers that it has sufficient information available to it from the material in the file, decide to rule on the action without an oral part of the procedure. In that case, it may nevertheless later decide to open the oral part of the procedure.\nArticle 107\nDate of the hearing\n1.   If the General Court decides to open the oral part of the procedure, the President shall fix the date of the hearing.\n2.   The President may, in exceptional circumstances, of his own motion or at the reasoned request of a main party, adjourn the hearing to another date.\nArticle 108\nAbsence of the parties from the hearing\n1.   Where a party informs the General Court that he will not be present at the hearing or where the General Court finds at the hearing that a party who has been duly given notice to attend is absent without excuse, the hearing shall proceed in the absence of the party concerned.\n2.   Where the main parties indicate to the General Court that they will not be present at the hearing, the President shall decide whether the oral part of the procedure may be closed.\nArticle 109\nCases heard in camera\n1.   After hearing the parties, the General Court may, in accordance with Article 31 of the Statute, decide to hear a case in camera.\n2.   The request by a party for a case to be heard in camera must include reasons and specify whether it concerns all or part of the hearing.\n3.   The oral proceedings in cases heard in camera shall not be published.\nArticle 110\nConduct of the hearing\n1.   The oral proceedings shall be opened and directed by the President, who shall be responsible for the proper conduct of the hearing.\n2.   A party may address the General Court only through his representative.\n3.   The members of the formation of the Court and the Advocate General may in the course of the hearing put questions to the representatives of the parties.\nArticle 111\nClose of the oral part of the procedure\nWhere an Advocate General has not been designated in a case, the President shall declare the oral part of the procedure closed at the end of the hearing.\nArticle 112\nDelivery of the Opinion of the Advocate General\n1.   Where an Advocate General has been designated in a case and delivers his Opinion in writing, he shall lodge it at the Registry, which shall communicate it to the parties.\n2.   The President shall declare the oral part of the procedure closed after the delivery, orally or in writing, of the Opinion of the Advocate General.\nArticle 113\nReopening of the oral part of the procedure\n1.   The General Court shall order the reopening of the oral part of the procedure when the conditions set out in Article 23(3) or Article 24(3) are satisfied.\n2.   The General Court may order the reopening of the oral part of the procedure:\n(a)\nif it considers that it lacks sufficient information;\n(b)\nwhere the case must be decided on the basis of an argument which has not been debated between the parties;\n(c)\nwhere requested by a main party who is relying on facts which are of such a nature as to be a decisive factor for the decision of the General Court but which it was unable to put forward before the oral part of the procedure was closed.\nArticle 114\nMinutes of the hearing\n1.   The Registrar shall draw up minutes of every hearing. The minutes shall be signed by the President and by the Registrar. They shall constitute an official record.\n2.   The minutes shall be served on the parties.\nArticle 115\nRecording of the hearing\nThe President of the General Court may, on a duly substantiated request, authorise a party who has participated in the written part or the oral part of the proceedings to listen, on the General Court's premises, to the sound recording of the hearing in the language used by the speakers during that hearing.\nChapter 9\nJUDGMENTS AND ORDERS\nArticle 116\nDate of delivery of a judgment\nThe parties shall be informed of the date of delivery of a judgment.\nArticle 117\nContent of a judgment\nA judgment shall contain:\n(a)\na statement that it is the judgment of the General Court;\n(b)\nan indication as to the formation of the Court;\n(c)\nthe date of delivery;\n(d)\nthe names of the President and of the Judges who took part in the deliberations, with an indication as to the name of the Judge-Rapporteur;\n(e)\nthe name of the Advocate General, if designated;\n(f)\nthe name of the Registrar;\n(g)\na description of the parties;\n(h)\nthe names of their representatives;\n(i)\na statement of the forms of order sought by the parties;\n(j)\nwhere applicable, the date of the hearing;\n(k)\na statement, where appropriate, that the Advocate General has been heard and, where applicable, the date of his Opinion;\n(l)\na summary of the facts;\n(m)\nthe grounds for the decision;\n(n)\nthe operative part of the judgment, including the decision as to costs.\nArticle 118\nDelivery and service of the judgment\n1.

Where the General Court finds that a defendant on whom an application initiating proceedings has been duly served has failed to respond to the application in the proper form or within the time limit prescribed in Article 81, without prejudice to the application of the provisions of the second paragraph of Article 45 of the Statute, the applicant may, within a time limit prescribed by the President, apply to the General Court for judgment by default.\n2.   A defendant in default shall not intervene in the default procedure and, with the exception of the decision which closes the proceedings, no procedural document shall be served on him.\n3.   The General Court shall give judgment in favour of the applicant in the judgment by default, unless it is clear that the General Court has no jurisdiction to hear and determine the action or that the action is manifestly inadmissible or manifestly lacking any foundation in law.\n4.   A judgment by default shall be enforceable. The General Court may, however, grant a stay of execution until it has given its decision on any application under Article 166 to set aside the judgment, or it may make execution subject to the provision of security of an amount and nature to be fixed in the light of the circumstances. This security shall be released if no such application is made or if the application fails.\nChapter 11\nAMICABLE SETTLEMENT AND DISCONTINUANCE\nArticle 124\nAmicable settlement\n1.   If, before the General Court has given its decision, the main parties reach a settlement of their dispute and inform the General Court of the abandonment of their claims, the President shall order the case to be removed from the register and shall give a decision as to costs in accordance with Articles 136 and 138, having regard to any proposals made by the parties on the matter.\n2.   This provision shall not apply to proceedings under Articles 263 TFEU and 265 TFEU.\nArticle 125\nDiscontinuance\nIf the applicant informs the General Court in writing or at the hearing that he wishes to discontinue the proceedings, the President shall order the case to be removed from the register and shall give a decision as to costs in accordance with Articles 136 and 138.\nChapter 12\nACTIONS AND ISSUES DETERMINED BY ORDER\nArticle 126\nAction manifestly bound to fail\nWhere it is clear that the General Court has no jurisdiction to hear and determine an action or where the action is manifestly inadmissible or manifestly lacking any foundation in law, the General Court may, on a proposal from the Judge-Rapporteur, at any time decide to give a decision by reasoned order without taking further steps in the proceedings.\nArticle 127\nReferral of a case to the Court of Justice or to the Civil Service Tribunal\nDecisions referring an action in the circumstances specified in the second paragraph of Article 54 of the Statute and in Article 8(2) of Annex I to the Statute shall be made by the General Court by reasoned order on a proposal from the Judge-Rapporteur.\nArticle 128\nDeclining of jurisdiction\nDecisions declining jurisdiction in the circumstances specified in the third paragraph of Article 54 of the Statute shall be made by the General Court by reasoned order on a proposal from the Judge-Rapporteur.\nArticle 129\nAbsolute bar to proceeding with a case\nOn a proposal from the Judge-Rapporteur, the General Court may at any time of its own motion, after hearing the main parties, decide to rule by reasoned order on whether there exists any absolute bar to proceeding with a case.\nArticle 130\nPreliminary objections and issues\n1.   A defendant applying to the General Court for a decision on inadmissibility or lack of competence without going to the substance of the case shall submit the application by a separate document within the time limit referred to in Article 81.\n2.   A party applying to the General Court for a declaration that the action has become devoid of purpose and that there is no longer any need to adjudicate on it or for a decision on another preliminary issue shall submit the application by a separate document.\n3.   The applications referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 must state the pleas of law and arguments relied on and the form of order sought; any supporting material must be annexed to the applications.\n4.   As soon as the application referred to in paragraph 1 has been submitted, the President shall prescribe a time limit within which the applicant in the action may submit in writing his pleas in law and the form of order which he seeks.\n5.   As soon as the application referred to in paragraph 2 has been submitted, the President shall prescribe a time limit within which the other parties may submit in writing their observations on that application.\n6.   The General Court may decide to open the oral part of the procedure in respect of the applications referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2. Article 106 shall not apply.\n7.   The General Court shall decide on the application as soon as possible or, where special circumstances so justify, reserve its decision until it rules on the substance of the case. It shall refer the case to the Court of Justice or to the Civil Service Tribunal if the case falls within their jurisdiction.\n8.   If the General Court refuses the application or reserves its decision, the President shall prescribe new time limits for further steps in the proceedings.\nArticle 131\nCases that, of the General Court's own motion, do not proceed to judgment\n1.   If the General Court declares that the action has become devoid of purpose and that there is no longer any need to adjudicate on it, it may at any time, of its own motion, on a proposal from the Judge-Rapporteur and after hearing the parties, decide to rule by reasoned order.\n2.   If the applicant ceases to reply to the General Court's requests, the General Court may, on a proposal from the Judge-Rapporteur and after hearing the parties, declare of its own motion, by reasoned order, that there is no longer any need to adjudicate.\nArticle 132\nActions that are manifestly well founded\nWhere the Court of Justice or the General Court has already ruled on one or more questions of law identical to those raised by the pleas in law of the action and the General Court finds that the facts have been established, it may, after the written part of the procedure has been closed, on a proposal from the Judge-Rapporteur and after hearing the parties, decide by reasoned order in which reference is made to the relevant case-law to declare the action manifestly well founded.\nChapter 13\nCOSTS\nArticle 133\nDecision as to costs\nA decision as to costs shall be given in the judgment or order which closes the proceedings.\nArticle 134\nGeneral rules as to allocation of costs\n1.   The unsuccessful party shall be ordered to pay the costs if they have been applied for in the successful party's pleadings.\n2.   Where there is more than one unsuccessful party the General Court shall decide how the costs are to be shared.\n3.   Where each party succeeds on some and fails on other heads, the parties shall bear their own costs. However, if it appears justified in the circumstances of the case, the General Court may order that one party, in addition to bearing his own costs, pay a proportion of the costs of the other party.\nArticle 135\nEquity and unreasonable or vexatious costs\n1.   Exceptionally, if equity so requires, the General Court may decide that an unsuccessful party is to pay only a proportion of the costs of the other party in addition to bearing his own, or even that he is not to be ordered to pay any.\n2.   The General Court may order a party, even if successful, to pay some or all of the costs, if this appears justified by the conduct of that party, including before the proceedings were brought, especially if he has made the opposite party incur costs which the General Court holds to be unreasonable or vexatious.\nArticle 136\nCosts in the event of discontinuance or withdrawal\n1.   A party who discontinues or withdraws from proceedings shall be ordered to pay the costs if they have been applied for in the other party's observations on the discontinuance.\n2.   However, at the request of the party who discontinues or withdraws from proceedings, the costs shall be borne by the other party if this appears justified by the conduct of that party.\n3.

If costs are not claimed, the parties shall bear their own costs.\nArticle 137\nCosts where a case does not proceed to judgment\nWhere a case does not proceed to judgment, the costs shall be in the discretion of the General Court.\nArticle 138\nCosts of interveners\n1.

The General Court may order an intervener other than those referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 to bear his own costs.\nArticle 139\nCosts of proceedings\nProceedings before the General Court shall be free of charge, except that:\n(a)\nwhere a party has caused the General Court to incur avoidable costs, in particular where the action is manifestly an abuse of process, the General Court may order that party to refund them;\n(b)\nwhere copying or translation work is carried out at the request of a party, the cost shall, in so far as the Registrar considers it excessive, be paid for by that party on the Registry's scale of charges referred to in Article 37;\n(c)\nin the event of any repeated failure to comply with the requirements of these Rules or of the practice rules referred to in Article 224, requiring regularisation to be sought, the costs involved in the requisite processing thereof by the General Court shall, at the request of the Registrar, be paid for by the party concerned on the Registry's scale of charges referred to in Article 37.\nArticle 140\nRecoverable costs\nWithout prejudice to Article 139, the following shall be regarded as recoverable costs:\n(a)\nsums payable to witnesses and experts under Article 100;\n(b)\nexpenses necessarily incurred by the parties for the purpose of the proceedings, in particular the travel and subsistence expenses and the remuneration of agents, advisers or lawyers.\nArticle 141\nProcedure for payment\n1.

The intervention shall be limited to supporting, in whole or in part, the form of order sought by one of the main parties. It shall not confer the same procedural rights as those conferred on the main parties and, in particular, shall not give rise to any right to request that a hearing be held.\n2.   The intervention shall be ancillary to the main proceedings. It shall become devoid of purpose if the case is removed from the register of the General Court as a result of a main party's discontinuance or withdrawal from the proceedings or of an agreement between the main parties, or where the application is declared inadmissible.\n3.   The intervener must accept the case as he finds it at the time of his intervention.\nArticle 143\nApplication to intervene\n1.   An application to intervene must be submitted within six weeks of the publication of the notice referred to in Article 79.\n2.

The applicant for leave to intervene shall be represented in accordance with Article 19 of the Statute.\n4.   Article 77, Article 78(3) to (5) and Article 139 shall apply to the application to intervene.\nArticle 144\nDecision on applications to intervene\n1.   The application to intervene shall be served on the main parties.\n2.   The President shall give the main parties an opportunity to submit their written or oral observations on the application to intervene and to apply, if necessary, for certain confidential information in the file in the case not to be communicated to an intervener.\n3.   Where the defendant lodges a plea of inadmissibility or of lack of competence, as provided in Article 130(1), a decision on the application to intervene shall not be given until after the plea has been rejected or the decision on the plea reserved.\n4.   Where the application is submitted pursuant to the first paragraph of Article 40 of the Statute and the main parties have not identified information in the file in the case that is confidential and which they claim would be prejudicial to them if communicated to the intervener, the intervention shall be allowed by decision of the President.\n5.   In any other case the President shall decide on the application to intervene as soon as possible, by order, and, where applicable, on the communication to the intervener of information which it is claimed is confidential.\n6.   If the application to intervene is refused, the order referred to in paragraph 5 must state the reasons on which it is based and include a decision as to the costs relating to the application to intervene, including the costs of the applicant for leave to intervene, pursuant to Articles 134 and 135.\n7.   If the application to intervene is granted, the intervener shall receive a copy of every procedural document served on the main parties, save, where applicable, for the confidential information excluded from such communication pursuant to paragraph 5.\n8.   In the event that the application to intervene is withdrawn, the President shall order that the applicant for leave to intervene be removed from the case and shall give a decision as to costs, including the costs of the applicant for leave to intervene, pursuant to Article 136.\n9.

Any person who, because of his financial situation, is wholly or partly unable to meet the costs of the proceedings shall be entitled to legal aid.\n2.   Legal aid shall be refused if it is clear that the General Court has no jurisdiction to hear and determine the action in respect of which the application for legal aid is made or if that action appears to be manifestly inadmissible or manifestly lacking any foundation in law.\nArticle 147\nApplication for legal aid\n1.   An application for legal aid may be made before the action has been brought or while it is pending.\n2.   The application for legal aid must be made using a form which is published in the Official Journal of the European Union and available on the internet site of the Court of Justice of the European Union. Without prejudice to Article 74, the form must be signed by the applicant for legal aid or, if he is represented, by his lawyer. An application for legal aid submitted without the application form will not be taken into consideration.\n3.   The application for legal aid must be accompanied by all information and supporting documents making it possible to assess the applicant's financial situation, such as a certificate issued by a competent national authority attesting to his financial situation.\n4.   If the application for legal aid is made before the action has been brought, the applicant must briefly state the subject-matter of the proposed action, the facts of the case and the arguments in support of the action. The application must be accompanied by supporting documents in that regard.\n5.   Where applicable, the application for legal aid shall be accompanied by the documents referred to in Article 51(2) and (3) and Article 78(3). In that case Article 51(4) and Article 78(5) shall apply.\n6.   If the applicant for legal aid is represented by a lawyer when the application for legal aid is lodged, Article 77 shall apply.\n7.   The introduction of an application for legal aid shall, for the person who made it, suspend the time limit prescribed for the bringing of an action until the date of service of the order making a decision on that application or, in the cases referred to in Article 148(6), of the order designating the lawyer instructed to represent the applicant.\nArticle 148\nDecision on the application for legal aid\n1.   Before giving his decision on an application for legal aid, the President shall prescribe a time limit within which the other main party may submit his written observations unless it is already apparent from the information produced that the conditions laid down in Article 146(1) have not been satisfied or that those laid down in Article 146(2) have been satisfied.\n2.   The decision on the application for legal aid shall be taken by the President by way of an order.\n3.   An order refusing legal aid shall state the reasons on which it is based.\n4.   Any order granting legal aid may designate a lawyer to represent the person concerned if that lawyer has been proposed by the applicant in the application for legal aid and has agreed to represent the applicant before the General Court.\n5.   If the person concerned has not indicated his choice of lawyer in the application for legal aid or following an order granting legal aid or if his choice is unacceptable, the Registrar shall send a copy of the order granting legal aid and a copy of the application to the competent authority of the Member State concerned mentioned in the Rules supplementing the Rules of Procedure of the Court of Justice. If the person concerned is not resident in the Union, the Registrar shall send a copy of the order granting legal aid and a copy of the application to the competent authority of the State in which the Court of Justice of the European Union has its seat.\n6.   Without prejudice to paragraph 4, the lawyer instructed to represent the applicant shall be designated by way of an order, having regard to the suggestions made by the person concerned or to the suggestions made by the authority referred to in paragraph 5, as the case may be.\n7.   An order granting legal aid may specify the amount to be paid to the lawyer instructed to represent the person concerned or fix a limit which the lawyer's disbursements and fees may not, in principle, exceed. It may provide for a contribution to be made by the person concerned to the costs referred to in Article 149(1), having regard to his financial situation.\n8.   No appeal shall lie from orders made under this Article.\n9.   Without prejudice to Article 147(6), service on the applicant for legal aid and on the other parties shall be effected as provided for in Article 80(1).\nArticle 149\nAdvances and responsibility for costs\n1.   Where legal aid is granted, the cashier of the General Court shall be responsible, where applicable within the limits fixed, for costs involved in the assistance and representation of the applicant before the General Court. At the request of the lawyer designated in accordance with Article 148, the President may decide that an amount by way of advance should be paid to that lawyer.\n2.   Where, by virtue of the decision closing the proceedings, the recipient of legal aid has to bear his own costs, the President shall fix the lawyer's disbursements and fees which are to be paid by the cashier of the General Court by way of a reasoned order from which no appeal shall lie.\n3.   Where, in the decision closing the proceedings, the General Court has ordered another party to pay the costs of the recipient of legal aid, that other party shall be required to refund to the cashier of the General Court any sums advanced by way of aid.\n4.   The Registrar shall take steps to obtain the recovery of the sums referred to in paragraph 3 from the party ordered to pay them.\n5.   Where the recipient of the legal aid is unsuccessful, the General Court may, in ruling as to costs in the decision closing the proceedings, if equity so requires, order that one or more parties should bear their own costs or that those costs should be borne, in whole or in part, by the cashier of the General Court by way of legal aid.\nArticle 150\nWithdrawal of legal aid\n1.   If the circumstances which led to the grant of legal aid alter during the proceedings, the President may, of his own motion or on request, withdraw that legal aid, having heard the person concerned.\n2.   An order withdrawing legal aid shall contain a statement of reasons and no appeal shall lie from it.\nChapter 16\nURGENT PROCEDURES\nSection 1\nExpedited procedure\nArticle 151\nDecision relating to the expedited procedure\n1.   The General Court may, at the request of the applicant or the defendant, after hearing the other main party, decide, having regard to the particular urgency and the circumstances of the case, to adjudicate under an expedited procedure. That decision shall be taken as soon as possible.\n2.   On a proposal from the Judge-Rapporteur, the General Court may, in exceptional circumstances, of its own motion and after hearing the main parties, decide to adjudicate under an expedited procedure.\n3.   The decision of the General Court to adjudicate under an expedited procedure may prescribe conditions as to the volume and presentation of the pleadings of the main parties; the subsequent conduct of the proceedings or as to the pleas in law and arguments on which the General Court will be called upon to decide.\n4.   If one of the main parties does not comply with any one of the conditions referred to in paragraph 3, the decision to adjudicate under an expedited procedure may be revoked. The proceedings shall then continue in accordance with the ordinary procedure.\nArticle 152\nRequest for an expedited procedure\n1.   A request for an expedited procedure shall be made by a separate document lodged at the same time as the application initiating the proceedings or the defence, and shall contain a statement of reasons specifying the particular urgency of the case and any other relevant circumstances.\n2.   The request for an expedited procedure may state that certain pleas in law or arguments or certain passages of the application initiating the proceedings or the defence are raised only in the event that the case is not decided under an expedited procedure, in particular by enclosing with the request an abridged version of the application initiating the proceedings and a schedule of annexes and only the annexes which are to be taken into consideration if the case is decided under an expedited procedure.\nArticle 153\nPriority treatment\nBy way of derogation from Article 67(1), cases on which the General Court has decided to adjudicate under an expedited procedure shall be given priority.\nArticle 154\nWritten part of the procedure\n1.   By way of derogation from Article 81(1), where the applicant has requested that the case be decided under an expedited procedure, the period prescribed for the lodging of the defence shall be one month. That period may be extended pursuant to Article 81(3).\n2.   If the General Court decides not to allow a request for an expedited procedure, the defendant shall be granted an additional period of one month in order to lodge or, as the case may be, supplement the defence.\n3.   Under the expedited procedure, the pleadings referred to in Articles 83(1) and 145(1) and (3) may be lodged only if the General Court, by way of measures of organisation of procedure adopted in accordance with Articles 88 to 90, so allows.\n4.   Under the expedited procedure, the President shall take account, when setting the time limits provided for by these Rules, of the particular urgency in adjudicating on the action.\nArticle 155\nOral part of the procedure\n1.   Where the General Court has approved an expedited procedure, it shall decide to open the oral part of the procedure as soon as possible after the presentation of the preliminary report by the Judge-Rapporteur. The General Court may nevertheless decide to rule without an oral part of the procedure where the main parties decide not to participate in a hearing and the General Court considers that it has sufficient information available to it from the material in the file in the case.\n2.   Without prejudice to Articles 84 and 85, the main parties may supplement their arguments and offer further evidence during the oral part of the procedure, provided that the delay in submission is justified.\nSection 2\nSuspension of operation or enforcement and other interim measures\nArticle 156\nApplication for suspension or other interim measures\n1.   An application to suspend the operation of any measure adopted by an institution, made pursuant to Article 278 TFEU or Article 157 TEAEC, shall be admissible only if the applicant has challenged that measure in an action before the General Court.\n2.   An application for the adoption of one of the other interim measures referred to in Article 279 TFEU shall be admissible only if it is made by a main party to a case before the General Court and relates to that case.\n3.   An application of a kind referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 shall state the subject-matter of the proceedings, the circumstances giving rise to urgency and the pleas of fact and law establishing a prima facie case for the interim measure applied for. It shall contain all the evidence and offers of evidence available to justify the grant of interim measures.\n4.   The application shall be made by a separate document and in accordance with the provisions of Articles 76 to 78.\nArticle 157\nProcedure\n1.   The application shall be served on the opposite party, and the President of the General Court shall prescribe a short time limit within which that party may submit written or oral observations.\n2.   The President of the General Court may grant the application even before the observations of the opposite party have been submitted. This decision may be varied or cancelled even without any application being made by any party.\n3.   The President of the General Court shall prescribe, where appropriate, measures of organisation of procedure and measures of inquiry.\n4.   In the event that the President of the General Court is prevented from acting, Articles 11 and 12 shall apply.\nArticle 158\nDecision on the application\n1.   The President of the General Court shall decide on the application by way of a reasoned order. The order shall be served on the parties forthwith.\n2.   The execution of the order may be made conditional on the lodging by the applicant of security, of an amount and nature to be fixed in the light of the circumstances.\n3.   Unless the order fixes the date on which the interim measure is to lapse, the measure shall lapse upon delivery of the final judgment.\n4.   The order shall have only an interim effect, and shall be without prejudice to the decision of the General Court on the substance of the case.\n5.   In the order closing the proceedings for interim relief, costs shall be reserved until the decision of the General Court on the substance of the case. However, if it appears justified in the light of the circumstances of the case, a decision as to the costs relating to the proceedings for interim relief shall be given in the order, pursuant to Articles 134 to 138.\nArticle 159\nChange in circumstances\nOn application by a party, the order may at any time be varied or cancelled on account of a change in circumstances.\nArticle 160\nNew application\nRefusal of an application for an interim measure shall not bar the main party who made it from making a further application on the basis of new facts.\nArticle 161\nApplications pursuant to Articles 280 TFEU, 299 TFEU and 164 TEAEC\n1.   The provisions of this Section shall apply to applications to suspend the enforcement of a decision of the General Court or of any measure adopted by the Council, the European Commission or the European Central Bank, submitted pursuant to Articles 280 TFEU, 299 TFEU or 164 TEAEC.\n2.

The General Court has jurisdiction to rule on:\ncases lodged by individuals or companies against acts of the European Union (EU) institutions which are addressed to them or that affect them directly and individually, including: cases on employment relations between the EU institutions and their staff,actions related to intellectual property rights;\nactions brought by EU Member States against the European Commission;\nactions brought by Member States against certain acts of the Council;\nactions seeking compensation for damage caused by EU institutions or bodies.\nKEY POINTS\n              \nAlong with the Court of Justice, the General Court is one of the EU’s Courts making up the Court of Justice of the European Union. Their purpose is to ensure a uniform interpretation and application of EU law.\nOrganisation of the General Court\nComposition\nSince 1 September 2019, as part of the reform of the EU’s judicial system introduced by Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2015/2422, the General Court comprises 2 judges from each Member State. From among themselves, the judges elect a president and a vice-president who serve for 3 years. Judges must exercise their functions impartially and independently. In exceptional cases, a judge can be given the role of Advocate-General*. Judges appoint a Registrar* for a term of 6 years.\nConstitution of Chambers\nCases brought before the General Court are heard by Chambers sitting with 3 or 5 judges, or, in some cases, a single judge. Judges elect Presidents of Chambers. For each case, one judge is appointed Judge-Rapporteur (who prepares the initial draft of the judgment). The General Court may also sit as a Grand Chamber (15 judges), when required due to the legal complexity or importance of the case.\nGeneral Court deliberations\nThe General Court deliberates in private. Following these discussions, the judges deliver a single judgment.\nLanguage\nThe applicant may choose any of the EU’s 24 official languages for the case. This language is used in the written and oral arguments made by the parties and in the General Court’s communications with the parties.\nRights and obligations of agents and lawyers\nAgents (representing the Member States or the EU institutions) and lawyers enjoy immunity in respect of words that they speak or write. Papers and documents relating to the proceedings may not be searched or seized.\nLawyers must produce a certificate of their authorisation to practise before a court of a Member State.\nProcedure\nThe process may include some or all of the steps listed below:\nWritten phase (exchange of pleadings between the parties): an application by a lawyer or agent and sent to the Registry* opens the procedure. The main points of the action are published in a communication, in all official languages, in the Official Journal of the European Union;the registry serves the application on the defendant who has 2 months to present a defence;in direct actions, in principle, the applicant may submit a reply within a time limit, to which the defendant may respond with a rejoinder.\nThere are specific rules for the treatment of confidential information or documents concerning the EU’s security or that of Member States or the conduct of their international relations.\nWhen a party considers that his/her identity should not be made public, he/she may request the General Court to ‘anonymise’ the relevant case, in whole or in part.\nIn addition, any person who can prove a legal interest in the result of a case submitted to the Court, as well as the Member States institutions, may intervene in the proceedings. The person can submit a statement supporting or rejecting the submissions of one of the parties, to which the parties may then respond.\nOral phase:\nAt the request of one of the parties, or on its own initiative, the General Court may decide to hold a hearing. During the hearing, the judges may question the representatives of the parties. The judges then deliberate on the basis of the draft judgment prepared by the Judge-Rapporteur and the judgment is delivered in public.\nLegal aid may be granted to cover the costs of legal representation before the General Court.\nExpedited (accelerated) procedure:\nThis procedure allows the General Court to rule quickly on the substance of a dispute in cases considered to be particularly urgent. The accelerated procedure may be requested by the applicant or by the defendant. It can also be decided by the General Court on its own initiative.\nInterim measures\nA proceeding before the General Court does not suspend the contested act. The General Court may, however, order a suspension or order other interim measures if certain conditions are met. The order is provisional and does not prejudge the General Court’s decision in the main proceedings.\nLitigation relating to intellectual property rights\nThis type of litigation concerns actions brought against the decisions of the European Union Intellectual Property Office (EUIPO) on the application of intellectual property rights and against the decisions of the Community Plant Variety Office (CPVO), related to the protection of plant variety rights.\nThe Rules of Procedure lay down procedures regarding the parties to the proceedings, the application and the responses.\nStakeholders other than the applicants may intervene during the procedure and have the same rights as the main parties.\ne-Curia\nIn 2018, the Rules of Procedure of the General Court were amended making it mandatory to use e-Curia, an application of the Court of Justice of the European Union which allows the representatives of parties in cases brought before the General Court, to exchange procedural documents with the General Court's Registry exclusively by electronic means.\nFROM WHEN DO THE RULES OF PROCEDURE APPLY?\n              \nThey have applied since 1 July 2015.\nThey replaced the Rules of Procedure of the General Court of 2 May 1991.\nBACKGROUND\n              \nFor more information, see:\nGeneral Court — presentation (Curia — Court of Justice of the European Union)\nCourt of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) (European Union).\nKEY TERMS\n              \nAdvocate-General: there are no permanent advocates-general at the General Court.
