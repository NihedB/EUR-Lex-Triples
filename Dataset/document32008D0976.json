{"celex_id": "32008D0976", "reference": "24.12.2008\nEN\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\nL 348/130\nCOUNCIL DECISION 2008/976/JHA\nof 16 December 2008\non the European Judicial Network\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on European Union, and in particular Articles 31 and 34(2)(c) thereof,\nHaving regard to the initiative of the Kingdom of Belgium, the Czech Republic, the Republic of Estonia, the Kingdom of Spain, the French Republic, the Italian Republic, the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, the Kingdom of the Netherlands, the Republic of Austria, the Republic of Poland, the Portuguese Republic, the Republic of Slovenia, the Slovak Republic and the Kingdom of Sweden,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European Parliament (1),\nWhereas:\n(1)\nBy Joint Action 98/428/JHA (2), the Council set up the European Judicial Network which has demonstrated its usefulness in the facilitation of judicial cooperation in criminal matters.\n(2)\nIn accordance with Article 6 of the Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters between the Member States of the European Union (3), mutual legal assistance takes place through direct contacts between competent judicial authorities. This decentralisation of mutual legal assistance is now widely implemented.\n(3)\nThe principle of mutual recognition of judicial decisions in criminal matters is being implemented gradually. It not only confirms the principle of direct contacts between competent judicial authorities, it also accelerates the procedures and makes them entirely judicial.\n(4)\nThe impact of these changes on judicial cooperation was further increased by the enlargement of the European Union in 2004 and 2007. Because of this evolution, the European Judicial Network is even more necessary than at the time of its creation and should therefore be strengthened.\n(5)\nBy Decision 2002/187/JHA (4), the Council set up Eurojust to improve coordination and cooperation between competent authorities of the Member States. Decision 2002/187/JHA provides that Eurojust is to maintain privileged relations with the European Judicial Network based on consultation and complementarity.\n(6)\nFive years of coexistence of Eurojust and the European Judicial Network have demonstrated both the need to maintain the two structures and the need to clarify their relationship.\n(7)\nNothing in this Decision should be construed to affect the independence that contact points may have under national law.\n(8)\nIt is necessary to strengthen judicial cooperation between the Member States and to allow contact points of the European Judicial Network and Eurojust for this purpose to communicate, whenever needed, directly and more efficiently through a secure telecommunications connection.\n(9)\nJoint Action 98/428/JHA should therefore be repealed and replaced by this Decision,\nHAS DECIDED AS FOLLOWS:\nArticle 1\nCreation\nThe network of judicial contact points set up between the Member States under Joint Action 98/428/JHA, hereinafter referred to as the ‘European Judicial Network’, shall continue to operate in accordance with the provisions of this Decision.\nArticle 2\nComposition\n1.   The European Judicial Network shall be made up, taking into account the constitutional rules, legal traditions and internal structure of each Member State, of the central authorities responsible for international judicial cooperation and the judicial or other competent authorities with specific responsibilities within the context of international cooperation.\n2.   One or more contact points of each Member State shall be established in accordance with its internal rules and internal division of responsibilities, care being taken to ensure effective coverage of the whole of its territory.\n3.   Each Member State shall appoint, among the contact points, a national correspondent for the European Judicial Network.\n4.   Each Member State shall appoint a tool correspondent for the European Judicial Network.\n5.   Each Member State shall ensure that its contact points have functions in relation to judicial cooperation in criminal matters and adequate knowledge of a language of the European Union other than its own national language, bearing in mind the need to be able to communicate with the contact points in the other Member States.\n6.   Where the liaison magistrates referred to in Council Joint Action 96/277/JHA of 22 April 1996 concerning a framework for the exchange of liaison magistrates to improve judicial cooperation between the Member States of the European Union (5) have been appointed in a Member State and have duties analogous to those assigned by Article 4 of this Decision to the contact points, they shall be linked to the European Judicial Network and to the secure telecommunications connection pursuant to Article 9 of this Decision by the Member State appointing the liaison magistrate in each case, in accordance with the procedures to be laid down by that Member State.\n7.   The Commission shall designate a contact point for those areas falling within its sphere of competence.\n8.

From among each country’s delegation a national correspondent and a tool correspondent, who deals with the new telecommunications channel, are designated.\nContact points work in judicial cooperation in criminal matters and must have language skills to be better able to communicate with their counterparts. Any national liaison magistrates already appointed must be linked to the EJN. The European Commission (EC) is also represented, and the EJN is administered by a secretariat.\nFunctions\nThe EJN operates to facilitate communication between the contact points, organising meetings and issuing background information.\nThe contact points facilitate judicial cooperation between EU countries, particularly in actions to combat serious crime, and enable appropriate communication and information sharing with contact points and judicial authorities in other EU countries.\nIn addition, contact points promote and participate in the organisation of training sessions, working with the European Judicial Training Network where appropriate.\nFull EJN meetings, to which at least three contact points from each country are invited, are held at least three times a year, and provide a forum for discussion of judicial cooperation issues, particularly in relation to EU legislation. Discussions serve as a basis for possible legislation and improvements in international cooperation. National and tool correspondents meet at least yearly on an ad hoc basis.\nSecretariat\nThe secretariat provides contact points with up-to-date information on national judicial and procedural systems and relevant legal texts through a website. In addition, it establishes a secure telecommunications channel for data and judicial cooperation requests.\nThe secretariat is funded by the budget of Eurojust, a complementary organisation enjoying a privileged relationship with the EJN based on consultation and information-sharing.\nAccountability\nEvery 2 years the EJN reports to the European Parliament, the Council and the EC on its activities, and every 4 years the Council carries out an operational assessment of the EJN based on a joint report produced by the EJN and the EC.\nBACKGROUND\nThe principle of mutual recognition of judicial decisions in criminal matters is being implemented gradually, with increasing direct contact between judicial authorities. Because of these changes and the enlargement of the EU in 2004 and 2007, the EJN has become increasingly important.\nFor further information see the European Judicial Network website\nWHEN DOES THE DECISION APPLY?\nFrom 24 December 2008.\nKEY TERMS\n* Eurojust: the EU’s judicial cooperation unit.\nREFERENCES\nAct\nEntry into force\nDeadline for transposition in the Member States\nOfficial Journal\nDecision 2008/976/JHA\n24.12.2008\n-\nOJ L 348 of 24.12.2008, pp. 130-134\nRELATED ACTS\nResolution of the Council and of the Representatives of the Governments of the Member States, meeting within the Council, on the establishment of a Network for legislative cooperation between the Ministries of Justice of the European Union (Official Journal C 326 of 20.12.2008, pp. 1-2).\nLast updated: 12.06.2015", "tags": ["information network", "information technology", "judicial cooperation in criminal matters in the EU", "operation of the Institutions", "criminal law", "exchange of information", "Eurojust"], "subjects": ["Justice and home affairs"], "split": "train", "reference_annotations": {}, "summary_annotations": {}}
