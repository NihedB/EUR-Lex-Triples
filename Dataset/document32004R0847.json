That obligation to cooperate flows from the requirement of unity in the international representation of the Community. The Community institutions and the Member States should take all necessary steps to ensure the best possible cooperation in that regard.\n(5)\nThe cooperation procedure between Member States and the Commission established by this Regulation should be without prejudice to the division of competencies between the Community and Member States, in accordance with Community law as interpreted by the Court of Justice.\n(6)\nAll existing bilateral agreements between Member States and third countries that contain provisions contrary to Community law should be amended or replaced by new agreements that are wholly compatible with Community law.\n(7)\nWithout prejudice to the Treaty, and in particular Article 300 thereof, Member States may wish to make amendments to existing agreements and make provision to manage their implementation until such time as an agreement concluded by the Community enters into force.\n(8)\nIt is essential to ensure that a Member State conducting negotiations takes account of Community law, broader Community interests and ongoing Community negotiations.\n(9)\nIf a Member State wishes to involve air carriers in the process of negotiation, all air carriers with an establishment in the territory of the Member State concerned should be treated equally.\n(10)\nEstablishment on the territory of a Member State implies the effective and real exercise of air transport activity through stable arrangements; the legal form of such an establishment, whether a branch or a subsidiary with a legal personality, should not be the determining factor in this respect. When an undertaking is established on the territory of several Member States, as defined by the Treaty, it should ensure, in order to avoid any circumvention of national law, that each of the establishments fulfils the obligations which may, in accordance with Community law, be imposed by the national law applicable to its activities.\n(11)\nIn order to ensure that the rights of Community air carriers are not unduly restricted, no new arrangements that reduce the number of Community air carriers which may be designated to provide air services in a given market should be introduced in bilateral air service agreements.\n(12)\nMember States should establish non-discriminatory and transparent procedures for the distribution of traffic rights between Community air carriers. In applying those procedures Member States should have due regard to the need to preserve continuity of air services.\n(13)\nThe measures necessary for the implementation of this Regulation should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 19.99 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission (3).\n(14)\nAny Member State may invoke the confidentiality of the provisions of bilateral agreements it has negotiated and request the Commission not to share the information with other Member States.\n(15)\nArrangements for greater cooperation over the use of Gibraltar airport were agreed in London on 2 December 1987 by the Kingdom of Spain and the United Kingdom in a joint declaration by the Ministers of Foreign Affairs of the two countries. Such arrangements have yet to enter into operation.\n(16)\nSince the objectives of this Regulation, namely the coordination of negotiations with third countries with a view to concluding air service agreements, the necessity to guarantee a harmonised approach in the implementation and application of those agreements and the verification of their compliance with Community law, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore, by reason of the Community-wide scope of this Regulation, be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives,\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nArticle 1\nNotification to the Commission\n1.   A Member State may, without prejudice to the respective competencies of the Community and its Member States, enter into negotiations with a third country concerning a new air service agreement or the modification of an existing air service agreement, its Annexes or any other related bilateral or multilateral arrangement, the subject matter of which falls partly within the competence of the Community, provided that:\n—\nany relevant standard clauses, developed and laid down jointly between Member States and the Commission, are included in such negotiations; and\n—\nthe notification procedure set out in paragraphs 2, 3 and 4 is complied with.\nWhere appropriate, the Commission shall be invited to participate as an observer in any such negotiations.\n2.   Where a Member State intends to enter into such negotiations it shall notify the Commission of its intentions in writing. This notification shall include a copy of the existing agreement, if available, other relevant documentation and an indication of the provisions to be addressed in the negotiations, the objectives of the negotiations and any other relevant information. The Commission shall make the notification and, on request, the accompanying documentation, available to other Member States, subject to the requirements of confidentiality.\nThe information shall be transmitted at least one calendar month before formal negotiations are scheduled to commence with the third country concerned. If, due to exceptional circumstances, formal negotiations are scheduled at less than one month's notice, the Member State shall transmit the information as soon as possible.\n3.   Member States may make comments to the Member State which has notified its intention to enter into negotiations in accordance with paragraph 2. That Member State shall take such comments into account as far as possible in the course of the negotiations.\n4.   If, within 15 working days of receipt of the notification referred to in paragraph 2, the Commission concludes that the negotiations are likely to:\n—\nundermine the objectives of Community negotiations underway with the third country concerned, and/or\n—\nlead to an agreement which is incompatible with Community law\nit shall inform the Member State accordingly.\nArticle 2\nConsultation of stakeholders and participation in negotiations\nInsofar as air carriers and other interested parties are to be involved in the negotiations referred to in Article 1, Member States shall treat equally all Community air carriers with an establishment on their respective territories to which the Treaty applies.\nArticle 3\nProhibition on introducing more restrictive arrangements\nA Member State shall not enter into any new arrangement with a third country, which reduces the number of Community air carriers which may, in accordance with existing arrangements, be designated to provide services between its territory and that country, neither in respect of the entire air transport market between the two parties nor on the basis of specific city pairs.\nArticle 4\nConclusion of agreements\n1.   Upon signature of an agreement, the Member State concerned shall notify the Commission of the outcome of the negotiations together with any relevant documentation.\n2.   Where the negotiations have resulted in an agreement which incorporates the relevant standard clauses referred to in Article 1(1), the Member State shall be authorised to conclude the agreement.\n3.   Where the negotiations have resulted in an agreement which does not incorporate the relevant standard clauses referred to in Article 1(1), the Member State shall be authorised, in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 7(2), to conclude the agreement, provided that this does not harm the object and purpose of the Community common transport policy. The Member State may provisionally apply the agreement pending the outcome of this procedure.\n4.   Notwithstanding paragraphs 2 and 3, if the Commission is actively negotiating with the same third country on the basis of a country-specific mandate or on the basis of Council Decision 2004/.../EC of... authorising the Commission to open negotiations with third countries on the replacement of certain provisions in existing bilateral agreements with a Community agreement (4), the Member State concerned may be authorised, in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 7(2), to apply provisionally and/or conclude the agreement.\nArticle 5\nDistribution of traffic rights\nWhere a Member State concludes an agreement, or amendments to an agreement or its Annexes, that provide for limitations on the use of traffic rights or the number of Community air carriers eligible to be designated to take advantage of traffic rights, that Member State shall ensure a distribution of traffic rights among eligible Community air carriers on the basis of a non-discriminatory and transparent procedure.\nArticle 6\nPublication of procedures\nMember States shall inform the Commission without delay of the procedures that they shall apply for the purposes of Article 5 and, where appropriate, Article 2. For information purposes, the Commission shall ensure that these procedures are published in the Official Journal of the European Union within eight weeks of their receipt. Any new procedures and subsequent changes to existing procedures shall be communicated to the Commission at least eight weeks before they enter into force, so that the Commission can ensure their publication in the Official Journal of the European Union within that eight-week period.\nArticle 7\nCommittee procedure\n1.   The Commission shall be assisted by the committee established under Article 11 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2408/92 of 23 July 1992 on access for Community air carriers to intra-Community air routes (5).\n2.   Where reference is made to this paragraph, Articles 3 and 7 of Decision 1999/468/EC shall apply, having regard to the provisions of Article 8 thereof.\n3.   The Committee shall adopt its rules of procedure.\nArticle 8\nConfidentiality\nIn notifying the Commission of negotiations and their outcome as envisaged in Articles 1 and 4, Member States shall clearly inform the Commission if any information therein is to be considered confidential and whether it can be shared with other Member States. The Commission and Member States shall ensure that any information identified as confidential is treated according to Article 4(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 30 May 2001 regarding public access to European Parliament, Council and Commission documents (6).\nArticle 9\nGibraltar\n1.   The application of this Regulation to the airport of Gibraltar is understood to be without prejudice to the respective legal positions of the Kingdom of Spain and the United Kingdom with regard to the dispute over sovereignty over the territory in which the airport is situated.\n2.   Application of this Regulation to Gibraltar airport shall be suspended until the arrangements included in the Joint Declaration made by the Foreign Ministers of the Kingdom of Spain and the United Kingdom on 2 December 1987 enter into operation. The Governments of Spain and the United Kingdom will inform the Council of such date of entry into operation.\nArticle 10\nEntry into force\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on the thirtieth day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.\nDone at Strasbourg, 29.4.2004.\nFor the European Parliament\nThe President\nP.

Since then, a large number of these have been brought into conformity with EU law.\nObjective\nThose ASAs not complying with EU law need to be amended in order to:\nensure legal certainty in such agreements for both parties;\nguarantee all EU airlines the right of establishment within the EU, including non-discriminatory market access to routes between all EU countries and non-EU countries where ASAs existed.\nAmending an ASA\nThere are 2 ways to amend an ASA:\nHorizontal agreements — acting on behalf of the EU countries concerned which have bilateral ASAs with a non-EU country, the European Commission negotiates a single agreement with that non-EU country.\nBilateral negotiations — amending or replacing each ASA individually.\nRules and procedure for bilateral negotiations\nAn EU country can enter into bilateral negotiations to amend or replace an ASA which falls partly within the competence of the EU if it follows the rules and procedure set out in the regulation:\nany relevant standard clauses, developed jointly between EU countries and the Commission, are included in such negotiations and the notification procedure is complied with;\nit notifies the Commission of its intentions in writing.\nIf, within 15 working days of receiving the notification, the Commission concludes that such negotiations are likely to undermine the objectives of EU negotiations already taking place with the non-EU country and/or lead to an agreement which is incompatible with EU law, it must inform the EU country accordingly.\nAn EU country may not enter into any new arrangement with a non-EU country that reduces the number of EU air carriers allowed to provide services between its territory and that country.\nFROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?\n              \nIt entered into force on 30 May 2004.\nBACKGROUND\nExternal Aviation Policy — Horizontal Agreements.\nMAIN DOCUMENT\n            \nRegulation (EC) No 847/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on the negotiation and implementation of air service agreements between Member States and third countries (OJ L 157, 30.4.2004, pp. 7–17)\nCorrigendum to Regulation (EC) No 847/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on the negotiation and implementation of air service agreements between Member States and third countries (OJ L 157, 30.4.2004) (OJ L 195, 2.6.2004, pp. 3–6)\nRELATED DOCUMENTS\n            \nCouncil Regulation (EEC) No 2408/92 of 23 July 1992 on access for Community air carriers to intra-Community air routes (OJ L 240, 24.8.1992, pp. 8–14)\nSuccessive amendments to Regulation (EEC) No 2408/92 have been incorporated into the basic text.
