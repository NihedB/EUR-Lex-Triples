That Decision has subsequently been amended and replaced several times, most recently by Council Decision 2011/871/CFSP (2).\n(7)\nThe Union is capable of conducting military rapid response operations in accordance with the concept defined by the EU Military Committee. The Union is capable of deploying Battle Groups in accordance with the concept defined by the EU Military Committee.\n(8)\nThe scheme for early financing is intended first and foremost for rapid response operations.\n(9)\nExercises at the political and military strategic level of the command and control structures and procedures for Union military operations through Union headquarters exercises, as approved by the Political and Security Committee (PSC), contribute to enhancing the Union's overall operational readiness.\n(10)\nThe Council decides on a case-by-case basis whether an operation has military or defence implications, within the meaning of Article 41(2) of the Treaty on European Union (TEU).\n(11)\nThe second subparagraph of Article 41(2) of the TEU provides that Member States whose representatives in the Council have made a formal declaration pursuant to the second subparagraph of Article 31(1) thereof, shall not be obliged to contribute to the financing of the operation having military or defence implications concerned.\n(12)\nIn accordance with Article 5 of the Protocol No 22 on the position of Denmark annexed to the TEU and to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, Denmark does not participate in the elaboration and implementation of decisions and actions of the Union which have defence implications. Denmark does not participate in this decision and therefore does not participate in the financing of the mechanism.\n(13)\nProvisions should be adopted to ensure that Athena protects individuals with regard to the processing of their personal data.\n(14)\nPursuant to Article 43 of Decision 2011/871/CFSP, the Council has reviewed that Decision and agreed to amend it.\n(15)\nFor the sake of clarity, Decision 2011/871/CFSP should be repealed and replaced by a new Decision,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\nArticle 1\nDefinitions\nFor the purpose of this Decision:\n(a)\n‘participating Member States’ means the Member States of the Union, except Denmark;\n(b)\n‘contributing States’ means the Member States contributing to the financing of the military operation in question in accordance with Article 41(2) of the TEU and the third States contributing to the financing of the common costs of this operation pursuant to agreements between them and the Union;\n(c)\n‘operations’ means the Union operations having military or defence implications;\n(d)\n‘military supporting actions’ means the Union operations, or parts thereof, decided by the Council in support of a third State or a third organisation, which have military or defence implications, but which are not under the authority of Union Headquarters;\n(e)\n‘day’ refers to a calendar day, not a working day, unless otherwise indicated.\nCHAPTER 1\nMECHANISM\nArticle 2\nEstablishment of the mechanism\n1.

Such arrangements shall be:\n(a)\nsubject to consultation of the Special Committee if they are concluded with Member States, Union institutions or bodies;\n(b)\nsubmitted for approval to the Special Committee if they are concluded with third States or international organisations.\n3.   Such arrangements shall be signed by the administrator or, where appropriate, the respective operation commander, acting on behalf of Athena, and by the competent administrative authorities of the other parties referred to in paragraph 1.\n4.   Framework contracts may be concluded in order to facilitate procurement in the most cost-effective manner. Such contracts shall be submitted for approval to the Special Committee before being signed by the administrator and shall be made available to Member States and operation commanders should they wish to make use of them. This provision will impose no obligation on any Member State to avail of or to procure goods or services on the basis of a framework contract.\nArticle 12\nStanding and ad hoc administrative arrangements on modalities for the payment of third States' contributions\n1.   In the framework of the agreements concluded between the Union and third States indicated by the Council as potential contributors to Union operations or as contributors to a specific Union operation, the administrator shall negotiate with these third States standing or ad hoc administrative arrangements. These arrangements shall take the form of an Exchange of Letters between Athena and the competent administrative services of the third States concerned establishing the modalities necessary to facilitate swift payment of contributions.\n2.   Pending the conclusion of the agreements referred to in paragraph 1, the administrator may take the necessary measures to facilitate payments by the contributing third States.\n3.   The administrator shall inform the Special Committee in advance of the envisaged arrangements referred to in paragraph 1, before signing them on behalf of Athena.\n4.   When a military operation is launched by the Union, the administrator shall, for the amounts of contributions decided by the Council, implement the arrangements with the third States contributing to that operation.\nCHAPTER 4\nBANK ACCOUNTS\nArticle 13\nOpening and purpose\n1.   Any bank account shall be opened at a first-rate financial institution with its head office in a Member State and shall be a current or a short-term account in euro. In duly warranted circumstances, and after approval of the administrator, accounts may be opened at financial institutions with head office outside the Member States.\n2.   In duly warranted circumstances, accounts may be opened in currencies other than the euro.\n3.   The contributions from contributing States shall be paid into these bank accounts. They shall be used to make the necessary advances to the operation commander for the implementation of expenditure relating to the common costs of a military operation.\n4.   The contributions pursuant to Article 28 and 30 shall each be paid in separate bank accounts. They shall be used to implement the expenditures for which the administration has been entrusted to Athena as specified in the respective Articles.\nArticle 14\nManagement of funds\n1.   Any payment from Athena's account shall require the joint signature of the administrator or a deputy administrator on the one hand and the accounting officer or a deputy accounting officer on the other.\n2.   No bank account may be overdrawn.\nCHAPTER 5\nCOMMON COSTS\nArticle 15\nDefinition of common costs and periods for eligibility\n1.   The common costs listed in Annex I shall be at the expense of Athena whenever they are incurred. When entered in an article of the budget showing the operation to which they are most related, they shall be regarded as operational costs of that operation. Otherwise, they shall be regarded as common costs incurred in preparation for, or following, operations.\n2.   Furthermore, Athena shall bear the operational common costs listed in Annex II during the period from the approval of the crisis management concept for the operation until the appointment of the operation commander. In particular circumstances, after the PSC has been consulted, the Special Committee may modify the period during which these costs shall be borne by Athena.\n3.   During the active phase of an operation, which runs from the date on which the operation commander is appointed to the day on which the operation headquarters ceases its activity, Athena shall bear as operational common costs:\n(a)\nthe common costs listed in Part A of Annex III;\n(b)\nthe common costs listed in Part B of Annex III, when the Council so decides;\n(c)\nthe common costs listed in Part C of Annex III, when the operation commander so requests and if the Special Committee approves it.\n4.   During the active phase of a military supporting action, as determined by the Council, Athena shall bear as operational common costs the common costs defined by the Council on a case-by-case basis by reference to Annex III.\n5.   The operational common costs of an operation also include the expenditure necessary to wind it up, as listed in Annex IV.\nThe operation is wound up when the equipment and infrastructure commonly funded for the operation have found their final destination and the accounts for the operation have been approved.\n6.   No expenditure incurred with a view to covering costs which would in any case have been borne by one or more contributing States, a Union institution or an international organisation, independently of the organisation of an operation, may be eligible as a common cost.\n7.   The Special Committee may decide on a case-by-case basis that, in view of particular circumstances, certain incremental costs other than those listed in Part B of Annex III shall be regarded as common costs for one given operation during its active phase.\n8.   If unanimity cannot be achieved in the Special Committee, the latter may, at the initiative of the Presidency, refer the question to the Council.\nArticle 16\nExercises\n1.   The common costs of the Union's exercises shall be financed through Athena following the rules and procedures similar to those for operations to which all participating Member States contribute.\n2.   These exercise common costs shall be composed of, firstly, incremental costs for deployable or fixed headquarters and, secondly, incremental costs incurred by the Union recourse to NATO common assets and capabilities when made available for an exercise.\n3.   Exercise common costs shall not include costs related to:\n(a)\ncapital acquisitions, including those related to buildings, infrastructure and equipment;\n(b)\nthe planning and preparatory phase of exercises, unless approved by the Special Committee;\n(c)\ntransport, barracks and lodging for forces.\nArticle 17\nReference amount\nAny Council decision by which the Council decides to establish or extend a Union military operation shall contain a reference amount for the common costs of that operation. The administrator shall, with the support in particular of the Union military staff and, if he or she is in office, the operation commander, evaluate the amount judged necessary to cover the common costs of the operation for the planned period. The administrator shall propose this amount through the Presidency to the Council body responsible for examining the draft decision. The members of the Special Committee shall be invited to the discussions of this body concerning the reference amount.\nCHAPTER 6\nBUDGET\nArticle 18\nBudgetary principles\n1.   The budget, drawn up in euro, is the act which for each financial year lays down and authorises all the revenue and expenditure relating to common costs administered by Athena.\n2.   All expenditure shall be linked to a specific operation, except where appropriate for the costs listed in Annex I.\n3.   The appropriations entered in the budget are authorised for the duration of a financial year which begins on 1 January and ends on 31 December of the same year.\n4.   Budget revenue and expenditure shall be in balance.\n5.   No revenue or expenditure relating to common costs may be implemented other than by allocation to a heading in the budget and within the limit of the appropriations entered there, except pursuant to Article 34(5).\nArticle 19\nAnnual budget\n1.   Each year the administrator shall draw up a draft budget for the following financial year, with the assistance of each operation commander for his or her operation.\n2.   The draft shall include:\n(a)\nthe appropriations deemed necessary to cover the common costs incurred in preparation for, or further to, operations;\n(b)\nthe appropriations deemed necessary to cover the operational common costs for ongoing or planned operations, including, where appropriate, to reimburse common costs which have been pre-financed by a State or third party;\n(c)\nthe provisional appropriations as referred to in Article 26;\n(d)\na forecast of the revenue needed to cover expenditure.\n3.   The commitment and payment appropriations shall be classified in titles and chapters grouping expenditure together by type or purpose, subdivided as necessary into articles. Detailed comments by chapter or article shall be included in the draft budget. One specific title shall be dedicated to each operation. One specific title shall be the general part of the budget and shall include the common costs incurred in preparation for, or further to, operations.\n4.   Each title may include a chapter entitled ‘provisional appropriations’. These appropriations shall be entered where there is uncertainty, based on serious grounds, about the amount of appropriations needed or the scope for implementing the appropriations entered.\n5.   Revenue shall consist of:\n(a)\ncontributions payable by the participating and contributing Member States and, where appropriate, by contributing third States;\n(b)\nmiscellaneous revenue, subdivided by title, which includes interest received, revenue from sales and the budget outturn from the previous financial year, after it has been determined by the Special Committee.\n6.   The administrator shall propose the draft budget to the Special Committee by 31 October at the latest. The Special Committee shall approve the draft budget by 31 December. The administrator shall adopt the approved budget and notify the participating Member States and contributing third States.\nArticle 20\nAmending budgets\n1.   In the case of unavoidable, exceptional or unforeseen circumstances, including when an operation is launched during the course of the financial year, the administrator shall propose a draft amending budget. The draft amending budget shall be drawn up, proposed, approved and adopted and notification given in accordance with the same procedure as the annual budget. The Special Committee shall discuss it taking account of its urgency.\n2.   When this draft amending budget results from the launching of a new operation or changes in the budget of an ongoing operation, the administrator will inform the Special Committee of the total costs foreseen for this operation. If these costs substantially exceed the relevant reference amount, the Special Committee may request the Council to approve it.\n3.   The draft amending budget resulting from the launching of a new operation shall be submitted to the Special Committee within a period of four months after the approval of the reference amount, unless the Special Committee decides on a longer deadline.\nArticle 21\nTransfers\n1.   The administrator, where appropriate on the basis of a proposal by the operation commander, may make transfers of appropriations. The administrator shall inform the Special Committee of his or her intention, in so far as the urgency of the situation permits, at least one week in advance. However, the prior approval of the Special Committee shall be required when:\n(a)\nthe planned transfer will amend the total of the appropriations provided for an operation;\nor\n(b)\nthe planned transfers between chapters during the financial year exceed 10 % of the appropriations entered in the chapter from which the appropriations are being drawn, as appearing in the adopted budget for the financial year on the date when the proposal for the transfer in question is made.\n2.   When he or she deems this to be necessary for the proper conduct of an operation, in the three months following the date of launching of the operation, the operation commander may make transfers of appropriations allocated for the operation, between articles and between chapters in the ‘operational common costs’ section of the budget. He or she shall inform the administrator and the Special Committee thereof.\nArticle 22\nCarryover of appropriations\n1.   In principle, the appropriations intended to cover the common costs incurred in preparation for, or further to, operations, which have not been committed are cancelled at the end of the financial year, if not otherwise provided for in paragraph 2.\n2.   Appropriations intended to cover the cost of storing material and equipment administered by Athena may be carried over once to the following financial year, when a commitment to that effect was made before 31 December of the current financial year. Appropriations intended to cover operational common costs may be carried over if they are necessary for an operation which has not been fully wound up.\n3.   The administrator shall submit proposals for the carrying over of non-committed appropriations from the preceding financial year to the Special Committee by 15 February. These proposals shall be deemed approved unless the Special Committee decides otherwise by 15 March.\n4.   The committed appropriations from the preceding financial year shall be carried over and the Special Committee shall be informed thereof by the administrator by 15 February.\nArticle 23\nAnticipated implementation\nOnce the annual budget has been approved, appropriations may be used to cover commitments and payments in so far as operationally necessary.\nCHAPTER 7\nCONTRIBUTIONS AND REIMBURSEMENTS\nArticle 24\nDetermination of contributions\n1.   Payment appropriations to cover the common costs incurred in preparation for, or further to, operations which are not covered by miscellaneous revenue shall be financed by contributions from the participating Member States.\n2.   Payment appropriations to cover the operational common costs of an operation shall be covered by contributions from the contributing States.\n3.   The contributions payable by the contributing Member States for an operation shall be equal to the amount of the payment appropriations entered in the budget and intended to cover the operational common costs of that operation, after deduction of the amounts of the contributions payable for the same operation by contributing third States pursuant to Article 12.\n4.   The breakdown of contributions between the Member States from whom a contribution is required shall be determined in accordance with the gross national product scale as specified in Article 41(2) of the TEU and in accordance with the Council Decision 2014/335/EU, Euratom (3), or any other Council Decision which may replace it.\n5.   The data for the calculation of contributions shall be those set out in the ‘GNI-based own resources’ column in the ‘Summary of financing of the general budget by type of own resource and by Member State’ table appended to the latest general budget adopted by the Union. The contribution of each Member State from whom a contribution is due shall be proportional to the share of gross national income (GNI) of that Member State in the total GNI aggregate of the Member States from whom a contribution is due.\nArticle 25\nSchedule for payment of contributions\n1.   When the Council has adopted a reference amount for a Union military operation, the contributing Member States shall pay their contributions at the level of 30 % of the reference amount, unless the Council decides on a different percentage. The administrator shall call for contributions according to operational needs for the operation up to the agreed level.\n2.   The Special Committee, on the basis of a proposal by the administrator, may decide that additional contributions will be called before the adoption of an amending budget for the operation. The Special Committee may decide to refer the matter to the competent preparatory bodies at the Council.\n3.   When an amending budget has been adopted for a specific operation, the Member States shall pay the balance of the contributions which they owe for that operation in application of Article 24. However, when the operation is planned to last more than six months within a financial year, the balance of contributions shall be paid in two instalments. In such a case, the first instalment shall be paid within 60 days of the launching of the operation; the second instalment shall be paid by a deadline to be set by the Special Committee acting on a proposal from the administrator, taking into account operational needs. The Special Committee may depart from the provisions of this paragraph.\n4.   The administrator shall send the corresponding calls for contributions by letter to the national administrations whose details have been communicated to him or her when:\n(a)\na draft budget for a financial year is approved by the Special Committee provided for in Article 19. The first call for contributions covers the operational needs for eight months. The second call for contributions covers the remaining balance of contributions, taking into account the balance of the previous year budget outturn if the Special Committee decided to enter this balance in the current budget after the audit opinion has been received;\n(b)\na reference amount has been adopted as provided for in Article 25(1); or\n(c)\nan amending budget is approved as provided for in Article 20.\n5.   Without prejudice to the other provisions in this Decision, the contributions shall be paid within 30 days following despatch of the relevant call for contributions, with the exception of the first call for contributions for a new financial year's budget, where the deadline for payment shall be 40 days following dispatch of the relevant call for contributions.\n6.   Once the draft aggregated budget has been submitted to the Special Committee, for those Member States with budgetary and financial procedures not allowing payment of their contribution within the established deadlines the administrator may issue to the State concerned, an anticipated call for contributions before the end of the current financial year as a prepayment for the call for contributions for the following financial year's budget.\n7.   Each contributing State shall pay the bank charges relating to the payment of its own contribution.\n8.   The administrator shall acknowledge receipt of contributions.\nArticle 26\nEarly financing\n1.   In the case of a Union military rapid response operation, contributions shall be due by contributing Member States at the level of the reference amount. Without prejudice to Article 25(3), payments shall be made as defined below.\n2.   For the purpose of the early financing of the Union military rapid response operations, the participating Member States shall either:\n(a)\npay contributions to Athena in advance; or\n(b)\nwhen the Council decides to conduct a Union military rapid response operation to the financing of which they contribute, pay their contributions to the common costs of that operation within five days following despatch of the call at the level of the reference amount, unless the Council decides otherwise.\n3.   For the purpose referred to in paragraph 2, the Special Committee, composed of one representative of each of the Member States contributing in advance, shall establish provisional appropriations in a specific title in the budget. These provisional appropriations shall be covered by contributions payable by the Member States contributing in advance within 90 days following despatch of the call for these contributions.\n4.   Any provisional appropriations referred to in paragraph 3 which are used for an operation shall be replenished within 90 days following despatch of the call.\n5.   Without prejudice to paragraph 1, any Member State contributing in advance may in specific circumstances authorise the administrator to use its contribution paid in advance to cover its contribution to an operation in which it participates, other than a rapid response operation. The contribution paid in advance shall be replenished by the Member State concerned within 90 days following despatch of the call.\n6.   Where funds are required for an operation, other than a rapid response operation, before sufficient contributions to that operation have been received:\n(a)\ncontributions paid in advance by Member States which contribute to financing that operation after approval by the Member States contributing in advance, may be used up to 75 % of their amount to cover contributions due to that operation. The contributions paid in advance shall be replenished by the Member States contributing in advance within 90 days following despatch of the call;\n(b)\nin the case referred to in point (a) of this paragraph, contributions due for the operation under Article 25(1) from Member States that had not contributed in advance shall be paid, after approval by the Member States concerned, within five days following despatch of the call by the administrator.\n7.   The operation commander may commit and pay the amounts made available to him or her, including pursuant to Article 34(3).\n8.   Any Member State may reverse its option by notifying the administrator at least three months in advance.\n9.   Interest earned on the early financing will be apportioned annually to the Member States contributing in advance and added to their provisional appropriations. The amounts will be notified to those Member States as part of the annual budgetary approval process.\nArticle 27\nReimbursement of pre-financing\n1.   A Member State, a third State or, as appropriate, an international organisation which has been authorised by the Council to pre-finance a part of the common costs of an operation may obtain reimbursement from Athena by making a request accompanied by the necessary supporting documents and addressed to the administrator at the latest two months after the date of completion of the operation concerned.\n2.   No request for reimbursement may be honoured if it has not been approved by the operation commander, if still in office, and by the administrator.\n3.   If a request for reimbursement presented by a contributing State is approved, it may be deducted from the next call for contributions addressed to that State by the administrator.\n4.   If no call for contributions is anticipated when the request is approved, or if the approved request for reimbursement would exceed the anticipated contribution, the administrator shall make payment of the amount to be reimbursed within 30 days, taking account of Athena's cash flow and of what is needed to finance the common costs of the operation concerned.\n5.   Reimbursement shall be due in accordance with this Decision even if the operation is cancelled.\n6.   Reimbursement shall include interest earned on the amount made available through pre-financing.\nArticle 28\nManagement by Athena of expenditure not included in common costs\n1.   The Special Committee, on the basis of a proposal by the administrator, with the assistance of the operation commander, or by a Member State, may decide that the administrative management of certain expenditure in relation to an operation (‘nation borne costs’), while remaining the responsibility of the Member State which it concerns, shall be entrusted to Athena.\n2.   The Special Committee, in its decision, may authorise the operation commander to enter into contracts on behalf of the Member States participating in an operation and, where appropriate, third parties, for the acquisition of the services and supplies to be financed as nation borne costs.\n3.   The Special Committee, in its decision, shall lay down the modalities for the pre-financing of nation borne costs.\n4.   Athena shall keep accounts of the nation borne costs entrusted to it and incurred by each Member State and, where appropriate, third parties. Each month it shall send each Member State and, where appropriate, those third parties, a statement of the expenditure borne by it and incurred by it or by its staff during the preceding month, and shall call for the necessary funds to pay for this expenditure. The Member States and, where appropriate, those third parties, shall pay Athena the funds required within 30 days following despatch of the call for funds.\nArticle 29\nManagement by Athena of pre-financing and expenditure not included in common costs to facilitate the initial deployment of the forces to an operation\nThe Special Committee, if particular operational circumstances so require, on the basis of a proposal by the administrator, with the assistance of the operation commander, or by a Member State, may decide that the pre-financing and administrative management of certain expenditure in relation to an operation, while remaining the responsibility of the Member State which it concerns, shall be entrusted to Athena in order to facilitate the initial deployment of the forces to an operation, before participating Member States are confirmed. The management of these costs shall be assured within existing means and resources and the initial outlay capped at 20 % of the reference amount. In this case the Special Committee shall outline in its decision the modalities for pre-financing and reimbursement of the pre-financed amounts by the future participating Member States and third parties.\nArticle 30\nManagement by Athena of third party financial contributions\n1.   In line with the relevant provisions of the operation's legal framework and following PSC decision to accept the implementation or management of a project by the operation or a financial contribution by a third party or a Member State to the expenditure arising from the operation, the Special Committee may authorise that the administrative management of the funding for that project or of that financial contribution to be entrusted to Athena, within existing means and resources. This may include projects funded by the Union.\n2.   The cost relating to the management of the contribution should be covered by the contribution itself. The Special Committee may decide that certain costs associated with the contribution and relative to the active phase of the operation are eligible as common costs on a case-by-case basis.\n3.   For the purposes of the management of a contribution by a third party, the Union or a Member State, the administrator shall, upon approval by the Special Committee, negotiate and sign an ad hoc administrative arrangement with the third party, the Union or the Member State, defining the purpose, costs to be covered by the contribution and the management modalities of the contribution, including the accountability of the operation commander to the Special Committee. The Administrator shall make sure that the management of the contribution shall respect the ad hoc arrangements and shall provide to the contributor concerned, directly or through the operation commander, all the relevant information relating to the management of the contribution.\nArticle 31\nInterest on late payment\n1.   If a State does not fulfil its financial obligations, the Union rules on interest on late payment determined by Article 78 of Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 966/2012 (4) of the European Parliament and of the Council or any other Regulation which may replace it in relation to the payment of contributions to the Union budget shall be applicable by analogy.\n2.   When payment is late by no more than 20 days, no interest shall be charged. When payment is late by more than 20 days, interests shall be charged for the entire delay.\nCHAPTER 8\nIMPLEMENTATION OF EXPENDITURE\nArticle 32\nPrinciples\n1.   Athena's appropriations shall be used in accordance with the principles of sound financial management, i.e. economy, effectiveness and efficiency.\n2.   Authorising officers shall be responsible for implementing Athena's revenue and expenditure in accordance with the principles of sound financial management and for ensuring that the requirements of legality and regularity are complied with. To implement expenditure, the authorising officers shall make budgetary commitments and legal commitments, shall validate expenditure and authorise payments and shall undertake the preliminaries for the implementation of appropriations. An authorising officer may delegate his or her duties by a decision determining:\n(a)\nstaff at an appropriate level for such delegation;\n(b)\nthe extent of the conferred powers;\n(c)\nthe scope for beneficiaries to subdelegate their powers.\n3.   The implementation of appropriations according to the principle of the segregation of the authorising officer and the accounting officer shall be ensured. The duties of authorising officer and accounting officer shall be mutually incompatible. Any payment made from funds administered by Athena shall require the joint signature of an authorising officer and an accounting officer.\n4.   Without prejudice to this Decision, when the implementation of common expenditure is entrusted to a Member State, a Union institution or, as appropriate, an international organisation, that State, institution or organisation shall apply the rules applicable to the implementation of its own expenditure. When the administrator implements expenditure directly, it shall comply with the rules applicable to the implementation of the ‘Council’ section of the general budget of the Union.\n5.   However, the administrator may provide the Presidency with elements for proposal to the Council or the Special Committee on rules for the implementation of common expenditure.\n6.   The Special Committee may approve rules for the implementation of common expenditure which depart from paragraph 4.\nArticle 33\nCommon costs incurred in preparation for, or further to, operations, or not linked directly to a specific operation\nThe administrator shall perform the duties of authorising officer for expenditure covering the common costs incurred in preparation for, or further to, operations, as well as common costs which cannot be linked directly to a specific operation.\nArticle 34\nOperational common costs\n1.   The operation commander shall carry out the duties of authorising officer for expenditure covering the operational common costs of the operation he or she commands. However, the administrator shall carry out the duties of authorising officer for expenditure covering the operational common costs incurred during the preparatory phase of a specific operation, which are implemented directly by Athena, or related to the operation after the end of its active phase.\n2.   The sums required for the implementation of expenditure on an operation shall be transferred by the administrator from Athena's bank account to the operation commander, upon his or her request, into the bank account opened on behalf of Athena, of which the operation commander has provided the details.\n3.   By way of derogation from Article 18(5), the adoption of a reference amount shall activate the right of the administrator and the operation commander, each in his or her area of competence, to commit and pay expenses for the operation concerned up to the percentage of the reference amount approved as provided for in Article 25(1), unless the Council decides on a higher level for commitments.\nThe Special Committee, on the basis of a proposal from the administrator or the operation commander and taking into account the operational necessity and urgency, may decide that additional expenditure may be committed and, as appropriate, paid. The Special Committee may decide to refer the question to the competent preparatory bodies at the Council through the Presidency unless operational circumstances dictate otherwise. This derogation shall not be applied as from the date of adoption of a budget for the operation concerned.\n4.   During the period prior to the adoption of a budget for an operation, the administrator and the operation commander or his or her representative shall report to the Special Committee every month, each reporting on the matters concerning him or her, as regards the expenses which are eligible as common costs for that operation. The Special Committee, on the basis of a proposal by the administrator, the operation commander or a Member State, may issue directives on the implementation of expenditure during that period.\n5.   By way of derogation from Article 18(5), in the case of imminent danger to the lives of personnel involved in a Union military operation, the operation commander for that operation may implement the necessary expenditure to save the lives of those personnel, in excess of the appropriations entered in the budget. He or she shall inform the administrator and the Special Committee as soon as possible. In such a case, the administrator shall, liaising with the operation commander, propose the transfers needed to finance this unexpected expenditure. If it is not possible to ensure sufficient funding for such expenditure by means of a transfer, the administrator shall propose an amending budget.\nCHAPTER 9\nFINAL DESTINATION OF EQUIPMENT AND INFRASTRUCTURE FINANCED IN COMMON\nArticle 35\nEquipment and infrastructure\n1.   A depreciation rate for equipment and other assets for all operations shall be proposed by the administrator to the Special Committee. If operational circumstances so require, and upon approval by the Special Committee, the operation commander may apply a different depreciation rate.\n2.   With a view to winding up the operation which he or she has commanded, the operation commander shall propose to the Special Committee a final destination for the equipment and infrastructure financed in common for that operation.\n3.   The administrator shall manage the equipment and infrastructure remaining after the end of the active phase of the operation, with a view if necessary to finding its final destination.\n4.   The final destination of equipment and infrastructure financed in common shall be approved by the Special Committee, taking into account operational needs and financial criteria. The final destination may be as follows:\n(a)\nin the case of infrastructure, be sold or transferred through Athena to the host country, a Member State or a third party;\n(b)\nin the case of equipment, be sold through Athena to a Member State, the host country or a third party, or be stored and maintained by Athena, a Member State or such a third party, for use in a subsequent operation.\n5.   When sold, equipment and infrastructure shall be sold for their market value, or, where no market value can be determined, for a fair and reasonable price taking into account specific local conditions.\n6.   Sale or transfer to the host country or a third party shall be in accordance with the relevant security rules in force.\n7.   When it is decided that Athena shall retain equipment financed in common for an operation, the contributing Member States may ask for financial compensation from the other participating Member States. The Special Committee, composed of the representatives of all the participating Member States, shall take the appropriate decisions on the basis of a proposal from the administrator.\nCHAPTER 10\nACCOUNTING AND INVENTORY\nArticle 36\nAccounting for operational common costs\nThe operation commander shall keep accounts of transfers received from Athena, of expenditure he or she has committed and of payments made and of revenue received, as well as an inventory of the movable property financed by the Athena budget and used for the operation which he or she commands.\nArticle 37\nConsolidated accounts\n1.   The accounting officer shall keep the accounts of contributions called for and transfers made. He or she shall also draw up the accounts for the common costs incurred in preparation for, or further to, operations, and for operational expenditure and revenue implemented under the direct responsibility of the administrator.\n2.   The accounting officer shall draw up the consolidated accounts for Athena's revenue and expenditure. Each operation commander shall send him or her the accounts for the expenditure he or she has committed and the payments he or she has made, and of revenue received.\nCHAPTER 11\nAUDIT AND PRESENTATION OF ACCOUNTS\nArticle 38\nRegular reports to the Special Committee\nEvery three months, the administrator shall present to the Special Committee a report on the implementation of revenue and expenditure since the beginning of the financial year. To this end, every operation commander shall provide the administrator with a report on expenditure relating to the operational common costs of the operation which he or she commands.\nArticle 39\nConditions for the exercise of controls\n1.   The persons responsible for auditing Athena's revenue and expenditure shall, before carrying out their task, have received clearance for access to classified information up to at least ‘SECRET UE/EU SECRET’ level held by the Council, or equivalent clearance from a Member State or NATO, as appropriate. Those persons shall ensure that they respect the confidentiality of the information and protect the data of which they acquire knowledge during their audit task, in accordance with the rules applicable to that information and those data.\n2.   The persons responsible for auditing Athena's revenue and expenditure shall have access without delay and without giving prior notice to the documents and to the contents of all data supports relating to that revenue and expenditure, and to the premises where those documents and supports are kept. They may make copies. The persons involved in implementing Athena's revenue and expenditure shall give the administrator and the persons responsible for the audit of that revenue and expenditure the necessary assistance in performing their task.\nArticle 40\nExternal auditing of the accounts\n1.   When the implementation of Athena's expenditure has been entrusted to a Member State, a Union institution or an international organisation, that State, institution or organisation shall apply the rules which apply to the auditing of its own expenditure.\n2.   However, the administrator or persons appointed by him or her may at any time carry out an audit of the common costs of Athena incurred in preparation for, or further to, operations, or the operational common costs of an operation. Furthermore, the Special Committee, on the basis of a proposal by the administrator or a Member State, may at any time appoint external auditors, whose tasks and conditions of employment it shall determine.\n3.   With a view to external audits, a six-member College of Auditors shall be established. The Special Committee shall appoint members for a three-year period, renewable once, from candidates proposed by the Member States. The Special Committee may extend a member's mandate by up to six months.\nThe candidates must be members of the highest national audit body of a Member State, or recommended by that body, and offer adequate guarantees of security and independence. They must be available to carry out tasks on behalf of Athena as needed. In carrying out these tasks:\n(a)\nthe members of the College of Auditors shall continue to be paid by their audit body of origin; Athena shall bear their mission expenses in accordance with the rules applicable to officials of the Union of an equivalent grade;\n(b)\nthe members shall neither request nor receive instructions other than from the Special Committee; within its audit mandate the College of Auditors and its members shall be completely independent and solely responsible for the conduct of the external audit;\n(c)\nthe members shall only report on their task to the Special Committee;\n(d)\nthe members shall check during the financial year as well as ex post, through controls on the spot as well as on supporting documents, that expenditure financed or pre-financed through Athena is implemented in accordance with the legislation applicable and the principles of sound financial management, i.e. economy, effectiveness and efficiency, and that internal controls are adequate\nEach year, the College of Auditors shall elect its chairman from amongst its members or extend his or her term of office. It shall adopt the rules applicable to audits carried out by its members in accordance with the highest international standards. The College of Auditors shall approve the audit reports drawn up by its members before their transmission to the administrator and to the Special Committee.\n4.   The Special Committee may decide on a case-by-case basis and upon specific motivations to use other external bodies.\n5.   The cost of the audits carried out by auditors acting on behalf of Athena shall be considered as a common cost to be borne by Athena.\nArticle 41\nInternal auditing of the accounts\n1.   On the basis of a proposal by the administrator and after informing the Special Committee, the Secretary-General of the Council shall appoint an internal auditor of the Athena mechanism, and at least one deputy internal auditor, for a period of four years, renewable up to a total period not exceeding 8 years; internal auditors must have the necessary professional qualifications and offer sufficient guarantees of security and independence. The internal auditor may not be either an authorising officer or accounting officer; he or she may not take part in the preparation of financial statements.\n2.   The internal auditor shall report to the administrator on dealing with risks, by issuing independent opinions on the quality of management and control systems and by issuing recommendations for improving the internal audit in operations and promoting sound financial management. He or she shall be responsible in particular for assessing the suitability and effectiveness of internal management systems and the performance of departments in implementing policies and reaching objectives by reference to the risks associated with them.\n3.

Furthermore, each operation commander shall give the internal auditor full access to the operation which he or she commands. The internal auditor shall check that the financial and budgetary systems and procedures function correctly, and shall ensure that robust and effective internal audit systems are in operation.\n7.   The proceedings and reports of the internal auditor shall be made available to the College of Auditors along with all supporting documents relating thereto.\nArticle 42\nAnnual presentation and closure of accounts\n1.   Each operation commander shall provide Athena's accounting officer by 31 March following the end of the financial year, or within four months following the end of the operation which he or she commands, whichever is the earlier, with the necessary information to establish the annual accounts for common costs, the annual accounts for expenditure pursuant to Article 28 and the annual activity report.\n2.

The Special Committee shall decide to enter the balance of the budget outturn for a financial year for which the accounts have been approved in the budget for the following financial year, as revenue or expenditure depending on the circumstances, by means of an amending budget. The Special Committee may, however, decide to enter the balance of the abovementioned budget outturn after having received the audit opinion from the College of Auditors.\n7.   The part of the balance of the budget outturn for a financial year which comes from the implementation of appropriations intended to cover common costs incurred in preparation for, or further to, operations, shall be entered against the next contributions from participating Member States.\n8.   The part of the balance of the budget outturn which comes from the implementation of appropriations intended to cover the operational common costs of a given operation shall be entered against the next contributions from the Member States which have contributed to that operation.\n9.

The deadline imposed on the administrator may not be less than four months from the date on which the operation was completed.\n2.   If the financial statements cannot, within the given deadline, include the revenue and expenditure connected with the winding up of that operation, that revenue and expenditure shall appear in the financial statements for Athena and shall be examined by the Special Committee in the context of the procedure foreseen in Article 42.\n3.   The Special Committee shall, based on an opinion of the College of Auditors, approve the financial statements for the operation which have been submitted to it.
