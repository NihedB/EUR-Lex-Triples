{"celex_id": "32006L0115", "reference": "27.12.2006\nEN\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\nL 376/28\nDIRECTIVE 2006/115/EC OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL\nof 12 December 2006\non rental right and lending right and on certain rights related to copyright in the field of intellectual property\n(codified version)\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Articles 47(2), 55 and 95 thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the Commission,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee,\nActing in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty (1),\nWhereas:\n(1)\nCouncil Directive 92/100/EEC of 19 November 1992 on rental right and lending right and on certain rights related to copyright in the field of intellectual property (2) has been substantially amended several times (3). In the interests of clarity and rationality the said Directive should be codified.\n(2)\nRental and lending of copyright works and the subject matter of related rights protection is playing an increasingly important role in particular for authors, performers and producers of phonograms and films. Piracy is becoming an increasing threat.\n(3)\nThe adequate protection of copyright works and subject matter of related rights protection by rental and lending rights as well as the protection of the subject matter of related rights protection by the fixation right, distribution right, right to broadcast and communication to the public can accordingly be considered as being of fundamental importance for the economic and cultural development of the Community.\n(4)\nCopyright and related rights protection must adapt to new economic developments such as new forms of exploitation.\n(5)\nThe creative and artistic work of authors and performers necessitates an adequate income as a basis for further creative and artistic work, and the investments required particularly for the production of phonograms and films are especially high and risky. The possibility of securing that income and recouping that investment can be effectively guaranteed only through adequate legal protection of the rightholders concerned.\n(6)\nThese creative, artistic and entrepreneurial activities are, to a large extent, activities of self-employed persons. The pursuit of such activities should be made easier by providing a harmonised legal protection within the Community. To the extent that these activities principally constitute services, their provision should equally be facilitated by a harmonised legal framework in the Community.\n(7)\nThe legislation of the Member States should be approximated in such a way as not to conflict with the international conventions on which the copyright and related rights laws of many Member States are based.\n(8)\nThe legal framework of the Community on the rental right and lending right and on certain rights related to copyright can be limited to establishing that Member States provide rights with respect to rental and lending for certain groups of rightholders and further to establishing the rights of fixation, distribution, broadcasting and communication to the public for certain groups of rightholders in the field of related rights protection.\n(9)\nIt is necessary to define the concepts of rental and lending for the purposes of this Directive.\n(10)\nIt is desirable, with a view to clarity, to exclude from rental and lending within the meaning of this Directive certain forms of making available, as for instance making available phonograms or films for the purpose of public performance or broadcasting, making available for the purpose of exhibition, or making available for on-the-spot reference use. Lending within the meaning of this Directive should not include making available between establishments which are accessible to the public.\n(11)\nWhere lending by an establishment accessible to the public gives rise to a payment the amount of which does not go beyond what is necessary to cover the operating costs of the establishment, there is no direct or indirect economic or commercial advantage within the meaning of this Directive.\n(12)\nIt is necessary to introduce arrangements ensuring that an unwaivable equitable remuneration is obtained by authors and performers who must remain able to entrust the administration of this right to collecting societies representing them.\n(13)\nThe equitable remuneration may be paid on the basis of one or several payments at any time on or after the conclusion of the contract. It should take account of the importance of the contribution of the authors and performers concerned to the phonogram or film.\n(14)\nIt is also necessary to protect the rights at least of authors as regards public lending by providing for specific arrangements. However, any measures taken by way of derogation from the exclusive public lending right should comply in particular with Article 12 of the Treaty.\n(15)\nThe provisions laid down in this Directive as to rights related to copyright should not prevent Member States from extending to those exclusive rights the presumption provided for in this Directive with regard to contracts concerning film production concluded individually or collectively by performers with a film producer. Furthermore, those provisions should not prevent Member States from providing for a rebuttable presumption of the authorisation of exploitation in respect of the exclusive rights of performers provided for in the relevant provisions of this Directive, in so far as such presumption is compatible with the International Convention for the Protection of Performers, Producers of Phonograms and Broadcasting Organisations (hereinafter referred to as the Rome Convention).\n(16)\nMember States should be able to provide for more far-reaching protection for owners of rights related to copyright than that required by the provisions laid down in this Directive in respect of broadcasting and communication to the public.\n(17)\nThe harmonised rental and lending rights and the harmonised protection in the field of rights related to copyright should not be exercised in a way which constitutes a disguised restriction on trade between Member States or in a way which is contrary to the rule of media exploitation chronology, as recognised in the judgment handed down in Société Cinéthèque v. FNCF\n (4).\n(18)\nThis Directive should be without prejudice to the obligations of the Member States relating to the time-limits for transposition into national law of the Directives as set out in Part B of Annex I,\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:\nCHAPTER I\nRENTAL AND LENDING RIGHT\nArticle 1\nObject of harmonisation\n1.

Without prejudice to paragraph 6, when a contract concerning film production is concluded, individually or collectively, by performers with a film producer, the performer covered by this contract shall be presumed, subject to contractual clauses to the contrary, to have transferred his rental right, subject to Article 5.\n5.   Member States may provide for a similar presumption as set out in paragraph 4 with respect to authors.\n6.   Member States may provide that the signing of a contract concluded between a performer and a film producer concerning the production of a film has the effect of authorising rental, provided that such contract provides for an equitable remuneration within the meaning of Article 5. Member States may also provide that this paragraph shall apply mutatis mutandis to the rights included in Chapter II.\nArticle 4\nRental of computer programs\nThis Directive shall be without prejudice to Article 4(c) of Council Directive 91/250/EEC of 14 May 1991 on the legal protection of computer programs (5).\nArticle 5\nUnwaivable right to equitable remuneration\n1.   Where an author or performer has transferred or assigned his rental right concerning a phonogram or an original or copy of a film to a phonogram or film producer, that author or performer shall retain the right to obtain an equitable remuneration for the rental.\n2.   The right to obtain an equitable remuneration for rental cannot be waived by authors or performers.\n3.   The administration of this right to obtain an equitable remuneration may be entrusted to collecting societies representing authors or performers.\n4.   Member States may regulate whether and to what extent administration by collecting societies of the right to obtain an equitable remuneration may be imposed, as well as the question from whom this remuneration may be claimed or collected.\nArticle 6\nDerogation from the exclusive public lending right\n1.   Member States may derogate from the exclusive right provided for in Article 1 in respect of public lending, provided that at least authors obtain a remuneration for such lending. Member States shall be free to determine this remuneration taking account of their cultural promotion objectives.\n2.   Where Member States do not apply the exclusive lending right provided for in Article 1 as regards phonograms, films and computer programs, they shall introduce, at least for authors, a remuneration.\n3.   Member States may exempt certain categories of establishments from the payment of the remuneration referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2.\nCHAPTER II\nRIGHTS RELATED TO COPYRIGHT\nArticle 7\nFixation right\n1.   Member States shall provide for performers the exclusive right to authorise or prohibit the fixation of their performances.\n2.   Member States shall provide for broadcasting organisations the exclusive right to authorise or prohibit the fixation of their broadcasts, whether these broadcasts are transmitted by wire or over the air, including by cable or satellite.\n3.   A cable distributor shall not have the right provided for in paragraph 2 where it merely retransmits by cable the broadcasts of broadcasting organisations.\nArticle 8\nBroadcasting and communication to the public\n1.   Member States shall provide for performers the exclusive right to authorise or prohibit the broadcasting by wireless means and the communication to the public of their performances, except where the performance is itself already a broadcast performance or is made from a fixation.\n2.   Member States shall provide a right in order to ensure that a single equitable remuneration is paid by the user, if a phonogram published for commercial purposes, or a reproduction of such phonogram, is used for broadcasting by wireless means or for any communication to the public, and to ensure that this remuneration is shared between the relevant performers and phonogram producers. Member States may, in the absence of agreement between the performers and phonogram producers, lay down the conditions as to the sharing of this remuneration between them.\n3.   Member States shall provide for broadcasting organisations the exclusive right to authorise or prohibit the rebroadcasting of their broadcasts by wireless means, as well as the communication to the public of their broadcasts if such communication is made in places accessible to the public against payment of an entrance fee.\nArticle 9\nDistribution right\n1.   Member States shall provide the exclusive right to make available to the public, by sale or otherwise, the objects indicated in points (a) to (d), including copies thereof, hereinafter ‘the distribution right’:\n(a)\nfor performers, in respect of fixations of their performances;\n(b)\nfor phonogram producers, in respect of their phonograms;\n(c)\nfor producers of the first fixations of films, in respect of the original and copies of their films;\n(d)\nfor broadcasting organisations, in respect of fixations of their broadcasts as set out in Article 7(2).\n2.

The limitations referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 shall be applied only in certain special cases which do not conflict with a normal exploitation of the subject matter and do not unreasonably prejudice the legitimate interests of the rightholder.\nCHAPTER III\nCOMMON PROVISIONS\nArticle 11\nApplication in time\n1.   This Directive shall apply in respect of all copyright works, performances, phonograms, broadcasts and first fixations of films referred to in this Directive which were, on 1 July 1994, still protected by the legislation of the Member States in the field of copyright and related rights or which met the criteria for protection under this Directive on that date.\n2.   This Directive shall apply without prejudice to any acts of exploitation performed before 1 July 1994.\n3.

It requires EU countries to have laws on the right to authorise or prohibit the rental and lending of originals and copies of copyright works. It determines who holds these rights and lays down certain procedures for their exercise.\nACT\nDirective 2006/115/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 December 2006 on rental right and lending right and on certain rights related to copyright in the field of intellectual property (codified version).\nSUMMARY\nEU countries must introduce laws granting the right to authorise or prohibit the rental and lending of originals and copies of copyright works.\nRental means making available for use, for a limited period of time and for direct or indirect economic or commercial advantage.\nLending means making available for use, for a limited period of time and not for direct or indirect economic or commercial advantage, when it is made through establishments which are accessible to the public.\nOwners of right\nThe holders of rental and lending rights are the authors, including the principal directors of films, performers, phonogram producers or film producers. The transfer of the rights of performers appearing in films is governed by special rules.\nTermination or transfer of right\nWhere an author or performer has transferred or assigned his rental right concerning a phonogram or an original or copy of a film, he retains the right to be paid an equitable amount for its rental. This right cannot be waived. However, its administration may be delegated to collecting societies representing authors or performing artists.\nDerogation to lending right\nEU countries may derogate from the exclusive lending right, provided that at least authors obtain payment for such lending. EU countries are free to determine this payment taking account of their cultural promotion objectives.\nNeighbouring rights to copyright\nAs regards rights related to copyright, EU countries must ensure that performers and broadcasting organisations are granted exclusive rights of fixation. EU countries must ensure that performers have the exclusive right of broadcasting and communicating to the public for in respect of their live performances. The broadcasting or communication to the public of a phonogram published for commercial purposes entitles performers and producers to remuneration. Broadcasting organisations have the exclusive right to authorise or prohibit the rebroadcasting of their broadcasts, as well as the communication to the public of their broadcasts if it takes place in public areas and an entrance fee is paid.\nEU countries must ensure that performers phonogram producers, producers of the first fixations of films and broadcasting organisations have an exclusive right to make available to the public, by sale or otherwise, fixations of their performances, their phonograms, the original and copies of their films and fixations of their broadcasts. This distribution right is exhausted within the EU where the first sale of these objects is made either by the right holder or with his consent.\nEU countries may provide for limitations to related rights in respect of private use, use of short excerpts or certain other uses.\nProtection of copyright-related rights under the directive must in no way affect the protection of copyright.\nREFERENCES\nAct\nEntry into force\nDeadline for transposition in the Member States\nOfficial Journal\nDirective 2006/115/EC\n16.1.2007\n1.7.1994 for provisions of 92/100/ECC (repealed) 30.6.1995 for provisions of Directive 93/98/EEC (repealed) 21.12.2002 for provisions of Directive 2001/29/EC (repealed)\nOJ L 376 of 27.12.2006\nRELATED ACTS\nDirective\n2014/26/EU\nof the European Parliament and of the Council on collective management of copyright and related rights and multi-territorial licensing of rights in musical works for online use in the internal market [Official Journal L 84 of 20.3.2014].\nThis directive aims to enable online service providers to obtain licenses for cross-border music services from collective management organisations operating across EU borders.
