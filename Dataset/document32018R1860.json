{"celex_id": "32018R1860", "reference": "7.12.2018\nEN\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\nL 312/1\nREGULATION (EU) 2018/1860 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL\nof 28 November 2018\non the use of the Schengen Information System for the return of illegally staying third-country nationals\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 79(2)(c) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,\nActing in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure (1),\nWhereas:\n(1)\nThe return of third-country nationals who do not fulfil or no longer fulfil the conditions for entry, stay or residence in the Member States, in full respect of fundamental rights and in particular the principle of non-refoulement, and in accordance with Directive 2008/115/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (2), is an essential part of the comprehensive efforts to tackle irregular migration and increase the rate of return of irregular migrants.\n(2)\nIt is necessary to increase the effectiveness of the Union system to return illegally staying third-country nationals. This is essential for maintaining public trust in the Union migration and asylum policy and providing support to persons in need of international protection.\n(3)\nMember States should take all necessary measures to return illegally staying third-country nationals in an effective and proportionate manner, in accordance with the provisions of Directive 2008/115/EC.\n(4)\nRegulation (EU) 2018/1861 (3) and Regulation (EU) 2018/1862 (4) of the European Parliament and of the Council lay down the conditions for the establishment, operation and use of the Schengen Information System (SIS).\n(5)\nA system should be established for sharing information between Member States that use SIS pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2018/1861 concerning return decisions issued in respect of third-country nationals staying illegally on the territory of the Member States and for monitoring whether third-country nationals subject to those decisions have left the territory of the Member States.\n(6)\nThis Regulation does not affect the rights and obligations of third-country nationals laid down in Directive 2008/115/EC. An alert entered into SIS for the purpose of return does not, in itself, constitute a determination of the status of the third-country national on the territory of Member States, especially in Member States other than the Member State which entered the alert into SIS.\n(7)\nAlerts on return entered into SIS and the exchange of supplementary information concerning those alerts should support competent authorities to take the necessary measures to enforce return decisions. SIS should contribute to the identification of and the information sharing between Member States on third-country nationals who are subject to such a return decision, who have absconded and are apprehended in another Member State. Those measures should help prevent and deter irregular migration and secondary movements and enhance cooperation between Member States' authorities.\n(8)\nTo ensure the effectiveness of return and increase the added value of alerts on return, Member States should enter alerts into SIS in relation to return decisions they issue in respect of illegally staying third-country nationals in accordance with provisions respecting Directive 2008/115/EC. For this purpose, Member States should also enter an alert into SIS when decisions imposing or stating an obligation to return are issued in the situations described in Article 2(2) of that Directive, namely to third-country nationals who are subject to a refusal of entry in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2016/399 of the European Parliament and of the Council (5), or who are apprehended or intercepted by the competent authorities in connection with the irregular crossing by land, sea or air of the external border of a Member State and who have not subsequently obtained an authorisation or a right to stay in that Member State, and to third-country nationals who are subject to return as a criminal law sanction or as a consequence of a criminal law sanction, according to national law, or who are the subject of extradition procedures. In certain circumstances, Member States may refrain from entering alerts on return into SIS where the risk of the return decision not being complied with is low, namely during any period of detention or when the return decision is issued at the external border and is executed immediately, in order to reduce their administrative burden.\n(9)\nThis Regulation should set out common rules for entering alerts on return into SIS. Alerts on return should be entered into SIS as soon as the underlying return decisions are issued. The alert should indicate whether a period for voluntary departure has been granted to the third-country national concerned, including whether such period has been extended and whether the decision has been suspended or removal has been postponed.\n(10)\nIt is necessary to determine the categories of data to be entered into SIS in respect of a third-country national who is the subject of a return decision. Alerts on return should contain only those data that are necessary to identify the data subjects, to allow the competent authorities to take informed decisions without losing time and to ensure, where necessary, the protection of those authorities from persons who are, for example, armed, violent, have escaped or are involved in an activity as referred to in Articles 3 to 14 of Directive (EU) 2017/541 of the European Parliament and of the Council (6). Furthermore, in order to facilitate identification and detect multiple identities, the alert should include also a reference to the identification document of the person concerned and a copy of that document, where available.\n(11)\nGiven the reliability of identifying persons using fingerprints and photographs or facial images, they should always be inserted in alerts on return. As they may not be available, for example, when a return decision is taken in absentia, it should exceptionally be possible to derogate from this requirement in such cases.\n(12)\nThe exchange of supplementary information provided by the national competent authorities on third-country nationals subject to alerts on return, should always be carried out through the network of national offices called SIRENE Bureaux serving as point of contact and in accordance with Articles 7 and 8 of Regulation (EU) 2018/1861.\n(13)\nProcedures should be established to enable Member States to verify that the obligation to return has been complied with and to confirm the departure of the third-country national concerned to the Member State that entered the alert on return into SIS. This information should contribute to more comprehensive monitoring of the compliance with return decisions.\n(14)\nAlerts on return should be deleted as soon as the Member State or competent authority that issued the return decision receives confirmation that the return has taken place or where the competent authority has sufficient and convincing information that the third-country national has left the territory of the Member States. Where a return decision is accompanied by an entry ban, an alert for refusal of entry and stay should be entered into SIS in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2018/1861. In such cases Member States should take all necessary measures to ensure that no time-gap exists between the moment in which the third-country national leaves the Schengen area and the activation of the alert for refusal of entry and stay in SIS. If the data contained in SIS show that the return decision is accompanied by an entry ban, the enforcement of the entry ban should be ensured.\n(15)\nSIS should contain a mechanism for notifying the Member States of the non-compliance of third-country nationals with an obligation to return within a given period of voluntary departure. The mechanism should support the Member States in fulfilling their obligations to enforce return decisions and their obligations to issue an entry ban in accordance with Directive 2008/115/EC with regard to third-country nationals who have not complied with an obligation to return.\n(16)\nThis Regulation should establish mandatory rules for consultation between Member States to avoid or reconcile conflicting instructions. Consultations should be carried out where third-country nationals who hold, or are being granted, a valid residence permit or a long-stay visa by a Member State are subject to an alert on return issued by another Member State, in particular if the return decision is accompanied by an entry ban, or where conflicting situations may arise at entry in the territories of the Member States.\n(17)\nAlerts should be kept in SIS only for the time required to fulfil the purposes for which they were entered. The relevant provisions of Regulation (EU) 2018/1861 on review periods should apply. Alerts on return should be automatically deleted as soon as they expire, in accordance with the review procedure referred to in that Regulation.\n(18)\nPersonal data obtained by a Member State pursuant to this Regulation should not be transferred or made available to any third country. As a derogation to that rule, it should be possible to transfer such personal data to a third country where the transfer is subject to strict conditions and is necessary in individual cases in order to assist with the identification of a third-country national for the purposes of his or her return. The transfer of any personal data to third countries should be carried out in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council (7) and be conducted with the agreement of the issuing Member State. It should be noted however, that third countries of return are often not subject to adequacy decisions adopted by the Commission under Article 45 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679. Furthermore, the extensive efforts of the Union in cooperating with the main countries of origin of illegally-staying third-country nationals subject to an obligation to return has not been able to ensure the systematic fulfilment by such third countries of the obligation established by international law to readmit their own nationals. Readmission agreements that have been concluded or are being negotiated by the Union or the Member States and which provide for appropriate safeguards for the transfer of data to third countries pursuant to Article 46 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 cover a limited number of such third countries.\nConclusion of any new agreement remains uncertain. In those circumstances, and as an exception to the requirement for an adequacy decision or appropriate safeguards, transfer of personal data to third-country authorities pursuant to this Regulation should be allowed for the purposes of implementing the return policy of the Union. It should be possible to use the derogation provided for in Article 49 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, subject to the conditions set out in that Article. Under Article 57 of that Regulation, implementation of that Regulation, including with regard to transfers of personal data to third countries pursuant to this Regulation, should be subject to monitoring by independent supervisory authorities.\n(19)\nNational authorities responsible for return might differ significantly among Member States, and such authorities might also vary within a Member State depending on the reasons for illegal stay. Judicial authorities might also issue return decisions, for instance as result of appeals against a refusal to grant an authorisation or right to stay or as a criminal sanction. All national authorities in charge of issuing and enforcing return decisions in accordance with Directive 2008/115/EC should be entitled to access SIS in order to enter, update, delete and search alerts on return.\n(20)\nAccess to alerts on return should be granted to the national competent authorities referred to in Regulation (EU) 2018/1861 for the purpose of identification and return of third-country nationals.\n(21)\nRegulation (EU) 2016/794 of the European Parliament and of the Council (8) provides that Europol is to support and strengthen actions carried out by the national competent authorities and their cooperation in combating terrorism and serious crime and to provide analysis and threat assessments. In order to facilitate Europol in carrying out its tasks, in particular within the European Migrant Smuggling Centre, it is appropriate to allow Europol access to the category of alerts as provided for in this Regulation.\n(22)\nRegulation (EU) 2016/1624 of the European Parliament and of the Council (9) provides, for the purpose of that Regulation, that the host Member State is to authorise the members of the teams referred to in point (8) of Article 2 of that Regulation deployed by the European Border and Coast Guard Agency to consult Union databases where this consultation is necessary for fulfilling operational aims specified in the operational plan on border checks, border surveillance and return. The objective of the deployment of the teams referred to in points (8) and (9) of Article 2 of that Regulation is to provide technical and operational reinforcement to the requesting Member States, especially to those facing disproportionate migratory challenges. For the teams referred to in points (8) and (9) of Article 2 of that Regulation to fulfil their tasks, they require access to alerts on return in SIS through a technical interface of the European Border and Coast Guard Agency connecting to Central SIS.\n(23)\nThe provisions on responsibilities of the Member States and the European Union Agency for the Operational Management of Large-Scale IT Systems in the Area of Freedom, Security and Justice established by Regulation (EU) 2018/1726 of the European Parliament and of the Council (10) (‘eu-LISA’), on the entry and processing of alerts, on the conditions for access to and retention of alerts, on data processing, on data protection, on liability and on monitoring and statistics in Regulation (EU) 2018/1861 should also apply to data contained and processed in SIS in accordance with this Regulation.\n(24)\nSince the objectives of this Regulation, namely to establish a system for sharing information about return decisions issued by the Member States in accordance with provisions respecting Directive 2008/115/EC in view of facilitating their enforcement and to monitor the compliance of illegally staying third-country nationals with their obligation to return, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States, but can rather, by reason of its scale and effects, be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union (TEU). In accordance with the principle of proportionality as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives.\n(25)\nThis Regulation respects fundamental rights and observes the principles recognised by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union.\n(26)\nThe application of this Regulation is without prejudice to the obligations deriving from the Geneva Convention relating to the Status of Refugees of 28 July 1951, as supplemented by the New York Protocol of 31 January 1967.\n(27)\nMember States should implement this Regulation in full respect of fundamental rights, including the respect of the principle of non-refoulement, and should always take into consideration the best interests of the child, family life, and the state of health or condition of vulnerability of the individuals concerned.\n(28)\nIn accordance with Articles 1 and 2 of Protocol No 22 on the position of Denmark annexed to the TEU and to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, Denmark is not taking part in the adoption of this Regulation and is not bound by it or subject to its application. Given that this Regulation builds upon the Schengen acquis, Denmark shall, in accordance with Article 4 of that Protocol, decide within a period of six months after the Council has decided on this Regulation whether it will implement it in its national law.\n(29)\nThis Regulation constitutes a development of provisions of the Schengen acquis in which the United Kingdom does not take part, in accordance with Council Decision 2000/365/EC (11); the United Kingdom is therefore not taking part in the adoption of this Regulation and is not bound by it or subject to its application.\n(30)\nThis Regulation constitutes a development of the provisions of the Schengen acquis in which Ireland does not take part, in accordance with Council Decision 2002/192/EC (12); Ireland is therefore not taking part in the adoption of this Regulation and is not bound by it or subject to its application.\n(31)\nAs regards Iceland and Norway, this Regulation constitutes a development of the provisions of the Schengen acquis within the meaning of the Agreement concluded by the Council of the European Union and the Republic of Iceland and the Kingdom of Norway concerning the latters' association with the implementation, application and development of the Schengen acquis (13), which fall within the area referred to in Article 1, point (C) of Council Decision 1999/437/EC (14).\n(32)\nAs regards Switzerland, this Regulation constitutes a development of the provisions of the Schengen acquis within the meaning of the Agreement between the European Union, the European Community and the Swiss Confederation on the Swiss Confederation's association with the implementation, application and development of the Schengen acquis (15), which fall within the area referred to in Article 1, point (C) of Decision 1999/437/EC read in conjunction with Article 3 of Council Decision 2008/146/EC (16).\n(33)\nAs regards Liechtenstein, this Regulation constitutes a development of the provisions of the Schengen acquis within the meaning of the Protocol between the European Union, the European Community, the Swiss Confederation and the Principality of Liechtenstein on the accession of the Principality of Liechtenstein to the Agreement between the European Union, the European Community and the Swiss Confederation on the Swiss Confederation's association with the implementation, application and development of the Schengen acquis (17), which fall within the area referred to in Article 1, point (C) of Decision 1999/437/EC read in conjunction with Article 3 of Council Decision 2011/350/EU (18).\n(34)\nAs regards Bulgaria and Romania, this Regulation constitutes an act building upon, or otherwise relating to, the Schengen acquis within the meaning of Article 4(2) of the 2005 Act of Accession and should be read in conjunction with Council Decisions 2010/365/EU (19) and (EU) 2018/934 (20).\n(35)\nAs regards Croatia, this Regulation constitutes an act building upon, or otherwise relating to, the Schengen acquis within the meaning of Article 4(2) of the 2011 Act of Accession and should be read in conjunction with Council Decision (EU) 2017/733 (21).\n(36)\nConcerning Cyprus this Regulation constitutes an act building upon, or otherwise relating to, the Schengen acquis within the meaning of Article 3(2) of the 2003 Act of Accession.\n(37)\nThe European Data Protection Supervisor was consulted in accordance with Article 28(2) of Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council (22) and delivered an opinion on 3 May 2017,\nHAVE

Schengen Information System\nA strengthened Schengen Information System\nSUMMARY OF:\nRegulation (EU) 2018/1860 on the use of the Schengen Information System (SIS) for the return of illegally staying third-country nationals\nRegulation (EU) 2018/1861 on the establishment, operation and use of the SIS in the field of border checks, and amending the Convention implementing the Schengen Agreement\nRegulation (EU) 2018/1862 on the establishment, operation and use of the SIS in the field of police cooperation and judicial cooperation in criminal matters\nWHAT IS THE AIM OF THESE REGULATIONS?\n              \nThe Schengen Information System (SIS), created in 1995 following the abolition of internal border controls in the EU, is a large-scale database supporting external border control and law enforcement cooperation between member countries of the Schengen Agreement.\nThe 3 regulations are designed to strengthen the existing measures in SIS II — established in 2006 and operational from 2013 — particularly in light of the new migration and security challenges. They will replace the current legislation laid down in Regulations (EC) No 1986/2006 and (EC) No 1987/2006, and Decision 2007/533/JHA.\nThis summary describes how the SIS will operate once the 3 new regulations are fully in force.\nKEY POINTS\nArchitecture\nSIS consists of:\na central system (Central SIS) with a technical support function (CS-SIS), containing a database (SIS database) performing technical supervision and administrative tasks, and a backup CS-SIS;a uniform national interface (NI-SIS) in each country which members use to enter, update, delete and search SIS data;a national system (N.SIS) in each country to communicate with Central SIS, including at least one national or shared backup N.SIS. It is not possible to search data files in another N.SIS, unless the countries concerned have agreed to share the file;\na communication infrastructure between CS-SIS, backup CS-SIS and NI-SIS provides an encrypted virtual network for SIS data and their exchange between SIRENE bureaux.\nThe European Union Agency for the Operational Management of Large-Scale IT Systems in the Area of Freedom, Security and Justice (eu-LISA):\nimplements technical solutions to strengthen the uninterrupted availability of SIS;\nin exceptional circumstances, may develop an additional copy of the SIS database;\nmust present a report no later than 28 December 2019 on options for technical solutions, containing an independent impact assessment and cost-benefit analysis;\npublishes a list of the N.SIS offices and SIRENE Bureaux.\nProcedural rules state:\nalerts* should remain in SIS only as long as required for their specific purpose and be deleted when they achieve their purpose;\nalerts must be reviewed within defined periods. The member country may then decide to prolong them, otherwise they are automatically deleted. The review periods are 5 years: persons wanted for arrest for surrender or extradition purposes and missing persons who may, or may not, need to be placed under protection3 years: people sought to assist with a judicial procedure and unknown wanted persons1 year: children at risk, vulnerable persons who need to be protected from travelling and persons for discreet, inquiry or specific checks10 years: objects for discreet inquiry or specific checks or for seizure or use as evidence in criminal proceedings;\ncategories of data to be entered into the system. These are designed to help end-users take decisions quickly. They include minimum requirements (surname, date of birth, reason for the alert and action to be taken) and other data, such as type of offence, photographic and dactyloscopic* information, if available;\nuse of biometric and dactyloscopic data must respect EU law and fundamental rights, and meet minimum quality standards and technical specifications;\na case must be adequate, relevant and sufficiently important to warrant an SIS alert, for example, an alert linked to a terrorist offence meets these criteria;\nonly the issuing member country may modify, add to, correct, update or delete data in SIS;\na country which considers acting on an alert would be incompatible with its national law, international obligations or essential interests may attach a flag* to the alert. This indicates it will not take any action on its territory.\nCosts:\nthe EU budget covers the operational, maintenance and development costs of Central SIS and the communication infrastructure;\nSchengen member countries cover the operational, maintenance and development costs of their own N.SIS.\nAlert categories per regulation\nRegulation (EU) 2018/1860 strengthens enforcement of the EU’s return policy and reduces incentives for illegal immigration into the EU:\nit lays down common conditions and procedures for entering and processing alerts and exchanging supplementary information on non-EU nationals subject to return decisions*;\nit requires national authorities to enter alerts as soon as a return decision is taken;\nit establishes harmonised procedures on categories of data to be included in the alertverification if a return decision has been complied with and, if not, the follow-up between the relevant authoritiesretention and deletion of alerts to ensure there is no delay between the departure of a non-EU national and the activation of an entry bancompulsory consultation between national authorities before granting or extending a residence permit or long-stay visa for a non-EU national who may be the subject of a return alert in another EU countryentering an alert on a return decision if the person is legally staying elsewhere in the EU.\nRegulation (EU) 2018/1861 covers the use of SIS for entry bans and border checks:\nit establishes the conditions and procedures for entering and processing alerts and exchange of supplementary information* on non-EU nationals refused entry or the right to stay in the EU;\nit introduces harmonised procedures on categories of data to be included in the alertcompulsory entry of an alert when a non-EU national is refused entry or the right to stay because they pose a security threat or are subject to a restrictive order preventing entry into, or transit through, an EU countrynon-EU nationals with the right of free movement within the EUmandatory consultation between national authorities before granting or extending a residence permit or long-stay visa to a non-EU national refused the right of entry or stay in another EU country;\nit guarantees non-EU nationals the right to be informed in writing if they are the subject of an alert.\nRegulation 2018/1862 improves and extends the use of SIS for cooperation between police and judicial authorities:\nit establishes the conditions and procedures for entering and processing alerts in the SIS on people and objects, and for exchanging supplementary information and data in police and judicial cooperation on criminal matters;\nit covers procedures on alerts on: people wanted for arrest, for surrender or extradition purposes;missing persons;vulnerable persons who need to be prevented from travelling, either for their own protection or to prevent a threat to public order or security;children at risk, notably of abduction, trafficking or becoming involved in terrorism;individuals being sought to assist with a judicial procedure as witnesses or because they have been summoned in connection with criminal proceedings;unknown wanted persons whose identity is being sought;discreet or specific checks and inquiries to prevent, detect, investigate or prosecute criminal offences, execute a criminal sentence or prevent threats to public security;items to be seized or used as evidence in criminal proceedings, especially readily identifiable objects such as cars, boats, aircraft, firearms, identity documents and banknotes.\nData rightsIndividuals have the right to:\nknow whether or not their personal data are being processed, for what purposes and under what conditions;\nlodge a complaint with a supervisory authority;\ncorrection of inaccurate personal data without undue delay;\nerasure of personal data if their use is no longer necessary or these have been unlawfully processed;\ntake action to access, rectify, erase, obtain information or compensation for an alert that concerns them;\ncompensation from a member country for any material or non-material damage they suffer from unlawful processing of their personal data.\nSIS member governments:\nare committed to enforcing rulings on data protection rights;\nreport annually to the European Data Protection Board on the number of requests they receive to access data and correct inaccuracies, and the volume of court cases and their outcome.\nIndependent supervisory authorities monitor the legality of national processing of personal data in SIS; the European Data Protection Supervisor set up under Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 performs the same role for eu-LISA. The two cooperate to ensure coordinated supervision of SIS.\nData processed in SIS and related supplementary information may not be transferred or made available to non-EU countries or international organisations.\nRegulation (EU) 2018/1725 applies to personal data processed by eu-LISA, the European Border and Coast Guard Agency and Eurojust.\nRegulation (EU) 2016/679 and Directive (EU) 2016/680 apply to personal data processed by national competent authorities and services.\nThe following have access to data in SIS:\nNational authorities responsible for border control, police and customs checks;prevention, detection, investigation or prosecution of terrorist acts or other serious criminal offences;decisions, including on residence permits and long-stay visas, on the entry, stay and return of non-EU nationals;security checks on non-EU nationals applying for international protection;naturalisation decisions;public prosecutions in criminal proceedings and judicial inquiries;issuing registration certificates for vehicles, boats, aircraft and firearms;\nthe EU agencies below have the right to access and search for the data in SIS they require to carry out their responsibilities. They inform the issuing member country when a search reveals the existence of an alert. They may not connect parts of SIS or transfer any of its data to their own system Europol: may access all data, not just some as previously. SIS member countries must inform the law enforcement agency of any hits or alerts relating to terrorist offences;Eurojust, which handles judicial cooperation of criminal matters;European Border and Coast Guard, teams involved in return-related tasks and migration management support teams.\nThe European Commission evaluates every 5 years the use these agencies make of SIS.\nResponsibilitiesEach SIS member country:\nensures the data are accurate, up-to-date and entered and stored in SIS lawfully, and respect general data processing rules;\nsets up, operates, maintains and develops its N.SIS, according to common standards, protocols and technical procedures, and connects it to NI-SIS;\nensures the uninterrupted availability of SIS data to end-users;\ntransmits its alerts through its N.SIS;\ndesignates an N.SIS Office with central responsibility to ensure the smooth operation and security of its N.SIS, access of the competent authorities to the SIS, overall compliance with the regulation and appropriate availability of the SIS for all end-users;\nappoints a national authority (the SIRENE Bureau) as a single contact point operational 24/7 for the exchange and availability of all supplementary information on alerts and to facilitate follow-up action;\nadopts security, business continuity and disaster recovery plans to protect data and prevent unauthorised access;\napplies professional secrecy and confidentiality rules, including close monitoring of external contractors. Private companies and organisations are banned from operational management of the N.SIS;\nkeeps electronic logs, normally deleted after 3 years, on alerts, access and exchange of personal data to check whether the search was lawful and ensure data integrity and security;\noperates a national SIS training programme for staff with access to SIS on data security, fundamental rights, including data protection, and data processing rules and regulations.\nThe Commission:\nadopts implementing and delegated acts on technical aspects of SIS and updates these as necessary;\nunder Regulation (EU) No 1053/2013, has an overall coordinating role for the evaluation and monitoring mechanism it implements with EU governments to ensure Schengen rules are fully applied nationally. This includes evaluation of the SIS;\nwill submit a report to the European Parliament and EU governments by 28 December 2019, and every year thereafter, until decides on the date for SIS operations to start, on the state of play of preparations for full implementation of the updated SIS regulation 2018/1862;\ncarries out an overall evaluation of Central SIS, the supplementary information exchange between national authorities, including an assessment of the automated fingerprint identification system (AFIS) and the SIS information campaigns 3 years after the regulation comes into force and every 4 years thereafter.\neu-LISA is responsible for:\nCentral SIS: its operational management, including quality checks on the data it contains, and all the tasks necessary to ensure it functions 24/7 every day of the year;\ncommunication infrastructure: key aspects, notably supervision, security, coordination between member countries and providers, and budgetary and contractual issues;\nSIRENE Bureaux: coordinating, managing and supporting testing activities, maintaining and updating technical specifications on supplementary information exchange between the Bureaux and the communication infrastructure, and managing technical change;\nadopting the necessary measures to protect data and prevent unauthorised access or use, including security, business continuity and disaster recovery plans for Central SIS and the communication infrastructure;\napplying professional secrecy and confidentiality rules, and maintenance of electronic logs on the same conditions as national authorities;\nmaking publicly available via the EU’s Official Journal a list of national authorities authorised to search for data in SIS;\nproducing daily, monthly and annual statistics on the number of records per category of alerts, omitting any personal data. Its reports are made public.\nInformation campaign\nThe Commission, in cooperation with supervisory authorities and the European Data Protection Supervisor, runs the campaign.
