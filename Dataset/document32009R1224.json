Some parts of the control system are poorly implemented by Member States which results in insufficient and divergent measures in response to infringements of the rules of the common fisheries policy thereby undermining the creation of a level playing field for fishermen across the Community. Accordingly the existing regime and all the obligations therein should be consolidated, rationalised and simplified, in particular through reduction of double regulation and administrative burdens.\n(5)\nIn view of the scale of the depletion of marine aquatic resources, it is vital for the Community to adopt the necessary measures to develop a culture of compliance among all operators with the rules of the common fisheries policy, and with the objectives set out by the World Summit on Sustainable Development in 2002 as well as the European Council’s Sustainable Development Strategy. To achieve this aim, the rules for control, inspection, and enforcement of conservation as well as resource management measures, structural measures and measures on the common organisation of the market should be reinforced, harmonised and strengthened.\n(6)\nGiven that Council Regulation (EC) No 1005/2008 of 29 September 2008 establishing a Community system to prevent, deter and eliminate illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing (7), obliges the Member States to take appropriate measures to ensure the effectiveness of the fight against all illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing and associated activities and given that Council Regulation (EC) No 1006/2008 of 29 September 2008 concerning authorisations for fishing activities of Community fishing vessels outside Community waters and the access of third country vessels to Community waters (8) establishes provisions on authorisations for Community fishing vessels to engage in fishing activities outside Community waters and on authorisations for third country fishing vessels to engage in fishing activities in Community waters, this Regulation should be complementary to these Regulations and ensure that there is no discrimination between Member States’ and third country nationals.\n(7)\nThis Regulation should affect neither special provisions contained in international agreements or applicable in the framework of regional fisheries management organisations nor any national control provisions which fall within the scope of this Regulation but go beyond its minimum provisions, provided that such national provisions are in conformity with Community law.\n(8)\nModern technologies, such as the vessel monitoring system, the vessel detection system and the automatic identification system, should be exploited since they allow effective monitoring, systematic and automated cross-checks in a rapid manner, and facilitate the administrative procedures for both the national authorities and the operators and thus allow timely risk analyses and global assessments of all relevant control information. The control system should therefore allow Member States to combine the use of the various control instruments to ensure the most efficient method of control.\n(9)\nA new, common approach to fisheries control should be introduced that includes comprehensive monitoring of catches, with a view to ensuring a level playing field for the fishing sector that takes into account the differences across the segments of the fleet. To this end common criteria for the implementation of fisheries control and in particular standardised and coordinated inspection procedures at sea, on land and throughout the market chain should be established. As part of the new approach the respective responsibilities of the Member States, the Commission and the Community Fisheries Control Agency should be clarified.\n(10)\nManagement of fishery resources at Community level is based in particular on total allowable catches (TACs), quotas, effort regimes and technical measures. Appropriate steps should be taken to ensure that Member States adopt the necessary measures to implement these management measures in an effective manner.\n(11)\nControl activities and methods should be based on risk management using cross-checking procedures in a systematic and comprehensive way by Member States. It is also necessary for Member States to exchange relevant information.\n(12)\nCooperation and coordination between Member States, the Commission and the Community Fisheries Control Agency should be intensified in order to promote compliance with the rules of the common fisheries policy.\n(13)\nTo ensure that fishing activities are only undertaken in line with the rules of the common fisheries policy such activities should be subject to a fishing licence and, when specific conditions apply, to a fishing authorisation. Also rules on the marking and identification of fishing vessels and their gear should apply.\n(14)\nTo ensure an effective control, Member States should operate a vessel monitoring system and fishing vessels of 12 metres’ length overall or more should be equipped with a device allowing Member States to automatically locate and identify those vessels. Furthermore fishing vessels should be equipped with an automatic identification system in accordance with Directive 2002/59/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 June 2002 establishing a Community vessel traffic monitoring and information system (9), and Member States should use the data of such a system for cross-checking purposes.\n(15)\nCooperation among Community agencies and among authorities of Member States should be strengthened. For this purpose, it should be possible to transmit data from the vessel monitoring system, automatic identification system and the vessel detection system to Community agencies and competent authorities of Member States engaged in surveillance operations for the purpose of maritime safety and security, border control, protection of the marine environment and general law enforcement.\n(16)\nIt should be for the Council to decide on the future use of electronic monitoring devices and traceability tools such as genetic analysis and other fisheries control technologies if these technologies lead to an improved compliance with rules of the common fisheries policy in a cost effective way.\n(17)\nMember States should monitor the activities of their fishing vessels in and outside Community waters. To facilitate effective monitoring masters of Community fishing vessels of 10 metres’ length overall or more should be obliged to keep a fishing logbook and submit landing and transhipment declarations. In order to make use of modern technologies, for fishing vessels of 12 metres’ length overall or more, the fishing logbook should be in electronic form and the landing and transhipment declarations should be submitted electronically.\n(18)\nThe information contained in the fishing logbooks of fishing vessels should be verified at the time of landing. Accordingly, those involved in the landing and marketing of fish and fishery products should be required to declare the quantities landed, transhipped, offered for sale or purchased.\n(19)\nFor small fishing vessels of less than 10 metres’ length overall an obligation to keep a fishing logbook or to complete a landing declaration would constitute a disproportionate burden in relation to their fishing capacity. In order to ensure an adequate level of control over such vessels, Member States should monitor their activities by the implementation of a sampling plan.\n(20)\nTranshipments at sea escape any proper control by flag or coastal states and therefore constitute a possible way for operators to carry illegal catch. To improve controls, transhipment operations in the Community should be authorised only in designated ports.\n(21)\nThe Member States’ authorities should be able to monitor landings in their ports. To that end fishing vessels engaged in fisheries on stocks subject to a multiannual plan that are under the obligation to record fishing logbook data electronically should be required to pre-notify those authorities of their intention to land in their ports. Member States should be allowed to deny access if the required information is not complete.\n(22)\nSince the management of fishing resources is based on fishing opportunities it should be ensured that catches and deployed effort are correctly recorded and that the catches and deployed effort are charged against the quotas and effort allocations of the flag Member State. Fisheries should be closed if the available quota or effort allocation have been exhausted.\n(23)\nIn view of the capacity requirements in the Community fishing fleet as contained in Article 13 of Regulation (EC) No 2371/2002, Council Regulation (EC) No 639/2004 of 30 March 2004 on the management of fishing fleets registered in the Community outermost regions (10), Commission Regulation (EC) No 1438/2003 of 12 August 2003 laying down implementing rules on the Community Fleet Policy as defined in Chapter III of Council Regulation (EC) No 2371/2002 (11) and Commission Regulation (EC) No 2104/2004 of 9 December 2004 laying down detailed implementation rules for Council Regulation (EC) No 639/2004 (12), instruments should be introduced for the control of the fleet capacity which should include the monitoring of the engine power and of the use of fishing gear. For that reason Member States should take measures to ensure that the total capacity of the fishing licences does not exceed the maximum capacity levels and ensure that the propulsion engine power of fishing vessels does not exceed the certified engine power of those vessels. Member States should for this purpose certify the propulsion engine power of fishing vessels whose propulsion engine power exceeds 120 kW and also verify on the basis of a sampling plan the consistency of engine power with other available information.\n(24)\nParticular measures should apply in case of multiannual plans as a particular form to protect the concerned stocks. Transhipments of catches of stocks subject to a multiannual plan should be allowed only in designated ports and only if these catches have been weighed.\n(25)\nSpecial provisions should be foreseen that only allowed gears are used and that lost gear is retrieved.\n(26)\nSpecial rules should apply to fishing restricted areas. The procedure for the establishment and lifting of real time closures for fishing grounds should be clearly established.\n(27)\nAs recreational fisheries can have a significant impact on fish resources, Member States should ensure that they are conducted in a manner compatible with the objectives of the common fisheries policy. For stocks under a recovery plan Member States should collect catch data of recreational fisheries. Where such fisheries have a significant impact on the resources, the Council should have the possibility to decide on specific management measures.\n(28)\nIn order to establish a comprehensive control regime, the whole chain of production and marketing should be covered by such a regime. It should include a coherent traceability system complementing the provisions contained in Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 28 January 2002 laying down the general principles and requirements of food law, establishing the European Food Safety Authority and laying down procedures in matters of food safety (13), and an enhanced control of producer organisations. It should also protect the interests of consumers by providing the information concerning the commercial designation, the production method and the catch area at each stage of the marketing as contained in Commission Regulation (EC) No 2065/2001 of 22 October 2001 laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 104/2000 as regards informing consumers about fishery and aquaculture products (14). It should ensure the monitoring of producer organisations in accordance with Commission Regulation (EC) No 2508/2000 of 15 November 2000 laying down the detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 104/2000 as regards operational programmes in the fisheries sector (15).\n(29)\nTo ensure that all catches are properly controlled Member States should ensure that all fisheries products are first marketed or registered at an auction centre or to registered buyers or to producer organisations. As the exact weight of catches needs to be known to follow the utilisation of quotas, Member States should ensure that all fisheries products are weighed unless sampling plans based on a common methodology are in place.\n(30)\nIn order to follow the way of the catch and to be able to verify their coherence with catch data, registered buyers, registered auctions or other bodies or persons authorised by Member States should submit sales notes. If they have an annual turnover in first sales of fisheries products of more than EUR 200 000 the sales notes should be transmitted electronically.\n(31)\nIn order to ensure compliance with Community conservation and trade measures, steps should be taken to require all fishery products for which neither a sales note nor a take-over declaration has been submitted and which are transported to a place other than that of landing to be accompanied by a transport document identifying their nature, origin and weight unless a transport document has been transmitted electronically before the transport.\n(32)\nMember States should carry out regular checks on producer organisations to ensure that they meet the legal requirements. They should also carry out checks regarding the price and intervention arrangements.\n(33)\nMember States should carry out surveillance in Community waters and take the necessary measures if a sighting or detection does not correspond to the information available to them.\n(34)\nThe concept and the tasks of control observers should be clearly established for future control observer schemes. At the same time rules should also be established on the conduct of inspections.\n(35)\nFor the consistent and effective prosecution of infringements, provision should be made to enable inspection and surveillance reports drawn up by Commission officials, Community inspectors and officials of Member States to be used in the same way as national reports. At the same time Member States should set up an electronic database providing the inspection and surveillance reports of their officials.\n(36)\nTo enhance a common level of control in Community waters a list of Community inspectors should be established and their tasks and competences should be clarified. For the same reason inspections of fishing vessels outside the waters of the inspecting Member State should be possible under certain conditions.\n(37)\nIn the case of an infringement it should be ensured that the appropriate measures are taken and that the infringement can effectively be followed up irrespective of where it occurs. In certain cases of serious infringements there should be an enhanced follow-up to enable immediate investigation. In this respect Member States should also be obliged to take appropriate measures where an infringement has been discovered by a Community inspector. Under certain conditions it should be possible to transfer the proceedings to the flag Member State or the Member State of which the offender holds the citizenship.\n(38)\nNationals of Member States should be deterred from committing infringements of the rules of the common fisheries policy. Since action taken following infringements of those rules differs widely from one Member State to another, thereby causing discrimination and unfair competition rules for fishermen and given that the absence of dissuasive, proportionate and effective sanctions in certain Member States reduces the effectiveness of controls, it is appropriate to introduce administrative sanctions in combination with a point system for serious infringements to provide a real deterrent.\n(39)\nThe persistence of a high number of serious infringements of the rules of the common fisheries policy within Community waters or by Community operators is to a large extent attributable to the non-deterrent level of sanctions for serious infringements of those rules laid down in national legislation. That weakness is compounded by the wide discrepancy in the levels of sanctions between Member States, which encourages illegal operators to operate in waters or within the territory of the Member States where the sanctions are lowest. It is therefore appropriate to complement the maximum levels of sanctions for serious infringements of the rules of the common fisheries policy as laid down in Article 44 of Regulation (EC) No 1005/2008 with dissuasive sanctions, taking into account the nature of the damage, value of the fishery products obtained by committing the serious infringement, the economic situation of the offender and any repetition of an infringement. Immediate enforcement measures and complementary measures should also be laid down.\n(40)\nThe establishment of sanctions should be complemented by a point system for serious infringements on the basis of which a fishing licence should be suspended if a certain number of points have been attributed to the holder of a fishing licence following the imposition of sanctions for serious infringements. If the fishing licences have been suspended five times on the basis of this system and again the number of points are attributed the fishing licence should be withdrawn altogether. In this context Member States should enter in a national register all infringements of the rules of the common fisheries policy.\n(41)\nTo ensure the achievement of the objectives of the common fisheries policy the Commission should be able to take effective corrective measures. To this end the management capacity of the Commission and its capacity to intervene in a manner proportionate to the level of non-compliance by a Member State should be strengthened. The Commission should be empowered to undertake inspections without prior notice and in an independent way, so as to verify the control operations carried out by the competent authorities of Member States.\n(42)\nFor the purposes of protecting the Community financial interest and securing the overriding interest in the conservation of fisheries resources, the financial assistance in the framework of Council Regulation (EC) No 1198/2006 of 27 July 2006 on the European Fisheries Fund (16) and Council Regulation (EC) No 861/2006 of 22 May 2006 establishing Community financial measures for the implementation of the common fisheries policy and in the area of the Law of Sea (17) should be made conditional upon compliance by Member States with their obligations in the fields of fisheries control and thus suspension and cancellation of such financial assistance should be foreseen in cases of an inadequate implementation of the rules of common fisheries policy by Member States which affects the effectiveness of the measures being financed.\n(43)\nPowers should be conferred to the Commission to close a fishery when the quota of a Member State or a TAC itself is exhausted. The Commission should also be empowered to deduct quotas and effort allocations to ensure the limitation of fishing opportunities are fully complied with. The Commission should also have the capacity to take emergency measures if there is evidence that fishing activities or measures of a Member State undermine the conservation and management measures of management plans or threaten the marine eco-system.\n(44)\nThe exchange of data in electronic form with other Member States and the Commission or the body designated by it should be ensured. The Commission or the body designated by it should be in a position to access directly the fisheries data of Member States to enable it to verify that Member States comply with their obligations and to intervene where inconsistencies are identified.\n(45)\nFor a better communication the competent authorities of Member States should set up websites with general information available on a publicly accessible part and operational information on a secure part of the website. It should also be ensured that the competent authorities of Member States for the implementation of this Regulation cooperate with each other, the Commission, the body designated by the Commission and the competent authorities of third countries.\n(46)\nThe measures necessary for the implementation of this Regulation should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission (18). All measures adopted by the Commission to implement this Regulation should comply with the proportionality principle.\n(47)\nThe mandate of the Community Fisheries Control Agency should be adjusted and extended to support the uniform implementation of the control system of the common fisheries policy, to ensure the organisation of operational cooperation, to provide assistance to Member States and to enable it to set up an emergency unit where a serious risk to the common fisheries policy is identified. It should also be enabled to provide itself with the necessary equipment to carry out joint deployment plans and to cooperate in the implementation of the EU Integrated Maritime Policy.\n(48)\nData collected and exchanged in the framework of this Regulation should be treated in accordance with applicable rules on confidentiality. Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data (19) should apply to the processing of personal data activities carried out by the Member States when applying this Regulation. Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 December 2000 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data by the Community institutions and bodies and on the free movement of such data (20) should govern the processing of personal data activities carried out by the Commission in the application of this Regulation.\n(49)\nIn order to bring the Community legislation in line with this Regulation certain Regulations pertaining to control provisions should be amended.\n(50)\nAs this Regulation will establish a new, comprehensive control regime, Regulation (EEC) No 2847/93, Council Regulation (EC) No 1627/94 of 27 June 1994 laying down general provisions concerning special fishing permits (21), and Council Regulation (EC) No 1966/2006 of 21 December 2006 on electronic recording and reporting of fishing activities and on means of remote sensing (22) should be repealed.\n(51)\nIn order to provide the Member States with the necessary time to adapt to some of the new obligations laid down in this Regulation, it is convenient to defer the applicability of certain provisions to a later date,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nTITLE I\nGENERAL PROVISIONS\nArticle 1\nSubject matter\nThis Regulation establishes a Community system for control, inspection and enforcement (hereinafter referred to as Community control system) to ensure compliance with the rules of the common fisheries policy.\nArticle 2\nScope\n1.

Member States shall also control access to waters and resources and control activities outside Community waters carried out by Community fishing vessels flying their flag and, without prejudice to the primary responsibility of the flag Member State, by their nationals.\n3.   Member States shall adopt appropriate measures, allocate adequate financial, human and technical resources and set up all administrative and technical structures necessary for ensuring control, inspection and enforcement of activities carried out within the scope of the common fisheries policy. They shall make available to their competent authorities and officials all adequate means to enable them to carry out their tasks.\n4.   Each Member State shall ensure that control, inspection and enforcement are carried out on a non-discriminatory basis as regards sectors, vessels or persons, and on the basis of risk management.\n5.   In each Member State, a single authority shall coordinate the control activities of all national control authorities. It shall also be responsible for coordinating the collection, treatment and certification of information on fishing activities and for reporting to, cooperating with and ensuring the transmission of information to the Commission, the Community Fisheries Control Agency established in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 768/2005 (23), other Member States and, where appropriate, third countries.\n6.   In accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 103, the payment of contributions from the European Fisheries Fund pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 1198/2006 and of Community financial contributions to measures referred to in Article 8(a) of Regulation (EC) No 861/2006 shall be conditional upon respect by the Member States of their obligation to ensure compliance with and enforcement of the rules of the common fisheries policy related to, or having an impact on the effectiveness of, the measures being financed, and to operate and maintain an effective control, inspection and enforcement system to this effect.\n7.   In accordance with their respective responsibilities, the Commission and the Member States shall ensure that the objectives of this Regulation are fulfilled in the management and control of Community financial assistance.\nTITLE III\nGENERAL CONDITIONS FOR ACCESS TO WATERS AND RESOURCES\nArticle 6\nFishing licence\n1.   A Community fishing vessel may be used for commercial exploitation of living aquatic resources only if it has a valid fishing licence.\n2.   The flag Member State shall ensure that the information contained in the fishing licence is accurate and consistent with that contained in the Community fishing fleet register referred to in Article 15 of Regulation (EC) No 2371/2002.\n3.   The flag Member State shall suspend temporarily the fishing licence of a vessel which is subject to temporary immobilisation decided by that Member State or which has had its fishing authorisation suspended in accordance with Article 45(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1005/2008.\n4.   The flag Member State shall withdraw permanently the fishing licence of a vessel which is the subject of a capacity adjustment measure referred to in Article 11(3) of Regulation (EC) No 2371/2002, or which has had its fishing authorisation withdrawn in accordance with Article 45(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1005/2008.\n5.   The flag Member State shall issue, manage and withdraw the fishing licence in accordance with the detailed rules adopted in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 119.\nArticle 7\nFishing authorisation\n1.   A Community fishing vessel operating in Community waters shall be authorised to carry out specific fishing activities only insofar as they are indicated in a valid fishing authorisation when the fisheries or fishing zones where the activities are authorised are subject to:\n(a)\na fishing effort regime;\n(b)\na multiannual plan;\n(c)\na fishing restricted area;\n(d)\nfishing for scientific purposes;\n(e)\nother cases laid down in Community legislation.\n2.   Where a Member State has a specific national fishing authorisation scheme, it shall send to the Commission at its request a summary of the information contained in the authorisation issued and the related aggregated figures on fishing effort.\n3.   Where the flag Member State has adopted national provisions in the form of a national fishing authorisation scheme for the allocation to individual vessels of the fishing opportunities available to it, it shall send to the Commission at its request information on the fishing vessels authorised to engage in a fishing activity in a given fishery, in particular concerning the external identification number, the name of the fishing vessels concerned, and the individual fishing opportunities allocated to them.\n4.   A fishing authorisation shall not be issued if the fishing vessel concerned does not have a fishing licence obtained in accordance with Article 6 or if its fishing licence has been suspended or withdrawn. A fishing authorisation shall be automatically withdrawn where the fishing licence corresponding to the vessel has been withdrawn permanently. It shall be suspended where the fishing licence has been suspended temporarily.\n5.

Without prejudice to special rules, where a fishing vessel carrying on board or, where appropriate, deploying a fishing gear or gears subject to a fishing effort regime or operating in a fishery subject to a fishing effort regime crosses during the same day two or more geographical areas subject to that fishing effort regime, the fishing effort deployed shall be counted against the maximum allowable fishing effort related to such fishing gear or such fishery and to the geographical area in which the largest proportion of time was spent during that day.\n3.   Where a Member State has authorised a fishing vessel in accordance with Article 27(2) to use more than one fishing gear or gears belonging to more than one grouping of fishing gears subject to a fishing effort regime during a certain fishing trip in a geographical area subject to that fishing effort regime, the fishing effort deployed during that trip shall be counted simultaneously against the maximum allowable fishing effort available to this Member State and related to each of such gears or groupings of fishing gears and to such geographical area.\n4.   Where fishing gears belong to the same grouping of fishing gears subject to the fishing effort regime, the fishing effort deployed in a geographical area by fishing vessels when carrying those gears on board shall be counted only once against the maximum allowable fishing effort related to such grouping of fishing gears and to such geographical area.\n5.   Member States shall regulate the fishing effort of their fleet in geographical areas subject to a fishing effort regime when carrying on board or, where appropriate, deploying a fishing gear or gears subject to that fishing effort regime or operating in a fishery subject to that fishing effort regime by taking appropriate action if the available maximum allowable fishing effort is about to be reached to ensure that the deployed fishing effort does not exceed the set limits.\n6.   A day present within an area shall be any continuous period of 24 hours or part thereof during which a fishing vessel is present within the geographical area and absent from port or where appropriate deploying its fishing gear. The time from which the continuous period of a day present in the area is measured is at the discretion of the Member State whose flag is flown by the fishing vessel concerned. A day absent from port shall be any continuous period of 24 hours or part thereof during which the fishing vessel is absent from port.\nArticle 27\nNotification of fishing gear\n1.   Without prejudice to specific rules, in relevant geographical areas subject to a fishing effort regime where gear restrictions apply or where maximum allowable fishing effort were set for different fishing gears or groupings of fishing gears, the master of a fishing vessel or his representative shall notify to the competent authorities of the flag Member State before a period to which maximum allowable fishing effort applies which fishing gear or, where applicable, fishing gears he intends to use during the forthcoming period. Until such notification is provided the fishing vessel shall not be entitled to fish within the geographical areas to which the fishing effort regime applies.\n2.   Where a fishing effort regime allows the use of gears belonging to more than one grouping of fishing gears in a geographical area, the use of more than one fishing gear during a fishing trip shall be subject to a prior authorisation by the flag Member State.\nArticle 28\nFishing effort report\n1.   When the Council so decides for Community fishing vessels which are not equipped with a functioning vessel monitoring system as referred to in Article 9 or which do not transmit fishing logbook data electronically as referred to in Article 15 and which are subject to a fishing effort regime, the masters of these fishing vessels shall communicate by telex, fax, telephone message or e-mail duly recorded by the recipient or by radio via a radio station approved under Community rules the following information in the form of a fishing effort report to the competent authorities of his flag Member State and, where appropriate, to the coastal Member State immediately before each entry into and exit from a geographical area subject to that fishing effort regime:\n(a)\nthe name, external identification mark, radio call sign and name of the master of the fishing vessel;\n(b)\nthe geographical location of the fishing vessel to which the communication refers;\n(c)\nthe date and time of each entry into and exit from the area and, where applicable, parts thereof;\n(d)\nthe catch retained on board by species in kilograms live weight.\n2.   Member States may implement, in accordance with Member States concerned by the fishing activities of the former’s vessels, alternative control measures to ensure compliance with effort reporting obligations. These measures shall be as effective and transparent as the reporting obligations in paragraph 1 and shall be notified to the Commission before being implemented.\nArticle 29\nExemptions\n1.   A fishing vessel carrying on board fishing gears subject to a fishing effort regime may transit across a geographical area subject to that fishing effort regime if it has no fishing authorisation to operate in that geographical area or it has first notified its competent authorities of its intention to transit. While the fishing vessel is within that geographical area, any fishing gear subject to that fishing effort regime and carried on board shall be lashed and stowed in accordance with conditions laid down in Article 47.\n2.   A Member State may choose not to count against any available maximum allowable fishing effort the activity of a fishing vessel undertaking non-fishing related activities in a geographical area subject to a fishing effort regime provided that the fishing vessel first notifies its flag Member State of its intention to do so, of the nature of its activity and that it surrenders its fishing authorisation for that time. Such fishing vessels shall not carry any fishing gear or fish during that time.\n3.   A Member State may choose not to count against any maximum allowable fishing effort the activity of a fishing vessel in a geographical area subject to a fishing effort regime which has been present in that geographical area but was unable to fish because it was assisting another fishing vessel in need of emergency aid or because it was transporting an injured person for emergency medical aid. Within one month after taking that decision, the flag Member State shall inform the Commission and provide evidence of the emergency aid supplied.\nArticle 30\nExhaustion of fishing effort\n1.   Without prejudice to Articles 29 and 31, in a geographical area where fishing gears are subject to a fishing effort regime a fishing vessel carrying on board such fishing gear or gears shall remain in port or out of that geographical area for the remainder of a period in which such fishing effort regime applies if:\n(a)\nit has exhausted the share of the maximum allowable fishing effort related to such geographical area and to such fishing gear or gears that has been assigned to it; or\n(b)\nthe maximum allowable fishing effort related to such geographical area and to such fishing gear or gears available to its flag Member State has been exhausted.\n2.   Without prejudice to Article 29, in a geographical area where a fishery is subject to a fishing effort regime, a fishing vessel shall not operate in that fishery in that area if:\n(a)\nit has exhausted the share of the maximum allowable fishing effort related to that geographical area and to that fishery that has been assigned to it; or\n(b)\nthe maximum allowable fishing effort related to that geographical area and to that fishery available to its flag Member State has been exhausted.\nArticle 31\nFishing vessels excluded from the application of a fishing effort regime\nThis Section shall not apply to fishing vessels to the extent that they are exempted from the application of a fishing effort regime.\nArticle 32\nDetailed rules\nDetailed rules for the application of this Section may be adopted in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 119.\nSection 3\nRecording and exchange of data by Member States\nArticle 33\nRecording of catches and fishing effort\n1.   Each flag Member State shall record all relevant data, in particular data referred to in Articles 14, 21, 23, 28 and 62, on fishing opportunities as referred to in this Chapter, expressed both in terms of landings and, where appropriate, fishing effort, and shall keep the originals of those data for a period of three years or longer in accordance with national rules.\n2.   Without prejudice to specific rules laid down in Community legislation, before the 15th of each month, each flag Member State shall notify the Commission or the body designated by it, by computer transmission of the aggregated data:\n(a)\nfor the quantities of each stock or group of stocks subject to TACs or quotas landed during the preceding month; and\n(b)\nfor the fishing effort deployed during the preceding month for each fishing area subject to a fishing effort regime or, where appropriate, for each fishery subject to a fishing effort regime.\n3.   By way of derogation from paragraph 2(a), for quantities landed from 1 January 2010 until 31 December 2010, Member States shall record quantities landed by fishing vessels of other Member States in their ports and notify them to the Commission in accordance with the procedures set out in this Article.\n4.   Each flag Member State shall notify the Commission by electronic means, before the end of the first month of each calendar quarter, of the quantities of stocks in aggregated form other than those mentioned in paragraph 2 landed during the preceding quarter.\n5.   All catches of a stock or a group of stocks subject to quota made by Community fishing vessels shall be charged against the quotas applicable to the flag Member State for the stock or group of stocks in question, irrespective of the place of landing.\n6.   Catches taken in the framework of scientific research which are marketed and sold shall be counted against the quota applicable to the flag Member State insofar as they exceed 2 % of the quotas concerned. Article 12(2) of Council Regulation (EC) No 199/2008 of 25 February 2008 establishing a Community framework for the collection, management and use of data in the fisheries sector and support for scientific advice regarding the Common Fisheries Policy (24) shall not apply to scientific research voyages during which such catches are taken.\n7.   Without prejudice to Title XII, Member States may until 30 June 2011 carry out pilot projects with the Commission and body designated by it on the real-time remote access to Member States data recorded and validated according to this Regulation. The data access format and procedures shall be considered and tested. Member States shall inform the Commission before 1 January 2011 if they plan to carry out pilot projects. As from 1 January 2012 the Council may decide on a different way and frequency of data transmission by Member States to the Commission.\n8.   Except for effort deployed by fishing vessels that are excluded from the application of a fishing effort regime, all fishing effort deployed by Community fishing vessels when carrying on board or, where appropriate, using a fishing gear or gears subject to a fishing effort regime or operating in a fishery subject to a fishing effort regime in a geographical area subject to that fishing effort regime shall be counted against the maximum allowable fishing effort related to such geographical area and to such fishing gear or such fishery available to the flag Member State.\n9.   Fishing effort deployed in the framework of scientific research by a vessel carrying a fishing gear or gears subject to a fishing effort regime or operating in a fishery subject to a fishing effort regime in a geographical area subject to that fishing effort regime shall be counted against the maximum allowable fishing effort related to such fishing gear or gears or such fishery and to such geographical area of its flag Member State if the catches taken during the deployment of this effort are marketed and sold insofar as they exceed 2 % of the fishing effort allocated. Article 12(2) of Regulation (EC) No 199/2008 shall not apply to scientific research voyages during which such catches are taken.\n10.   The Commission may adopt formats for the transmission of the data referred to in this Article in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 119.\nArticle 34\nData on the exhaustion of fishing opportunities\nA Member State shall inform the Commission, without delay, when it establishes that:\n(a)\nthe catches of a stock or group of stocks subject to a quota made by the fishing vessels flying its flag are deemed to have exhausted 80 % of that quota; or\n(b)\n80 % of the maximum fishing effort level related to a fishing gear or a fishery and to a geographical area and applicable to all or a group of the fishing vessels flying its flag is deemed to have been reached.\nIn such an eventuality, it shall provide the Commission, at the Commission’s request, with more detailed and more frequent information than provided for in Article 33.\nSection 4\nClosure of fisheries\nArticle 35\nClosure of fisheries by Member States\n1.   Each Member States shall establish the date from which:\n(a)\nthe catches of a stock or group of stocks subject to a quota made by the fishing vessels flying its flag shall be deemed to have exhausted that quota;\n(b)\nthe maximum allowable fishing effort related to a fishing gear or a fishery and to a geographical area and applicable to all or a group of the fishing vessels flying its flag shall be deemed to have been reached.\n2.   As from the date referred to in paragraph 1, the Member State concerned shall prohibit fishing either for the stock or group of stocks whose quota has been exhausted, in the relevant fishery or when carrying on board the relevant fishing gear in the geographical area where the maximum allowable fishing effort has been reached, by all or part of the fishing vessels flying its flag and in particular the retention on board, the transhipments, the relocations and the landings of fish taken after that date and shall decide on a date up to which transhipments, transfers and landings or final declarations of catches are permitted.\n3.   The decision referred to in paragraph 2 shall be made public by the Member State concerned and immediately communicated to the Commission. It shall be published in the Official Journal of the European Union (C series) and on the public website of the Commission. As from the date that the decision has been made public by the Member State concerned, Member States shall ensure that no retention on board, transhipments, relocations or landings either of the relevant fish or when carrying on board relevant fishing gears in relevant geographical areas by fishing vessels or a group of the vessels flying the flag of the Member State concerned take place in their waters and on their territory.\n4.   The Commission shall make available to Member States by electronic means the notifications received pursuant to this Article.\nArticle 36\nClosure of fisheries by the Commission\n1.   Where the Commission finds that a Member State has not complied with the obligation to notify the monthly data on fishing opportunities as provided for in Article 33(2), it may set the date on which 80 % of the fishing opportunities of that Member State are deemed to have been exhausted and it may set the estimated date on which the fishing opportunities shall be deemed to have been exhausted.\n2.   On the basis of the information under Article 35 or on its own initiative, where the Commission finds that fishing opportunities available to the Community, a Member State or group of Member States are deemed to have been exhausted, the Commission shall inform the Member States concerned thereof and shall prohibit fishing activities for the respective area, gear, stock, group of stocks or fleet involved in those specific fishing activities.\nArticle 37\nCorrective measures\n1.   When the Commission has prohibited fishing because of the alleged exhaustion of the fishing opportunities available to a Member State or group of Member States or to the Community and it transpires that a Member State has not in fact exhausted its fishing opportunities, this Article shall apply.\n2.   If the prejudice suffered by the Member State for which fishing has been prohibited before its fishing opportunities were exhausted has not been removed, measures shall be adopted with the aim of remedying in an appropriate manner the prejudice caused, in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 119. These measures may involve making deductions from the fishing opportunities of any Member State which has overfished and allocating the quantities so deducted appropriately to the Member States whose fishing activities were prohibited before their fishing opportunities were exhausted.\n3.   The deductions referred to in paragraph 2 and the consequent allocations shall be made taking into account as a matter of priority the species and relevant geographical areas for which the fishing opportunities were fixed. They may be made during the year in which the prejudice occurred or in the succeeding year or years.\n4.   Detailed rules for the application of this Article, and in particular for determining the quantities concerned, shall be adopted in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 119.\nCHAPTER II\nControl of fleet management\nSection 1\nFishing capacity\nArticle 38\nFishing capacity\n1.   Member States shall be responsible for carrying out the necessary checks in order to ensure that the total capacity corresponding to the fishing licences issued by a Member State, in GT and in kW, shall at any moment not be higher than the maximum capacity levels for that Member State established in accordance with:\n(a)\nArticle 13 of Regulation (EC) No 2371/2002;\n(b)\nRegulation (EC) No 639/2004;\n(c)\nRegulation (EC) No 1438/2003; and\n(d)\nRegulation (EC) No 2104/2004.\n2.

Member States shall inform the Commission as part of the report referred to in Article 118 of the check methods used, together with the names and addresses of the bodies responsible for carrying out the verifications referred to in paragraph 2 of this Article.\nSection 2\nEngine power\nArticle 39\nMonitoring of engine power\n1.   It shall be prohibited to fish with a fishing vessel that is equipped with an engine the power of which exceeds the one established in the fishing licence.\n2.   Member States shall ensure that the certified engine power is not exceeded. Member States shall inform the Commission as part of the report referred to in Article 118 on the control measures they have undertaken to ensure that the certified engine power is not exceeded.\n3.   Member States may charge parts or all costs arising from the certification of engine power to the operators of the fishing vessels.\nArticle 40\nCertification of engine power\n1.   Member States shall be responsible for certifying engine power and issuing engine certificates for Community fishing vessels whose propulsion engine power exceeds 120 kilowatts (kW), except vessels using exclusively static gear or dredge gear, auxiliary vessels and vessels used exclusively in aquaculture.\n2.   A new propulsion engine, a replacement propulsion engine and a propulsion engine that has been technically modified of fishing vessels referred to in paragraph 1 shall be officially certified by the Member States’ competent authorities as not being capable of developing more maximum continuous engine power than stated in the engine certificate. Such a certificate shall only be issued if the engine is not capable of developing more than the stated maximum continuous engine power.\n3.   Member States’ competent authorities may assign the certification of engine power to classification societies or to other operators having the necessary expertise for the technical examination of engine power. Those classification societies or other operators shall only certify a propulsion engine as not being capable of exceeding the officially stated power if there is no possibility to increase the performance of the propulsion engine above the certified power.\n4.   It shall be prohibited to use a new propulsion engine, a replacement propulsion engine or a propulsion engine that has been technically modified if such engine has not been officially certified by the Member State concerned.\n5.   This Article shall apply for fishing vessels subject to a fishing effort regime as from 1 January 2012. For other fishing vessels it shall apply as from 1 January 2013.\n6.   Detailed rules for the application of this Section shall be adopted in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 119.\nArticle 41\nVerification of engine power\n1.   Member States shall undertake, following a risk analysis, data verification, established on a sampling plan based on the methodology adopted by the Commission in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 119, of the consistency of engine power using all the information available to the administration concerning the technical characteristics of the vessel concerned. In particular they shall verify the information contained in:\n(a)\nvessel monitoring system records;\n(b)\nthe fishing logbook;\n(c)\nthe Engine International Air Pollution Prevention (EIAPP) Certificate issued for the engine in accordance with Annex VI to the Marpol 73/78 Convention;\n(d)\nclass certificates issued by a recognised ship inspection and survey organisation within the meaning of Directive 94/57/EC;\n(e)\nthe sea trial certificate;\n(f)\nthe Community Fishing Fleet Register; and\n(g)\nany other documents providing relevant information on vessel power or any related technical characteristics.\n2.   Following the analysis of the information referred to in paragraph 1, where there are indications that the engine power of a fishing vessel is greater than the power stated on its fishing licence, Member States shall proceed to a physical verification of the engine power.\nCHAPTER III\nControl of multiannual plans\nArticle 42\nTranshipment in port\n1.   Fishing vessels engaged in fisheries subject to a multiannual plan shall not tranship their catches on board of any other vessel in a designated port or in places close to the shore unless they have been weighed in accordance with Article 60.\n2.   By way of derogation from paragraph 1, fishing vessels may tranship pelagic catches subject to a multiannual plan in designated ports or places close to the shore which have not been weighed provided that a control observer or an official is present on board the receiving vessel or an inspection is carried out before the departure of the receiving vessel after the transhipment is completed. The master of the receiving vessel is responsible for informing the competent authorities of the coastal Member State 24 hours before the estimated departure of the receiving vessel. The control observer or official shall be designated by the competent authorities of the flag Member State of the receiving vessel. If the receiving vessel engages in fishing activities before or after having received such catches, it shall carry on board the control observer or official until the landing of the received catches. The receiving vessel shall land the received catches in a port of a Member State designated for this purpose in accordance with the conditions laid down in Article 43(4) where the catch shall be weighed in accordance with Articles 60 and 61.\nArticle 43\nDesignated ports\n1.   The Council may decide, when adopting a multiannual plan, on a threshold applicable to the live weight of species subject to a multiannual plan, above which a fishing vessel shall be required to land its catches in a designated port or a place close to the shore.\n2.   Where more than the threshold of fish as referred to in paragraph 1 is to be landed, the master of a Community fishing vessel shall ensure that such landing is only made in a designated port or a place close to the shore in the Community.\n3.   When the multiannual plan is applied in the framework of a regional fisheries management organisation, the landings or transhipments may take place in the ports of a Contracting Party or a non-contracting Cooperating Party of that organisation, in accordance with the rules laid down by that regional fisheries management organisation.\n4.   Each Member State shall designate ports or places close to the shore in which landings referred to in paragraph 2 shall take place.\n5.   For a port or place close to the shore to be determined as a designated port, the following conditions shall be met:\n(a)\nestablished landing or transhipment times;\n(b)\nestablished landing or transhipment places;\n(c)\nestablished inspection and surveillance procedures.\n6.   Where a port or place close to the shore has been determined as a designated port for the landing of a given species subject to a multiannual plan, it may be used for the landing of any other species.\n7.   Member States shall be exempted from paragraph 5(c) if the national control action programme adopted in accordance with Article 46 contains a plan on how to perform control in designated ports, ensuring the same level of control by competent authorities. The plan shall be deemed satisfactory if agreed by the Commission in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 119.\nArticle 44\nSeparate stowage of demersal catches subject to multiannual plans\n1.   All catches of demersal stocks subject to a multiannual plan retained on board a Community fishing vessel of 12 metres’ length overall or more shall be placed in boxes, compartments or containers separately for each of such stocks in such a way that they are identifiable from other boxes, compartments or containers.\n2.   Masters of Community fishing vessels shall keep the catches of demersal stocks subject to a multiannual plan according to a stowage plan that describes the location of the different species in the holds.\n3.   It shall be prohibited to retain on board a Community fishing vessel in any box, compartment or container any quantity of catches of demersal stocks subject to a multiannual plan mixed with any other fisheries product.\nArticle 45\nReal time use of quotas\n1.   When accumulated catches of stocks subject to a multiannual plan have reached a certain threshold of the national quota, data on catches shall be sent more frequently to the Commission.\n2.   The Council shall decide on the relevant threshold to apply and the frequency of the communication of the data referred to in paragraph 1.\nArticle 46\nNational control action programmes\n1.   Member States shall define a national control action programme applicable to each multiannual plan. All national control action programmes shall be notified to the Commission or made available on the secure part of the Member State’s website in accordance with Article 115(a).\n2.   Member States shall set out specific inspection benchmarks in accordance with Annex I. Such benchmarks shall be defined in accordance with risk management and shall be revised periodically after an analysis of the results achieved has been made. Inspection benchmarks shall evolve progressively until the target benchmarks defined in Annex I are reached.\nCHAPTER IV\nControl of technical measures\nSection 1\nUse of fishing gear\nArticle 47\nFishing gear\nIn fisheries in which it is not allowed to use more than one type of gear, any other gear shall be lashed and stowed so that it may not readily be used, in accordance with the following conditions:\n(a)\nnets, weights and similar gear shall be disconnected from their trawl boards and towing and hauling wires and ropes;\n(b)\nnets which are on or above deck shall be securely lashed and stowed;\n(c)\nlonglines shall be stowed in lower decks.\nArticle 48\nRetrieval of lost gear\n1.   A Community fishing vessel shall have the equipment on board to retrieve lost gear.\n2.   The master of a Community fishing vessel that has lost gear or part of it shall attempt to retrieve it as soon as possible.\n3.   If the lost gear cannot be retrieved, the master of the vessel shall inform the competent authority of its flag Member State, which shall then inform the competent authority of the coastal Member State, within 24 hours of the following:\n(a)\nthe external identification number and the name of the fishing vessel;\n(b)\nthe type of lost gear;\n(c)\nthe time when the gear was lost;\n(d)\nthe position where the gear was lost;\n(e)\nthe measures undertaken to retrieve the gear.\n4.   If the gear that is retrieved by the competent authorities of the Member States has not been reported as lost, these authorities may recover the cost from the master of the fishing vessel that lost the gear.\n5.   A Member State may exempt Community fishing vessels of less than 12 metres’ length overall flying its flag from the requirement set out in paragraph 1 if they:\n(a)\noperate exclusively within the territorial seas of the flag Member State; or\n(b)\nnever spend more than 24 hours at sea from the time of departure to the return to port.\nArticle 49\nCatch composition\n1.   If catches which have been retained on board any Community fishing vessel have been taken with nets with different minimum mesh sizes during the same voyage, the species composition shall be calculated for each part of the catch which has been taken under different conditions. To that end, all changes from the mesh size previously used as well as the catch composition on board at the moment of any such change shall be entered into the fishing logbook.\n2.   Without prejudice to Article 44, detailed rules on the keeping on board of a stowage plan, by species, of processed products, indicating where they are located in the hold, may be adopted in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 119.\nSection 2\nControl of fishing restricted areas\nArticle 50\nControl of fishing restricted areas\n1.   Fishing activities of Community fishing vessels and third country fishing vessels in fishing zones where a fishing restricted area has been established by the Council shall be controlled by the fisheries monitoring centre of the coastal Member State, which shall have a system to detect and record the vessels’ entry into, transit through and exit from the fishing restricted areas.\n2.   In addition to paragraph 1, the Council shall establish a date from which the fishing vessels shall have an operational system on board which shall alert the master of the entry and exit into a fishing restricted area.\n3.   The frequency of data transmissions shall be of at least once every 30 minutes when a fishing vessel enters a fishing restricted area.\n4.   Transit through a fishing restricted area is allowed for all fishing vessels that are not authorised to fish in such areas subject to the following conditions:\n(a)\nall gears carried on board are lashed and stowed during the transit; and\n(b)\nthe speed during transit is not less than six knots except in case of force majeure or adverse conditions. In such cases, the master shall immediately inform the fisheries monitoring centre of the flag Member State which shall then inform the competent authorities of the coastal Member State.\n5.   This Article shall apply to Community fishing vessels and third country fishing vessels of 12 metres’ length overall or more.\nSection 3\nReal-time closure of fisheries\nArticle 51\nGeneral provisions\n1.   When a trigger catch level of a particular species or group of species as defined in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 119 has been reached, the area concerned shall be temporarily closed to the relevant fisheries in accordance with this Section.\n2.   The trigger catch level shall be calculated on the basis of a sampling methodology adopted by the Commission in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 119, as the percentage or weight of a particular species or group of species compared to the total catch in a haul of the fish concerned.\n3.   Detailed rules for the application of this Section may be adopted in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 119.\nArticle 52\nTrigger catch in two hauls\n1.   Where the quantity of catches exceeds a trigger catch level in two consecutive hauls, the fishing vessel shall change the fishing area by at least five nautical miles, or two nautical miles for fishing vessels of less than 12 metres’ length overall, from any position of the previous haul before continuing fishing and shall inform without delay the competent authorities of the coastal Member State.\n2.   The Commission in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 119, at its own initiative or at the request of the Member State concerned, may modify distances referred to in paragraph 1.\nArticle 53\nReal-time closure by Member States\n1.   When an official, control observer or research platform detects that a trigger catch level has been reached, the official, the control observer of the coastal Member State or the person who is participating in a joint operation under a Joint Deployment Plan shall inform without delay the competent authorities of the coastal Member State.\n2.   On the basis of the information received in accordance with paragraph 1 the coastal Member State shall decide the real-time closure of the area concerned without delay. It may also use the information received in accordance with Article 52, or any available information for this decision. The decision establishing the real-time closure shall define clearly the geographical area of the affected fishing grounds, the duration of the closure and the conditions governing fisheries in that area during the closure.\n3.   If the area referred to in paragraph 2 straddles jurisdictions, the Member State concerned shall without delay inform the neighbouring coastal Member State of the findings and the decision to close. The neighbouring coastal Member State shall close its part of the area without delay.\n4.   The real time closure referred to in paragraph 2 shall be non-discriminatory and shall only apply to fishing vessels that are equipped to catch the species concerned and/or which have an authorisation to fish on the fishing grounds concerned.\n5.   The coastal Member State shall inform without delay the Commission, all Member States and third countries whose fishing vessels are authorised to operate in the area concerned that a real-time closure has been established.\n6.   The Commission may request the Member State at any time to cancel or amend the real time closure with immediate effect if the Member State concerned has not provided sufficient information that a trigger catch level has been reached in accordance with Article 51.\n7.   Fishing activities in the area referred to in paragraph 2 shall be prohibited as defined in the decision establishing the real-time closure.\nArticle 54\nReal-time closure by the Commission\n1.   On the basis of the information demonstrating that a trigger catch level has been reached the Commission may determine an area to be temporarily closed if the coastal Member State has not itself established such a closure.\n2.   The Commission shall inform without delay all Member States and third countries whose fishing vessels operate in the closed area and shall make available without delay on its official website a map with the coordinates of the area temporarily closed, specifying the duration of the closure and the conditions governing fisheries in that specific closed area.\nCHAPTER V\nControl of recreational fisheries\nArticle 55\nRecreational fisheries\n1.   Member States shall ensure that recreational fisheries on their territory and in Community waters are conducted in a manner compatible with the objectives and rules of the common fisheries policy.\n2.   The marketing of catches from recreational fisheries shall be prohibited.\n3.   Without prejudice to Regulation (EC) No 199/2008, Member States shall monitor, on the basis of a sampling plan, the catches of stocks subject to recovery plans by recreational fisheries practised from vessels flying their flag and from third country vessels in waters under their sovereignty or jurisdiction. Fishing from shore shall not be included.\n4.   The Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries (STECF) shall evaluate the biological impact of recreational fisheries as referred to in paragraph 3. Where a recreational fishery is found to have a significant impact, the Council may decide, in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 37 of the Treaty, to submit recreational fisheries as referred to in paragraph 3 to specific management measures such as fishing authorisations and catch declarations.\n5.   Detailed rules for the application of this Article shall be adopted in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 119.\nTITLE V\nCONTROL OF MARKETING\nCHAPTER I\nGeneral provisions\nArticle 56\nPrinciples for the control of marketing\n1.

This information shall be noted in the inspection report.\nArticle 83\nInfringements detected outside the waters of the inspecting Member State\n1.   If an infringement has been detected as a result of an inspection carried out in accordance with Article 80, the inspecting Member State shall without delay submit a summary inspection report to the coastal Member State or, in case of an inspection outside Community waters, to the flag Member State of the fishing vessel concerned. A full inspection report shall be submitted to the coastal and to the flag Member State within 15 days from the time of inspection.\n2.   The coastal Member State or, in case of an inspection outside Community waters, the flag Member State of the fishing vessel concerned shall undertake all appropriate measures in respect of the infringement referred to in paragraph 1.\nArticle 84\nEnhanced follow-up with regard to certain serious infringements\n1.   The flag Member State or the coastal Member State in whose waters a fishing vessel is suspected of having:\n(a)\nmisrecorded catches of stocks subject to a multiannual plan of more than 500 kg or 10 %, calculated as a percentage of the fishing logbook figures, whichever is the higher; or\n(b)\ncommitted any of the serious infringements referred to in Article 42 of Regulation (EC) No 1005/2008 or in Article 90(1) of this Regulation within one year of committing a first such serious infringement;\nmay require the fishing vessel to proceed immediately to a port for a full investigation, in addition to the measures referred to in Chapter IX of Regulation (EC) No 1005/2008.\n2.   The coastal Member State shall immediately and in compliance with its procedures under national law notify the flag Member State of the investigation referred to in paragraph 1.\n3.   Officials may remain on board a fishing vessel until a full investigation as referred to in paragraph 1 has been undertaken.\n4.   The master of the fishing vessel referred to in paragraph 1 shall cease all fishing activities and proceed to port if he has been requested to do so.\nCHAPTER IV\nProceedings of infringements detected in the course of inspections\nArticle 85\nProceedings\nWithout prejudice to Article 83(2) and Article 86, where an infringement of the rules of the common fisheries policy is discovered by the competent authorities in the course of or after an inspection, the competent authorities of the inspecting Member State shall take appropriate measures in accordance with Title VIII against the master of the vessel involved or against any other legal or natural person responsible for the infringement.\nArticle 86\nTransfer of proceedings\n1.   The Member State in the territory or waters of which an infringement has been discovered may transfer proceedings relating to that infringement to the competent authorities of the flag Member State or the Member State of which the offender holds the citizenship, with the agreement of the Member State concerned and on condition that the transfer is more likely to achieve the result referred to in Article 89(2).\n2.   The flag Member State may transfer proceedings relating to an infringement to the competent authorities of the inspecting Member State, with the agreement of the Member State concerned and on condition that the transfer is more likely to achieve the result referred to in Article 89(2).\nArticle 87\nInfringement detected by Community inspectors\nMember States shall undertake all appropriate measures in respect of any infringement that a Community inspector has discovered in the waters under their sovereignty or jurisdiction, or on a fishing vessel flying their flag.\nArticle 88\nCorrective measures in the absence of proceedings by the Member State of landing or transhipment\n1.   If the Member State of landing or transhipment is not the flag Member State and its competent authorities do not take appropriate measures against the natural or legal persons responsible, or do not transfer proceedings in accordance with Article 86, the quantities illegally landed or transhipped may be set against the quota allocated to the Member State of landing or transhipment.\n2.   The quantities of fish to be set against the quota of the Member State of landing or transhipment shall be fixed in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 119 after the Commission has consulted the two Member States concerned.\n3.   If the Member State of landing or transhipment no longer has a corresponding quota at its disposal, Article 37 shall apply. To that end the quantities of fish illegally landed or transhipped shall be deemed equivalent to the amount of the prejudice suffered, as mentioned in that Article, by the flag Member State.\nTITLE VIII\nENFORCEMENT\nArticle 89\nMeasures to ensure compliance\n1.   Member States shall ensure that appropriate measures are systematically taken, including administrative action or criminal proceedings in conformity with their national law, against the natural or legal persons suspected of a breach of any of the rules of the common fisheries policy.\n2.   The overall level of sanctions and accompanying sanctions shall be calculated, in accordance with the relevant provisions of national law, in such way as to make sure that they effectively deprive those responsible of the economic benefit derived from their infringement without prejudice to the legitimate right to exercise their profession. Those sanctions shall also be capable of producing results proportionate to the seriousness of such infringements, thereby effectively discouraging further offences of the same kind.\n3.   Member States may apply a system whereby a fine is proportionate to the turnover of the legal person, or to the financial advantage achieved or envisaged by committing the infringement.\n4.   The competent authorities of the Member State having jurisdiction in the event of an infringement shall, without delay and in compliance with their procedures under national law, notify the flag Member States, the Member State of which the offender holds the citizenship, or any other Member State with an interest in following up the administrative action, criminal proceedings or other measures taken and of any definitive ruling relating to such infringement, including the number of points assigned in accordance with Article 92.\nArticle 90\nSanctions for serious infringements\n1.   In addition to Article 42 of Regulation (EC) No 1005/2008, the following activities shall also be considered as serious infringements for the purpose of this Regulation depending on the gravity of the infringement in question which shall be determined by the competent authority of the Member State, taking into account criteria such as the nature of the damage, its value, the economic situation of the offender and the extent of the infringement or its repetition:\n(a)\nthe non-transmission of a landing declaration or a sales note when the landing of the catch has taken place in the port of a third country;\n(b)\nthe manipulation of an engine with the aim of increasing its power beyond the maximum continuous engine power according to the engine certificate;\n(c)\nthe failure to land any species subject to a quota caught during a fishing operation, unless such landing would be contrary to obligations provided for in the rules of the common fisheries policy in fisheries or fishing zones where such rules apply.\n2.   Member States shall ensure that a natural person having committed or a legal person held liable for a serious infringement is punishable by effective, proportionate and dissuasive administrative sanctions, in accordance with the range of sanctions and measures provided for in Chapter IX of Regulation (EC) No 1005/2008.\n3.   Without prejudice to Article 44(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1005/2008, the Member States shall impose a sanction that is effectively dissuasive and, as appropriate, calculated on the value of the fisheries products obtained by committing a serious infringement.\n4.   In fixing the sanction, the Member States shall also take into account the value of the prejudice to the fishing resources and the marine environment concerned.\n5.   Member States may also, or alternatively, use effective, proportionate and dissuasive criminal sanctions.\n6.   The sanctions provided for in this Chapter may be accompanied by other sanctions or measures, in particular those described in Article 45 of Regulation (EC) No 1005/2008.\nArticle 91\nImmediate enforcement measures\nMember States shall take immediate measures to prevent masters of fishing vessels or other natural persons and legal persons caught in the act of committing a serious infringement, as defined in Article 42 of Regulation (EC) No 1005/2008, from continuing to do so.\nArticle 92\nPoint system for serious infringements\n1.   Member States shall apply a point system for serious infringements as referred to in Article 42(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 1005/2008 on the basis of which the holder of a fishing licence is assigned the appropriate number of points as a result of an infringement of the rules of the common fisheries policy.\n2.   When a natural person has committed or a legal person is held liable for a serious infringement of the rules of the common fisheries policy, the appropriate number of points shall be assigned to the holder of the fishing licence as a result of the infringement. The points assigned shall be transferred to any future holder of the fishing licence for the fishing vessel concerned where the vessel is sold, transferred or otherwise changes ownership after the date of the infringement. The holder of the fishing licence shall be entitled to review proceedings in accordance with national law.\n3.   When the total number of points equals or exceeds a specified number of points, the fishing licence shall be automatically suspended for a period of at least two months. That period shall be four months if the fishing licence is suspended a second time, eight months if the fishing licence is suspended a third time and one year if the fishing licence is suspended a fourth time as a consequence of a licence holder being assigned the specified number of points. In case of the holder being assigned the specified number of points for a fifth time, the fishing licence shall be permanently withdrawn.\n4.   If the holder of a fishing licence does not commit, within three years from the date of the last serious infringement, another serious infringement, all points on the fishing licence shall be deleted.\n5.   Detailed rules for the application of this Article shall be adopted in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 119.\n6.   Member States shall also establish a point system under which the master of a vessel is assigned the appropriate number of points as a result of a serious infringement of the rules of the common fisheries policy committed by him.\nArticle 93\nNational register of infringements\n1.   Member States shall enter in a national register all infringements of the rules of the common fisheries policy committed by vessels flying their flag or by their nationals, including the sanctions they incurred and the number of points assigned. Infringements of fishing vessels flying their flag or by their nationals prosecuted in other Member States shall also be entered by Member States in their national register on infringements, upon notification of the definitive ruling by the Member State having jurisdiction, pursuant to Article 90.\n2.   When following up an infringement of rules of the common fisheries policy, a Member State may request other Member States to provide information contained in their national register on the fishing vessels and persons suspected of having committed the infringement in question or caught in the act of committing the infringement in question.\n3.   Where a Member State requests information from another Member State in relation to the measures taken on an infringement, that other Member State may provide the relevant information on the fishing vessels and persons in question.\n4.   The data contained in the national register of infringements shall be stored only for as long as necessary for the purpose of this Regulation, but always for a minimum of three calendar years, starting from the year following that in which the information is recorded.\nTITLE IX\nCONTROL PROGRAMMES\nArticle 94\nCommon control programmes\nMember States may carry out, among themselves and on their initiative, control, inspection and surveillance programmes concerning fisheries activities.\nArticle 95\nSpecific control and inspection programmes\n1.   The Commission in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 119 and in concert with the Member State concerned, may determine which fisheries shall be subject to specific control and inspection programmes.\n2.   The specific control and inspection programmes referred to in paragraph 1 shall state the objectives, priorities and procedures as well as benchmarks for inspection activities. Such benchmarks shall be established based on risk management and revised periodically after an analysis has been made of the results achieved.\n3.   When a multiannual plan has entered into force and before a specific control and inspection programme has become applicable, each Member State shall establish risk management based target benchmarks for inspection activities.\n4.   The Member States concerned shall adopt the necessary measures to ensure the implementation of the specific control and inspection programmes, particularly as regards required human and material resources and the periods and zones where these are to be deployed.\nTITLE X\nEVALUATION AND CONTROL BY THE COMMISSION\nArticle 96\nGeneral principles\n1.   The Commission shall control and evaluate the application of the rules of the common fisheries policy by the Member States by means of the examination of information and documents and by conducting verifications, autonomous inspections and audits and shall facilitate coordination and cooperation between them. For this purpose the Commission may, of its own accord and by its own means, initiate and carry out inquiries, verifications, inspections and audits. It may in particular verify:\n(a)\nthe implementation and application of the rules of the common fisheries policy by Member States and their competent authorities;\n(b)\nthe implementation and application of the rules of the common fisheries policy in the waters of a third country in accordance with an international agreement with that country;\n(c)\nthe conformity of national administrative practices and inspection and surveillance activities with the rules of the common fisheries policy;\n(d)\nthe existence of the required documents and their compatibility with the applicable rules;\n(e)\nthe circumstances in which control activities are carried out by Member States;\n(f)\nthe detection and proceedings of infringements;\n(g)\nthe cooperation between Member States.\n2.   Member States shall cooperate with the Commission in order to facilitate the accomplishment of its tasks. Member States shall ensure that the verification, autonomous inspection and audit missions carried out under this Title are not subject to publicity that is injurious to on-the-spot missions. Wherever the Commission officials encounter difficulties in the execution of their duties, the Member States concerned shall provide the Commission with the means to accomplish its task and give the Commission officials the opportunity to evaluate the specific control and inspection operations.\nMember States shall afford the Commission such assistance as it needs to fulfil its tasks.\nArticle 97\nCompetences of Commission officials\n1.   Commission officials may carry out verifications and inspections on fishing vessels as well as on the premises of businesses and other bodies with activities relating to the common fisheries policy and shall have access to all information and documents needed to exercise their responsibilities, to the same extent and under the same conditions as officials of the Member State in which the verification and inspection take place.\n2.   Commission officials shall be entitled to take copies of the relevant files and to take the necessary samples if they have reasonable grounds to believe that the rules of the common fisheries policy are not complied with. They may request the identification of any person found on the inspected premises.\n3.   Commission officials shall have no powers going beyond those of national inspectors and they shall have no police and enforcement powers.\n4.   Commission officials shall present a written authority stating their identity and capacity.\n5.   The Commission shall issue written instructions to its officials indicating their authority and the objectives of their mission.\nArticle 98\nVerifications\n1.   Wherever it is deemed necessary by the Commission, its officials may be present during control activities carried out by national control authorities. In the framework of these missions of verification, the Commission shall establish appropriate contacts with Member States with a view, wherever possible, to establishing a mutually acceptable verification programme.\n2.   The Member State concerned shall ensure that the bodies or persons concerned accept to be submitted to the verifications referred to in paragraph 1.\n3.   If the control and inspection operations envisaged in the framework of the initial verification programme cannot be carried out for factual reasons, the Commission officials, in liaison and agreement with the competent authorities of the Member State concerned, shall modify the initial verification programme.\n4.   In case of sea or air controls and inspections, the commander of the vessel or aircraft shall be in sole charge of the control and inspection operations. In exercising his command he shall take due account of the verification programme referred to in paragraph 1.\n5.   The Commission may arrange for its officials visiting a Member State to be accompanied by one or more officials from another Member State as observers. Upon request from the Commission the sending Member State shall nominate, at short notice if necessary, the national officials selected as observers. Member States may also draw up a list of national officials whom the Commission may invite to be present at such controls and inspections. The Commission can invite national officials included in that list or those notified to the Commission at its discretion. The Commission shall, where appropriate, place the list at the disposal of all the Member States.\n6.   Commission officials may decide, if they consider it necessary, to carry out missions of verification referred to in this Article without prior notice.\nArticle 99\nAutonomous inspections\n1.   When there is reason to believe that irregularities occur in the application of the rules of the common fisheries policy, the Commission may carry out autonomous inspections. It shall carry out such inspections of its own accord and without the presence of officials of the Member State concerned.\n2.   All operators may be subject to autonomous inspections where these are considered necessary.\n3.   In the framework of autonomous inspections on the territory or in waters under the sovereignty or jurisdiction of a Member State, the procedural rules of that Member State shall apply.\n4.   If a serious infringement of the provisions of this Regulation is discovered by Commission officials on the territory or in waters under the sovereignty or jurisdiction of a Member State, Commission officials shall inform without delay the competent authorities of the Member State concerned which shall undertake all appropriate measures in respect of such infringement.\nArticle 100\nAudits\nThe Commission may carry out audits of the control systems of Member States. The audits may include in particular the evaluation of:\n(a)\nthe quota and the effort management system;\n(b)\ndata validation systems, including systems of cross-checks of vessel monitoring systems, catch, effort and marketing data and data related to the Community fishing fleet register as well as the verification of licences and fishing authorisations;\n(c)\nthe administrative organisation, including the adequacy of the available staff and the available means, the training of staff, the delimitation of functions of all authorities involved in control as well as the mechanisms in place to coordinate the work and the joint evaluation of the results of those authorities;\n(d)\nthe operational systems, including procedures for control of designated ports;\n(e)\nnational control action programmes including the establishment of inspection levels and their implementation;\n(f)\nthe national system of sanctions, including the adequacy of the sanctions imposed, duration of proceedings, economic benefits forfeited by offenders and the deterrent nature of such system of sanctions.\nArticle 101\nVerification, autonomous inspection and audit reports\n1.   The Commission shall inform the Member States concerned of the preliminary findings of verifications and of autonomous inspections within one day after they have taken place.\n2.   Commission officials shall draw up a verification, autonomous inspection or audit report after each verification, autonomous inspection or audit. The report shall be made available to the Member State concerned within one month after the conclusion of the verification, autonomous inspection or audit. Member States shall have the possibility to comment on the findings of the report within one month.\n3.   Member States shall take the necessary action on the basis of the report referred to in paragraph 2.\n4.   The Commission shall publish the finalised verification, autonomous inspection and audit reports, together with the comments of the Member State concerned, on the secure part of its official website.\nArticle 102\nFollow-up of verification, autonomous inspection and audit reports\n1.   Member States shall provide the Commission with any relevant information as that may request on the implementation of this Regulation. In submitting a request for information, the Commission shall specify a reasonable time limit within which the information is to be supplied.\n2.   If the Commission considers that irregularities have occurred in the implementation of the rules of the common fisheries policy or that the existing control provisions and methods in particular Member States are not effective it shall inform the Member States concerned, which shall then conduct an administrative inquiry in which Commission officials may participate.\n3.   The Member States concerned shall inform the Commission of the results of the inquiry and forward a report to the Commission drawn up not more than three months after the Commission’s request. This period may be extended by the Commission, on a duly reasoned request from the Member State, for a reasonable delay.\n4.   If the administrative inquiry referred to in paragraph 2 does not lead to the removal of the irregularities or if the Commission identifies shortcomings in the control system of a Member State during the verifications or autonomous inspections referred to in Articles 98 and 99 or in the audit referred to in Article 100, the Commission shall establish an action plan with that Member State. The Member State shall take all necessary measures to implement that action plan.\nTITLE XI\nMEASURES TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE BY MEMBER STATES WITH COMMON FISHERIES POLICY OBJECTIVES\nCHAPTER I\nFinancial measures\nArticle 103\nSuspension and cancellation of Community financial assistance\n1.   The Commission may decide to suspend for a maximum period of 18 months all or part of the payments of the Community financial assistance under Regulation (EC) No 1198/2006 and Article 8(a) of Regulation (EC) No 861/2006 where there is evidence that:\n(a)\nthe effectiveness of the measures being financed is or is likely to be affected by non-compliance with the rules of the common fisheries policy, in particular in the fields of conservation and management of fisheries resources, the adaptation of fleet and fisheries control;\n(b)\nthe non-compliance is directly attributable to the Member State concerned; and\n(c)\nthe non-compliance may lead to a serious threat to the conservation of living aquatic resources or the effective operation of the Community control and enforcement system,\nand where the Commission concludes, on the basis of the information available and, where appropriate, after examination of the Member State’s explanations, that the Member State concerned has not taken adequate measures to remedy the situation and is not in a position to do so in the immediate future.\n2.   Where, during the period of suspension, the Member State concerned still fails to demonstrate that it has taken remedial action to ensure compliance with and the enforcement of applicable rules in the future or that there is no serious risk that the future effective operation of the Community control and enforcement system will be impaired, the Commission may cancel all or part of the Community financial assistance the payment of which was suspended pursuant to paragraph 1. Such cancellation shall only be made after the corresponding payment has been suspended for 12 months.\n3.   Before taking the measures referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2, the Commission shall inform in writing the Member State concerned of its findings relating to failures in the control system of the Member State and its intention to adopt the decision referred to paragraph 1 or 2, and shall request it to take remedial action within a period to be determined by the Commission according to the gravity of the infringement, which shall not be less than one month.\n4.   If the Member State fails to reply to the letter referred to in paragraph 3 within the period to be determined in accordance with that paragraph, the Commission may take the decision referred to in paragraph 1 or 2 on the basis of the information available at that time.\n5.   The percentage by which payments may be suspended or cancelled shall be proportionate to the nature and importance of the Member State’s non-compliance with applicable rules on conservation, control, inspection or enforcement and the gravity of the threat to the conservation of living aquatic resources or the effective operation of the Community control and enforcement system and shall take into account the extent to which the effectiveness of the measures being financed is or is likely to be affected. It shall take into account, and be limited by, the relative share of the fishery and fishery-related activities, to which non-compliance relates, within the measures financed by the financial assistance referred to in paragraph 1.\n6.   Decisions under this Article shall be taken with due regard to all relevant circumstances and in such a way that a real economic link exists between the subject matter of the compliance failure and the measure to which the suspended payment or cancelled Community financial assistance relates.\n7.   A suspension shall be discontinued if the conditions laid down in paragraph 1 are no longer met.\n8.   Detailed rules for the application of this Article shall be adopted in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 119.\nCHAPTER II\nClosure of fisheries\nArticle 104\nClosure of fisheries for failure to comply with the common fisheries policy objectives\n1.   Where a Member State does not respect its obligations for the implementation of a multiannual plan, and where the Commission has evidence that the failure to respect those obligations constitutes a serious threat to the conservation of the stock concerned, the Commission may provisionally close the fisheries affected by those shortcomings for the Member State concerned.\n2.   The Commission shall inform in writing the Member State concerned of its findings and the relevant documentation and set a deadline of no more than ten working days for the Member State to demonstrate that the fisheries can be safely exploited.\n3.   The measures referred to in paragraph 1 shall only apply if the Member State fails to respond to the request of the Commission within the deadline given in paragraph 2 or if the response is considered unsatisfactory or is clearly indicative of the fact that the necessary measures have not been implemented.\n4.   The Commission shall lift the closure after the Member State has demonstrated in writing to the satisfaction of the Commission that the fisheries can be safely exploited.\nCHAPTER III\nDeduction and transfers of quotas and fishing effort\nArticle 105\nDeduction of quotas\n1.   When the Commission has established that a Member State has exceeded the quotas which have been allocated to it, the Commission shall operate deductions from future quotas of that Member State.\n2.   In the case of an overfishing of a quota, allocation or share of a stock or a group of stocks available to a Member State in a given year the Commission shall operate deductions in the following year or years from the annual quota, allocation or share of the Member State which has overfished by applying a multiplying factor according to the following table:\nExtent of overfishing relative to the permitted landings\nMultiplying factor\nUp to 5 %\nOverfishing * 1,0\nOver 5 % up to 10 %\nOverfishing * 1,1\nOver 10 % up to 20 %\nOverfishing * 1,2\nOver 20 % up to 40 %\nOverfishing * 1,4\nOver 40 % up to 50 %\nOverfishing * 1,8\nAny further overfishing greater than 50 %\nOverfishing * 2,0\nHowever, a deduction equal to the overfishing * 1,00 shall apply in all cases of overfishing relative to permitted landing equal to, or less than, 100 tonnes.\n3.   In addition to the multiplying factors referred to in paragraph 2, a multiplying factor of 1,5 shall apply if:\n(a)\na Member State has repeatedly overfished its quota, allocation or share of the stock or group of stocks over the previous two years and these overfishings have been the subject of deductions as referred to in paragraph 2;\n(b)\nthe available scientific, technical and economic advice and in particular the reports drawn up by STECF have established that overfishing constitutes a serious threat to the conservation of the stock concerned; or\n(c)\nthe stock is subject to a multiannual plan.\n4.   In the case of an overfishing of a quota, allocation or share of a stock or a group of stocks available to a Member State in earlier years, the Commission, after consultation of the Member State concerned, may deduct quotas in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 119 from future quotas of that Member State to take account of the level of overfishing.\n5.   If a deduction according to paragraphs 1 and 2 cannot be operated on the quota, allocation or share of a stock or group of stocks that was overfished as such because that quota, allocation or share of a stock or group of stocks is not or not sufficiently available to the Member State concerned, the Commission, after consultation of the Member State concerned, may deduct in the following year or years quotas for other stocks or groups of stocks available to that Member State in the same geographical area, or with the same commercial value in accordance with paragraph 1.\n6.   Detailed rules for the application of this Article, and in particular for determining the quantities concerned, may be adopted in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 119.\nArticle 106\nDeduction of fishing effort\n1.   When the Commission has established that a Member State has exceeded the fishing effort which has been allocated to it, the Commission shall operate deductions from future fishing effort of that Member State.\n2.   If the fishing effort in a geographical area or in a fishery available to a Member State is exceeded the Commission shall operate deductions in the following year or years from the fishing effort available to that Member State for the geographical area or the fishery concerned by applying a multiplying factor according to the following table:\nExtent of excess of available fishing effort\nMultiplying factor\nUp to 5 %\nExcess* 1,0\nOver 5 % up to 10 %\nExcess* 1,1\nOver 10 % up to 20 %\nExcess* 1,2\nOver 20 % up to 40 %\nExcess* 1,4\nOver 40 % up to 50 %\nExcess* 1,8\nAny further excess greater than 50 %\nExcess* 2,0\n3.   If a deduction according to paragraph 2 cannot be operated on the maximum allowable fishing effort that was exceeded as such because such maximum allowable fishing effort is not or not sufficiently available to the Member State concerned, the Commission may deduct in the following year or years fishing effort available to that Member State in the same geographical area in accordance with paragraph 2.\n4.   Detailed rules for the application of this Article, and in particular for determining the fishing effort concerned, may be adopted in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 119.\nArticle 107\nDeduction of quotas for failure to comply with the rules of the common fisheries policy\n1.   Where there is evidence that rules on stocks subject to multiannual plans are not being complied with by a Member State and that this may lead to a serious threat to the conservation of these stocks, the Commission may operate deductions in the following year or years from the annual quotas, allocations or shares of a stock or group of stocks available to that Member State, applying the proportionality principle by taking into account the damage caused to the stocks.\n2.   The Commission shall inform in writing the Member State concerned of its findings and set a deadline of no more than 15 working days for the Member State to demonstrate that the fisheries can be safely exploited.\n3.   The measures referred to in paragraph 1 shall only apply if the Member State fails to respond to the request of the Commission within the deadline given in paragraph 2 or if the response is considered unsatisfactory or is clearly indicative of the fact that the necessary measures have not been implemented.\n4.   Detailed rules for the application of this Article, and in particular for determining the quantities concerned, shall be adopted in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 119.\nCHAPTER IV\nEmergency measures\nArticle 108\nEmergency measures\n1.   If there is evidence, including based on the results of the sampling carried out by the Commission, that fishing activities and/or measures adopted by a Member State or Member States undermine the conservation and management measures adopted in the framework of multiannual plans or threaten the marine eco-system and this requires immediate action, the Commission, at the substantiated request of any Member State or on its own initiative, may decide on emergency measures which shall last not more than six months. The Commission may take a new decision to extend the emergency measures for no more than six months.\n2.   The emergency measures provided for in paragraph 1 shall be proportionate to the threat and may include, inter alia:\n(a)\nsuspension of fishing activities of vessels flying the flag of the Member States concerned;\n(b)\nclosure of fisheries;\n(c)\nprohibition against Community operators accepting landings, placing in cages for fattening or farming, or transhipments of fish and fisheries products caught by the vessels flying the flag of the Member States concerned;\n(d)\nprohibition against the placing on the market or use for other commercial purposes fish and fisheries products caught by the vessels flying the flag of the Member States concerned;\n(e)\nprohibition against the provision of live fish for fish farming in the waters under the jurisdiction of the Member States concerned;\n(f)\nprohibition against the accepting of live fish caught by vessels flying the flag of the Member State concerned for the purposes of fish farming in waters under the jurisdiction of the other Member States;\n(g)\nprohibition against fishing vessels flying the flag of the Member State concerned to fish in waters under the jurisdiction of other Member States;\n(h)\nmodification of the fishing data submitted by Member States in an appropriate way.\n3.   A Member State shall communicate the request referred to in paragraph 1 simultaneously to the Commission and to the Member States concerned. The other Member States may submit their written comments to the Commission within five working days of receipt of the request. The Commission shall take a decision within 15 working days of receipt of the request.\n4.   The emergency measures shall have immediate effect. They shall be notified to the Member States concerned and published in the Official Journal of the European Union.\n5.   The Member States concerned may refer the Commission decision to the Council within 15 working days of receipt of the notification.\n6.   The Council, acting by qualified majority, may take a different decision within one month of the date of receipt of the referral.\nTITLE XII\nDATA AND INFORMATION\nCHAPTER I\nAnalysis and audit of data\nArticle 109\nGeneral principles for the analysis of data\n1.   Member States shall set up a computerised database for the purpose of validation of data recorded in accordance with this Regulation and a validation system no later than 31 December 2013.\n2.   Member States shall ensure that all data recorded in accordance with this Regulation are accurate, complete and submitted within deadlines laid down in the common fisheries policy. In particular:\n(a)\nMember States shall perform cross-checking, analyses and verifications of the following data through automated computerised algorithms and mechanisms:\n(i)\nvessel monitoring system data;\n(ii)\nfishing activities data, in particular the fishing logbook, the landing declaration, the transhipment declaration and prior notification;\n(iii)\ndata from take-over declarations, transport documents and sales notes;\n(iv)\ndata from fishing licences and fishing authorisations;\n(v)\ndata from inspection reports;\n(vi)\ndata on engine power;\n(b)\nthe following data shall also be cross-checked, analysed and verified where applicable:\n(i)\nvessel detection system data;\n(ii)\ndata on sightings;\n(iii)\ndata relating to international fisheries agreements;\n(iv)\ndata on entries into and exits from fishing areas, maritime areas where specific rules on access to waters and resources apply, regulatory areas of regional fisheries management organisations and similar organisations and waters of a third country;\n(v)\nautomatic identification system data.\n3.   The validation system shall allow the immediate identification of inconsistencies, errors and missing information in the data.\n4.   Member States shall ensure that the database clearly displays any data inconsistencies detected by the data validation system. The database shall also flag all data that were corrected and indicate the reason for such a correction.\n5.   If an inconsistency in the data has been identified, the Member State concerned shall undertake the necessary investigations and, if there are reasons to suspect that an infringement has been committed, take the necessary action.\n6.   Member States shall ensure that the dates for data receipt, data entry, data validation and the dates for the follow-up of detected inconsistencies are clearly visible in the database.\n7.   If the data referred to in paragraph 2 are not transmitted by electronic means Member States shall ensure that they are entered manually into the database without delay.\n8.   Member States shall establish a national plan for the implementation of the validation system covering the data listed under points (a) and (b) of paragraph 2 and the follow-up of inconsistencies. The plan shall allow Member States to make priorities for the validation and cross-checks and subsequent follow up on inconsistencies based on risk management. The plan shall be submitted to the Commission for approval by 31 December 2011. The Commission shall approve the plans before 1 July 2012 having allowed for the Member States to make corrections. Amendments to the plan shall be submitted to the Commission on an annual basis for approval.\n9.   If the Commission has identified inconsistencies in the data entered in the database of the Member State as a result of its own investigations, and after having presented documentation and consulted with the Member State, it may require the Member State to investigate the reason for the inconsistency and to correct the data if necessary.\n10.   The databases established and data collected by Member States referred to in this Regulation shall be deemed authentic under the conditions established under national law.\nArticle 110\nAccess to data\n1.   Member States shall ensure the remote access for the Commission or the body designated by it to all data referred to in Article 115 at any time without prior notice. In addition, the Commission shall be given the possibility to download manually and automatically these data for any period or for any number of fishing vessels.\n2.   Member States shall grant access to Commission officials based on electronic certificates generated by the Commission or the body designated by it.\nThe access shall be made available on the Member States’ secure part of their websites referred to in Article 115.\n3.   Without prejudice to paragraphs 1 and 2, Member States may until 30 June 2012 carry out pilot project(s) with the Commission or the body designated by it to provide real-time remote access to Member States data on fishing opportunities recorded and validated according to this Regulation. When both the Commission and the Member State concerned are satisfied with the outcome of the pilot project, and as long as the remote access is functioning as agreed, the Member State concerned shall no longer be obliged to report on fishing opportunities as described in Article 33(2) and (8). The data access format and procedures shall be considered and tested. Member States shall inform the Commission before 1 January 2012 if they plan to carry out pilot project(s). As from 1 January 2013 the Council may decide on a different way and frequency of data transmission by Member States to the Commission.\nArticle 111\nExchange of data\n1.   Each flag Member State shall ensure the direct electronic exchange of relevant information with other Member States, and where appropriate, the Commission or the body designated by it, in particular:\n(a)\nvessel monitoring system data when its vessels are present in another Member State’s waters;\n(b)\nfishing logbook information when its vessels are fishing in another Member State’s waters;\n(c)\nlanding declarations and transhipment declarations when such operations take place in another Member States ports;\n(d)\nprior notification when the intended port is in another Member State.\n2.   Each coastal Member State shall ensure the direct electronic exchange of relevant information with other Member States, and where appropriate, the Commission or the body designated by it, in particular by sending:\n(a)\nsales notes information to the flag Member State when a first sale originates from another Member State’s fishing vessel;\n(b)\ntake-over declaration information when the fish is placed in storage in Member State other than the flag Member State or the Member State of landing;\n(c)\nsales notes and take-over declaration information to the Member State where the landing took place.\n3.   Detailed rules for the application of this Chapter, in particular on checking the quality, compliance with deadlines for submission of data, cross-checks, analysis, verification of the data and on establishing a standardised format for the download and exchange of data, shall be adopted in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 119.\nCHAPTER II\nConfidentiality of data\nArticle 112\nProtection of personal data\n1.   This Regulation leaves intact and in no way affects the level of protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data under the provisions of Community and national law, and in particular does not alter either the obligations of Member States relating to their processing of personal data under Directive 95/46/EC or the obligations of the Community institutions and bodies relating to their processing of personal data under Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 when fulfilling their responsibilities.\n2.   The rights of persons with regard to their registration data processed in national systems shall be exercised in accordance with the law of the Member State which stored their personal data, and in particular the provisions implementing Directive 95/46/EC, and, with regard to their registration data processed in Community systems, shall be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 45/2001.\nArticle 113\nConfidentiality of professional and commercial secrecy\n1.   Member States and the Commission shall take all necessary steps to ensure that the data collected and received within the framework of this Regulation shall be treated in accordance with applicable rules on professional and commercial secrecy of data.\n2.   The data exchanged between Member States and the Commission shall not be transmitted to persons other than those in Member States or Community institutions whose functions require them to have such access unless the Member States transmitting the data give their express consent.\n3.   The data referred to in paragraph 1 shall not be used for any purpose other than that provided for in this Regulation unless the authorities providing the data give their express consent for the use of the data for other purposes and on condition that the provisions in force in the Member State of the authority receiving the data do not prohibit such use.\n4.   Data communicated in the framework of this Regulation to persons working for competent authorities, courts, other public authorities and the Commission or the body designated by it, the disclosure of which would undermine:\n(a)\nthe protection of the privacy and the integrity of the individual, in accordance with Community legislation regarding the protection of personal data;\n(b)\nthe commercial interests of a natural or legal person, including intellectual property;\n(c)\ncourt proceedings and legal advice; or\n(d)\nthe scope of inspections or investigations;\nshall be subject to applicable rules on confidentiality. Information may always be disclosed if this is necessary to bring about the cessation or prohibition of an infringement of the rules of the common fisheries policy.\n5.   The data referred to in paragraph 1 shall benefit from the same protection as is accorded to similar data by the national legislation of Member State receiving them and by the corresponding provisions applicable to Community institutions.\n6.   This Article shall not be construed as an obstacle to the use of the data, obtained pursuant to this Regulation, in the framework of legal actions or proceedings subsequently undertaken for failure to respect the rules of the common fisheries policy. The competent authorities of the Member State transmitting the data shall be informed of all the instances where those data are utilised for these purposes.\n7.   This Article shall not prejudice the obligations pursuant to international conventions concerning mutual assistance in criminal matters.\nCHAPTER III\nOfficial websites\nArticle 114\nOfficial websites\n1.   For the purpose of this Regulation each Member State shall set up before 1 January 2012 at the latest an official website accessible via Internet and containing the information listed in Articles 115 and 116. Member States shall communicate the Internet address of their official website to the Commission.

Benchmarks at sea shall refer to the number of patrol days at sea in the management areas, possibly with a separate benchmark for days patrolling specific areas.\n(d)\nLevel of aerial surveillance\nFlexible benchmark: to be set after a detailed analysis of the fishing activity conducted in each area and taking the available resources at the Member State’s disposal into consideration.\nANNEX II\nCORRELATION TABLE\nRegulation (EEC) No 2847/93\nThis Regulation\nArticle 1(1)\nArticles 1 and 2\nArticle 1(2)\nArticle 5(3)\nArticle 1(3)\nArticle 2\nArticle 2\nArticle

(EC) No 1224/2009 establishing a system for ensuring compliance with the common fisheries policy\nWHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?\n              \nIt establishes a system for the control, inspection and enforcement by national authorities of the rules of the common fisheries policy (CFP).\nKEY POINTS\nThe main objectives of the control system are to: ensure that only the permitted quantities of fish are caught;collect the necessary data for managing fishing opportunities;clarify the roles of EU countries and the European Commission;ensure the rules are applied to all fisheries in the same way and with harmonised sanctions throughout the EU;ensure that fisheries and aquaculture products can be traced back and checked throughout the supply chain, from net to plate.\nIt applies to: all fishing activities in EU waters;the fishing activities of EU vessels and EU citizens in EU and non-EU waters;the processing and marketing of fishery products;recreational fishing for species of fish subject to recovery plans.\nControl and monitoring\nEU countries must carry out inspections throughout the whole production chain, in particular during: fishing;landing;processing;transport;marketing.\nThe monitoring and collection of data is based on different sources and new technologies such as: the satellite-based vessel monitoring system (VMS);electronic logbooks;a systematic catch weighing system;a system to trace fishery products from vessel to retailer.\nInspection powers\nEU countries are responsible for controlling and enforcing the CFP. However, the Commission can carry out its own independent inspections, including taking part in national inspections, to check whether national authorities are implementing the rules correctly, and carrying out audits of the national fisheries control system of EU countries.\nSanctions\nEU countries must take appropriate administrative actions such as sanctions or criminal proceedings in case of infringement of the rules. In case of serious infringements, EU countries must also apply a system of penalty points for the holders of fishing permits and for masters of fishing vessels. The accumulation of points can lead to suspension and ultimately to withdrawal of the permit for several serious offences.\nEU countries can also face sanctions for not enforcing CFP rules correctly including: the withholding of aid from the EU Maritime and Fisheries Fund;the closing of a fishery until the situation is resolved;a reduction in quotas (in the case of overfishing).\nIf an EU country does not take adequate action to resolve the problem, the Commission can take them to the Court of Justice of the European Union.\nData collection\nEU countries are required to have a secure database of all information collected in carrying out their responsibilities under the regulation. The Commission must be able to access the database directly from any location. EU countries must also establish an official website of the data they collect, composed of secure and publicly accessible parts.\nThe regulation also establishes a system of mutual assistance and information exchange between EU countries.\nCoordination\nTo encourage closer collaboration and the exchange of best practice, the European Fisheries Control Agency organises joint control campaigns involving inspectors from different EU countries.\nRules for specific control and inspection programmes for certain fisheries\nIn December 2018, the Commission adopted Implementing Decision (EU) 2018/1986, an implementing act which sets out specific control and inspection programmes (SCIPs) for certain fisheries and repeals Implementing Decisions 2012/807/EU, 2013/328/EU, 2013/305/EU and 2014/156/EU. The implementing decision lays down rules for specific control and inspection programmes for certain fisheries, such as: fisheries exploiting stocks or species covered by multiannual plans (as specified in Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013 on the common fisheries policy);fisheries exploiting species under the landing obligation (Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013) andfisheries exploiting stocks or species subject to conservation and management measures adopted by regional fisheries management organisations, including the General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean (GFCM).\nThe rules cover aspects such as: the scope and objectives of programmes;procedures for risk assessment and relation with joint deployment plans;national and regional risk management strategies;target benchmarks;cooperation with other EU and non-EU countries;joint inspections and surveillance activities;exchange of data; andinformation and evaluation.\nIn September 2020, the Commission adopted Implementing Decision (EU) 2020/1320 amending Implementing Decision (EU) 2018/1986. This amendment was necessary to align the SCIPs with the EU fisheries conservation, management measures, notably Regulation (EU) 2019/1022. This required the SCIP for the Mediterranean Sea and the Black Sea to be extended to certain additional stocks and fisheries. Implementing Decision (EU) 2020/1320 also reflects recently adopted GFCM recommendations: Recommendation GFCM/43/2019/2 on a multiannual management plan for sustainable exploitation blackspot seabream in the Alboran Sea (geographical subareas 1 to 3);Recommendation GFCM/43/2019/5 on a multiannual management plan for sustainable demersal fisheries in the Adriatic Sea (geographical subareas 17 and 18);Recommendation GFCM/43/2019/6 on management measures for sustainable trawl fisheries targeting giant red shrimp and blue and red shrimp in the Strait of Sicily (geographical subareas 12, 13, 14, 15 and 16);Recommendation GFCM/43/2019/4 on a management plan for the sustainable exploitation of red coral in the Mediterranean Sea; andRecommendation GFCM/43/2019/1 on a set of management measures for the use of anchored fish aggregating devices in common dolphinfish fisheries in the Mediterranean Sea.\nFROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?\n              \nThe regulation has applied since 1 January 2010.\nBACKGROUND\n              \nFor further information, see:\nThe EU’s fisheries control system (European Commission).\nMAIN DOCUMENT\n            \nCouncil Regulation (EC) No 1224/2009 of 20 November 2009 establishing a Community control system for ensuring compliance with the rules of the common fisheries policy, amending Regulations (EC) No 847/96, (EC) No 2371/2002, (EC) No 811/2004, (EC) No 768/2005, (EC) No 2115/2005, (EC) No 2166/2005, (EC) No 388/2006, (EC) No 509/2007, (EC) No 676/2007, (EC) No 1098/2007, (EC) No 1300/2008, (EC) No 1342/2008 and repealing Regulations (EEC) No 2847/93, (EC) No 1627/94 and (EC) No 1966/2006 (OJ L 343, 22.12.2009, pp. 1-50)\nSuccessive amendments to Council Regulation (EC) No 1224/2009 have been incorporated into the original document.
