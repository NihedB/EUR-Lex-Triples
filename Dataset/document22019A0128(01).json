Letter from the Union\nMadam,\n1.   \nThe European Union (‘the Union’) and the Kingdom of Norway (‘Norway’), as the Parties to this Agreement, acknowledge that, for the purposes of the Generalised System of Preferences (‘GSP’), both Parties apply similar rules of origin with the following general principles:\n(a)\ndefinition of the concept of ‘originating products’ based on the same criteria;\n(b)\nprovisions for regional cumulation of origin;\n(c)\nprovisions for applying cumulation to materials which originate, within the meaning of their GSP rules of origin, in the Union, Switzerland, Norway or Turkey;\n(d)\nprovisions for a general tolerance for non-originating materials;\n(e)\nprovisions for non-alteration of products from the beneficiary country;\n(f)\nprovisions for issuing or making out replacement proofs of origin;\n(g)\nrequirement for administrative cooperation with the competent authorities in the beneficiary countries on the matter of proofs of origin.\n2.   \nThe Union and Norway shall recognise that materials originating, within the meaning of their respective GSP rules of origin, in the Union, Switzerland, Norway or Turkey, acquire the origin of a beneficiary country of the GSP scheme of either Party if they undergo, in that beneficiary country, a working or processing going beyond the operations considered as insufficient working or processing to confer the status of originating products. This subparagraph shall apply to materials originating in Switzerland and Turkey, subject to the completion of the conditions laid down respectively in paragraphs 15 and 16.\nThe customs authorities of the Member States of the Union and of Norway shall provide each other with appropriate administrative cooperation, in particular for the purpose of subsequent verification of the proofs of origin in respect of the materials referred to in the first subparagraph. The provisions concerning administrative cooperation laid down in Protocol No 3 to the Agreement of 14 May 1973 between the European Economic Community and the Kingdom of Norway are to be applied.\nThis paragraph shall not apply to products of Chapters 1 to 24 of the Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System, adopted by the Organization set-up by the Convention establishing a Customs Co-operation Council, done at Brussels on 15 December 1950.\n3.   \nThe Union and Norway hereby undertake to accept replacement proofs of origin in the form of replacement certificates of origin Form A (‘replacement certificates’) issued by the customs authorities of the other Party and replacement statements on origin made out by reconsignors of the other Party, registered for that purpose.\nEach Party may assess the eligibility for preferential treatment of products covered by replacement proofs of origin in accordance with its own legislation.\n4.   \nEach Party shall provide that the following conditions are respected before issuing or making out a replacement proof of origin:\n(a)\nreplacement proofs of origin may be issued or made out only if the initial proofs of origin were issued or made out in accordance with the legislation applicable in the Union or Norway;\n(b)\nonly where products have not been released for free circulation in a Party, a proof of origin or a replacement proof of origin may be replaced by one or more replacement proofs of origin for the purpose of sending all or some of the products covered by the initial proof of origin from that Party to the other Party;\n(c)\nthe products shall have remained under customs supervision in the reconsigning Party and shall not have been altered, transformed in any way, or subjected to operations other than those necessary to preserve them in their condition (‘principle of non-alteration’);\n(d)\nwhere products have acquired originating status under a derogation from the rules of origin granted by a Party, replacement proofs of origin shall not be issued or made out if the products are reconsigned to the other Party;\n(e)\nreplacement proofs of origin may be issued by the customs authorities or made out by the reconsignors where the products to be reconsigned to the territory of the other Party have acquired originating status through regional cumulation;\n(f)\nreplacement proofs of origin may be issued by the customs authorities or made out by the reconsignors if the products to be reconsigned to the territory of the other Party are not granted preferential treatment by the reconsigning Party.\n5.   \nFor the purpose of point (c) of paragraph 4, the following shall apply:\n(a)\nwhere there appear to be grounds for doubt as regards compliance with the principle of non-alteration, the customs authorities of the Party of final destination may request the declarant to provide evidence of compliance with that principle, which may be given by any means;\n(b)\nupon request by the reconsignor, the customs authorities of the reconsigning Party shall certify that the products have remained under customs supervision during their stay in the territory of that Party and that no authorisation to alter, transform in any way, or subject them to operations other than those necessary to preserve them in their condition was granted by the customs authorities during their storage in the territory of the Party;\n(c)\nwhere the replacement proof is a replacement certificate, the customs authorities of the Party of final destination shall not request a certificate of non-manipulation for the time the products were in the other Party.\n6.   \nEach Party shall ensure that:\n(a)\nwhere the replacement proofs of origin correspond to the initial proofs of origin issued or made out in a beneficiary country of the GSP scheme of the Union and of that of Norway, the customs authorities of the Member States of the Union and of Norway shall provide each other with appropriate administrative cooperation for the purpose of subsequent verification of these replacement proofs of origin. At the request of the Party of final destination, the customs authorities of the reconsigning Party shall launch and follow up the procedure of subsequent verification of the corresponding initial proofs of origin;\n(b)\nwhen the replacement proofs of origin correspond to the initial proofs of origin issued or made out in a country exclusively beneficiary of the GSP scheme of the Party of final destination, that Party shall carry out the procedure of subsequent verification of the initial proofs of origin in cooperation with the beneficiary country. The initial proofs of origin corresponding to the replacement proofs of origin under verification or, where appropriate, copies of the initial proofs of origin corresponding to the replacement proofs of origin under verification shall be provided by the customs authorities of the reconsigning Party to the customs authorities of the Party of final destination in order to allow them to carry out the procedure of subsequent verification.\n7.   \nEach Party shall ensure that:\n(a)\nthe top right-hand box of each replacement certificate shall indicate the name of the intermediary country of reconsignment where it is issued;\n(b)\nbox 4 shall contain the words ‘replacement certificate’ or ‘certificat de remplacement’, as well as the date of issue of the initial certificate of origin Form A and its serial number;\n(c)\nthe name of the reconsignor shall be given in box 1;\n(d)\nthe name of the final consignee may be given in box 2;\n(e)\nall particulars of the reconsigned products appearing on the initial certificate shall be transferred to boxes 3 to 9;\n(f)\nreferences to the reconsignor's invoice may be given in box 10;\n(g)\nthe customs authority which issued the replacement certificate shall endorse box 11.

The reconsignor shall sign the certificate of origin in box 12. A reconsignor who signs box 12 in good faith shall not be held responsible for the accuracy of the particulars entered on the initial certificate of origin Form A;\n(h)\nthe customs authority which is requested to issue the replacement certificate shall note on the initial certificate of origin Form A the weights, numbers and nature of the products forwarded and shall indicate thereon the serial numbers of each corresponding replacement certificate. It shall keep the request for the replacement certificate as well as the initial certificate of origin Form A for at least three years.\n(i)\nreplacement certificates of origin shall be drawn up in English or French.\n8.   \nEach Party shall provide that:\n(a)\nthe reconsignor shall indicate the following on each replacement statement on origin:\n(1)\nall particulars of the reconsigned products taken from the initial proof of origin;\n(2)\nthe date on which the initial proof of origin was made out;\n(3)\nthe particulars of the initial proof of origin, including, where appropriate, information about cumulation applied to the goods covered by the statement on origin;\n(4)\nthe name, address and registered exporter number of the reconsignor;\n(5)\nthe name and address of the consignee in the Union or in Norway;\n(6)\nthe date and place of making out the statement on origin or issuing the certificate of origin;\n(b)\neach replacement statement on origin shall be marked ‘Replacement statement’, or ‘Attestation de remplacement’;\n(c)\nreplacement statements on origin shall be made out by reconsignors registered in the electronic system of self-certification of origin by exporters, namely the Registered Exporter (REX) system, irrespective of the value of the originating products contained in the initial consignment;\n(d)\nwhere a proof of origin is replaced, the reconsignor shall indicate the following on the initial proof of origin:\n(1)\nthe date of making out the replacement statement(s) on origin and the quantities of goods covered by the replacement statement(s) on origin;\n(2)\nthe name and address of the reconsignor;\n(3)\nthe name and address of the consignee or consignees in the Union or in Norway;\n(e)\nthe initial statement on origin shall be marked with the word ‘Replaced’ or ‘Remplacé’;\n(f)\na replacement statement on origin shall be valid for twelve months from the date of its making out;\n(g)\nreplacement statements on origin shall be drawn up in English or French.\n9.\nThe initial proofs of origin and copies of the replacement proofs of origin shall be kept by the reconsignor for at least three years from the end of the calendar year in which the replacement proofs of origin were issued or made out.\n10.\nThe Parties agree to share the costs of the REX system in accordance with the modalities of cooperation to be laid down between the competent authorities of the Parties.\n11.\nAny differences between the Parties arising from the interpretation or application of this Agreement shall be settled solely by bilateral negotiation between the Parties. If the differences could affect the interests of Switzerland and/or Turkey, they shall be consulted.\n12.\nThe Parties may amend this Agreement by mutual agreement in written form at any time. Both Parties shall enter into consultation with respect to possible amendments to this Agreement at the request of one of the Parties. If the amendments could affect the interests of Switzerland and/or Turkey, they shall be consulted. Such amendments shall enter into force on a mutually agreed date, once both Parties have notified each other of the completion of their respective internal requirements.\n13.\nIn the event of serious misgivings as to the proper functioning of this Agreement, either Party may suspend its application provided that the other Party has been notified in writing three months in advance.\n14.\nThis Agreement may be terminated by either Party provided that the other Party has been notified in writing three months in advance.\n15.\nThe first subparagraph of paragraph 2 shall apply to materials originating in Switzerland only if the Parties have concluded a similar agreement with Switzerland and have notified each other of the fulfilment of this condition.\n16.\nThe first subparagraph of paragraph 2 shall apply to materials originating in Turkey (1) only if the Parties have concluded a similar agreement with Turkey and have notified each other of the fulfilment of this condition.\n17.\nAs from the entry into force of an agreement between Norway and Turkey in accordance with the first subparagraph of paragraph 2 of this Agreement, and subject to reciprocity by Turkey, each party may provide that replacement proofs of origin for products incorporating materials originating in Turkey which have been processed under bilateral cumulation in GSP beneficiary countries may be issued or made out in the Parties.\n18.\nThis Agreement shall enter into force on a mutually agreed date, once the Union and Norway have notified each other of the completion of the internal adoption procedures required. From that date, it shall replace the Agreement in the form of an Exchange of Letters between the Community and each of the EFTA countries that grants tariff preferences under the GSP (Norway and Switzerland), providing that goods originating in Norway or Switzerland shall be treated on their arrival on the customs territory of the Community as goods with content of Community origin, signed on 29 January 2001 (2).\nI should be obliged if you would confirm that your Government is in agreement with the above.\nI have the honour to propose that, if the above is acceptable to your Government, this letter and your confirmation shall together constitute an Agreement between the European Union and the Kingdom of Norway.\nPlease accept, Madam, the assurance of my highest consideration.\nСъставено в Брюксел на\nHecho en Bruselas, el\nV Bruselu dne\nUdfærdiget i Bruxelles, den\nGeschehen zu Brüssel am\nBrüssel,\nΈγινε στις Βρυξέλλες, στις\nDone at Brussels,\nFait à Bruxelles, le\nSastavljeno u Bruxellesu\nFatto a Bruxelles, addì\nBriselē,\nPriimta Briuselyje,\nKelt Brüsszelben,\nMagħmul fi Brussell,\nGedaan te Brussel,\nSporządzono w Brukseli, dnia\nFeito em Bruxelas,\nÎntocmit la Bruxelles,\nV Bruseli\nV Bruslju,\nTehty Brysselissä\nUtfärdat i Bryssel den\nUtferdiget i Brussel,\nЗа Европейския съюз\nРог la Unión Europea\nZa Evropskou unii\nFor Den Europæiske Union\nFür die Europäische Union\nEuroopa Liidu nimel\nΓια την Ευρωπαϊκή Ένωση\nFor the European Union\nPour l'Union européenne\nZa Europsku uniju\nPer l'Unione europea\nEiropas Savienības vārdā –\nEuropos Sąjungos vardu\nAz Európai Unió részéről\nGħall-Unjoni Ewropea\nVoor de Europese Unie\nW imieniu Unii Europejskiej\nPela União Europeia\nPentru Uniunea Europeană\nZa Európsku úniu\nZa Evropsko unijo\nEuroopan unionin puolesta\nFör Europeiska unionen\nFor Den europeiske union\nB.

For the least developed countries, duty is removed for virtually all their exports.\nThe EU and Norway (along with Switzerland and Turkey) have very similar GSP systems and thus can be linked.\nRules of origin\nTo benefit from tariff preferences, products must be shown to originate from a beneficiary country.\nOrigin refers to where a product is produced or manufactured, not where it is shipped from.\nCumulation\n‘Cumulation’ describes the system that allows products originating in country A to be further processed or added to products originating in country B, as if they had originated in country B. The resulting product would have the origin of country B. It can only be applied between countries operating with identical origin rules.\nAgreement between EU and Norway\nUnder the EU GSP’s ‘extended cumulation’, materials originating in Norway, Switzerland or Turkey that undergo more than a minimal operation in a beneficiary country are considered to originate in that beneficiary country, and may benefit from preferences when imported to the EU, Norway, Switzerland or Turkey.\nThis agreement requires the EU and Norway to have similar rules of origin covering the following principles: a definition of ‘originating products’ based on the same criteria;rules for regional cumulation* of origin;rules for applying cumulation to materials that originate, within the meaning of their GSP rules of origin, in the EU, Switzerland, Norway or Turkey;rules for a general tolerance of non-originating materials;rules for non-alteration of products from the beneficiary country;rules for issuing or making out replacement proofs of origin;requirement for administrative cooperation with the authorities in the beneficiary countries on the matter of proofs of origin.\nThis agreement replaces a similar reciprocal agreement between the European Community and each of the European Free Trade Association countries that granted tariff preferences under the GSP, for goods originating in Norway or Switzerland.\nDATE OF ENTRY INTO FORCE\n              \nIt entered into force on 1 February 2019.\nBACKGROUND\n              \nFor further information, see:\nGeneralised system of preferences (European Commission).\nKEY TERMS\n              \nRegional cumulation. Operation between the countries of one of the regional groups of beneficiary countries recognised by the EU’s GSP where materials originating in one country of the group that are further worked or processed in another beneficiary country of the same group are considered to originate in the latter country. Cumulation is also possible between individual countries of cumulation groups I III, upon request and under certain conditions.\nMAIN DOCUMENT\n            \nAgreement in the form of an Exchange of Letters between the European Union and the Kingdom of Norway on the cumulation of origin between the European Union, the Swiss Confederation, the Kingdom of Norway and the Republic of Turkey in the framework of the Generalised System of Preferences (OJ L 24, 28.1.2019, pp. 3–11).\nRELATED DOCUMENT\n            \nNotice concerning the entry into force of the Agreement in the form of an Exchange of Letters between the European Union and the Kingdom of Norway on the cumulation of origin between the European Union, the Swiss Confederation, the Kingdom of Norway and the Republic of Turkey in the framework of the Generalised System of Preferences (OJ L 27, 31.1.2019, p. 1).\nlast update 09.11.2021", "tags": ["agreement (EU)", "Norway", "generalised preferences", "originating product", "Switzerland", "tariff preference", "Türkiye", "tariff agreement"], "subjects": ["Preferential systems", "European Free Trade Association (EFTA)", "External relations"], "split": "train", "reference_annotations": {}, "summary_annotations": {}}
