The Contracting Parties recognise that public subsidies to air carriers distort or threaten to distort competition by favouring certain undertakings in the provision of air transport services, that they jeopardise the basic objectives of the Agreement and that they are incompatible with the principle of an open aviation area.2. When a Contracting Party deems it essential to grant public subsidies to an air carrier operating under this Agreement in order to achieve a legitimate objective, it shall see to it that such subsidies are proportionate to the objective, transparent and designed to minimise, to the extent feasible, their adverse impact on the air carriers of the other Contracting Party. The Contracting Party intending to grant any such subsidy shall inform the other Contracting Party of its intention and shall make sure that such subsidy is consistent with the criteria laid down in this Agreement.3. If one Contracting Party believes that a subsidy provided by the other Contracting Party, or, as the case may be, by a public or governmental body of a country other than the Contracting Parties, is inconsistent with the criteria laid down in paragraph 2, it may request a meeting of the Joint Committee, as provided in Article 22 to consider the issue and develop appropriate responses to concerns found to be legitimate.4. When a dispute can not be settled by the Joint Committee, the Contracting Parties retain the possibility of applying their respective anti-subsidy measures.5. The provisions of this Article shall apply without prejudice to the Contracting Parties' laws and regulations regarding essential air services and public service obligations in the territories of the Contracting Parties.Article 9Commercial opportunities1. The air carriers of each Contracting Party shall have the right to establish offices in the territory of the other Contracting Party for the promotion and sale of air transport and related activities.2. The air carriers of each Contracting Party shall be entitled, in accordance with the laws and regulations of the other Contracting Party relating to entry, residence, and employment, to bring in and maintain in the territory of the other Contracting Party managerial, sales, technical, operational, and other specialist staff who are required to support the provision of air transport.3. (a) Without prejudice to point (b) below, each air carrier shall have in relation to groundhandling in the territory of the other Contracting Party:(i) the right to perform its own groundhandling (\"self-handling\") or, at its option(ii) the right to select among competing suppliers that provide groundhandling services in whole or in part where such suppliers are allowed market access on the basis of the laws and regulations of each Contracting Party, and where such suppliers are present in the market.(b) For the following categories of groundhandling services i.e. baggage handling, ramp handling, fuel and oil handling, freight and mail handling as regards the physical handling of freight and mail between the air terminal and the aircraft, the rights under point (a)(i) and (ii) shall be subject only to specific constraints according to the laws and regulations applicable in the territory of the other Party. Where such constraints preclude self-handling and where there is no effective competition between suppliers that provide groundhandling services, all such services shall be available on both an equal and an adequate basis to all air carriers; prices of such services shall not exceed their full cost including a reasonable return on assets, after depreciation.4. Any air carrier of each Contracting Party may engage in the sale of air transport in the territory of the other Contracting Party directly and/or, at the air carrier's discretion, through its sales agents or other intermediaries appointed by the air carrier.

At their discretion, the air carriers of each Party may pay for such expenses in the territory of the other Party in freely convertible currencies according to local currency regulation.7. In operating or holding out services under the Agreement, any air carrier of a Contracting Party may enter into cooperative marketing arrangements, such as blocked-space agreements or code-sharing arrangements, with:(a) any air carrier or carriers of the Contracting Parties;and(b) any air carrier or carriers of a third country;and(c) any surface, land or maritime carriers;provided that (i) all participants in such arrangements hold the appropriate authority and (ii) the arrangements meet the requirements relating to safety and competition normally applied to such arrangements. In respect of passenger transport sold involving code-shares, the purchaser shall be informed at the point of sale, or in any case before boarding, which transportation providers will operate each sector of the service.8. (a) In relation to the transport of passengers, surface transportation providers shall not be subject to laws and regulations governing air transport on the sole basis that such surface transportation is held out by an air carrier under its own name. Surface transportation providers have the discretion to decide whether to enter into cooperative arrangements. In deciding on any particular arrangement, surface transportation providers may consider, among other things, consumer interests and technical, economic, space, and capacity constraints.(b) Moreover, and notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, air carriers and indirect providers of cargo transportation of the Contracting Parties shall be permitted, without restriction, to employ in connection with international air transport any surface transportation for cargo to or from any points in the territories of Morocco and the European Community, or in third countries, including transport to and from all airports with customs facilities, and including, where applicable, the right[s] to transport cargo in bond under applicable laws and regulations. Such cargo, whether moving by surface or by air, shall have access to airport customs processing and facilities. Air carriers may elect to perform their own surface transportation or to provide it through arrangements with other surface carriers, including surface transportation operated by other air carriers and indirect providers of cargo air transport. Such intermodal cargo services may be offered at a single, through price for the air and surface transportation combined, provided that shippers are not misled as to the facts concerning such transportation.Article 10Customs duties and charges1.

Equipment and supplies referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Article may be required to be kept under the supervision or control of the appropriate authorities.5. The exemptions provided by this Article shall also be available where the air carriers of one Contracting Party have contracted with another air carrier, which similarly enjoys such exemptions from the other Contracting Party, for the loan or transfer in the territory of the other Party of the items specified in paragraphs 1 and 2.6. Nothing in this Agreement shall prevent either Contracting Party from imposing taxes, levies, duties, fees or charges on goods sold other than for consumption on board to passengers during a sector of an air service between two points within its territory at which embarkation or disembarkation is permitted.Article 11User Charges1. Each Contracting Party shall undertake not to impose on the air carriers of the other Contracting Party user charges higher than those imposed on its own air carriers operating similar international air services.2. Increased or new charges should only follow adequate consultation between the competent charging authorities and the air carriers of each Contracting Party. Reasonable notice of any proposals for changes in user charges should be given to users to enable them to express their views before changes are made. The Contracting Parties shall also encourage the exchange of such information as may be necessary to permit an accurate assessment of the reasonableness of, justification for and apportionment of the charges in accordance with the principles set out above.Article 12PricingPrices for air transport services operated pursuant to this Agreement shall be established freely and shall not be subject to approval, but they may be required to be filed for information purposes only. Prices to be charged for carriage wholly within the European Community shall be subject to European Community law.Article 13StatisticsThe competent authorities of either Contracting Party shall supply the competent authorities of the other Contracting Party, at their request, with the information and statistics related to the traffic carried by the air carriers authorised by one Contracting Party on the agreed services to or from the territory of the other Contracting Party in the same form as they have been prepared and submitted by the authorised air carriers to their national competent authorities.

Either Contracting Party may request consultations at any time concerning the safety standards maintained by the other Contracting Party.4. Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to limit the authority of the competent authorities of a Contracting Party to take all appropriate and immediate measures whenever they ascertain that an aircraft, a product or an operation may:(a) fail to satisfy the minimum standards established pursuant to the Convention or the legislation specified in Part A of Annex VI, whichever is applicable,(b) give rise to serious concerns – established through an inspection referred to in paragraph 2 –that an aircraft or the operation of an aircraft does not comply with the minimum standards established pursuant to the Convention or the legislation specified in Part A of Annex VI, whichever is applicable,or(c) give rise to serious concerns that there is a lack of effective maintenance and administration of minimum standards established pursuant to the Convention or the legislation specified in Part A of Annex VI, whichever is applicable.5. Where the competent authorities of one Contracting Party take action under paragraph 4, they shall promptly inform the competent authorities of the other Contracting Party of taking such action, providing reasons for its action.6. Where measures taken in application of paragraph 4 are not discontinued even though the basis for taking them has ceased to exist, either Contracting Party may refer the matter to the Joint Committee.Article 15Aviation Security1. The assurance of safety for civil aircraft, their passengers and crew being a fundamental pre-condition for the operation of international air services, the Contracting Parties reaffirm their obligations to each other to provide for the security of civil aviation against acts of unlawful interference, and in particular their obligations under the Chicago Convention, the Convention on Offences and Certain Other Acts Committed on Board Aircraft, signed at Tokyo on 14 September 1963, the Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Seizure of Aircraft, signed at The Hague on 16 December 1970, the Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts against the Safety of Civil Aviation, signed at Montreal on 23 September 1971, the Protocol for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts of Violence at Airports Serving International Civil Aviation, signed at Montreal on 24 February 1988 and the Convention on the marking of plastic explosives for purpose of detection signed at Montreal on 1 March 1991, insofar as both Contracting Parties are parties to these conventions, as well as all other conventions and protocols relating to civil aviation safety of which both Parties are parties.2. The Contracting Parties shall provide upon request all necessary assistance to each other to prevent acts of unlawful seizure of civil aircraft and other unlawful acts against the safety of such aircraft, their passengers and crew, airports and air navigation facilities, and any other threat to the security of civil aviation.3. The Contracting Parties shall, in their mutual relations, act in conformity with the aviation security Standards and, so far as they are applied by them, the Recommended Practices established by the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) and designated as Annexes to the Chicago Convention, to the extent that such security provisions are applicable to the Contracting Parties. Both Contracting Parties shall require that operators of aircraft of their registry, operators who have their principal place of business or permanent residence in their territory, and the operators of airports in their territory, act in conformity with such aviation security provisions.4. Each Contracting Party shall ensure that effective measures are taken within its territory to protect aircraft, to screen passengers and their carry-on items, and to carry out appropriate checks on crew, cargo (including hold baggage) and aircraft stores prior to and during boarding or loading and that those measures are adjusted to meet increases in the threat. Each Contracting Party agrees that their air carriers may be required to observe the aviation security provisions referred to in paragraph 3 required by the other Contracting Party, for entrance into, departure from, or while within, the territory of that other Contracting Party. Each Contracting Party shall also act favourably upon any request from the other Contracting Party for reasonable special security measures to meet a particular threat5. When an incident or threat of an incident of unlawful seizure of civil aircraft or other unlawful acts against the safety of such aircraft, their passengers and crew, airports or air navigation facilities occurs, the Contracting Parties shall assist each other by facilitating communications and other appropriate measures intended to terminate rapidly and safely such incident or threat thereof.6. When a Contracting Party has reasonable grounds to believe that the other Contracting Party has departed from the aviation security provisions of this Article, that Contracting Party may request immediate consultations with the other Contracting Party.7. Without prejudice to Article 4 (Revocation of Authorisations) of this Agreement, failure to reach a satisfactory agreement within fifteen (15) days from the date of such request shall constitute grounds to withhold, revoke, limit or impose conditions on the operating authorisation of one or more air carriers of such other Contracting Party.8. When required by an immediate and extraordinary threat, a Contracting Party may take interim action prior to the expiry of fifteen (15) days.9. Any action taken in accordance with the paragraph 7 shall be discontinued upon compliance by the other Contracting Party with the provisions of this Article.Article 16Air traffic management1.
