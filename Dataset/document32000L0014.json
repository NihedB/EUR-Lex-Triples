Reducing permissible noise levels for such equipment will protect the health and well-being of citizens as well as protect the environment. The public should also be provided with information on the noise emitted by such equipment.(2) Community legislation concerning noise emission by equipment for use outdoors has consisted to date of the following nine directives covering some types of construction machinery and lawnmowers: Council Directive 79/113/EEC of 19 December 1978 on the approximation of the laws of the Members States relating to the determination of the noise emission of construction plant and equipment(4), Council Directive 84/532/EEC of 17 September 1984 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to common provisions for construction plant and equipment(5), Council Directive 84/533/EEC of 17 September 1984 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the permissible sound power lever of compressors(6), Council Directive 84/534/EEC of 17 September 1984 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the permissible sound power level of tower cranes(7), Council Directive 84/535/EEC of 17 September 1984 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the permissible sound power level of welding generators(8), Council Directive 84/536/EEC of 17 September 1984 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the permissible sound power level of power generators(9), Council Directive 84/537/EEC of 17 September 1984 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the permissible sound power level of powered hand-held concrete-breakers and picks(10), Council Directive 84/538/EEC of 17 September 1984 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the permissible sound power level of lawnmowers(11) and Council Directive 86/662/EEC of 22 December 1986 on the limitation of noise emitted by hydraulic excavators, rope-operated excavators, dozers, loaders and excavator-loaders(12), hereinafter referred to as \"existing Directives\"; these Directives lay down the requirements with regard to permissible noise levels, noise test codes, marking and conformity assessment procedures for each type of equipment separately. A simplification of this legislation and the creation of a framework for the reduction of noise emission by equipment for use outdoors is appropriate.(3) This Directive is based on the principles and concepts set out in the Council Resolution of 7 May 1985 on a new approach to technical harmonisation and standards(13). The aforementioned principles have been further developed in the Council Decision 93/465/EEC of 22 July 1993 concerning the modules for the various phases of the conformity assessment procedure and the rules for the affixing and use of the CE conformity marking, which are intended to be used in the technical harmonisation directives(14).(4) The Fifth Environmental Action Programme attached to the resolution of 1 February 1993(15) identifies noise as one of the most pressing environmental problems in urban areas and the need to take action with regard to various noise sources.(5) In its Green Paper \"Future Noise Policy\", the Commission addressed noise in the environment as one of the main local environmental problems in Europe, and announced its intention to propose a framework directive to control noise emission by equipment for use outdoors.(6) Member States should ensure that equipment covered by this Directive complies with the requirements thereof when placed on the market or put into service in the Member States. Requirements protecting workers by regulating the use of outdoor equipment are not affected by this Directive.(7) Member States should not prohibit, restrict or impede the placing on the market or putting into service in their territory of equipment which complies with the requirements of this Directive, bears the CE marking and the indication of the guaranteed sound power level and is accompanied by an EC declaration of conformity.(8) The manufacturer or his authorised representative established in the Community should be responsible for ensuring that the equipment is in conformity with the provisions of this Directive and of any other directives that apply to it. The manufacturer or his authorised representative established in the Community should affix the CE marking and the indication of the guaranteed sound power level to the equipment and ensure that the equipment is accompanied by an EC declaration of conformity in order to certify thereby that the equipment is in conformity with the provisions of this Directive and any other pertinent directives.(9) Member States, if necessary in cooperation with other Member States, should take all appropriate measures to ensure that non-complying equipment will comply in future or is withdrawn from the market. A sound implementation and application of this Directive is indispensable to meet the objectives of this Directive. A closer cooperation in the market surveillance by means of a continuous exchange of information is necessary. Therefore a Committee should be established.(10) Marking of equipment for use outdoors with its guaranteed sound power level is essential in order to enable consumers and users to make an informed choice of equipment and as a basis for regulation on use or economic instruments to be adopted at the local or national level. This marking must be clear and unambiguous. The indicated values should be guaranteed by the manufacturer. It is appropriate that the indication of the noise emission in the form of the guaranteed sound power level should accompany the CE marking. A unified, fixed procedure to assess noise emission values is an indispensable condition for reliable marking.(11) Existing directives concerning compressors, tower cranes, welding and power generators, and concrete-breakers and picks require the Commission to submit proposals to reduce the permissible noise levels. Noise reduction technology for some other equipment for use outdoors (e.g. graders, loader-type landfill compactors, dumpers, combustion-engine driven counterbalanced lift trucks, mobile cranes, builders' hoists, construction winches, compaction machines, paver-finishers and hydraulic power packs) is available but not generally used. Surveys show that the noise emission values of equipment for use outdoors of the same power currently on the market can differ by more than 10 dB. It is appropriate to reduce noise emissions by equipment subject to noise limits down to the level of the better performers on the market today in two stages, in order to allow manufacturers who do not already comply with the requirements sufficient time to adapt their equipment to the more demanding limit values.(12) Different conformity assessment procedures may be considered appropriate for different categories of equipment. Decision 93/465/EEC offers different modules for use in conformity assessment procedures. For equipment subject to permissible sound power levels, a procedure consisting of an involvement of a notified body for checking the conformity with the provisions of this Directive in the design and the production phase is considered to be appropriate. Self certification is considered appropriate for equipment subject to noise marking only. Monitoring is indispensable.(13) The technical and administrative standards of notified bodies throughout the Community should be the same. This can only be achieved by setting minimum criteria they have to meet.(14) The collection of noise data is considered to be indispensable as a basis for informed consumer choice and for the Member States' and the Commission's further assessment of new technological development and the need for further legislative action. These noise data can be collected by simply sending a copy of the EC declaration of conformity to the Member State and the Commission.(15) In order to protect citizens against unreasonably high noise exposure, Member States should be able to restrict, in accordance with the provisions of the Treaty, the use of equipment in the environment.(16) The technical provisions concerning the measurement methods must be supplemented and adapted as necessary to technical progress and the progress in European standardisation. The measures necessary for the implementation of this Directive should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission(16).(17) It is important to have lower noise emission limits for lawnmowers and lawn trimmers/lawn edge trimmers which have remained unchanged since the adoption of Directive 84/538/EEC. To give guidance to industry, indicative figures for lower limits should be introduced for stage II. The Commission should submit a report to the European Parliament and the Council on whether and to what extent technical progress allows a reduction of limit values for lawnmowers and lawn trimmers/lawn edge trimmers, and, if appropriate, submit a proposal to amend this Directive.(18) This Directive replaces the existing directives; the existing directives must be repealed when the requirements of this Directive come into force. Transitional periods are necessary to allow a smooth transition from the existing directives to this Directive,HAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:Article 1ObjectivesThe aim of this Directive is to harmonise the laws of the Member States relating to noise emission standards, conformity assessment procedures, marking, technical documentation and collection of data concerning the noise emission in the environment of equipment for use outdoors. It will contribute to the smooth functioning of the internal market, while protecting human health and well-being.Article 2Scope1. This Directive applies to equipment for use outdoors listed in Articles 12 and 13 and defined in Annex I. This Directive only covers equipment that is placed on the market or put into service as an entire unit suitable for the intended use.

The manufacturer must allow the notified body entrance for inspection purposes to the locations of design, manufacture, inspection and testing, and storage and must provide it with all necessary information, in particular:- the quality assurance system documentation- the quality records as foreseen by the design part of the quality assurance system, such as results of analyses, calculations, tests, etc.- the quality records as foreseen by the manufacturing part of the quality assurance system, such as inspection reports and test data, calibration data, qualification reports of the personnel concerned, etc.4.3. The notified body shall periodically carry out audits to make sure that the manufacturer maintains and applies the quality assurance system and must provide an audit report to the manufacturer.4.4. Additionally the notified body may pay unexpected visits to the manufacturer. During such visits the notified body may carry out, or cause to be carried out, tests to verify that the quality assurance system is functioning correctly, if necessary. The notified body must provide the manufacturer with a visit report and, if a test has taken place, with a test report.5. The manufacturer must, for a period ending at least 10 years after the last equipment has been manufactured, keep at the disposal of the national authorities:- the documentation referred to in the second indent of point 3.1 of this Annex- the updating referred to in the second paragraph of point 3.4- the decisions and reports from the notified body which are referred to in the final paragraph of point 3.4, points 4.3 and 4.4.6. Each notified body must give the other notified bodies the relevant information concerning the quality assurance system approvals issued and withdrawn.ANNEX IXMINIMUM CRITERIA TO BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT BY MEMBER STATES FOR THE NOTIFICATION OF BODIES1. The body, its director and its staff responsible for carrying out verification operations may be neither the designer, builder, supplier or installer of the equipment nor the authorised representative of any of those parties. They may become involved neither directly nor as authorised representatives in the design, construction, marketing or maintenance of such equipment nor represent the parties engaged in these activities. This does not preclude the possibility of exchange of technical information between the manufacturer and the body.2. The body and its staff must carry out the assessments and verifications with the highest degree of professional integrity and technical competence and must be free from all pressures and inducements, particularly financial, which might influence their judgement or the results of their work, especially from persons or groups of persons with an interest in the results of verification.3. The body must have at its disposal the necessary staff and possess the necessary facilities to enable it to perform properly the technical and administrative tasks connected with inspection and surveillance operations; it must also have access to the equipment required for any special verification.4. The staff responsible for inspection must have;- sound technical and professional training- satisfactory knowledge of the requirements for the assessment of technical documentation- satisfactory knowledge of the requirements for the tests they carry out and adequate practical experience of such tests- the ability to draw up the certificates, records and reports required to authenticate the performance of the tests.5. The impartiality of inspection staff must be guaranteed. Their remuneration must not depend on the number of tests carried out or the results of such tests.6. The body must take out liability insurance unless its liability is assumed by the State in accordance with national law, or the Member State itself is directly responsible for the tests.7. The staff of the body must observe professional secrecy with regard to all information gained in carrying out its tests (except vis-à-vis the competent administrative authorities of the State in which its activities are carried out) under this Directive or any provisions of national law giving effect to it.ANNEX XUNIT VERIFICATIONMODEL OF CONFORMITY CERTIFICATE>PIC FILE= \"L_2000162EN.007802.EPS\">", "summary": "Noise emission by equipment used outdoors\nNoise emission by equipment used outdoors\nSUMMARY OF:\nDirective 2000/14/EC on noise emission in the environment by equipment for use outdoors\nWHAT IS THE AIM OF THE DIRECTIVE?\n              \nIt aims to:\nimprove the control of noise emissions by 57 types of equipment used outdoors (Articles 12 and 13, Annex I), such as: compressors,excavator-loaders,different types of saws,mixers, etc.;\npromote the smooth functioning of the EU single market;\nimprove the health and well-being of citizens by reducing the noise emitted by equipment used outdoors.\nIt repeals and replaces 9 legal instruments on noise emissions for each type of construction plant and equipment, as well as Directive 84/538/EEC on lawnmowers.\nKEY POINTS\n              \nThe directive’s purpose is four-fold:\nto harmonise noise emission standards;\nto harmonise conformity assessment* procedures;\nto harmonise noise level marking;\nto gather data on noise emissions.\nThe following types of equipment are excluded:\nnon-powered attachments (to tools) that are separately placed on the market or put into service* (except for hand-held concrete-breakers and picks);\nall equipment intended for the transport of goods or persons by public road or rail or by air or on waterways;\nequipment designed and constructed for use by the police or the military.\nEU countries are responsible for verifying that the rules laid down by the directive are being applied. Annexes V to VIII contains the various conformity assessment procedures to be used.\nThe manufacturer or the person placing the equipment on the market or putting it into service must ensure (Articles 4 and 8) that:\nthey have drawn up an ‘EC declaration of conformity’ certifying that each of item of equipment bearing the CE marking conforms with the directive;\nthey have affixed an indelible legible marking to each item of equipment indicating the guaranteed sound power level.\nWhere an EU country ascertains that equipment does not comply with these conditions, it must withdraw it from the market or prohibit its use.\nLabelling is compulsory for all items of equipment covered by the directive and must include:\nthe CE marking visibly, legibly and indelibly affixed to each item of equipment;\ndetails of the sound power level LWA* in dB(A)* in relation to 1 pW*.\nThe noise emission limits laid down for certain types of equipment involved 2 stages, so as to enable businesses to adapt to the new regulations. The emission limits for stage 1 took effect 2 years after the directive’s entry into force and more stringent limits entered into force in 2006.\nEU countries may set up notified bodies which are responsible for monitoring the noise emission limits applicable to the equipment. These monitoring controls apply both to the equipment design phase and the equipment production phase. It should be noted, however, that it is not necessary to monitor the design of equipment that is subject only to compulsory marking.\nWith a view to assessing the impact of the directive, a procedure for the collection of noise emission data was established. This information serves as the basis for customers to choose less noisy equipment and for devising economic incentives and awards. Manufacturers or their authorised representatives are required to send to the relevant authorities in EU countries, as well as to the European Commission, a copy of the EC declaration of conformity for equipment placed on the market.\nThe directive has 24 articles and 10 annexes covering:\ndefinitions of equipment;\nEC declaration of conformity;\nmethod of measurement of airborne noise emitted by equipment for use outdoors;\nmodels of the CE marking of conformity and of the indication of the guaranteed sound power level;\ninternal control of production;\ninternal control of production with assessment of technical documentation and periodical checking;\nunit verification;\nfull quality assurance;\nminimum criteria to be taken into account by EU countries for the notification of bodies (the notified bodies mentioned above);\nunit verification — model of conformity certificate.\nPossible revisions to the legislation\nAn evaluation and impact assessment study of Directive 2000/14/EC has been ongoing since May 2017. Its results, as well as previously completed studies, will be used by the Commission as the basis for the upcoming revision process of EU legislation in this field. A public consultation was launched in January 2018 and ran until April 2018.\nFROM WHEN DOES THE DIRECTIVE APPLY?\n              \nIt has applied since 3 January 2002 and had to become law in the EU countries by 3 July 2001.\nBACKGROUND\n              \nFor more information, see:\nNoise emission by outdoor equipment (European Commission).\nKEY TERMS\n              \nConformity assessment: the process confirming that a product satisfies the necessary process, service, system, person or body requirements.\nPutting into service: the moment of first use by the end-user for purposes for which the good was intended.\nLWA: measure of the acoustic energy emitted by a machine, i.e. the sound power.\ndB(A): average sound level in decibels as perceived by the human ear.\n1pW: 1 picowatt — the international standard reference value of sound power when this quantity is expressed as a level in decibels.\nMAIN DOCUMENT\n            \nDirective 2000/14/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 8 May 2000 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the noise emission in the environment by equipment for use outdoors (OJ L 162, 3.7.2000, pp. 1-78)\nSuccessive amendments to Directive 2000/14/EC have been incorporated in the original text.
