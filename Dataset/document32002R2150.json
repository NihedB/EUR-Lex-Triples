This creates the basis for monitoring compliance with the principles of maximisation of recovery and safe disposal. Statistical instruments are still required, however, for assessing compliance with the principle of waste prevention and to establish a link between waste generation data and global, national and regional inventories of resource use.(2) The terms for the description of waste and waste management need to be defined in order to ensure the comparability of results in waste statistics.(3) Community waste policy has led to the establishment of a set of principles to be followed by waste-producing units and waste management. This requires the monitoring of waste at different points of the waste-stream generation, collection, recovery and disposal.(4) Council Regulation (EC) No 322/97 of 17 February 1997 on Community statistics(4).(5) To guarantee comparable results, waste statistics should be produced in accordance with the specified breakdown, in an appropriate form and within a fixed period of time from the end of the reference year.(6) Since the objective of the proposed measure, namely to establish a framework for the production of Community statistics on the generation, recovery and disposal of waste, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States, by reason of the need to define terms of description of waste and waste management so as to ensure the comparability of the statistics supplied by the Member States, and can therefore be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve the objective of the proposed measure.(7) Member States may need a transitional period for the establishment of their statistics on waste for all or some of the economic activities A, B and G to Q of NACE REV 1 as established by Council Regulation (EEC) No 3037/90 of 9 October 1990 on the statistical classification of economic activities in the European Community(5) for which their national statistical system requires major adaptations.(8) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Regulation should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission(6).(9) The Statistical Programme Committee has been consulted by the Commission,HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:Article 1Objective1. The objective of this Regulation is to establish a framework for the production of Community statistics on the generation, recovery and disposal of waste.2.

(EC) No 2150/2002 on EU waste statistics\nWHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?\nThis European Union (EU) law permits the gathering of regular and comparable data on waste in EU countries and their transmission to Eurostat, the EU’s statistics office.\nThe statistics collected allow EU waste policy implementation to be monitored and evaluated.\nKEY POINTS\nScope\nThe law covers the production of statistics by EU countries and the European Commission in their respective fields of competence:\nwaste generation (Annex I to the regulation);\nrecovery and disposal of waste (Annex II to the regulation).\nNomenclature\nEU countries and the Commission are required to use the nomenclatures (categories) set out in Annexes I to III to produce their statistics. These nomenclatures refer to\nwaste categories (e.g. spent solvents, mineral and metallic wastes),\neconomic activities (ranging from mining to food or textile production) and\nwaste management operations (e.g. sewerage, industrial waste treatment or materials recovery).\nData collection\nThe data used to produce the statistics are to be collected by means of surveys, statistical estimation procedures or referral to administrative or other sources. Unless they generate large amounts of waste, firms with fewer than 10 employees are excluded from surveys.\nTransmission of statistics to Eurostat\nEU countries must transmit the statistical results (including confidential data) to Eurostat within 18 months of the end of the reference periods laid down in Annexes I and II. The frequency is biennial.\nThe Commission is able to adopt measures necessary for applying or amending the regulation. These measures relate to:\nthe appropriate format for the transmission of results by EU countries;\nadjustment to economic and technical developments in the gathering, processing and communication of statistics;\nthe adaptation of the specifications listed in Annexes I, II and III;\nthe formulation of proper quality assessment criteria;\nthe implementation of the results of pilot studies.\nReports\nEvery 3 years, the Commission reports to the European Parliament and Council on the statistics prepared under this regulation, their quality and the burden on businesses.\nFROM WHEN DOES THIS REGULATION APPLY?\n              \nIt has applied since 29 December 2002.\nBACKGROUND\n              \nFor more information, see:\n‘Waste statistics’ on Eurostat's website\n‘Environmental Data Centre on Waste’ on Eurostat's website\n‘Waste’’ on the European Commission's website\nMAIN DOCUMENT\n            \nRegulation (EC) No 2150/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 November 2002 on waste statistics (OJ L 332, 9.12.2002, pp. 1–36)\nSubsequent amendments to Regulation (EC) No 2150/2002 have been incorporated in the original text.
