In the interests of clarity and rationality the said Regulation should be codified.\n(2)\nIn order to maintain the internal market, rules on trade with third countries are needed for the protection of cultural goods.\n(3)\nIt seems necessary to take measures in particular to ensure that exports of cultural goods are subject to uniform controls at the Community's external borders.\n(4)\nSuch a system should require the presentation of a licence issued by the competent Member State prior to the export of cultural goods covered by this Regulation. This necessitates a clear definition of the scope of such measures and the procedures for their implementation. The implementation of the system should be as simple and efficient as possible.\n(5)\nThe measures necessary for the implementation of this Regulation should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission (3).\n(6)\nIn view of the considerable experience of the Member States' authorities in the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 515/97 of 13 March 1997 on mutual assistance between the administrative authorities of the Member States and cooperation between the latter and the Commission to ensure the correct application of the law on customs and agricultural matters (4), the said Regulation should be applied to this matter.\n(7)\nAnnex I to this Regulation is aimed at making clear the categories of cultural goods which should be given particular protection in trade with third countries, but is not intended to prejudice the definition, by Member States, of national treasures within the meaning of Article 30 of the Treaty,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nArticle 1\nDefinition\nWithout prejudice to Member States' powers under Article 30 of the Treaty, the term ‘cultural goods’ shall refer, for the purposes of this Regulation, to the items listed in Annex I.\nArticle 2\nExport licence\n1.   The export of cultural goods outside the customs territory of the Community shall be subject to the presentation of an export licence.\n2.   The export licence shall be issued at the request of the person concerned:\n(a)\nby a competent authority of the Member State in whose territory the cultural object in question was lawfully and definitively located on 1 January 1993;\n(b)\nor, thereafter, by a competent authority of the Member State in whose territory it is located following either lawful and definitive dispatch from another Member State, or importation from a third country, or re-importation from a third country after lawful dispatch from a Member State to that country.\nHowever, without prejudice to paragraph 4, the Member State which is competent in accordance with points (a) or (b) of the first subparagraph is authorised not to require export licences for the cultural goods specified in the first and second indents of category A.1 of Annex I where they are of limited archaeological or scientific interest, and provided that they are not the direct product of excavations, finds or archaeological sites within a Member State, and that their presence on the market is lawful.\nThe export licence may be refused, for the purposes of this Regulation, where the cultural goods in question are covered by legislation protecting national treasures of artistic, historical or archaeological value in the Member State concerned.\nWhere necessary, the authority referred to in point (b) of the first subparagraph shall enter into contact with the competent authorities of the Member State from which the cultural object in question came, and in particular the competent authorities within the meaning of Council Directive 93/7/EEC of 15 March 1993 on the return of cultural objects unlawfully removed from the territory of a Member State (5).\n3.   The export licence shall be valid throughout the Community.\n4.   Without prejudice to the provisions of paragraphs 1, 2 and 3, direct export from the customs territory of the Community of national treasures having artistic, historic or archaeological value which are not cultural goods within the meaning of this Regulation is subject to the national law of the Member State of export.\nArticle 3\nCompetent authorities\n1.   Member States shall furnish the Commission with a list of the authorities empowered to issue export licences for cultural goods.\n2.   The Commission shall publish a list of the authorities and any amendment to that list in the ‘C’ series of the Official Journal of the European Union.\nArticle 4\nPresentation of licence\nThe export licence shall be presented, in support of the export declaration, when the customs export formalities are carried out, at the customs office which is competent to accept that declaration.\nArticle 5\nLimitation of competent customs offices\n1.   Member States may restrict the number of customs offices empowered to handle formalities for the export of cultural goods.\n2.   Member States availing themselves of the option afforded by paragraph 1 shall inform the Commission of the customs offices duly empowered.\nThe Commission shall publish this information in the ‘C’ series of the Official Journal of the European Union.\nArticle 6\nAdministrative cooperation\nFor the purposes of implementing this Regulation, the provisions of Regulation (EC) No 515/97, and in particular the provisions on the confidentiality of information, shall apply mutatis mutandis.\nIn addition to the cooperation provided for under the first paragraph, Member States shall take all necessary steps to establish, in the context of their mutual relations, cooperation between the customs authorities and the competent authorities referred to in Article 4 of Directive 93/7/EEC.\nArticle 7\nImplementing measures\nThe measures necessary for the implementation of this Regulation, in particular those concerning the form to be used (for example, the model and technical properties) shall be adopted in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 8(2).\nArticle 8\nCommittee\n1.   The Commission shall be assisted by a committee.\n2.   Where reference is made to this paragraph, Articles 3 and 7 of Decision 1999/468/EC shall apply.\nArticle 9\nPenalties\nThe Member States shall lay down the rules on penalties applicable to infringements of the provisions of this Regulation and shall take all measures necessary to ensure that they are implemented. The penalties provided for must be effective, proportionate and dissuasive.\nArticle 10\nReporting\n1.   Each Member State shall inform the Commission of the measures taken pursuant to this Regulation.\nThe Commission shall pass on this information to the other Member States.\n2.   Every three years the Commission shall present a report to the European Parliament, the Council and the European Economic and Social Committee on the implementation of this Regulation.\nThe Council, acting on a proposal from the Commission, shall examine every three years and, where appropriate, update the amounts indicated in Annex I, on the basis of economic and monetary indicators in the Community.\nArticle 11\nRepeal\nRegulation (EEC) No 3911/92, as amended by the Regulations listed in Annex II, is repealed.\nReferences to the repealed Regulation shall be construed as references to this Regulation and shall be read in accordance with the correlation table in Annex III.\nArticle 12\nEntry into force\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on the 20th day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.\nDone at Brussels, 18 December 2008.\nFor the Council\nThe President\nM.

It ensures that uniform controls are carried out on these exports at the EU’s external borders. The categories of cultural objects to which the regulation applies are listed in its Annex I.\nExport licence\nAn export licence must be presented when a cultural good is exported outside the customs territory of the EU. The exporter must request such a licence, which is issued by the competent EU country authority. It is valid throughout the EU. An EU country may refuse an export licence if the goods are protected by legislation on national treasures of artistic, historical or archaeological value. Under certain circumstances, an EU country may permit exports of certain cultural goods without a licence.\nThe export licence must be presented together with the export declaration at the competent customs office when the customs export formalities are being completed. EU countries may limit the number of customs offices competent for the formalities relating to cultural goods.\nCommission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 1081/2012 lays down rules governing the drawing up, issuing and use of the export licences provided for under Regulation (EC) No 116/2009.\nIt specifies the types of licence to be issued, their use and period of validity. There are 3 types of licence:\nthe standard licence - used in normal circumstances for each export subject to Regulation (EC) No 116/2009 and valid for 1 year;\nthe specific open licence - covers the repeated temporary export of a specific cultural good by its owner for use and/or exhibition in a third country and valid for up to 5 years;\nthe general open licence - issued to museums/other institutions to cover the temporary export of any of the goods that belong to their permanent collection that are liable to be temporarily exported from the EU on a regular basis for exhibition in a non-EU country. These are valid for up to 5 years.\nModels of the 3 forms are provided in Annexes I, II and III respectively.\nImplementation\nWith a view to implementing this regulation, national administrative authorities are to provide each other with mutual assistance as well as cooperate with the European Commission. Furthermore, cooperation must be established between EU countries' customs and competent authorities.\nEU countries must establish effective, proportionate and dissuasive penalties for infringements of the regulation.\nFROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?\n              \nRegulation (EU) No 116/2009 is the codified version of an original act (Regulation (EEC) No 3911/92), and its subsequent amendments. It has applied since 2 March 2009.\nBACKGROUND\n              \nFor more information, see:\n‘Cultural Goods’ on the European Commission's website.\nMAIN DOCUMENT\n            \nCouncil Regulation (EC) No 116/2009 of 18 December 2008 on the export of cultural goods (codified version) (OJ L 39, 10.2.2009, pp. 1-7)\nRELATED DOCUMENTS\nList of authorities empowered to issue export licences for cultural goods, published in accordance with Article 3(2) of Council Regulation (EC) No 116/2009 (OJ C 164, 16.7.2009, pp. 6-20)\nList of customs offices empowered to handle formalities for the exportation of cultural goods, published in accordance with Article 5(2) of Council Regulation (EC) No 116/2009 (OJ C 134, 13.6.2009, pp. 9-13)\nlast update 20.02.2017", "tags": ["export licence", "administrative cooperation", "third country", "heritage protection", "cultural relations", "cultural object", "export"], "subjects": ["Free movement of goods", "Protocol on Ireland/Northern Ireland", "Internal market - Principles", "Culture", "Commercial policy"], "split": "train", "reference_annotations": {}, "summary_annotations": {}}
