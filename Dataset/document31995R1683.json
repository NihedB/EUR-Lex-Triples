In the case of a Schengen visa, the days should be counted from the date he or she enters the Schengen area (the entry stamp) to the date they exit the Schengen area (the exit stamp), both days included.The precise length of validity of the visa is indicated on the visa sticker under the heading ‘Duration of stay’.\nRegulation (EU) 2017/1370 introduces a new design for the visa sticker with additional safety features to prevent forgery. Ireland and the United Kingdom (1) are not subject to the application of the new measures which came into force on 17 August 2017. Nevertheless, these countries may request the European Commission to enter into agreements in order to exchange technical information in the model of their national visas.\nTechnical specificationsThe uniform visa must conform to:\na list of technical specifications concerning universally recognisable security features clearly visible to the naked eye including: an integrated photograph produced to high security standards,the logo consisting of a letter or letters indicating the issuing country - or group of countries, in the case of the Benelux;\nother technical specifications which aim to prevent counterfeiting and falsification of the visa and provide methods to fill in the visa.\nEach EU country must designate only one authority for printing visas. It must communicate the name of this body to the Commission and the other EU countries.\nTechnical specifications for the new visa sticker will be set out in a Commission implementing decision. The regulation will apply no later than 15 months after the adoption of the additional technical specifications referred to in Regulation (EC) No 1683/95.\nFROM WHEN DOES THIS REGULATION APPLY?\n              \nIt has applied since 3 August 1995.\nBACKGROUND\n              \nFor more information, see:\nVisa policy (European Commission).\nKEY TERMS\n              \nSchengen countries: Austria, Belgium, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Italy, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland.\nMAIN DOCUMENT\n            \nCouncil Regulation (EC) No 1683/95 of 29 May 1995 laying down a uniform format for visas (OJ L 164, 14.7.1995, pp. 1-4)\nSubsequent amendments to Regulation (EC) No 1683/95 have been incorporated into the basic text.
