{"celex_id": "32009R1221", "reference": "22.12.2009\nEN\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\nL 342/1\nREGULATION (EC) No 1221/2009 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL\nof 25 November 2009\non the voluntary participation by organisations in a Community eco-management and audit scheme (EMAS), repealing Regulation (EC) No 761/2001 and Commission Decisions 2001/681/EC and 2006/193/EC\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 175(1) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the Commission,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee (1),\nHaving regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions (2),\nActing in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty (3),\nWhereas:\n(1)\nArticle 2 of the Treaty provides that the Community is to have among its tasks the promotion of sustainable growth throughout the Community.\n(2)\nDecision No 1600/2002/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 July 2002 laying down the Sixth Community Environment Action Programme (4) identifies the improvement of collaboration and partnership with enterprises as a strategic approach to meeting environmental objectives. Voluntary commitments are an essential part thereof. Encouraging wider participation in the Community's eco-management and audit scheme (EMAS) and the development of initiatives to encourage organisations to publish rigorous and independently verified environmental or sustainable development performance reports is regarded as necessary in this context.\n(3)\nThe Commission Communication of 30 April 2007 on the Mid-term review of the Sixth Community Environment Action Programme recognises that there is a need to improve the functioning of the voluntary instruments that have been designed for industry and that those instruments have a great potential but have not been fully developed. It calls upon the Commission to revise the instruments in order to promote their participation and reduce the administrative burden in their management.\n(4)\nThe Commission Communication of 16 July 2008 on the Sustainable Consumption and Production and Sustainable Industrial Policy Action Plan recognises that EMAS helps organisations to optimise their production processes, reducing environmental impacts and making more effective use of resources.\n(5)\nFor the purpose of promoting a coherent approach between the legislative instruments developed at Community level in the field of environmental protection, the Commission and the Member States should consider how registration under EMAS may be taken into account in the development of legislation or used as a tool in the enforcement of legislation. They should also, in order to raise the appeal of EMAS for organisations, take account of EMAS in their procurement policies and, where appropriate, refer to EMAS or equivalent environmental management systems as contract performance conditions for works and service.\n(6)\nArticle 15 of Regulation (EC) No 761/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 19 March 2001 allowing voluntary participation by organisations in a Community eco-management and audit scheme (EMAS) (5) provides that the Commission is to review EMAS in the light of the experience gained during its operation and propose appropriate amendments to the European Parliament and the Council.\n(7)\nApplication of environmental management schemes, including EMAS as set out in Regulation (EC) No 761/2001, demonstrated their effectiveness in promoting improvements of the environmental performance of organisations. There is, however, a need to increase the number of organisations participating in the scheme in order to achieve a better overall impact of environmental improvements. To this effect, the experience gathered from the implementation of that Regulation should be used to enhance the ability of EMAS to bring about an improvement in the overall environmental performance of organisations.\n(8)\nOrganisations should be encouraged to participate in EMAS on a voluntary basis and may gain added value in terms of regulatory control, cost savings and public image provided that they are able to demonstrate an improvement of their environmental performance.\n(9)\nEMAS should be made available to all organisations, in and outside the Community, whose activities have an environmental impact. EMAS should provide a means for those organisations to manage that impact and to improve their overall environmental performance.\n(10)\nOrganisations, in particular small organisations, should be encouraged to participate in EMAS. Their participation should be promoted by facilitating access to information, to existing support funds and to public institutions and by establishing or promoting technical assistance measures.\n(11)\nOrganisations which implement other environmental management systems and want to move to EMAS should be able to do so as easily as possible. Links with other environmental management schemes should be considered.\n(12)\nOrganisations with sites located in one or more Member States should be able to register all or a number of those sites under one single registration.\n(13)\nThe mechanism for establishing an organisation's compliance with all applicable legal requirements relating to the environment should be strengthened in order to enhance the credibility of EMAS and, in particular, to enable Member States to reduce the administrative burden of registered organisations by way of deregulation or regulatory relief.\n(14)\nThe process of implementation of EMAS should include involvement of employees and workers of the organisation as this increases job satisfaction, as well as knowledge of environmental issues which can be replicated in and outside the work environment.\n(15)\nThe EMAS logo should be an appealing communication and marketing tool for organisations, which raises the awareness of buyers and other stakeholders to EMAS. Rules for the use of the EMAS logo should be simplified by the use of one single logo and existing restrictions should be removed save for those relating to the product and packaging. There should be no confusion with environmental product labels.\n(16)\nCosts and fees for registration under EMAS should be reasonable and proportionate to the size of the organisation and the work to be done by the Competent Bodies. Without prejudice to the rules of the Treaty on State aid, exemptions or reductions of fees should be considered for small organisations.\n(17)\nOrganisations should produce and make publicly available periodic environmental statements providing the public and other interested parties with information on their compliance with applicable legal requirements relating to the environment and their environmental performance.\n(18)\nIn order to ensure relevance and comparability of the information, reporting on the organisations’ environmental performance should be on the basis of generic and sector-specific performance indicators focusing on key environmental areas at the process and product level using appropriate benchmarks and scales. This should help organisations compare their environmental performance both over different reporting periods and with the environmental performance of other organisations.\n(19)\nReference documents including best environmental management practice and environmental performance indicators for specific sectors should be developed through information exchange and collaboration between Member States. Those documents should help organisations better focus on the most important environmental aspects in a given sector.\n(20)\nRegulation (EC) No 765/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 9 July 2008 setting out the requirements for accreditation and market surveillance relating to the marketing of products (6) organises accreditation at the national and European levels and sets the overall framework for accreditation. This Regulation should complement those rules in so far as necessary, while taking into account the specific features of EMAS such as the need to ensure a high level of credibility towards stakeholders, especially Member States and, where appropriate, should set more specific rules. The EMAS provisions should ensure and steadily improve the competence of environmental verifiers by providing for an independent and neutral accreditation or licensing system, training and an appropriate supervision of their activities and thus guarantee the transparency and credibility of organisations participating in EMAS.\n(21)\nWhen a Member State decides not to use accreditation for EMAS, Article 5(2) of Regulation (EC) No 765/2008 should apply.\n(22)\nPromotion and support activities should be undertaken by both the Member States and the Commission.\n(23)\nWithout prejudice to the rules of the Treaty on State aid, incentives should be given by Member States to registered organisations such as access to funding or tax incentives in the framework of schemes supporting environmental performance of industry, provided that organisations are able to demonstrate an improvement of their environmental performance.\n(24)\nMember States and the Commission should develop and implement specific measures aimed at greater participation in EMAS by organisations, in particular small organisations.\n(25)\nWith the aim of ensuring a harmonised application of this Regulation, the Commission should produce sectoral reference documents in the area covered by this Regulation following a priority programme.\n(26)\nThis Regulation should be revised, if appropriate, within five years of its entry into force in the light of experience gained.\n(27)\nThis Regulation replaces Regulation (EC) No 761/2001 which should therefore be repealed.\n(28)\nGiven that useful elements of Commission Recommendation 2001/680/EC of 7 September 2001 on guidance for the implementation of Regulation (EC) No 761/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council allowing voluntary participation by organisations in a Community eco-management and audit scheme (EMAS) (7) and of Commission Recommendation 2003/532/EC of 10 July 2003 on guidance for the implementation of Regulation (EC) No 761/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council allowing voluntary participation by organisations in a Community eco-management and audit scheme (EMAS) concerning the selection and use of environmental performance indicators (8) are included in this Regulation, those acts should no longer be used as they are superseded by this Regulation.\n(29)\nSince the objectives of this Regulation, namely to create a single credible scheme and avoid the establishment of different national schemes, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore, by reason of its scale and effects, be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives.\n(30)\nThe measures necessary for the implementation of this Regulation should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission (9).\n(31)\nIn particular the Commission should be empowered to establish procedures for the peer evaluation of Competent Bodies, to develop sectoral reference documents, to recognise existing environmental management systems, or parts thereof, as complying with corresponding requirements of this Regulation and to amend Annexes I to VIII. Since those measures are of general scope and are designed to amend non-essential elements of this Regulation, inter alia, by supplementing it with new non-essential elements, they must be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny provided for in Article 5a of Decision 1999/468/EC.\n(32)\nSince a period of time is required to ensure that the framework for the proper functioning of this Regulation is in place, Member States should have a period of 12 months following the date of entry into force of this Regulation to modify the procedures followed by Accreditation Bodies and Competent Bodies under the corresponding provisions of this Regulation. Within that 12-month period, Accreditation Bodies and Competent Bodies should be entitled to continue to apply the procedures established under Regulation (EC) No 761/2001,\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nCHAPTER I\nGENERAL PROVISIONS\nArticle 1\nObjective\nA Community eco-management and audit scheme, hereinafter referred to as ‘EMAS’, is hereby established, allowing voluntary participation by organisations located inside or outside the Community.\nThe objective of EMAS, as an important instrument of the Sustainable Consumption and Production and Sustainable Industrial Policy Action Plan, is to promote continuous improvements in the environmental performance of organisations by the establishment and implementation of environmental management systems by organisations, the systematic, objective and periodic evaluation of the performance of such systems, the provision of information on environmental performance, an open dialogue with the public and other interested parties and the active involvement of employees in organisations and appropriate training.\nArticle 2\nDefinitions\nFor the purposes of this Regulation the following definitions shall apply:\n1.\n‘environmental policy’ means the overall intentions and direction of an organisation relating to its environmental performance as formally expressed by top management including compliance with all applicable legal requirements relating to the environment and also a commitment to continuous improvement of environmental performance.

An inventory limited to the environmental aspects of an organisation's site and facilities is insufficient.\nThese include, but are not limited to:\n(i)\nproduct life cycle related issues (design, development, packaging, transportation, use and waste recovery/disposal);\n(ii)\ncapital investments, granting loans and insurance services;\n(iii)\nnew markets;\n(iv)\nchoice and composition of services (e.g. transport or the catering trade);\n(v)\nadministrative and planning decisions;\n(vi)\nproduct range compositions;\n(vii)\nthe environmental performance and practices of contractors, subcontractors and suppliers.\nOrganisations must be able to demonstrate that the significant environmental aspects associated with their procurement procedures have been identified and that significant environmental impacts associated with these aspects are addressed within the management system. The organisation should endeavour to ensure that the suppliers and those acting on the organisation's behalf comply with the organisation's environmental policy within the remit of the activities carried out for the contract.\nIn the case of these indirect environmental aspects, an organisation shall consider how much influence it can have over these aspects, and what measures can be taken to reduce the environmental impact.\n3.\nDescription of the criteria for assessing the significance of the environmental impact\nAn organisation shall define the criteria for assessing the significance of the environmental aspects of its activities, products and services, to determine which have a significant environmental impact.\nThe criteria developed by an organisation shall take into account Community legislation and shall be comprehensive, capable of independent checking, reproducible and made publicly available.\nConsiderations in establishing the criteria for assessing the significance of an organisation's environmental aspects may include, but are not limited to:\n(a)\ninformation about the condition of the environment to identify activities, products and services of the organisation that may have an environmental impact;\n(b)\nthe organisation's existing data on material and energy inputs, discharges, wastes and emissions in terms of risk;\n(c)\nviews of interested parties;\n(d)\nenvironmental activities of the organisation that are regulated;\n(e)\nprocurement activities;\n(f)\ndesign, development, manufacturing, distribution, servicing, use, re-use, recycling and disposal of the organisation's products;\n(g)\nthose activities of the organisation with the most significant environmental costs, and environmental benefits.\nIn assessing the significance of the environmental impacts of the organisation's activities the organisation shall think not only of normal operating conditions but also of start-up and shutdown conditions and of reasonably foreseeable emergency conditions. Account shall be taken of past, present and planned activities.\n4.\nExamination of all existing environmental management practices and procedures.\n5.\nEvaluation of feedback from the investigation of previous incidents.\nANNEX II\nEnvironmental management system requirements and additional issues to be addressed by organisations implementing EMAS\nThe environmental management system requirements under EMAS are those laid down in Section 4 of the EN ISO 14001:2004 standard.

These additional requirements are listed in the right column below, which constitutes Part B of this Annex.\nPART A\nenvironmental management systems requirements under EN ISO 14001:2004\nPART B\nadditional issues to be addressed by organisations implementing EMAS\nOrganisations participating in the eco-management and audit scheme (EMAS) shall implement the requirements of EN ISO 14001:2004, which are described in Section 4 of the European Standard (1) and are fully reproduced below:\nA.\nEnvironmental management system requirements\nA.1.\nGeneral requirements\nThe organisation shall establish, document, implement, maintain and continually improve an environmental management system in accordance with the requirements of this International Standard and determine how it will fulfill these requirements.\nThe organisation shall define and document the scope of its environmental management system.\nA.2.\nEnvironmental policy\nTop management shall define the organisation's environmental policy and ensure that, within the defined scope of its environmental management system, it:\n(a)\nis appropriate to the nature, scale and environmental impacts of its activities, products and services;\n(b)\nincludes a commitment to continual improvement and prevention of pollution;\n(c)\nincludes a commitment to comply with applicable legal requirements and with other requirements to which the organisation subscribes which relate to its environmental aspects;\n(d)\nprovides the framework for setting and reviewing environmental objectives and targets;\n(e)\nis documented, implemented and maintained;\n(f)\nis communicated to all persons working for or on behalf of the organisation; and\n(g)\nis available to the public.\nA.3.\nPlanning\nA.3.1.\nEnvironmental aspects\nThe organisation shall establish, implement and maintain a procedure(s):\n(a)\nto identify the environmental aspects of its activities, products and services within the defined scope of the environmental management system that it can control and those that it can influence taking into account planned or new developments, or new or modified activities, products and services; and\n(b)\nto determine those aspects that have or can have significant impact(s) on the environment (i.e. significant environmental aspects).\nThe organisation shall document this information and keep it up to date.\nThe organisation shall ensure that the significant environmental aspects are taken into account in establishing, implementing and maintaining its environmental management system.\nB.1.\nEnvironmental review\nOrganisations shall carry out an initial environmental review as set out in Annex I in order to identify and evaluate their environmental aspects and identify applicable legal requirements relating to the environment.\nOrganisations outside the Community shall also make reference to the legal requirements relating to the environment applicable to similar organisations in the Member States where they intend to submit an application.\nA.3.2.\nLegal and other requirements\nThe organisation shall establish, implement and maintain a procedure(s):\n(a)\nto identify and have access to the applicable legal requirements and other requirements to which the organisation subscribes related to its environmental aspects; and\n(b)\nto determine how these requirements apply to its environmental aspects.\nThe organisation shall ensure that these applicable legal requirements and other requirements to which the organisation subscribes are taken into account in establishing, implementing and maintaining its environmental management system.\nB.2.\nLegal compliance\nOrganisations wishing to register with EMAS shall be able to demonstrate that they:\n(1)\nhave identified, and know the implications to the organisation of all applicable legal requirements relating to the environment, identified during the environmental review according to Annex I.\n(2)\nprovide for legal compliance with environmental legislation, including permits and permit limits; and\n(3)\nhave procedures in place that enable the organisation to meet these requirements on an ongoing basis.\nA.3.3.\nObjectives, targets and programme(s)\nThe organisation shall establish, implement and maintain documented environmental objectives and targets, at relevant functions and levels within the organisation.\nThe objectives and targets shall be measurable, where practicable, and consistent with the environmental policy, including the commitments to prevention of pollution, to compliance with applicable legal requirements and with other requirements to which the organisation subscribes, and to continual improvement.\nWhen establishing and reviewing its objectives and targets, an organisation shall take into account the legal requirements and other requirements to which the organisation subscribes, and its significant environmental aspects. It shall also consider its technological options, its financial, operational and business requirements, and the views of interested parties.\nThe organisation shall establish, implement and maintain a programme(s) for achieving its objectives and targets. Programme(s) shall include:\n(a)\ndesignation of responsibility for achieving objectives and targets at relevant functions and levels of the organisation; and\n(b)\nthe means and time-frame by which they are to be achieved.\nB.3.\nEnvironmental performance\n(1)\nOrganisations shall be able to demonstrate that the management system and the audit procedures address the actual environmental performance of the organisation with respect to the direct and indirect aspects identified in the environmental review under Annex I.\n(2)\nThe environmental performance of the organisation against its objectives and targets shall be evaluated as part of the management review process. The organisation shall also commit itself to the continual improvement of its environmental performance. In doing so, the organisation may base its action on local, regional and national environmental programmes.\n(3)\nThe means to achieve the objectives and targets cannot be environmental objectives. If the organisation comprises one or more sites, each of the sites to which EMAS applies shall comply with all the requirements of EMAS including the continual improvement of environmental performance as defined in Article 2(2).\nA.4.\nImplementation and operation\nA.4.1.\nResources, roles, responsibility and authority\nManagement shall ensure the availability of resources essential to establish, implement, maintain and improve the environmental management system. Resources include human resources and specialised skills, organisational infrastructure, technology and financial resources.\nRoles, responsibilities and authorities shall be defined, documented and communicated in order to facilitate effective environmental management.\nThe organisation's top management shall appoint a specific management representative(s) who, irrespective of other responsibilities, shall have defined roles, responsibilities and authority for:\n(a)\nensuring that an environmental management system is established, implemented and maintained in accordance with the requirements of this International Standard;\n(b)\nreporting to top management on the performance of the environmental management system for review, including recommendations for improvement.\nA.4.2.\nCompetence, training and awareness\nB.4.\nEmployee involvement\n(1)\nThe organisation should acknowledge that active employee involvement is a driving force and a prerequisite for continuous and successful environmental improvements as well as being a key resource in the improvement of environmental performance as well as the right method to anchor the environmental management and audit system in the organisation in a successful way.\n(2)\nThe term ‘employee participation’ includes both participation of, and information to the individual employee and his representatives. Therefore, there should be an employee participation scheme at all levels. The organisation should acknowledge that commitment, responsiveness and active support from the side of the management is a prerequisite for the success of those processes. In this context the necessity of feedback from the management to the employees must be stressed.\nThe organisation shall ensure that any person(s) performing tasks for it or on its behalf that have the potential to cause a significant environmental impact(s) identified by the organisation is (are) competent on the basis of appropriate education, training or experience, and shall retain associated records.\nThe organisation shall identify training needs associated with its environmental aspects and its environmental management system. It shall provide training or take other action to meet these needs, and shall retain associated records.\nThe organisation shall establish, implement and maintain a procedure(s) to make persons working for it or on its behalf aware of:\n(a)\nthe importance of conformity with the environmental policy and procedures and with the requirements of the environmental management system;\n(b)\nthe significant environmental aspects and related actual or potential impacts associated with their work, and the environmental benefits of improved personal performance;\n(c)\ntheir roles and responsibilities in achieving conformity with the requirements of the environmental management system; and\n(d)\nthe potential consequences of departure from specified procedures.\n(3)\nIn addition to the these requirements, employees shall be involved in the process aimed at continually improving the organisation's environmental performance through:\n(a)\nthe initial environmental review, the analysis of the status quo and in collecting and verifying information,\n(b)\nthe establishment and implementation of an environmental management and audit system improving environmental performance,\n(c)\nenvironmental committees to gather information and to ensure the participation of environmental officer/management representatives and employees and their representatives,\n(d)\njoint working groups for the environmental action programme and environmental auditing,\n(e)\nthe elaboration of the environmental statements.\n(4)\nAppropriate forms of participation such as the suggestion-book system or project-based group works or environmental committees should be used for this purpose.

Objectives of the audit programme\nThe objectives shall include, in particular, assessing the management systems in place, and determining conformity with the organisation's policy and programme, which shall include compliance with relevant environmental regulatory requirements.\n3.   Scope of the audit programme\nThe overall scope of the individual audits, or of each stage of an audit cycle where appropriate, shall be clearly defined and shall explicitly specify the:\n(a)\nsubject areas covered;\n(b)\nactivities to be audited;\n(c)\nenvironmental criteria to be considered;\n(d)\nperiod covered by the audit.\nEnvironmental audit includes assessment of the factual data necessary to evaluate environmental performance.\n4.   Audit frequency\nThe audit or audit cycle which covers all activities of the organisation shall be completed, as appropriate, at intervals of no longer than three years or four years if the derogation provided for in Article 7 applies. The frequency with which any activity is audited will vary depending on the:\n(a)\nnature, scale and complexity of the activities;\n(b)\nsignificance of associated environmental impacts;\n(c)\nimportance and urgency of the problems detected by previous audits;\n(d)\nhistory of environmental problems.\nMore complex activities with a more significant environmental impact shall be audited more frequently.\nThe organisation shall carry out audits at least on an annual basis, as this will help to demonstrate to the organisation's management and the environmental verifier that it is in control of its significant environmental aspects.\nThe organisation shall carry out audits regarding:\n(a)\nthe environmental performance of the organisation; and\n(b)\nthe organisation's compliance with applicable legal obligations relating to the environment.\nB.   Audit activities\nAudit activities shall include discussions with personnel, inspection of operating conditions and equipment and reviewing of records, written procedures and other relevant documentation, with the objective of evaluating the environmental performance of the activity being audited to determine whether it meets the applicable standards, regulations or environmental objectives and targets set and whether the system in place to manage environmental responsibilities is effective and appropriate, inter alia, spot-checking of compliance with these criteria should be used to determine the effectiveness of the entire management system.\nThe following steps, in particular, shall be included in the audit process:\n(a)\nunderstanding of the management systems;\n(b)\nassessing strengths and weaknesses of the management systems;\n(c)\ngathering relevant evidence;\n(d)\nevaluating audit findings;\n(e)\npreparing audit conclusions;\n(f)\nreporting audit findings and conclusions.\nC.   Reporting audit findings and conclusions\nThe fundamental objectives of a written audit report are:\n(a)\nto document the scope of the audit;\n(b)\nto provide the management with information on the state of compliance with the organisations’ environmental policy and the environmental progress of the organisation;\n(c)\nto provide the management with information on the effectiveness and reliability of the arrangements for monitoring environmental impacts of the organisation;\n(d)\nto demonstrate the need for corrective action, where appropriate.\nANNEX IV\nENVIRONMENTAL REPORTING\nA.   Introduction\nEnvironmental information shall be presented in a clear and coherent manner in electronic form or in printed form.\nB.   Environmental statement\nThe environmental statement shall contain at least the elements and shall meet the minimum requirements as set out below:\n(a)\na clear and unambiguous description of the organisation registering under EMAS and a summary of its activities, products and services and its relationship to any parent organisations as appropriate;\n(b)\nthe environmental policy and a brief description of the environmental management system of the organisation;\n(c)\na description of all the significant direct and indirect environmental aspects which result in significant environmental impacts of the organisation and an explanation of the nature of the impacts as related to these aspects (Annex I.2);\n(d)\na description of the environmental objectives and targets in relation to the significant environmental aspects and impacts;\n(e)\na summary of the data available on the performance of the organisation against its environmental objectives and targets with respect to its significant environmental impacts. Reporting shall be on the core indicators and on other relevant existing environmental performance indicators as set out in Section C;\n(f)\nother factors regarding environmental performance including performance against legal provisions with respect to their significant environmental impacts;\n(g)\na reference to the applicable legal requirements relating to the environment;\n(h)\nthe name and accreditation or licence number of the environmental verifier and the date of validation.\nThe updated environmental statement shall contain at least the elements and shall meet the minimum requirements as set out in points (e) to (h).\nC.   Core indicators and other relevant existing environmental performance indicators\n1.   Introduction\nOrganisations shall report, both in the environmental statement and the updated environmental statement, on the core indicators insofar as these relate to the direct environmental aspects of the organisation and other relevant existing environmental performance indicators as set out below.\nThe reporting shall provide data on actual input/impact. If disclosure would adversely affect the confidentiality of commercial or industrial information of the organisation where such confidentiality is provided for by national or Community law to protect a legitimate economic interest, the organisation may be permitted to index this information in its reporting, e.g. by establishing a base line year (with the index number 100) from which the development of the actual input/impact would appear.\nThe indicators shall:\n(a)\ngive an accurate appraisal of the organisation's environmental performance;\n(b)\nbe understandable and unambiguous;\n(c)\nallow for a year on year comparison to assess the development of the environmental performance of the organisation;\n(d)\nallow for comparison with sector, national or regional benchmarks as appropriate;\n(e)\nallow for comparison with regulatory requirements as appropriate.\n2.   Core indicators\n(a)\nCore indicators shall apply to all types of organisations. They focus on performance in the following key environmental areas:\n(i)\nEnergy efficiency;\n(ii)\nMaterial efficiency;\n(iii)\nWater;\n(iv)\nWaste;\n(v)\nBiodiversity; and\n(vi)\nEmissions.\nWhere an organisation concludes that one or more core indicators are not relevant to its significant direct environmental aspects, that organisation may not report on those core indicators. The organisation shall provide justification to that effect with reference to its environmental review.\n(b)\nEach core indicator is composed of:\n(i)\na figure A indicating the total annual input/impact in the given field;\n(ii)\na figure B indicating the overall annual output of the organisation; and\n(iii)\na figure R indicating the ratio A/B.\nEach organisation shall report on all 3 elements for each indicator.\n(c)\nThe indication of the total annual input/impact in the given field, figure A, shall be reported as follows:\n(i)\non Energy efficiency\n—\nconcerning the ‘total direct energy use’, the total annual energy consumption, expressed in MWh or GJ,\n—\nconcerning the ‘total renewable energy use’, the percentage of total annual consumption of energy (electricity and heat) produced by the organisation from renewable energy sources,\n(ii)\non Material efficiency\n—\nconcerning the ‘annual mass-flow of different materials used’ (excluding energy carriers and water), expressed in tonnes,\n(iii)\non Water\n—\nconcerning the ‘total annual water consumption’, expressed in m3,\n(iv)\non Waste\n—\nconcerning the ‘total annual generation of waste’, broken down by type, expressed in tonnes,\n—\nconcerning the ‘total annual generation of hazardous waste’ expressed in kilograms or tonnes,\n(v)\non Biodiversity\n—\nconcerning the ‘use of land’, expressed in m2 of built-up area,\n(vi)\non Emissions\n—\nconcerning the ‘total annual emission of greenhouse gases’, including at least emissions of CO2, CH4, N2O, HFCs, PFCs and SF6, expressed in tonnes of CO2 equivalent,\n—\nconcerning the ‘total annual air emission’, including at least emissions of SO2, NOx and PM, expressed in kilograms or tonnes,\nIn addition to the indicators defined above, an organisation may use also other indicators to express the total annual input/impact in the given field;\n(d)\nThe indication of the overall annual output of the organisation, figure B, is the same for all fields, but is adapted to the different types of organisations, depending on their type of activity, and shall be reported as follows:\n(i)\nfor organisations working in the production sector (industry), it shall indicate the total annual gross value-added expressed in million euro (EUR Mio) or total annual physical output expressed in tonnes or, in the case of small organisations the total annual turnover or number of employees;\n(ii)\nfor organisations in the non-production sectors (administration/services), it shall relate to the size of the organisation expressed in number of employees.\nIn addition to the indicators defined above, an organisation may use also other indicators to express its overall annual output.\n3.   Other relevant environmental performance indicators\nEach organisation shall also report annually on its performance relating to the more specific environmental aspects as identified in its environmental statement and, where available, take account of sectoral reference documents as referred to in Article 46.\nD.   Public availability\nThe organisation shall be able to demonstrate to the environmental verifier that anybody interested in the organisation's environmental performance can easily and freely be given access to the information required above under points B and C.\nThe organisation shall ensure that this information is available in (one of) the official language(s) of the Member State, in which the organisation is registered, and if applicable in (one of) the official language(s) of those Member States, in which sites covered by the corporate registration are located.\nE.   Local accountability\nOrganisations registering under EMAS may wish to produce one corporate environmental statement, covering a number of different geographic locations.\nAs the intention of EMAS is to ensure local accountability, organisations shall ensure that the significant environmental impacts of each site are clearly identified and reported within the corporate environmental statement.\nANNEX V\nEMAS LOGO\n1.

voluntary participation by organisations in a Community eco-management and audit scheme (EMAS)\nWHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?\n              \nIt establishes the eco-management and audit scheme (EMAS), which is a voluntary premium environmental management tool for all kinds of organisations that are willing to evaluate, report on and improve their environmental performance.\nKEY POINTS\nThe EMAS registration process\nTo receive EMAS registration, an organisation must:\nconduct a review of all the environmental aspects of its activities, products and services;\nadopt an environmental policy containing a commitment to comply with all the relevant legislation and to achieve continuous improvement of their environmental performance;\ndevelop a programme with information on specific environmental objectives and targets;\nestablish an effective management system to achieve its environmental policy and ensure continuous improvement;\ncarry out an environmental audit assessing the management system in place and overall conformity with its policy and programme;\nprovide an environmental statement of its performance, set against its objectives, and the steps to be taken in the future.\nValidation\nThe environmental review, management system, audit procedure and statement must be approved by an accredited environmental verifier.The validated statement is registered and made publicly available.\nUse of the EMAS logo\nAn organisation successfully completing all these stages may use the EMAS logo on its letterheads and in reference to its activities and services, to demonstrate its commitment to improving its environmental performance.\nEuropean Commission decisions\nThe European Commission has adopted a series of decisions in relation to Regulation (EC) No 1221/2009. They include:\nDecision 2011/832/EU concerning a guide on European Union (EU) corporate registration, non-EU-country and global registration under Regulation (EC) No 1221/2009;\nDecision (EU) 2016/1621 on a guidance document on notification to accreditation and licensing bodies by environmental verifiers active in an EU Member State other than that where the accreditation or licence was granted under Regulation (EC) No 1221/2009;\nDecisions (EU) 2017/2285 and (EU) 2020/1802 amending the user’s guide setting out the steps needed to participate in EMAS.\nThe Commission has also adopted a further series of decisions on sectoral reference documents – concerning best environmental management practices, sector environmental performance indicators and benchmarks of excellence for:\nthe retail trade sector (Decision (EU) 2015/801);\nthe tourism sector (Decision (EU) 2016/611);\nthe food and beverage manufacturing sector (Decision (EU) 2017/1508);\nthe agriculture sector (Decision (EU) 2018/813);\nthe electrical and electronic equipment manufacturing sector (Decision (EU) 2019/63);\nthe car manufacturing sector (Decision (EU) 2019/62);\nthe public administration sector (Decision (EU) 2019/61);\nthe waste management sector (Decision (EU) 2020/519);\nthe fabricated metal products manufacturing sector (Decision (EU) 2021/2053);\nthe telecommunications and information and communication technologies services sector (Decision (EU) 2021/2054).\nAmendments to the legislation\nRegulation (EC) No 1221/2009 has been amended three times:\nRegulation (EU) No 517/2013 amended the regulation, adapting it to take account of Croatia becoming a member of the EU in July 2013.\nRegulation (EU) 2017/1505 amends Annexes I, II and III to take into account the requirements set out in the new version of the International Standard ISO 14001. Because organisations wishing to obtain or maintain both EMAS registration and ISO 14001 certification often conduct one integrated verification/certification process, coherence between the requirements of these two instruments should be kept.\nRegulation (EU) 2018/2026 amends Annex IV to address improvements identified in the light of experience gained in the operation of EMAS. Given the number and nature of these amendments, in the interests of clarity it was considered appropriate to replace Annex IV in its entirety.\nRepeal\nRegulation (EC) No 1221/2009 repeals Regulation (EC) No 761/2001 and Decisions 2001/681/EC and 2006/193/EC.\nFROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?\n              \nIt has applied since 11 January 2010.\nBACKGROUND\n              \nFor more information, see:\nEco-management and audit scheme (European Commission).\nMAIN DOCUMENT\n            \nRegulation (EC) No 1221/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 November 2009 on the voluntary participation by organisations in a Community eco-management and audit scheme (EMAS), repealing Regulation (EC) No 761/2001 and Commission Decisions 2001/681/EC and 2006/193/EC (OJ L 342, 22.12.2009, pp. 1–45).\nSuccessive amendments to Regulation (EC) No 1221/2009 have been incorporated in the original text.
