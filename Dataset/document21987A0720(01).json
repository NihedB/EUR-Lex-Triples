It is used by 211 economies, of which 160 are signatories to the convention, for their customs tariffs and for collecting international trade statistics.\nIt contains some 5,000 commodity groups — each identified by a six-digit code — and classifies over 98% of international trade in goods.\nGovernments, international organisations and the private sector use the harmonized system for many other purposes, including internal taxes, trade policies, monitoring of controlled goods and freight tariffs. This makes it a universal economic language and a code for goods.\nThe convention is updated every 5 years. The latest version, containing 351 amendments, will come into force on 1 January 2022 (replacing the current version from 2017).\nFor more information, see:\nThe Combined Nomenclature (European Commission).\nMAIN DOCUMENTS\n            \nCouncil Decision 87/369/EEC of 7 April 1987 concerning the conclusion of the International Convention on the Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System and of the Protocol of Amendment thereto (OJ L 198, 20.7.1987, pp. 1-2)\nInternational Convention on the Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System (OJ L 198, 20.7.1987, pp. 3-10)\nProtocol of Amendment to the International Convention on the Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System (OJ L 198, 20.7.1987, pp. 11-409)\nlast update 17.09.2020", "tags": ["customs harmonisation", "international convention", "customs cooperation", "Combined Nomenclature"], "subjects": ["Provisions under Article 235 EEC", "External relations", "Harmonisation of customs law: various"], "split": "train", "reference_annotations": {}, "summary_annotations": {}}
