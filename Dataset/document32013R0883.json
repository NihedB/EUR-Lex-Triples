{"celex_id": "32013R0883", "reference": "18.9.2013\nEN\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\nL 248/1\nREGULATION (EU, EURATOM) No 883/2013 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL\nof 11 September 2013\nconcerning investigations conducted by the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) and repealing Regulation (EC) No 1073/1999 of the European Parliament and of the Council and Council Regulation (Euratom) No 1074/1999\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 325 thereof, in conjunction with the Treaty establishing the European Atomic Energy Community, and in particular Article 106a thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the Court of Auditors (1),\nActing in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure (2),\nWhereas:\n(1)\nThe Union institutions and the Member States attach great importance to the protection of the financial interests of the Union and to the fight against fraud, corruption and any other illegal activity affecting those interests. The Commission’s responsibility in that connection is closely bound up with its duty to implement the budget pursuant to Article 317 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) and the importance of action to that end is confirmed by Article 325 TFEU.\n(2)\nAll available means should be deployed fully to attain that objective, notably in the context of investigative duties devolving upon the Union, while the current distribution and balance of responsibilities between the Union and the Member States should be maintained.\n(3)\nTo reinforce the means available for combating fraud, while respecting the principle of each institution’s internal organisational autonomy, the Commission, by Decision 1999/352/EC, ECSC, Euratom (3), has established the European Anti-Fraud Office (‘the Office’) among its own services with responsibility for conducting administrative fraud investigations. The Commission has given the Office full independence to exercise its investigative function. Decision 1999/352/EC, ECSC, Euratom provides that for the purposes of investigations the Office is to exercise the powers conferred by Union law.\n(4)\nRegulation (EC) No 1073/1999 of the European Parliament and of the Council (4) was adopted to regulate investigations conducted by the Office. In order to make the Office’s investigative activities more effective, and in the light of the evaluations of its activities made by the Union institutions, in particular the Commission’s evaluation report of April 2003 and the Special Reports No 1/2005 (5) and No 2/2011 (6) of the Court of Auditors concerning the management of the Office, there is a need to revise the current legal framework.\n(5)\nThe Office’s mandate should comprise the conduct of investigations within the institutions, bodies, offices and agencies established by, or on the basis of, the Treaties (‘institutions, bodies, offices and agencies’) and the exercise of the power of investigation conferred on the Commission by the relevant Union acts, as well as providing the Member States with assistance from the Commission in organising close and regular cooperation between their competent authorities. The Office should also contribute to the design and development of methods for preventing and combating fraud, corruption and any other illegal activity affecting the financial interests of the Union, based on its operational practice in this field.\n(6)\nThe responsibility of the Office as set up by the Commission also extends beyond the protection of financial interests to include all activities relating to safeguarding Union interests against irregular conduct liable to result in administrative or criminal proceedings.\n(7)\nThis Regulation should apply without prejudice to more extensive protection which may derive from the provisions of the Treaties.\n(8)\nGiven the need to step up the fight against fraud, corruption and any other illegal activity affecting the financial interests of the Union, the Office should be able to conduct internal investigations in all the institutions, bodies, offices and agencies.\n(9)\nIn the context of external investigations, the Office should be entrusted with the exercise of the powers conferred on the Commission by Council Regulation (Euratom, EC) No 2185/96 of 11 November 1996 concerning on-the-spot checks and inspections carried out by the Commission in order to protect the European Communities’ financial interests against fraud and other irregularities (7). The Office should also be allowed to exercise the other powers conferred on the Commission to conduct on-the-spot checks and inspections in the Member States, notably for the purpose of detecting irregularities as required by Article 9 of Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 2988/95 of 18 December 1995 on the protection of the European Communities’ financial interests (8).\n(10)\nThe operational efficiency of the Office depends greatly on cooperation with the Member States. There is a need for the Member States to identify their competent authorities which are able to provide the Office with the assistance needed in the performance of its duties. In cases where a Member State has not set up a specialist department at national level with the task of coordinating the protection of the financial interests of the Union and the fight against fraud, a service (the anti-fraud coordination service) should be designated to facilitate effective cooperation and exchange of information with the Office.\n(11)\nThe Office should have access to any relevant information held by the institutions, bodies, offices and agencies of the Union in connection with external investigations.\n(12)\nInvestigations should be conducted in accordance with the Treaties and in particular with Protocol No 7 on the privileges and immunities of the European Union, while respecting the Staff Regulations of Officials and the Conditions of Employment of Other Servants of the European Union laid down in Council Regulation (EEC, Euratom, ECSC) No 259/68 (9) (‘the Staff Regulations’) and the Statute for Members of the European Parliament, and with full respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, in particular the principle of fairness, for the right of persons involved to express their views on the facts concerning them and for the principle that the conclusions of an investigation may be based solely on elements which have evidential value. To that end, the institutions, bodies, offices and agencies should lay down the terms and conditions under which internal investigations are to be conducted.\n(13)\nInternal investigations can be conducted only if the Office is guaranteed access to all premises of the institutions, bodies, offices and agencies and to all information and documents held by them.\n(14)\nThe accuracy of the information sent to the Office in connection with its mandate should be assessed promptly. To that end, the Office, prior to the opening of an investigation, should have access to any relevant information in databases held by the institutions, bodies, offices or agencies, when this is indispensable for assessing the basis in fact of allegations.\n(15)\nThe Office should be placed under precise obligations to inform the institutions, bodies, offices and agencies of investigations in progress where an official, other servant, member of an institution or body, head of office or agency, or staff member is concerned by the matter under investigation or where precautionary measures may be required in order to protect the financial interests of the Union.\n(16)\nClear rules should be laid down which, while confirming the priority enjoyed by the Office for conducting internal investigations on matters affecting the financial interests of the Union, enable the institutions, bodies, offices and agencies quickly to conduct such investigations in cases where the Office decides not to intervene.\n(17)\nTo ensure the independence of the Office in carrying out the tasks conferred on it by this Regulation, its Director-General should be able to open an investigation on his own initiative. Where the Office is conducting an investigation, the relevant institutions, bodies, offices or agencies should not conduct an investigation into the same facts in parallel, unless agreed otherwise with the Office.\n(18)\nInvestigations should be conducted under the authority of the Director-General, in full independence from the institutions, bodies, offices and agencies and from the Supervisory Committee. To that end, the Director-General should be able to adopt guidelines on investigation procedures for the staff of the Office. Those guidelines should provide practical guidance to the staff of the Office on the conduct of investigations and the procedural guarantees and rights of persons concerned or witnesses, and details on the internal advisory and control procedures to be followed, including a legality check. In order to provide greater transparency with regard to the conduct of investigations, those guidelines should be available to the public on the Office’s website. Those guidelines should not create or alter any rights or obligations arising under this Regulation.\n(19)\nIn accordance with Article 21 of the Staff Regulations, the staff of the Office should conduct the investigations in accordance with the guidelines on investigation procedures and on the basis of individual instructions given by the Director-General in specific cases.\n(20)\nIn accordance with the Staff Regulations, the staff of the Office should carry out their investigative tasks in full independence and should avoid conflicts of interest. Members of the staff of the Office should immediately inform the Director-General if an investigation concerns a matter in which they have any personal interest such as to impair, or to be seen as impairing, their independence, in particular if they are or have been involved in another capacity in the matter under investigation.\n(21)\nExternal and internal investigations by the Office follow, in part, distinct rules. However, the Office should be allowed, whenever necessary, to combine in one single investigation the aspects of an external and an internal investigation, without having to open two separate investigations.\n(22)\nIt is necessary, in the interests of legal certainty, to specify the procedural guarantees applicable to investigations conducted by the Office, taking into account the administrative nature of those investigations.\n(23)\nThe procedural guarantees and fundamental rights of persons concerned and of witnesses should be respected without discrimination at all times and at all stages of both external and internal investigations, in particular when information about ongoing investigations is provided. Provision of any information concerning investigations conducted by the Office to the European Parliament, the Council, the Commission or the Court of Auditors, whether bilaterally or as part of an exchange of views, should respect the confidentiality of investigations, the legitimate rights of the persons concerned and, where applicable, the national provisions governing judicial proceedings. Information transmitted or obtained during investigations should be treated in accordance with Union law on data protection. Exchanges of information should be governed by the principle of proportionality and by the need-to-know principle.\n(24)\nIn order to strengthen the protection of the individual rights of persons under investigation, conclusions referring by name to a person concerned should not be drawn, at the final stage of an investigation, without that person being given the opportunity to comment on facts concerning him.\n(25)\nThe Director-General should ensure that any information supplied to the public respects the legitimate rights of the persons concerned.\n(26)\nThe Office and the institutions, bodies, offices and agencies involved in the investigation should protect freedom of expression, in accordance with the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, and journalistic sources.\n(27)\nIt should be incumbent on the Director-General to ensure the protection of personal data and respect for confidentiality of information gathered in the course of investigations. Officials and other servants of the Union should be assured of legal protection equivalent to that provided for by the Staff Regulations.\n(28)\nTo ensure that the findings of investigations conducted by the Office are taken into account and that the requisite follow-up action is taken, the reports should have the status of admissible evidence in administrative or judicial proceedings. To that end, those reports should be drawn up in a manner compatible with the rules governing administrative reports in the Member States.\n(29)\nWhere it is found that facts brought to light by the final report on an internal investigation could give rise to criminal proceedings, the information to that effect should be transmitted to the national judicial authorities of the Member State concerned. In the recommendations accompanying the final investigation report, the Director-General should indicate whether, in the light of the nature of the facts and the scale of their financial impact, internal measures by the institution, body, office or agency concerned would allow for a more effective follow-up.\n(30)\nIn cases where the Director-General transmits to the judicial authorities of the Member State concerned information obtained by the Office in the course of internal investigations, that transmission of information should be without prejudice to subsequent classification in law by the national judicial authority as to whether investigative proceedings are required.\n(31)\nIt is for the competent authorities of the Member States or the institutions, bodies, offices or agencies, as the case may be, to decide what action should be taken on completed investigations on the basis of the final investigation reports drawn up by the Office.\n(32)\nIn order to improve its efficiency, the Office should know how the results of its investigations have been followed up. Hence, the institutions, bodies, offices and agencies of the Union and, where appropriate, the competent authorities of the Member States should report to the Office, at its request, on the action taken, if any, on the basis of the information transmitted to them by the Office.\n(33)\nIn view of the major benefits of strengthening cooperation between the Office, Eurojust, Europol and the competent authorities of the Member States, the Office should be able to conclude with them administrative arrangements which may, in particular, aim at facilitating practical cooperation and exchange of information on technical and operational matters, without creating any additional legal obligations.\n(34)\nIn order to strengthen the cooperation between the Office, Eurojust and the competent authorities of the Member States in respect of deeds which may be the subject of a criminal investigation, the Office should inform Eurojust of, in particular, those cases of suspected fraud, corruption or any other illegal activity affecting the financial interests of the Union and involving serious forms of criminality. The transmission of information to the competent authorities of the Member States concerned should occur, as appropriate, before the information provided by them is transmitted by the Office to Eurojust or Europol, where such information is accompanied by an invitation to take specific criminal investigative action.\n(35)\nFor the sake of successful cooperation between the Office, the relevant institutions, bodies, offices and agencies of the Union, the competent authorities of the Member States, the competent authorities in third countries, and international organisations, a mutual exchange of information should be organised. Such exchange of information should respect the principles of confidentiality and the rules on data protection laid down in Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 December 2000 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data by the Community institutions and bodies and on the free movement of such data (10). In particular, the Office should verify that the recipient has the appropriate competence and that the transmission of information is necessary. Exchanges of information with Eurojust should be covered by Eurojust’s mandate, which extends to coordination in transnational cases of serious crime.\n(36)\nGiven the scale of the Union funds allocated to the external-aid sector, the number of investigations carried out by the Office in that sector and the existence of international cooperation for investigation purposes, the Office should be able, where appropriate in coordination with other competent services, to seek in the performance of its tasks, by means of administrative arrangements, practical assistance from the competent authorities in third countries and from international organisations, without creating any additional legal obligations.\n(37)\nThe Office should enjoy independence in the discharge of its functions. To reinforce that independence, the Office should be subject to regular monitoring of its investigative functions by a Supervisory Committee, composed of outside independent persons who are highly qualified in the Office’s areas of activity. The Supervisory Committee should not interfere with the conduct of ongoing investigations. Its duties should also include assisting the Director-General in discharging his responsibilities.\n(38)\nIt is appropriate to specify the criteria and procedure for appointing the members of the Supervisory Committee and to further specify the tasks of the Supervisory Committee arising from its mandate.\n(39)\nA reserve list should be drawn up designating candidates who may replace members of the Supervisory Committee for the remainder of their term of office in the event that one or more of those members resigns, dies or becomes otherwise unable to perform his duties.\n(40)\nIn order to ensure that the Supervisory Committee can carry out its mission efficiently, the independent functioning of its secretariat should be guaranteed by the Office.\n(41)\nAn exchange of views should take place once a year between the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission. Such exchange of views should cover, inter alia, the strategic priorities for investigation policies and the effectiveness of the work of the Office with regard to the performance of its mandate, without in any way interfering with the independence of the Office in the conduct of its investigations. Preparation for the exchange of views should take place at technical level and should include, in so far as may be necessary, a preparatory meeting between the relevant services of the institutions concerned. When discussing the effectiveness of the work of the Office with regard to the performance of its mandate, the institutions participating in the exchange of views should be able to address statistical information concerning the follow-up given to the Office’s investigations and to the information transmitted by the Office.\n(42)\nIn order to ensure complete independence in the running of the Office, its Director-General should be appointed for a non-renewable term of seven years.\n(43)\nThe function of the Director-General of the Office is particularly important also for the European Parliament and the Council. The person appointed as Director-General should enjoy the widest possible support and recognition from the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission. The Commission should therefore seek to achieve a common accord with the European Parliament and the Council in the framework of the consultation procedure.\n(44)\nA call for applications for the post of Director-General should be published in the Official Journal of the European Union at the latest six months before the end of the term of office of the Director-General in office. The call for applications should be prepared by the Commission on the basis of the outcome of close consultations with the European Parliament and the Council. It should specify the selection criteria, including the requirements which candidates should meet in order to be eligible for the post.\n(45)\nThe Director-General should inform the Supervisory Committee periodically of those cases in which information has been transmitted to the judicial authorities of the Member States and of the total number of the Office’s cases dealt with by the same judicial authorities of the Member States in question, by way of follow-up to an investigation conducted by the Office.\n(46)\nExperience from operational practice has shown that it would be useful to allow the Director-General to delegate the exercise of certain of his functions to one or more members of the staff of the Office.\n(47)\nThe Director-General should put in place an internal advisory and control mechanism, including a legality check, with particular reference to the obligation to respect the procedural guarantees and fundamental rights of the persons concerned and the national law of the Member States concerned.\n(48)\nIn order to ensure the Office’s independence, the Commission should decide on appropriate delegations of the powers of the appointing authority to the Director-General.\n(49)\nThis Regulation in no way diminishes the powers and responsibilities of the Member States to take measures to combat fraud, corruption and any other illegal activity affecting the financial interests of the Union. Entrusting to an independent Office the task of conducting external administrative investigations in this area is accordingly in full compliance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to step up the fight against fraud, corruption and any other illegal activity affecting the financial interests of the Union.\n(50)\nThe Commission should assess the need for revision of this Regulation in the event that a European Public Prosecutor’s Office is established.\n(51)\nThis Regulation respects fundamental rights and complies, in particular, with the principles recognised in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union.\n(52)\nThe European Data Protection Supervisor has been consulted in accordance with Article 28(2) of Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 and delivered an opinion on 1 June 2011 (11).\n(53)\nGiven the substantial number of amendments necessary, Regulation (EC) No 1073/1999 should be repealed and replaced by this Regulation.\n(54)\nPursuant to Article 106a(1) of the Treaty establishing the European Atomic Energy Community (TEAEC), which extends the application of Article 325 TFEU to the European Atomic Energy Community (Euratom), the rules governing investigations conducted by the Office as regards the Union should also apply as regards Euratom. Pursuant to Article 106a(2) TEAEC, references to the Union in Article 325 TFEU must be taken as references to Euratom and references to the Union in this Regulation therefore include, when the context so requires, references to Euratom. Council Regulation (Euratom) No 1074/1999 of 25 May 1999 concerning investigations conducted by the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) (12) should therefore be repealed,\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nArticle 1\nObjectives and tasks\n1.   In order to step up the fight against fraud, corruption and any other illegal activity affecting the financial interests of the European Union and of the European Atomic Energy Community (hereinafter referred to collectively, when the context so requires, as ‘the Union’), the European Anti-Fraud Office established by Decision 1999/352/EC, ECSC, Euratom (‘the Office’) shall exercise the powers of investigation conferred on the Commission by:\n(a)\nthe relevant Union acts; and\n(b)\nthe relevant cooperation and mutual assistance agreements concluded by the Union with third countries and international organisations.\n2.   The Office shall provide the Member States with assistance from the Commission in organising close and regular cooperation between their competent authorities in order to coordinate their action aimed at protecting the financial interests of the Union against fraud. The Office shall contribute to the design and development of methods of preventing and combating fraud, corruption and any other illegal activity affecting the financial interests of the Union. The Office shall promote and coordinate, with and among the Member States, the sharing of operational experience and best procedural practices in the field of the protection of the financial interests of the Union, and shall support joint anti-fraud actions undertaken by Member States on a voluntary basis.\n3.   This Regulation shall apply without prejudice to:\n(a)\nProtocol No 7 on the privileges and immunities of the European Union attached to the Treaty on European Union and to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union;\n(b)\nthe Statute for Members of the European Parliament;\n(c)\nthe Staff Regulations;\n(d)\nRegulation (EC) No 45/2001.\n4.   Within the institutions, bodies, offices and agencies established by, or on the basis of, the Treaties (‘institutions, bodies, offices and agencies’), the Office shall conduct administrative investigations for the purpose of fighting fraud, corruption and any other illegal activity affecting the financial interests of the Union. To that end, it shall investigate serious matters relating to the discharge of professional duties constituting a dereliction of the obligations of officials and other servants of the Union liable to result in disciplinary or, as the case may be, criminal proceedings, or an equivalent failure to discharge obligations on the part of members of institutions and bodies, heads of offices and agencies or staff members of institutions, bodies, offices or agencies not subject to the Staff Regulations (hereinafter collectively referred to as ‘officials, other servants, members of institutions or bodies, heads of offices or agencies, or staff members’).\n5.   For the application of this Regulation, competent authorities of the Member States and institutions, bodies, offices or agencies may establish administrative arrangements with the Office. Those administrative arrangements may concern, in particular, the transmission of information and the conduct of investigations.\nArticle 2\nDefinitions\nFor the purposes of this Regulation:\n(1)\n‘financial interests of the Union’ shall include revenues, expenditures and assets covered by the budget of the European Union and those covered by the budgets of the institutions, bodies, offices and agencies and the budgets managed and monitored by them;\n(2)\n‘irregularity’ shall mean ‘irregularity’ as defined in Article 1(2) of Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 2988/95;\n(3)\n‘fraud, corruption and any other illegal activity affecting the financial interests of the Union’ shall have the meaning applied to those words in the relevant Union acts;\n(4)\n‘administrative investigations’ (‘investigations’) shall mean any inspection, check or other measure undertaken by the Office in accordance with Articles 3 and 4, with a view to achieving the objectives set out in Article 1 and to establishing, where necessary, the irregular nature of the activities under investigation; those investigations shall not affect the powers of the competent authorities of the Member States to initiate criminal proceedings;\n(5)\n‘person concerned’ shall mean any person or economic operator suspected of having committed fraud, corruption or any other illegal activity affecting the financial interests of the Union and who is therefore subject to investigation by the Office;\n(6)\n‘economic operator’ shall have the meaning applied to that term by Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 2988/95 and Regulation (Euratom, EC) No 2185/96;\n(7)\n‘administrative arrangements’ shall mean arrangements of a technical and/or operational nature concluded by the Office, which may in particular aim at facilitating the cooperation and the exchange of information between the parties thereto, and which do not create additional legal obligations.\nArticle 3\nExternal investigations\n1.   The Office shall exercise the power conferred on the Commission by Regulation (Euratom, EC) No 2185/96 to carry out on-the-spot checks and inspections in the Member States and, in accordance with the cooperation and mutual assistance agreements and any other legal instrument in force, in third countries and on the premises of international organisations.\nAs part of its investigative function, the Office shall carry out the checks and inspections provided for in Article 9(1) of Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 2988/95 and in the sectoral rules referred to in Article 9(2) of that Regulation in the Member States and, in accordance with the cooperation and mutual assistance agreements and any other legal instrument in force, in third countries and on the premises of international organisations.\n2.   With a view to establishing whether there has been fraud, corruption or any other illegal activity affecting the financial interests of the Union in connection with a grant agreement or decision or a contract concerning Union funding, the Office may, in accordance with the provisions and procedures laid down by Regulation (Euratom, EC) No 2185/96, conduct on-the-spot checks and inspections on economic operators.\n3.   During on-the-spot checks and inspections, the staff of the Office shall act, subject to the Union law applicable, in compliance with the rules and practices of the Member State concerned and with the procedural guarantees provided for in this Regulation.\nAt the request of the Office, the competent authority of the Member State concerned shall provide the staff of the Office with the assistance needed in order to carry out their tasks effectively, as specified in the written authorisation referred to in Article 7(2). If that assistance requires authorisation from a judicial authority in accordance with national rules, such authorisation shall be applied for.\nThe Member State concerned shall ensure, in accordance with Regulation (Euratom, EC) No 2185/96, that the staff of the Office are allowed access, under the same terms and conditions as its competent authorities and in compliance with its national law, to all information and documents relating to the matter under investigation which prove necessary in order for the on-the-spot checks and inspections to be carried out effectively and efficiently.\n4.   Member States shall, for the purposes of this Regulation, designate a service (‘the anti-fraud coordination service’) to facilitate effective cooperation and exchange of information, including information of an operational nature, with the Office. Where appropriate, in accordance with national law, the anti-fraud coordination service may be regarded as a competent authority for the purposes of this Regulation.\n5.   During an external investigation, the Office may have access to any relevant information, including information in databases, held by the institutions, bodies, offices and agencies, connected with the matter under investigation, where necessary in order to establish whether there has been fraud, corruption or any other illegal activity affecting the financial interests of the Union. For that purpose Article 4(2) and (4) shall apply.\n6.   Where, before a decision has been taken whether or not to open an external investigation, the Office handles information which suggests that there has been fraud, corruption or any other illegal activity affecting the financial interests of the Union, it may inform the competent authorities of the Member States concerned and, where necessary, the competent Commission services.\nWithout prejudice to the sectoral rules referred to in Article 9(2) of Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 2988/95, the competent authorities of the Member States concerned shall ensure that appropriate action is taken, in which the Office may take part, in compliance with national law. Upon request, the competent authorities of the Member States concerned shall inform the Office of the action taken and of their findings on the basis of information as referred to in the first subparagraph of this paragraph.\nArticle 4\nInternal investigations\n1.   In the areas referred to in Article 1, the Office shall carry out administrative investigations within the institutions, bodies, offices and agencies (‘internal investigations’).\nThose internal investigations shall be conducted in accordance with the conditions set out in this Regulation and in the decisions adopted by the respective institution, body, office or agency.\n2.   Provided that the provisions referred to in paragraph 1 are complied with:\n(a)\nthe Office shall have the right of immediate and unannounced access to any relevant information, including information in databases, held by the institutions, bodies, offices and agencies, and to their premises. The Office shall be empowered to inspect the accounts of the institutions, bodies, offices and agencies. The Office may take a copy of, and obtain extracts from, any document or the contents of any data medium held by the institutions, bodies, offices and agencies and, if necessary, assume custody of such documents or data to ensure that there is no danger of their disappearance;\n(b)\nthe Office may request oral information, including through interviews, and written information from officials, other servants, members of institutions or bodies, heads of offices or agencies, or staff members.\n3.   In accordance with the provisions and procedures laid down by Regulation (Euratom, EC) No 2185/96, the Office may carry out on-the-spot checks and inspections at the premises of economic operators in order to obtain access to information relevant to the matter under internal investigation.\n4.   The institutions, bodies, offices and agencies shall be informed whenever the staff of the Office conduct an internal investigation on their premises or consult a document or request information held by them. Without prejudice to Articles 10 and 11, the Office may at any time forward to the institution, body, office or agency concerned the information obtained in the course of internal investigations.\n5.   The institutions, bodies, offices and agencies shall put in place appropriate procedures and take necessary measures to ensure at all stages the confidentiality of internal investigations.\n6.   Where internal investigations reveal that an official, other servant, member of an institution or body, head of office or agency, or staff member may be a person concerned, the institution, body, office or agency to which that person belongs shall be informed.\nIn cases where the confidentiality of the internal investigation cannot be ensured using the usual channels of communication, the Office shall use appropriate alternative channels for transmitting information.\nIn exceptional cases, the provision of such information may be deferred on the basis of a reasoned decision by the Director-General, which shall be transmitted to the Supervisory Committee after the closure of the investigation.\n7.   The decision to be adopted by each institution, body, office or agency as provided for in paragraph 1 shall include, in particular, a rule concerning a duty on the part of officials, other servants, members of institutions or bodies, heads of offices or agencies, or staff members to cooperate with and supply information to the Office, while ensuring the confidentiality of the internal investigation.\n8.   Where, before a decision has been taken whether or not to open an internal investigation, the Office handles information which suggests that there has been fraud, corruption or any other illegal activity affecting the financial interests of the Union, it may inform the institution, body, office or agency concerned. Upon request, the institution, body, office or agency concerned shall inform the Office of any action taken and of its findings on the basis of such information.\nWhere necessary, the Office shall also inform the competent authorities of the Member State concerned. In this case, the procedural requirements laid down in the second and third subparagraphs of Article 9(4) shall apply. If the competent authorities decide to take any action on the basis of the information transmitted to them, in accordance with national law, they shall, upon request, inform the Office thereof.\nArticle 5\nOpening of investigations\n1.   The Director-General may open an investigation when there is a sufficient suspicion, which may also be based on information provided by any third party or anonymous information, that there has been fraud, corruption or any other illegal activity affecting the financial interests of the Union. The decision by the Director-General whether or not to open an investigation shall take into account the investigation policy priorities and the annual management plan of the Office established in accordance with Article 17(5). That decision shall also take into account the need for efficient use of the Office’s resources and for proportionality of the means employed. With regard to internal investigations, specific account shall be taken of the institution, body, office or agency best placed to conduct them, based, in particular, on the nature of the facts, the actual or potential financial impact of the case, and the likelihood of any judicial follow-up.\n2.   The decision to open an external investigation shall be taken by the Director-General, acting on his own initiative or following a request from a Member State concerned or any institution, body, office or agency of the Union.\nThe decision to open an internal investigation shall be taken by the Director-General, acting on his own initiative or following a request from the institution, body, office or agency within which the investigation is to be conducted or from a Member State.\n3.   While the Director-General is considering whether or not to open an internal investigation following a request as referred to in paragraph 2, and/or while the Office is conducting an internal investigation, the institutions, bodies, offices or agencies concerned shall not open a parallel investigation into the same facts, unless agreed otherwise with the Office.\n4.   Within two months of receipt by the Office of a request as referred to in paragraph 2, a decision whether or not to open an investigation shall be taken. It shall be communicated without delay to the Member State, institution, body, office or agency which made the request. Reasons shall be given for a decision not to open an investigation. If, on the expiry of that period of two months, the Office has not taken any decision, the Office shall be deemed to have decided not to open an investigation.\nWhere an official, other servant, member of an institution or body, head of office or agency, or staff member, acting in accordance with Article 22a of the Staff Regulations, provides information to the Office relating to a suspected fraud or irregularity, the Office shall inform that person of the decision whether or not to open an investigation in relation to the facts in question.\n5.   If the Director-General decides not to open an internal investigation, he may without delay send any relevant information to the institution, body, office or agency concerned for appropriate action to be taken in accordance with the rules applicable to that institution, body, office or agency. The Office shall agree with that institution, body, office or agency, if appropriate, on suitable measures to protect the confidentiality of the source of that information and shall, if necessary, ask to be informed of the action taken.\n6.   If the Director-General decides not to open an external investigation, he may without delay send any relevant information to the competent authorities of the Member State concerned for action to be taken where appropriate, in accordance with its national rules.

The invitation shall include a list of the rights of the person concerned, in particular the right to be assisted by a person of his choice.\nThe invitation to an interview shall be sent to a witness with at least 24 hours’ notice.

The Office shall give the person concerned a copy of the record of the interview.\n3.   As soon as an investigation reveals that an official, other servant, member of an institution or body, head of office or agency, or staff member may be a person concerned, that official, other servant, member of an institution or body, head of office or agency, or staff member shall be informed to that effect, provided that this does not prejudice the conduct of the investigation or of any investigative proceedings falling within the remit of a national judicial authority.\n4.   Without prejudice to Articles 4(6) and 7(6), once the investigation has been completed and before conclusions referring by name to a person concerned are drawn up, that person shall be given the opportunity to comment on facts concerning him.\nTo that end, the Office shall send the person concerned an invitation to comment either in writing or at an interview with staff designated by the Office. That invitation shall include a summary of the facts concerning the person concerned and the information required by Articles 11 and 12 of Regulation (EC) No 45/2001, and shall indicate the time-limit for submitting comments, which shall not be less than 10 working days from receipt of the invitation to comment.

Any person interviewed shall be entitled to use any of the official languages of the institutions of the Union. However, officials or other servants of the Union may be required to use an official language of the institutions of the Union of which they have a thorough knowledge.\nArticle 10\nConfidentiality and data protection\n1.

The Office may designate a Data Protection Officer in accordance with Article 24 of Regulation (EC) No 45/2001.\n5.

On completion of an investigation by the Office, a report shall be drawn up, under the authority of the Director-General. That report shall give an account of the legal basis for the investigation, the procedural steps followed, the facts established and their preliminary classification in law, the estimated financial impact of the facts established, the respect of the procedural guarantees in accordance with Article 9 and the conclusions of the investigation.\nThe report shall be accompanied by recommendations of the Director-General on whether or not action should be taken. Those recommendations shall, where appropriate, indicate any disciplinary, administrative, financial and/or judicial action by the institutions, bodies, offices and agencies and by the competent authorities of the Member States concerned, and shall specify in particular the estimated amounts to be recovered, as well as the preliminary classification in law of the facts established.\n2.   In drawing up such reports and recommendations, account shall be taken of the national law of the Member State concerned. Reports drawn up on that basis shall constitute admissible evidence in administrative or judicial proceedings of the Member State in which their use proves necessary, in the same way and under the same conditions as administrative reports drawn up by national administrative inspectors. They shall be subject to the same evaluation rules as those applicable to administrative reports drawn up by national administrative inspectors and shall have the same evidentiary value as such reports.\n3.   Reports and recommendations drawn up following an external investigation and any relevant related documents shall be sent to the competent authorities of the Member States concerned in accordance with the rules relating to external investigations and, if necessary, to the competent Commission services.\n4.

Where the report drawn up following an internal investigation reveals the existence of facts which could give rise to criminal proceedings, that information shall be transmitted to the judicial authorities of the Member State concerned.\n6.   At the request of the Office, the competent authorities of the Member States concerned shall, in due time, send to the Office information on action taken, if any, following the transmission by the Director-General of his recommendations in accordance with paragraph 3, and following the transmission by the Office of any information in accordance with paragraph 5.\n7.   Without prejudice to paragraph 4, if, on completion of an investigation, no evidence has been found against the person concerned, the Director-General shall close the investigation regarding that person and inform that person within 10 working days.\n8.   Where an informant who has provided the Office with information leading or relating to an investigation so requests, the Office may notify that informant that the investigation has been closed. The Office may, however, refuse any such request if it considers that it is such as to prejudice the legitimate interests of the person concerned, the effectiveness of the investigation and of the action to be taken subsequent thereto, or any confidentiality requirements.\nArticle 12\nExchange of information between the Office and the competent authorities of the Member States\n1.   Without prejudice to Articles 10 and 11 of this Regulation and to the provisions of Regulation (Euratom, EC) No 2185/96, the Office may transmit to the competent authorities of the Member States concerned information obtained in the course of external investigations in due time to enable them to take appropriate action in accordance with their national law.\n2.

rules\nSUMMARY OF:\nRegulation (EU, Euratom) No 883/2013 concerning investigations conducted by the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF)\nRegulation (EU, Euratom) 2020/2223 amending Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 883/2013, as regards cooperation with the European Public Prosecutor’s Office and the effectiveness of the European Anti-Fraud Office investigations\nWHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATIONS?\n              \nRegulation (EU, Euratom) No 883/2013 aims to:\nreinforce the independence of the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF), set up under Decision 1999/352/EC, ECSC, Euratom to combat fraud, corruption and any illegal activity which could harm the EU’s financial interests*;\nmake OLAF investigations more effective;\nimprove cooperation between the different institutions and bodies involved;\nstrengthen the rights of individuals covered by investigations.\nAmending Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2020/2223 seeks to:\nadapt the operation of OLAF to the establishment of the European Public Prosecutor’s Office (EPPO), set up under Regulation (EU) 2017/1939 (see summary) to ensure maximum complementarity; and\nenhance the effectiveness of OLAF’s investigative function as regards a number of specific issues, including: new rules for carrying out on-the-spot checks and inspectionsaccess to bank account informationestablishing a controller of procedural guaranteesaccess to the final report by the person concernedthe strengthened role of the anti-fraud coordination services in the EU countries andnew rules to improve the follow-up of investigations.\nKEY POINTS\nOLAF:\nconducts internal and external investigations;\nprovides assistance to EPPO based on close cooperation, exchange of information, complementarity and avoidance of duplication;\nhelps EU countries to organise close cooperation between their anti-fraud authorities;\ndevelops EU anti-fraud policies as a European Commission service;\ncontributes to the design and development of anti-fraud and anti-corruption strategies to protect the EU’s financial interests;\npromotes and coordinates sharing of operational experience and best procedural practices;\nparticipates, where necessary, in joint investigation teams;\nsupports joint national anti-fraud activities.\nInternal investigations\nOLAF:\ncarries out administrative investigations within EU institutions, bodies, offices and agencies, and at the premises of economic operators*;\nenjoys immediate and unannounced access to any relevant information and data, relating to the matter under investigation;\nmay request oral and written information from officials, other staff and heads of offices and agencies;\ninforms the institutions, bodies, offices and agencies if an investigation concerns their employees and consults them, where necessary, if precautionary administrative measures should be taken to protect the EU’s financial interests.\nAmending Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2020/2223 allows OLAF, during its investigations, access to privately owned devices used for work purposes, if OLAF has reasonable grounds for suspecting that their content may be relevant for the investigation. Access would be based on internal rules to be adopted by each institution, body, office or agency concerned in respect of its staff and members.\nExternal investigations\nOLAF:\ncarries out on-the-spot checks and inspections and other investigative activities in EU countries, non-EU countries, the premises of international organisations and on economic operators, according to the rules laid down in Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 883/2013 and Regulation (Euratom, EC) No 2185/96, and to the terms of cooperation and mutual assistance agreements;\nmay transmit to EU countries’ competent national authorities information about fraud, corruption or any other illegal activity affecting the EU’s financial interests to enable them to take appropriate action.\nUnder amending Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2020/2223, in external investigations, access to privately owned devices used for work purposes would take place under the same conditions and to the same extent as they do for national authorities in the relevant country.\nInvestigations procedure\nOLAF’s director-general:\ndecides whether, if there is sufficient suspicion, to open an external or internal investigation, either on the director-general’s own initiative or following a request from an EU institution, body, office or agency, or from an EU country;\nmay send any relevant information to the EU institution, body, office or agency or the EU country concerned if the director-general decides not to open an investigation;\ndirects the conduct of investigations on the basis of written instructions, where appropriate;\nreports to the Supervisory Committee if an investigation cannot be closed within 12 months and every 6 months thereafter;\nmay transmit to national judicial authorities any information obtained during an internal investigation coming under their jurisdiction.\nOLAF staff:\nconducts investigations objectively and impartially, respecting the regulation’s procedural guarantees and the presumption of innocence;\nseeks evidence for and against the person concerned;\nmay, with suitable notice, interview an individual or a witness any time during the investigation — this person has the right to avoid self-incrimination and to be assisted by a person of choice;\nwrites up a record of the interview and gives a copy to the interviewee;\nprovides the person concerned with an opportunity to comment on facts concerning them;\ntreats all information transmitted or obtained during external and internal investigations as confidential;\ncooperates with EPPO, Eurojust, Europol and competent authorities of the EU countries, non-EU countries and international organisations.\nAccess to bank account information\nUnder amending Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2020/2223, OLAF’s investigative powers are strengthened. OLAF can request information on bank accounts and, where strictly necessary, on transactions, with the cooperation of national authorities. This would be under the same conditions as those applicable to competent national authorities and subject to a written request explaining its appropriateness and proportionality.\nController of procedural guarantees\nThe independent position of controller of procedural guarantees is created under amending Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2020/2223. Administratively attached to the Supervisory Committee, the controller would be responsible for handling complaints from the persons concerned and could make recommendations to OLAF on how to resolve the problem raised in the complaint.\nClose collaboration between OLAF and EPPO\nOLAF and EPPO have complementary roles in protecting the EU’s financial interests and will work in close cooperation. Under amending Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2020/2223, OLAF remains an administrative body conducting administrative investigations, which may lead to financial, administrative, disciplinary and judicial recommendations, EPPO’s mandate, which covers 22 of the 27 EU countries, focuses on criminal investigations to establish the criminal responsibility of persons involved in fraud, corruption or other criminal offences affecting the EU’s financial interests falling under its competence.\nWhen acting in support of EPPO and to protect the admissibility of evidence, as well as fundamental rights and procedural guarantees, EPPO and OLAF must cooperate closely to ensure that procedural safeguards of Regulation (EU) 2017/1939 are observed.\nFinal report\nDrawn up under the director-general’s authority upon completion of the investigation, the final report:\ncontains: the legal basis for the investigationprocedural steps followed and guarantees respectedfacts established and their preliminary classification in lawestimated financial impact andconclusions of the investigation;\nis accompanied, where appropriate, by the director-general’s recommendations on whether or not action, whether disciplinary, administrative, financial or judicial, should be taken and estimated amounts should be recovered;\nis sent to the EU country or the institution, body, office or agency concerned.\nEU countries:\nestablish an anti-fraud coordination service (AFCOS) to facilitate effective cooperation and the sharing of information with OLAF;\nprovide or coordinate the necessary assistance for OLAF to carry out its tasks effectively.\nEU institutions, bodies, offices and agencies:\nadopt rules requiring their staff to cooperate with and supply information to OLAF;\nensure the confidentiality of internal investigations;\nmay not begin a parallel inquiry into the same facts when the OLAF director-general has opened or is considering opening an investigation;\nsend OLAF, without delay, any information on possible cases of fraud, corruption or other illegal financial activity.\nRepeal\nRegulation (EU, Euratom) No 883/2013 repeals Regulation (EC) No 1073/1999 and Regulation (Euratom) No 1074/1999.\nFROM WHEN DO THE REGULATIONS APPLY?\nRegulation (EU, Euratom) No 883/2013 has applied since 1 October 2013.\nAmending Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2020/2223 entered into force on 17 January 2021.\nBACKGROUND\n              \nFor more information, see:\nEuropean Anti-Fraud Office (European Commission).\nKEY TERMS\n              \nFinancial interests: revenues, expenditure and assets covered by the EU budget.\nEconomic operator: businesses or other organisations, such as suppliers and contractors, providing goods, work or services.\nMAIN DOCUMENTS\n            \nRegulation (EU, Euratom) No 883/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 September 2013 concerning investigations conducted by the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) and repealing Regulation (EC) No 1073/1999 of the European Parliament and of the Council and Council Regulation (Euratom) No 1074/1999 (OJ L 248, 18.9.2013, pp. 1-22)\nSuccessive amendments to Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 883/2013 have been incorporated into the original text.
