whereas the Warsaw Convention is applied worldwide for the benefit of both passengers and air carriers;(3) Whereas the limit set on liability by the Warsaw Convention is too low by today's economic and social standards and often leads to lengthy legal actions which damage the image of air transport; whereas as a result Member States have variously increased the liability limit, thereby leading to different terms and conditions of carriage in the internal aviation market;(4) Whereas in addition the Warsaw Convention applies only to international transport; whereas, in the internal aviation market, the distinction between national and international transport has been eliminated; whereas it is therefore appropriate to have the same level and nature of liability in both national and international transport;(5) Whereas a full review and revision of the Warsaw Convention is long overdue and would represent, in the long term, a more uniform and applicable response, at an international level, to the issue of air carrier liability in the event of accidents; whereas efforts to increase the limits of liability imposed in the Warsaw Convention should continue through negotiation at multilateral level;(6) Whereas, in compliance with the principle of subsidiarity, action at Community level is desirable in order to achieve harmonization in the field of air carrier liability and could serve as a guideline for improved passenger protection on a global scale;(7) Whereas it is appropriate to remove all monetary limits of liability within the meaning of Article 22 (1) of the Warsaw Convention or any other legal or contractual limits, in accordance with present trends at international level;(8) Whereas, in order to avoid situations where victims of accidents are not compensated, Community air carriers should not, with respect of any claim arising out of the death, wounding or other bodily injury of a passenger under Article 17 of the Warsaw Convention, avail themselves of any defence under Article 20 (1) of the Warsaw Convention up to a certain limit;(9) Whereas Community air carriers may be exonerated from their liability in cases of contributory negligence of the passenger concerned;(10) Whereas it is necessary to clarify the obligations of this Regulation in the light of Article 7 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2407/92 of 23 July 1992 on licensing of air carriers (4); whereas, in this regard, Community air carriers should be insured up to a certain limit laid down in this Regulation;(11) Whereas Community air carriers should always be entitled to claim against third parties;(12) Whereas prompt advance payments can considerably assist the injured passengers or natural persons entitled to compensation in meeting the immediate costs following an air accident;(13) Whereas the rules on the nature and limitation of liability in the event of death, wounding or any other bodily injury suffered by a passenger form part of the terms and conditions of carriage in the air transport contract between carrier and passenger; whereas, in order to reduce the risk of distorting competition, third-country carriers should adequately inform passengers of their conditions of carriage;(14) Whereas it is appropriate and necessary that the monetary limits expressed in this Regulation be reviewed in order to take into account economic developments and developments in international fora;(15) Whereas the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) is at present engaged in a review of the Warsaw Convention; whereas, pending the outcome of such review, actions on an interim basis by the Community will enhance the protection of passengers; whereas the Council should review this Regulation as soon as possible after the review by ICAO,HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:Article 1 This Regulation lays down the obligations of Community air carriers in relation to liability in the event of accidents to passengers for damage sustained in the event of death or wounding of a passenger or any other bodily injury suffered by a passenger, if the accident which caused the damage so sustained took place on board an aircraft or in the course of any of the operations of embarking or disembarking.This Regulation also clarifies some insurance requirements for Community air carriers.In addition, this Regulation sets down some requirements on information to be provided by air carriers established outside the Community which operate to, from or within the Community.Article 2 1. For the purpose of this Regulation:(a) 'air carrier` shall mean an air transport undertaking with a valid operating licence;(b) 'Community air carrier` shall mean an air carrier with a valid operating licence granted by a Member State in accordance with the provisions of Regulation (EEC) No 2407/92;(c) 'person entitled to compensation` shall mean a passenger or any person entitled to claim in respect of that passenger, in accordance with applicable law;(d) 'ecu` shall mean the unit of account in drawing up the general budget of the European Communities in accordance with Articles 207 and 209 of the Treaty;(e) 'SDR` shall mean a Special Drawing Right as defined by the International Monetary Fund;(f) 'Warsaw Convention` shall mean the Convention for the Unification of Certain Rules Relating to International Carriage by Air, signed at Warsaw on 12 October 1929, or the Warsaw Convention as amended at The Hague on 28 September 1955 and the Convention supplementary to the Warsaw Convention done at Guadalajara on 18 September 1961 - whichever is applicable to the passenger contract of carriage, together with all international instruments which supplement, and are associated with, it and are in force.2. Concepts contained in this Regulation which are not defined in paragraph 1 shall be equivalent to those used in the Warsaw Convention.Article 3 1. (a) The liability of a Community air carrier for damages sustained in the event of death, wounding or any other bodily injury by a passenger in the event of an accident shall not be subject to any financial limit, be it defined by law, convention or contract.(b) The obligation of insurance set out in Article 7 of Regulation (EEC) No 2407/92 shall be understood as requiring that a Community air carrier shall be insured up to the limit of the liability required under paragraph 2 and thereafter up to a reasonable level.2. For any damages up to the sum of the equivalent in ecus of 100 000 SDR, the Community air carrier shall not exclude or limit his liability by proving that he and his agents have taken all necessary measures to avoid the damage or that it was impossible for him or them to take such measures.3. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 2, if the Community air carrier proves that the damage was caused by, or contributed to by, the negligence of the injured or deceased passenger, the carrier may be exonerated wholly or partly from its liability in accordance with applicable law.Article 4 In the event of death, wounding or any other bodily injury suffered by a passenger in the event of an accident, nothing in this Regulation shall(a) imply that a Community air carrier is the sole party liable to pay damages; or(b) restrict any rights of a Community air carrier to seek contribution or indemnity from any other party in accordance with applicable law.Article 5 1. The Community air carrier shall without delay, and in any event not later than fifteen days after the identity of the natural person entitled to compensation has been established, make such advance payments as may be required to meet immediate economic needs on a basis proportional to the hardship suffered.2. Without prejudice to paragraph 1, an advance payment shall not be less than the equivalent in ecus of 15 000 SDR per passanger in the event of death.3. An advance payment shall not constitute recognition of liability and may be offset against any subsequent sums paid on the basis of Community air carrier liability, but is not returnable, except in the cases prescribed in Article 3 (3) or in circumstances where it is subsequently proved that the person who received the advance payment caused, or contributed to, the damage by negligence or was not the person entitled to compensation.Article 6 1. The provisions contained in Articles 3 and 5 shall be included in the Community air carrier's conditions of carriage.2. Adequate information on the provisions contained in Articles 3 and 5 shall, on request, be available to passengers at the Community air carrier's agencies, travel agencies and check-in counters and at points of sale. The ticket document or an equivalent shall contain a summary of the requirements in plain and intelligible language.3. Air carriers established outside the Community operating to, from or within the Community and not applying the provisions referred to in Articles 3 and 5 shall expressly and clearly inform the passengers thereof, at the time of purchase of the ticket at the carrier's agencies, travel agencies or check-in counters located in the territory of a Member State. Air carriers shall provide the passengers with a form setting out their conditions. The fact that only a liability limit is indicated on the ticket document or an equivalent shall not constitute sufficient information.Article 7 No later than two years after the entry into force of this Regulation, the Commission shall draw up a report on the application of the Regulation which, inter alia, takes into account economic developments and developments in international fora. Such report may be accompanied by proposals for a revision of this Regulation.Article 8 This Regulation shall enter into force one year after the date of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.Done at Luxembourg, 9 October 1997.For the CouncilThe PresidentM.

The 2002 amending regulation brought the original regulation into line with the new international rules in the Montreal Convention, to additionally include baggage and delay liability issues.\nKEY POINTS\nAir carrier liability for passengers and their baggage\nThe regulation summarises the liability rules applied by EU air carriers under EU legislation and the Montreal Convention, and EU Member States’ national legislation. Compensation is expressed as the approximate value in local currency of special drawing rights (SDRs)*.\nInsurance and passenger notification\nEU air carriers must:\nbe insured up to a sufficient level that is adequate for all persons entitled to compensation to receive the full amount to which they are entitled under the regulation;\nensure that a summary of the main provisions governing liability for passengers and their baggage is available to passengers at all points of sale, including by telephone and via the internet;\nuse a notice based on the annex to the regulation.\nEU air carriers must also provide each passenger with a written indication of the carrier's liability limit for the flight in respect of:\ndeath or injury;\ndestruction, loss of or damage to baggage; and\ndamage caused by delay.\nThe above limits are those established by this regulation unless the air carrier voluntarily applies higher limits. For carriage by non-EU air carriers, these requirements apply only to flights to, from or within the EU.\nCompensation in the case of death or injury\nThere are no financial limits to the liability for passenger injury or death. For damages up to 100,000 SDRs, the air carrier cannot contest claims for compensation. Above that amount, the air carrier can defend itself against a claim by proving it was not negligent or otherwise at fault.\nAdvance payments\nIf a passenger is killed or injured, the air carrier must make an advance payment, to cover immediate needs, within 15 days of the person being identified, under the following conditions.\nIn the event of death, this advance payment must not be less than 16,000 SDRs.\nAn advance payment does not constitute recognition of liability and can be offset against any subsequent sums paid for air carrier liability.\nIt is not returnable unless the carrier proves that the damage was caused or contributed to by the negligence or omission of the person claiming compensation, or where the person who received the advance payment was not entitled to it.\nPassenger delays\nIf a passenger is delayed, the air carrier is liable for damage unless it took all possible reasonable steps to avoid the damage. Liability is limited to 4,150 SDRs.\nBaggage delays\nIf baggage is delayed, the air carrier is liable for damage unless it took all possible reasonable measures to avoid it. Liability is limited to 1,000 SDRs.\nDestruction, loss or damage to baggage\nThe air carrier is liable for the destruction of, loss of or damage to baggage, liability is up to 1,000 SDRs. For checked baggage, it is liable even if it is not at fault, unless the baggage was defective. For unchecked baggage, the carrier is liable only if it is at fault.\nHigher limits for baggage\nPassengers can benefit from a higher liability limit by making a special declaration at the latest at check-in and by paying a supplementary fee. The fee must reflect the additional costs above those for baggage valued within the liability limit. The tariff must be made available on request.\nComplaints on baggage\nIf checked baggage is damaged, delayed, lost or destroyed, the passenger must write and complain to the air carrier as soon as possible, within 7 days for damage and 21 days for delay following receipt.\nAny court action must be brought within 2 years from the date of arrival of the aircraft, or from the date on which the aircraft was due to arrive.\nFROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?\n              \nIt has applied since 17 October 1998.\nBACKGROUND\n              \nFor further information, see:\nAviation safety policy in Europe (European Commission).\nKEY TERMS\n              \nSpecial drawing rights. A potential claim on the freely usable currencies of international monetary fund members. SDRs can be exchanged for those currencies (as defined by the international monetary fund).\nMAIN DOCUMENT\n            \nCouncil Regulation (EC) No 2027/97 of 9 October 1997 on air carrier liability in the event of accidents (OJ L 285, 17.10.1997, pp. 1–3).\nSuccessive amendments to Regulation (EC) No 2027/97 have been incorporated in the original text.
