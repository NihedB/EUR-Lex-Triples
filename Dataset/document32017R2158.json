It defines ‘food hygiene’ as a set of measures and conditions necessary to control hazards and to ensure fitness for human consumption of a foodstuff taking into account its intended use. Food safety hazards occur when food is exposed to hazardous agents which result in contamination of that food. Food hazards may be biological, chemical or physical.\n(2)\nAcrylamide is a contaminant as defined in Council Regulation (EEC) No 315/93 (2) and as such, it is a chemical hazard in the food chain.\n(3)\nAcrylamide is a low molecular weight, highly water soluble, organic compound which forms from the naturally occurring constituents asparagine and sugars in certain foods when prepared at temperatures typically higher than 120 °C and low moisture. It forms mainly in baked or fried carbohydrate-rich foods where raw materials contain its precursors, such as cereals, potatoes and coffee beans.\n(4)\nAs the acrylamide levels in some foodstuffs appear to be significantly higher than the levels in comparable products of the same product category, a Commission Recommendation 2013/647/EU (3) invited Member States' competent authorities to carry out investigations in the production and processing methods used by food business operators if the acrylamide level found in a specific foodstuff exceeded the indicative values set out in the Annex to that Recommendation.\n(5)\nIn 2015 the Scientific Panel on Contaminants in the Food Chain (CONTAM) of the European Food Safety Authority (‘the Authority’) adopted an opinion on acrylamide in food (4). Based on animal studies, the Authority confirms previous evaluations that acrylamide in food potentially increases the risk of developing cancer for consumers in all age groups. Since acrylamide is present in a wide range of everyday foods, this concern applies to all consumers but children are the most exposed age group on a body weight basis. Possible harmful effects of acrylamide on the nervous system, pre- and post-natal development and male reproduction were not considered to be a concern, based on current levels of dietary exposure. The current levels of dietary exposure to acrylamide across age groups indicate a concern with respect to its carcinogenic effects.\n(6)\nGiven the Authority's conclusions with respect to carcinogenic effects of acrylamide and in the absence of any consistent and mandatory measures to be applied by food businesses in order to lower levels of acrylamide, it is necessary to ensure food safety and to reduce the presence of acrylamide in foodstuffs where raw materials contain its precursors by laying down appropriate mitigation measures. The levels of acrylamide can be lowered by mitigation approach, such as implementation of good hygiene practice and application of procedures based on hazard analysis and critical control point (HACCP) principles.\n(7)\nIn accordance with Article 4 of Regulation (EC) No 852/2004, food business operators are to follow the procedures necessary to meet targets set to achieve the objectives of that Regulation and to employ sampling and analysis as appropriate to maintain their own performance. In that respect, the setting of targets, such as benchmark levels, may guide the implementation of hygiene rules, while ensuring the reduction of the level of exposure to certain hazards. Mitigation measures would lower the presence of acrylamide in food. In order to check the compliance with the benchmark levels the effectiveness of mitigation measures should be verified through sampling and analysis.\n(8)\nIt is therefore appropriate to establish mitigation measures which identify food processing steps susceptible to the formation of acrylamide in foods and set out activities to reduce the levels of acrylamide in those foodstuffs.\n(9)\nThe mitigation measures set out in this Regulation are based on current scientific and technical knowledge and they have proven to result in lower levels of acrylamide without adversely affecting the quality and microbial safety of the product. Those mitigation measures have been established following extensive consultation of organisations representing affected food business operators, consumers and experts from competent authorities of Member States. Where the mitigation measures include the use of food additives and other substances, the food additives and other substances should be used in accordance with their authorisation of use.\n(10)\nBenchmark levels are performance indicators to be used to verify the effectiveness of the mitigation measures and are based on experience and occurrence for broad food categories. They should be established at a level as low as reasonably achievable with the application of all relevant mitigation measures. The benchmark levels should be determined taking into account the most recent occurrence data from the Authority's database, whereby it is assumed that within a broad food category, the level of acrylamide in 10 % to 15 % of the production with the highest levels can usually be lowered by applying good practices. It is acknowledged that the specified food categories are in certain cases broad and that for specific foods within such a broad food category there may be specific production, geographic or seasonal conditions or product characteristics for which it is not possible to achieve the benchmark levels despite the application of all mitigation measures. In such situations, the food business operator should be able to show the evidence that he applied the relevant mitigation measures.\n(11)\nThe benchmark levels should be regularly reviewed by the Commission with the aim to set lower levels, reflecting the continuous reduction of the presence of acrylamide in food.\n(12)\nFood business operators, producing foodstuffs within the scope of this Regulation and which perform retail activities and/or directly supply only local retail establishments are typically small scale operators. Therefore, mitigation measures are adapted to the nature of their operation. However, food business operators which are part of, or franchises of, a larger, interconnected operation and that are centrally supplied should apply additional mitigation measures practicable for larger-scale businesses as those measures further reduce the presence of acrylamide in food and are feasible to be applied by such undertakings.\n(13)\nThe effectiveness of the mitigation measures to reduce the acrylamide content should be verified through sampling and analysis. It is appropriate to determine requirements for the sampling and analysis that has to be performed by the food business operators. As regards sampling, analytical requirements and frequency of sampling should be established in order to ensure that the obtained analytical results are representative for their production. Food business operators, producing foodstuffs within the scope of this Regulation and which perform retail activities and/or directly supply only local retail establishments are exempted from the obligation to sample and analyse their production for the presence of acrylamide as such a requirement would put a disproportionate burden on their business.\n(14)\nIn addition to sampling and analysis by the business operators, Regulation (EC) No 882/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council (5) requires the Member States to regularly perform official controls to ensure compliance with feed and food law. The sampling and analysis performed by the Member States in the context of official controls should comply with the sampling procedures and analytical criteria established in application of Regulation (EC) No 882/2004.\n(15)\nComplementary to the measures provided for in this Regulation, the setting of maximum levels for acrylamide in certain foods should be considered in accordance with Regulation (EEC) No 315/93 following the entry into force of this Regulation.\n(16)\nThe implementation of the mitigation measures by food business operators might involve changes to their current production process therefore, it is appropriate to provide for a transitional period before the measures provided for in this Regulation apply.\n(17)\nThe measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Plants, Animals, Food and Feed,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nArticle 1\nScope\n1.   Without prejudice to the applicable provisions of the Union law in food area, food business operators which produce and place on the market foodstuffs listed in paragraph 2 shall in accordance with Article 2 apply the mitigation measures set out in Annexes I and II, in view of achieving levels of acrylamide as low as reasonably achievable below the benchmark levels set out in Annex IV.\n2.

PRODUCTS BASED ON RAW POTATOES\nSelection of suitable potato varieties\n1.\nFood business operators (hereinafter ‘FBOs’) shall identify and use the potato varieties that are suitable for the product type and where the content of acrylamide precursors, such as reducing sugars (fructose and glucose) and asparagine is the lowest for the regional conditions.\n2.\nFBOs shall use the potato varieties which have been stored in the conditions which are applicable to a specific potato variety and for the storage period determined for a specific variety. The stored potatoes shall be used within their optimal storage window.\n3.\nFBOs shall identify potato varieties with lower acrylamide forming potential in cultivation, storage and during food processing. The results shall be documented.\nAcceptance criteria\n1.\nFBOs shall specify in their arrangements regarding potato supply the maximum content of reducing sugars in potatoes and also the maximum amount of bruised, spotted or damaged potatoes.\n2.\nIf the specified content of reducing sugar content in potatoes and the amount of bruised, spotted or damaged potatoes are exceeded, FBOs may accept the potato supply by specifying additional available mitigation measures to be taken to ensure that the presence of acrylamide in the final product is as low as reasonably achievable below the benchmark level set out in Annex IV.\nPotato storage and transport\n1.\nWhere FBOs operate their own storage facilities:\n—\nthe temperature shall be appropriate to the potato variety stored and it shall be above 6 °C;\n—\nthe level of humidity shall be such as to minimise senescent sweetening;\n—\nsprouting shall be suppressed in long term stored potatoes where permitted, using appropriate agents;\n—\nduring storage the level of reducing sugars in potatoes shall be tested.\n2.\nPotato lots shall be monitored for reducing sugars at the time of harvest.\n3.\nFBOs shall specify the potato transport conditions in terms of temperature and duration especially if outside temperatures are significantly lower than the temperature regime applied during storage, to ensure that the temperature during the transportation of potatoes is not lower than the temperature regime applied during storage. These specifications shall be documented.\n(a)   SLICED POTATO CRISPS\nRecipe and process design\n1.\nFor each product design, FBOs shall specify frying oil temperatures at the exit of the fryer. Those temperatures shall be as low as feasibly possible on a specific line and for the specific product, in line with quality and food safety standards and taking into account relevant factors such as fryer manufacturer, fryer type, potato variety, total solids, potato size, growing conditions, sugar content, seasonality and the target moisture content for the product.\n2.\nWhere the frying oil temperatures at the exit of the fryer is higher than 168 °C due to a specific product, design or technology, then the FBOs shall provide data demonstrating that the level of acrylamide in the finished product is as low as reasonably achievable and that the benchmark level set out in Annex IV is achieved.\n3.\nFor each product design, FBOs shall specify the moisture content post frying which shall be set as high as feasibly possible for a specific production line and for a specific product, in accordance with expected quality and food safety standards and taking into account relevant factors such as potato variety, seasonality, tuber size, and the fryer exit temperature. The minimal moisture content shall not be lower than 1,0 %.\n4.\nFBOs shall use in-line colour sorting (manual and/or optical-electronic) for potato crisps post frying.\n(b)   FRENCH FRIES AND OTHER CUT DEEP FRIED OR OVEN-FRIED POTATO PRODUCTS\nRecipe and Process design\n1.\nPotatoes shall be tested for reducing sugars prior to use. This can be done by fry testing using colours as an indicator of potential high reducing sugar content: indicative fry testing 20-25 centre strips, which are fried to evaluate frying colours of the potato strips against the colour specification using a USDA Munsell colour chart or calibrated company-specific charts for small operators. Alternatively the overall finished frying colour can be measured by specific equipment (e.g. Agtron).\n2.\nFBOs shall remove immature tubers having a low underwater weight and high reducing sugar levels. The removal can be done by passing tubers through a salt brine or similar systems which make immature tubers float or by pre-washing potatoes to detect bad tubers.\n3.\nFBOs shall remove slivers right after cutting to avoid burned pieces in the final cooked product.\n4.\nFBOs shall blanch potato strips to remove some of the reducing sugars from the outside of the strips.\n5.\nFBOs shall adapt blanching regimes to the specific quality attributes of the incoming raw material and they shall stay within specification limits for finished product colour.\n6.\nFBOs shall prevent (enzymatic) discolouration and after cooking darkening of potato products. This can be done by applying disodium diphosphate (E450), which also lowers the pH level of the washing water and inhibits the browning reaction.\n7.\nThe use of reducing sugars as a browning agent shall be avoided. They may be used only if needed, to consistently stay within specification limits. FBOs shall control the colour of the final product by performing colour checks on the final cooked product. If needed after blanching, controlled addition of dextrose enables meeting the finished colour specification. Controlled addition of dextrose after blanching results in lower acrylamide levels in the final cooked product at the same colour as observed in unblanched products with only naturally accumulated reducing sugars.\nInformation to the end users\n1.\nFor the end users, FBOs shall indicate recommended cooking methods specifying time, temperature, quantity for oven/deep fryer/pan on packaging and/or via other communication channels. For consumers the recommended cooking instructions shall be clearly displayed on all product packaging in compliance with Regulation (EU) No 1169/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council (4) on the provision of food information to consumers.\nRecommended cooking methods shall be in agreement with customer specifications and requirements for professional end users and must be validated per product type to ensure products have optimal sensory quality at the lightest acceptable colour, per cooking method specified (e.g. fryer, oven) and have levels of acrylamide below the benchmark level determined in Annex IV.\nFBOs shall recommend to end users other than consumers that they should have tools available for the operators (e.g. chefs) to ensure good cooking methods and also provide calibrated equipment (e.g. timers, frying curves, colour grading charts (e.g. USDA/Munsell) and at minimum, clear pictures with targeted final prepared product colours.\n2.\nFBOs shall recommend the end users in particular to:\n—\nkeep the temperature between 160 and 175 °C when frying, and 180-220 °C when using an oven. Lower temperature can be used when the fan is switched on;\n—\nPreheat the cooking device (e.g. oven, air fryer) to correct temperature between 180 and 220 °C according to on-pack cooking instructions, depending on the products specifications and local requirements;\n—\ncook potatoes until a golden yellow colour;\n—\ndo not overcook;\n—\nturn oven products after 10 minutes or halfway through the total cooking time;\n—\nfollow the recommended cooking instructions, as provided by the manufacturer;\n—\nwhen preparing smaller quantities of potatoes than indicated on pack, reduce the cooking time, to avoid excessive browning of the product;\n—\ndo not overfill the frying basket; fill your basket up to the halfway mark to avoid excessive oil uptake by extended frying times.\nII.   DOUGH-BASED POTATO CRISPS, SNACKS, CRACKERS AND OTHER DOUGH-BASED POTATO PRODUCTS\nRaw Materials\n1.\nFor each product, FBOs shall specify target values for reducing sugars in their dehydrated potato ingredients.\n2.\nThe target value of reducing sugars in the products concerned shall be set as low as feasibly possible, taking into account all relevant factors in the design and production of the finished product such as the amount of potato ingredients in the product recipe, further possible mitigation measures, further processing of the dough, seasonality and the moisture content in the finished product.\n3.\nWhere the content of reducing sugars is higher than 1,5 % the FBOs shall provide data demonstrating that the level of acrylamide in the finished product is as low as reasonably achievable below the benchmark level set out in Annex IV.\nRecipe and Process Design\n1.\nDehydrated potato ingredients shall be analysed prior to their use either by the supplier or the user to confirm that the sugar content does not exceed the specified level.\n2.\nWhere dehydrated potato ingredients exceed the specified sugar level, FBOs shall specify the additional mitigation measures to be taken to ensure that the level of acrylamide in the final product is as low as reasonably achievable below the benchmark level set out in Annex IV.\n3.\nFor each product FBOs shall review whether it is possible to utilise the partial replacement of potato ingredients with ingredients with lower acrylamide forming potential.\n4.\nIn wet dough-based systems, FBOs shall consider the use of the following substances insofar possible, taking into account that these substances may not be synergistic in their mitigation effect i.e. specifically applies to the use of asparaginase and lowering levels of pH:\n—\nAsparaginase\n—\nAcids or their salts (to reduce the level of pH of the dough)\n—\nCalcium salts.\n5.\nWhere dough-based potato crisps, snacks or crackers are fried, FBOs shall specify frying oil temperatures for each product at the exit of the fryer, control these temperatures and maintain records to demonstrate controls.\n6.\nThe oil temperature at the fryer exit shall be as low as feasibly possible on a specific line and for the specific product, in accordance with prescribed quality and food safety standards and taking into account relevant factors, such as the fryer manufacturer, fryer type, sugar content and the target moisture content for the product.\nWhere the temperature is higher than 175 °C at the fryer exit, FBOs shall provide data demonstrating that the level of acrylamide in the finished product. is below the benchmark level specified in Annex IV.\n(Note: Most pellet products are fried at temperatures higher than 175 °C because of their very short frying time and the temperatures needed to achieve the required expansion and texture of these products).\n7.\nWhere dough-based potato crisps, snacks or crackers are baked, FBOs shall specify for each product the baking temperature at the exit of the baking oven and maintain records to demonstrate controls.\n8.\nThe temperature at the exit of the baking oven/drying process shall be as low as feasibly possible on a specific line and for the specific product, in line with expected quality and food safety standards, and taking into account relevant factors such as the machinery type, reducing sugar content of the raw material and the moisture content of the product.\n9.\nWhere the product temperature is higher than 175 °C at the end of the baking/drying process, the FBOs shall provide data demonstrating that the level of acrylamide in the finished product is below the benchmark level specified in Annex IV.\n10.\nFor each product, FBOs shall specify the moisture content post frying or baking which shall be set as high as feasibly possible on a specific production line and for a specific product, in line with the product quality and food safety requirements, and taking into account the fryer exit, baking and drying temperature. The moisture content in the final product shall not be lower than 1,0 %.\nIII.   FINE BAKERY WARES\nThe mitigation measures in this Chapter are applicable to the fine bakery wares such as cookies, biscuits, rusks, cereal bars, scones, cornets, wafers, crumpets and gingerbread, as well as unsweetened products such as crackers, crisp breads and bread substitutes. In this category a cracker is a dry biscuit (a baked product based on cereal flour), e.g. soda crackers, rye crispbreads and matzot.\nAgronomy\nIn case of contract farming, where agricultural products are supplied to FBOs directly by their producers, FBOs shall ensure that the following requirements to prevent elevated asparagine levels in cereals are applied:\n—\nto follow Good Agricultural Practices on fertilisation, in particular with regard to maintaining balanced sulphur levels in the soil and to ensure a correct nitrogen application;\n—\nto follow Good Phytosanitary Practices in order to ensure the application of good practices on crop protection measures to prevent fungal infection.\nFBOs shall carry out controls to verify the effective application of the aforesaid requirements.\nRecipe and Product Design\nIn the manufacturing process FBOs shall apply the following mitigation measures:\n1.\nFor relevant products, FBOs shall consider reducing or replacing fully or partially ammonium bicarbonate with alternative raising agents such as\n(a)\nsodium bicarbonate and acidulants, or\n(b)\nsodium bicarbonate and disodium diphosphates with organic acids or potassium variants thereof.\nAs part of this consideration, FBOs shall ensure that the use of the said alternative raising agents do not result in organoleptic changes (taste, appearance, texture etc.) or increase the overall sodium content which influence product identity and consumers acceptance.\n2.\nFor products where the product design allows, FBOs shall replace fructose or fructose-containing ingredients such as syrups and honey with glucose or non-reducing sugars such as sucrose, particularly in recipes containing ammonium bicarbonate where possible and taking into consideration that replacing fructose or other reducing sugars may result in a modified product identity due to loss of flavour and colour formation.\n3.\nFBOs shall use asparaginase where effective and possible to reduce asparagine and mitigate the potential for acrylamide formation. FBOs shall take into account that there is limited or no effect on the levels of acrylamide of the use of asparaginase in recipes with high fat content, low moisture or high pH value.\n4.\nWhere a product characteristic allows, FBOs shall review whether it is possible to utilise the partial replacement of wheat flour with alternative grain flour, such as rice, taking into consideration that any change will have an impact on the baking process and organoleptic properties of the products. Different types of grains have shown different levels of asparagine (typical asparagine levels are the highest in rye and in descending order lower in oats, wheat, maize and with the lowest levels in rice).\n5.\nFBOs shall take into account in the risk assessment the impact of ingredients in the fine bakery wares that may raise acrylamide levels in the final product, and use ingredients that do not have such effects but maintain physical and organoleptic properties (such as almonds roasted at lower rather than higher temperatures and dried fruits as fructose source).\n6.\nFBOs shall ensure that suppliers of heat treated ingredients which are susceptible to acrylamide formation carry out an acrylamide risk assessment and implement the appropriate mitigation measures.\n7.\nFBOs shall ensure that a change in products sourced from suppliers does not result in increased acrylamide levels in such cases.\n8.\nFBOs shall consider to add organic acids to the production process or decrease the levels of pH as far as possible and reasonable in combination with other mitigation measures and taking into account that this can result in organoleptic changes (less browning, modification of taste).\nProcessing\nFBOs shall take the following mitigation measures in the manufacture of fine bakery wares and shall ensure that the measures taken are compatible with the product characteristics and food safety requirements:\n1.\nFBO shall apply the heat input, i.e. time and temperature combination that is the most effective to reduce acrylamide formation while achieving the targeted product characteristics.\n2.\nFBOs shall increase the moisture content in the final product in consideration of achieving the targeted product quality, the required shelf life and food safety standards.\n3.\nProducts shall be baked to a lighter colour endpoint in the final product in consideration of achieving the targeted product quality, the required shelf life and food safety standards.\n4.\nIn developing new products, FBOs shall take into account in their risk assessment the size and surface area of a particular piece of product taking into account that small product size potentially leads to higher acrylamide levels due to heat impact.\n5.\nAs certain ingredients used in the manufacture of fine bakery wares could be heat treated several times (e.g. pre-processed cereal pieces, nuts, seeds, dried fruits, etc.), which results in the raise of acrylamide levels in final products, FBOs shall adjust product and process design accordingly to comply with the benchmark levels of acrylamide set out in Annex IV. In particular the FBOs shall not use burnt products as rework.\n6.\nFor product pre-mixes that are put on the market to be baked at home or in catering establishments, FBOs shall provide preparation instructions to their customers to ensure that the acrylamide levels in the final products are as low as reasonably achievable below the benchmark levels.\nIV.   BREAKFAST CEREALS\nAgronomy\nIn case of contract farming, where agricultural products are supplied to FBOs directly by their producers, FBOs shall ensure that the following requirements to prevent elevated asparagine levels in cereals are applied:\n—\nto follow Good Agricultural Practices on fertilisation, in particular with regard to maintaining balanced sulphur levels in the soil and to ensure a correct nitrogen application;\n—\nto follow Good Phytosanitary Practices in order to ensure the application of good practices on crop protection measures to prevent fungal infection.\nFBOs shall carry out controls to verify the effective application of the aforesaid requirements.\nRecipe\n1.\nGiven that products based on maize and rice tend to have less acrylamide than those made with wheat, rye, oats and barley, FBOs shall consider using maize and rice in new product development where applicable and taking into consideration that any change will have an impact on the manufacturing process and organoleptic properties of the products.\n2.\nFBOs shall control the addition rates at the point of addition of reducing sugars (e.g. fructose and glucose) and ingredients containing reducing sugars (e.g. honey) taking into consideration their impact on organoleptic properties and process functionalities (binding clusters for cluster formation) and which can act as precursors to acrylamide formation when added prior to heat-treatment stages.\n3.\nFBOs shall take into account in the risk assessment the acrylamide contribution from heat-treated, dry ingredients, such as roasted and toasted nuts and oven dried fruits, and use alternative ingredients if the contribution is likely to bring the finished product above the benchmark level specified in Annex IV.\n4.\nFor heat-treated ingredients which contain 150 micrograms of acrylamide per kilogram (μg/kg) or more, FBOs shall take the following actions:\n—\nto establish a register of such ingredients;\n—\nto carry out audits of suppliers and/or analyses;\n—\nto ensure that no changes are made by the supplier of such ingredients that increase acrylamide levels.\n5.\nWhen the cereal is in a flour dough format and the manufacturing process allows a sufficient time, temperature and moisture content for asparaginase to reduce asparagine levels, FBOs shall use asparaginase where required provided there is no adverse effect on flavour or risk of residual enzyme activity.\nProcessing\nIn the manufacture of breakfast cereals FBOs shall apply the following mitigation measures and shall ensure that the measures taken are compatible with the product characteristics and food safety requirements:\n1.\nFBOs shall identify, by means of risk assessment, the critical heat-treatment step(s) in the manufacturing process that generate(s) acrylamide.\n2.\nAs higher heating temperatures and longer heating times generate higher acrylamide levels, FBOs shall identify an effective combination of temperature and heating times to minimise acrylamide formation without compromising the taste, texture, colour, safety and shelf-life of the product.\n3.\nTo avoid the generation of acrylamide spikes, FBOs shall control heating temperatures, times and feed-rates in order to achieve the following minimum moisture content in the final product after the final heat treatment in consideration of achieving the targeted product quality, the required shelf life and food safety standards:\n—\ntoasted products: 1 g/100 g for extruded products, 1 g/100 g for batch cooked products, 2 g/100 g for steam rolled products;\n—\ndirect expanded products: 0,8 g/100 g for extruded products;\n—\nbaked products: 2 g/100 g for continuously cooked products;\n—\nfilled products: 2 g/100 g for extruded products;\n—\nother drying: 1 g/100 g for batch cooked products, 0,8 g/100 g for gun puffed products.\nFBOs shall measure the moisture content and express acrylamide concentration in a dry mass to eliminate the confounding effect of moisture changes.\n4.\nReworking product back through the process has the potential to generate higher acrylamide levels through repeated exposure to the heat-treatments steps.
