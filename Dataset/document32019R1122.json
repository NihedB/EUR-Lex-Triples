{"celex_id": "32019R1122", "reference": "2.7.2019\nEN\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\nL 177/3\nCOMMISSION DELEGATED REGULATION (EU) 2019/1122\nof 12 March 2019\nsupplementing Directive 2003/87/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards the functioning of the Union Registry\n(Text with EEA relevance)\nTHE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,\nHaving regard to Directive 2003/87/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 October 2003 establishing a system for greenhouse gas emission allowance trading within the Union and amending Council Directive 96/61/EC (1), and in particular Article 19(3) thereof,\nWhereas:\n(1)\nArticle 19(1) of Directive 2003/87/EC requires that all allowances issued from 1 January 2012 onwards are held in a Union Registry. Such a Union Registry was initially established by Commission Regulation (EU) No 920/2010 (2).\n(2)\nCommission Regulation (EU) No 389/2013 (3) repealed Regulation (EU) No 920/2010 to lay down general, operational and maintenance requirements concerning the Union Registry for the trading period starting on 1 January 2013 and subsequent periods, concerning the independent transaction log provided for in Article 20(1) of Directive 2003/87/EC, and concerning registries provided for in Article 6 of Decision No 280/2004/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (4).\n(3)\nThe Union Registry ensures the accurate accounting of transactions under the system for greenhouse gas emission allowance trading within the Union (EU ETS), set up by Directive 2003/87/EC. The Union Registry is a standardised and secured electronic database containing common data elements to track the issue, holding, transfer and cancellation, as applicable, of allowances, and to provide for public access and confidentiality, as appropriate. It should ensure that there are no transfers, which are incompatible with the obligations resulting from Directive 2003/87/EC.\n(4)\nA new period of economy-wide legislation applies from 2021 that is the start of a new period for the EU ETS. It is necessary to ensure that the implementation and the functioning of the registries system comply also with the requirements set for this new period.\n(5)\nDirective (EU) 2018/410 of the European Parliament and of the Council (5) amended substantially Directive 2003/87/EC so as to enhance cost-effective emission reductions and low-carbon investments, requiring changes to the Union Registry. The provisions introduced by those amendments apply to the periods from 2021.\n(6)\nPursuant to Article 13 of Directive 2003/87/EC, allowances issued from 1 January 2013 onwards are valid indefinitely. However, from 2021 onwards, the allowances are to include an indication of the trading period of their creation. It is therefore necessary to provide the appropriate functionalities in the Union Registry. The indication showing in which ten-year period the allowances were created should only be visible to account holders where this is needed to distinguish the allowances created in one phase from those created in another phase. This is the case during the transition from the third trading period to the fourth, taking into account the fact that allowances created in the period starting in 2021 are only valid for emissions from 1 January 2021 onwards.\n(7)\nIn addition, restriction to the surrender of allowances should be applied to ensure that allowances can only be used for emissions from the first year of the ten-year period in which they were issued. The rules for the calculation of the compliance status figure are necessary in order to ensure the compliance with this restriction.\n(8)\nDirective (EU) 2018/410 deleted paragraph 7 of Article 11b of Directive 2003/87/EC. The use of international credits in the EU ETS will therefore no longer be possible in the trading period starting from 1 January 2021. Consequently, no international credits may be held on ETS accounts and international credit entitlements will cease to exist. However, until all operations required in relation to the trading period between 2013 and 2020 are concluded, the use of international credits, and consequently of international credit entitlements, should be maintained. Non-eligible units should be removed from ETS accounts after the end of the continued applicability of the relevant provisions of Regulation (EU) No 389/2013.\n(9)\nFollowing the classification of emission allowances consisting of any units recognised for compliance with the requirements of Directive 2003/87/EC as ‘financial instruments’ under Directive 2014/65/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council (6), it is appropriate to adapt the rules regulating the Union Registry to align them with the requirements of the financial market legislation to the extent necessary, in particular by ensuring the provision of relevant information allowing the effective enforcement of Directive 2014/65/EU and Regulation (EU) No 596/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council (7).\n(10)\nIn accordance with Directive 2014/65/EU and Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council (8), financial instruments are to be identified by means of International Securities Identification Numbers (ISIN codes) defined in ISO 6166. In order to facilitate the fulfilment of reporting obligations by the account holders, the ISIN codes for emission allowances should be displayed in the Union Registry.\n(11)\nThe smooth implementation of the auctioning process under Commission Regulation (EU) No 1031/2010 (9), stemming primarily from the experience gained from the implementation of the auctioning process, and from the fact that from 3 January 2018 spot emission allowances listed in point (11) of Section C of Annex I to Directive 2014/65/EU are classified as financial instruments, requires amendments to Regulation (EU) No 389/2013. In particular, this classification means that spot emission allowances come within the scope of Directive 98/26/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (10). The amendments are necessary to better align the processes covering the auctions in this Regulation with the requirements of Directive 98/26/EC including their harmonised implementation under national law, where necessary, for the purposes of the auctioning of emission allowances.\n(12)\nAs allowances exist only in dematerialised form and are fungible, the title to an allowance should be established by its existence in the account of the Union Registry in which it is held. Moreover, to reduce the risks associated with the reversal of transactions entered in the Union Registry, and the consequent disruption to the system and to the market that such reversal may cause, it is necessary to ensure that allowances are fully fungible. In particular, transactions can be reversed, revoked or unwound only in accordance with the rules of the Registry, within a period set by those rules. Nothing in this Regulation should prevent an account holder or a third party from exercising any right or claim resulting from the underlying transaction that they may have in law to recovery or restitution in respect of a transaction that has entered a system, such as in case of fraud or technical error, as long as this does not lead to the reversal, revocation or unwinding of the transaction. Furthermore, the acquisition of an allowance in good faith should be protected.\n(13)\nThe central administrator's main responsibilities should be to provide, operate and maintain the Union Registry and the European Union Transaction Log (EUTL), to manage central accounts and to perform operations which are carried out centrally. The national administrators' main responsibilities should be to be the contact point with their respective account holders in the Union Registry and perform all operations involving direct contact with them, including the opening, suspension of access to and closure of accounts.\n(14)\nWhere Member States allocate allowances free of charge on the basis of Article 10c of Directive 2003/87/EC, these allowances should be issued in accordance with Article 10c of that Directive.\n(15)\nRegulation (EU) 2017/2392 of the European Parliament and of the Council (11) amended Directive 2003/87/EC. That amendment extended the derogation from the EU ETS obligations for flights to and from third countries until 31 December 2023. Accordingly, aircraft operators benefiting from the derogation are to continue to receive free allowances until that date. From 1 January 2021, the number of free allowances allocated to aircraft operators is subject to the application of the linear factor referred to in Article 9 of Directive 2003/87/EC.\n(16)\nArticle 11 of Directive 2003/87/EC provides that competent authorities are to transfer, by 28 February of each year, the number of allowances allocated to operators for free for that year. Where that Directive provides for the recalculation of the number of allowances allocated to an operator, the central administrator should ensure that the recalculation of the allocation is made in accordance with Directive 2003/87/EC and the required changes are carried out in the Union Registry and the EUTL before the national competent authority may transfer the allowances to the operator concerned.\n(17)\nNothing in this Regulation should prevent a competent authority from requiring an operator to transfer a number of allowances, received in excess of its adjusted allocation for the relevant year, to the EU Allocation Account in cases where there has been an over allocation of allowances, including as a result of an error in the original allocation or the operator having failed to correctly or completely submit to the competent authority relevant information provided that the central administrator has carried out a change to the national allocation table of the Member State.\n(18)\nAllowances issued after an operator has ceased the activities performed in the installation to which those allowances relate, without informing the competent authority beforehand, cannot be classified as emissions allowances within the meaning of Directive 2003/87/EC. This implies that in case the excess allocation results from the operator not reporting the cessation of production, it should be possible to remove from the operator holding account the corresponding number of allowances even without the approval of the operator.\n(19)\nAdequate and harmonised requirements on opening of accounts, authentication and access rights should be applied to protect the security of information held in the Union Registry and to avoid fraud. The requirements laid down in Regulation (EU) No 389/2013 should be reviewed and updated with the purpose of ensuring their effectiveness while taking into account proportionality. Although the administrators of the Union Registry are not directly subject to requirements laid down in Directive (EU) 2015/849 of the European Parliament and of the Council (12), requirements and safeguard measures of that Directive are also reflected in the rules governing the opening and maintaining of accounts in the Union Registry, with special regard to information of beneficial owners. The rules in Regulation (EU) No 389/2013 should be revised to allow national administrators to adapt their procedures to the actual risk represented by a particular action.\n(20)\nIf an original document, originating in another Member State, or a certified copy thereof, is submitted as evidence under Annexes IV or VIII, the rules of Regulation (EU) 2016/1191 of the European Parliament and of the Council (13) should be applied accordingly.\n(21)\nNational administrators, the central administrator and the Commission are to comply with Union and national legislation concerning the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, in particular Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council (14), and Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 of the European Parliament and of the Council (15), where they are applicable to information held and processed pursuant to this Regulation.\n(22)\nRecords concerning all processes, operators and persons in the registries system should be kept, while personal data contained in them should be deleted after the expiry of the relevant retention period.\n(23)\nThe Commission and the national administrators are joint controllers of the information held and processed pursuant to this Regulation. The Union Registry and the EUTL performs tasks that are carried out in the public interest. In the case of a personal data breach, the relevant notification procedures pursuant to data protection legislation are applicable.\n(24)\nNational administrators, the central administrator and the Commission should ensure that information held and processed pursuant to this Regulation can only be used for the purpose of the functioning of the Union Registry.\n(25)\nThe rules governing the Union Registry should be simplified in order to reduce any administrative burden to the extent possible, without undermining the environmental integrity, security or reliability of the EU ETS. To define the direction and extent of possible simplifications and alleviations, the practical experience of national administrators of the Union Registry was gathered and Member States were consulted. The resulting new rules intend to provide for easier understanding and use of the Union Registry both by its users and administrators.\n(26)\nWhere necessary and for as long as necessary in order to protect the environmental integrity of the EU ETS, aviation operators and other operators in the EU ETS may not use allowances that are issued by a Member State which has notified the European Council of its intention to withdraw from the Union pursuant to Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union (‘TEU’).\n(27)\nLinking the EU ETS with other emissions trading systems expands opportunities for emissions reductions, thereby cutting the cost of fighting climate change. The operationalisation of linking agreements pursuant to Article 25 of Directive 2003/87/EC requires a number of adaptations in the Union Registry. Therefore, Regulation (EU) No 389/2013 should be amended to, inter alia, ensure the recognition of allowances of third countries for compliance, enable the transfer of such allowances, the creation of accounts, transaction processes and to include the conditions for suspension of the link.\n(28)\nAll operations required in relation to the third trading period of the EU ETS between 2013 and 2020 should be completed in accordance with the rules laid down in Regulation (EU) No 389/2013. As Directive 2003/87/EC allowed for the use of international credits generated pursuant to the Kyoto Protocol, that Regulation should continue to apply to those operations. In order to provide clarity about the rules applying to all operations related to the third trading period in accordance with Directive 2003/87/EC, as amended by Directive 2009/29/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (16), on the one hand, and the rules applying to all operations related to the fourth trading period in accordance with Directive 2003/87/EC, as amended by Directive (EU) 2018/410, on the other hand, the scope of application of those provisions of Regulation (EU) No 389/2013 which continue to apply, after the entry into force of the present Regulation, for the operations related to the third trading period should be limited to that purpose.\n(29)\nThe European Data Protection Supervisor was consulted in accordance with Article 42 of Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 and delivered an opinion on 18 October 2018,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nTITLE I\nGENERAL PROVISIONS\nCHAPTER 1\nSubject matter, scope and definitions\nArticle 1\nSubject matter\nThis Regulation lays down general, operational and maintenance requirements concerning the Union Registry and the independent transaction log provided for in Article 20(1) of Directive 2003/87/EC.\nArticle 2\nScope\nThis Regulation applies to allowances created for the purposes of the European Union Emissions Trading System (EU ETS).\nArticle 3\nDefinitions\nFor the purposes of this Regulation, the definitions in Article 3 of Regulation (EU) No 1031/2010 and in Article 3 of Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2019/331 (17) shall apply.

Each aircraft operator shall have one aircraft operator holding account.\n3.   Aircraft operators performing aviation activities with total annual emissions lower than 25 000 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent per year or operating fewer than 243 flights per period for three consecutive four-month period may mandate a natural person or a legal entity to open an aircraft operator holding account and to surrender the allowances pursuant to Article 12(2a) of Directive 2003/87/EC on their behalf. Responsibility for compliance still remains with the aircraft operator. When mandating the natural person or the legal entity, the aircraft operator shall ensure that there is no conflict of interest amongst the mandated person or entity and competent authorities, national administrators, verifiers or other bodies subject to the provisions of Directive 2003/87/EC and the acts adopted for its implementation. In this case, the natural person or legal entity mandated shall provide the information required in accordance with paragraph 1.\n4.   Within 20 working days of the receipt of a complete set of information in accordance with paragraph 1 of this Article and Article 21, the national administrator shall open an aircraft operator holding account for each aircraft operator in the Union Registry or inform the prospective account holder of the refusal to open the account, pursuant to Article 19.\n5.

Within 20 working days of the receipt of a complete set of information in accordance with paragraph 1 of this Article and Article 21, the national administrator shall register the verifier in the Union Registry or inform the prospective verifier of the refusal, pursuant to Article 19.\nArticle 19\nRefusal to open an account or register a verifier\n1.   The national administrator shall verify whether the information and documents provided for account opening or registration are complete, up-to-date, accurate and true.\nIn the event of justified doubts, the national administrator may request assistance by another national administrator in carrying out the verification referred to in the first subparagraph. The administrator that has received such request may refuse it. The prospective account holder or verifier may explicitly ask the national administrator to request such assistance. The national administrator shall inform the prospective account holder or verifier of such assistance request.\n2.   A national administrator may refuse to open an account or register a verifier:\n(a)\nif the information and documents provided are incomplete, out-of-date or otherwise inaccurate or false;\n(b)\nif a law enforcement authority provides information or if information is available by other means to a national administrator that the prospective account holder, or, if it is a legal person, any of the directors of the prospective account holder, is under investigation or has been convicted in the preceding five years for fraud involving allowances, money laundering, terrorist financing or other serious crimes for which the account may be an instrument;\n(c)\nif the national administrator has reasonable grounds to believe that the accounts may be used for fraud involving allowances, money laundering, terrorist financing or other serious crimes;\n(d)\nfor reasons set out in national law.\n3.   Where the national administrator refuses to open an operator holding account or aircraft operator holding account in accordance with paragraph 2, the account may be opened upon instruction from the competent authority. All access to the account shall be suspended in accordance with Article 30(4) until the reasons for refusal listed in paragraph 2 are no longer present.\n4.   If the national administrator refuses to open an account, the person requesting the account opening may object to the competent authority or the relevant authority under national law, who shall either instruct the national administrator to open the account or uphold the refusal in a reasoned decision, subject to requirements of national law that pursue a legitimate objective compatible with this Regulation and are proportionate.\nArticle 20\nAuthorised representatives\n1.

Whenever required by national law, each operator and aircraft operator shall select a verifier from the list of verifiers registered with the national administrator administering its account.\n2.   The national administrator, the competent authority or, upon decision of the competent authority, the account holder or the verifier shall enter emissions data for the previous year.\n3.   Annual emissions data shall be submitted using the format set out in Annex IX.\n4.   Upon the satisfactory verification in accordance with Article 15 of Directive 2003/87/EC of an operator's report on the emissions from an installation during a previous year, or of an aircraft operator's report on the emissions from all aviation activities it performed during a previous year, the verifier or the competent authority shall approve the annual emissions data.\n5.   The emissions approved in accordance with paragraph 4 shall be marked as ‘verified’ in the Union Registry by the national administrator or the competent authority. The competent authority may decide that instead of the national administrator, the verifier shall be responsible for marking emissions as ‘verified’ in the Union Registry. All approved emissions shall be marked ‘verified’ by 31 March.\n6.   The competent authority may instruct the national administrator to correct the annual verified emissions for an installation or an aircraft operator to ensure compliance with Articles 14 and 15 of Directive 2003/87/EC, by entering the corrected verified or estimated emissions for that installation or an aircraft operator for a given year in the Union Registry.\n7.   Where, on 1 May of each year, no verified emissions figure has been recorded in the Union Registry for an installation or an aircraft operator for a previous year or the verified emissions figure was proven to be incorrect, any substitute emissions figure estimate entered in the Union Registry shall be calculated as closely as possible in accordance with Articles 14 and 15 of Directive 2003/87/EC.\nArticle 32\nBlocking of accounts due to a failure to submit verified emissions\n1.   If, on 1 April of each year, the annual emissions of an installation or aircraft operator for the preceding year have not been entered and marked as ‘verified’ in the Union Registry, the central administrator shall ensure that the Union Registry sets the corresponding operator holding account or aircraft operator holding account to a blocked status.\n2.   When all overdue verified emissions of the installation or aircraft operator for that year have been recorded in the Union Registry, the central administrator shall ensure that the Union Registry sets the account to open status.\nArticle 33\nCalculation of compliance status figures\n1.   The central administrator shall ensure that on 1 May of each year, the Union Registry indicates the compliance status figure for the preceding year for every installation and aircraft operator with an operator or aircraft operator holding account that is not in a closed status by calculating the sum of all allowances surrendered for the current period less the sum of all verified emissions in the current period up to and including the preceding year, plus a correction factor. The compliance status figure shall not be calculated for accounts that had their previous compliance status figure zero or positive and the year of last emissions was set to a year before the preceding year. The calculation shall not take into account the surrender of allowances issued for a period subsequent to the current compliance period.\nThe central administrator shall ensure that the Union Registry calculates the compliance status figure before the closure of the account pursuant to Articles 25 and 26.\n2.   For the trading periods 2008-2012 and 2013-2020, the correction factor referred to in paragraph 1 shall be zero if the compliance status figure of the last year of the previous period was greater than zero, but shall remain the same as the compliance status figure of the last year of the previous period if this figure is less than or equal to zero. For the trading periods starting on 1 January 2021, the correction factor referred to in paragraph 1 shall be the same as the compliance status figure of the last year of the previous period.\n3.   The central administrator shall ensure that the Union Registry records the compliance status figure for every installation and aircraft operator for each year.\nCHAPTER 2\nTransactions\nSection 1\nGeneral\nArticle 34\nOnly transactions expressly provided for in this Regulation for each account type shall be initiated by that account type.\nArticle 35\nExecution of transfers\n1.

The central administrator shall ensure that all transfers specified in Article 55 to accounts indicated on the trusted account list are executed immediately if they are proposed for execution between 10:00 and 16:00 CET on working days.\nA transfer to accounts indicated on the trusted accounts list proposed for execution at any other time shall be executed on the same working day at 10:00 CET, if it is proposed for execution before 10:00 CET, or on the following working day at 10:00 CET, if it is proposed for execution after 16:00 CET.\n3.   The central administrator shall ensure that all transfers specified in Article 55 to accounts not indicated on the trusted account list and transfers from an Auction Collateral Delivery Account, proposed for execution before 12.00 CET of a working day, are executed at 12.00 CET of the following working day.

An authorised representative may initiate aborting a transaction at least two hours before its execution. If aborting a transaction was initiated because of suspected fraud, the account holder shall immediately report it to the competent national law enforcement authority. That report shall be forwarded to the national administrator within 7 working days.\n6.   If an account representative or the account holder suspects that a transfer, which is subject to execution rules in paragraph 3, was proposed for execution fraudulently, at the latest two hours before its execution, the account representative or the account holder may request the national administrator, or the central administrator where appropriate, to abort the transfer on behalf of the account representative or the account holder. The account holder shall report the suspected fraud to the competent national law enforcement authority immediately following the request. That report shall be forwarded to the national administrator or the central administrator where appropriate, within 7 working days.\n7.   Upon proposal for execution, a notification shall be sent to all account representatives indicating the proposed execution of the transfer. Upon initiation of aborting a transaction pursuant to paragraph 5, a notification shall be sent to all account representatives and the national administrator administering the account.\n8.   For the purposes of Article 3(11), Member States may decide that for a given year national public holidays are not to be considered as working days for the purposes of application of this Regulation in that Member State. Such decision shall specify those days and shall be published by 1 December of the year preceding the year concerned.\nArticle 36\nNature of allowances and finality of transactions\n1.   An allowance shall be a fungible, dematerialised instrument that is tradable on the market.\n2.   The dematerialized nature of allowances shall imply that the record of the Union Registry shall constitute prima facie and sufficient evidence of title over an allowance, and of any other matter which is by this Regulation directed or authorised to be recorded in the Union Registry.\n3.   The fungibility of allowances shall imply that any recovery or restitution obligations that may arise under national law in respect of an allowance shall only apply to the allowance in kind.\nSubject to Article 58 and the reconciliation process provided for in Article 73, a transaction shall become final and irrevocable upon its finalisation pursuant to Article 74. Without prejudice to any provision of or remedy under national law that may result in a requirement or order to execute a new transaction in the Union Registry, no law, regulation, rule or practice on the setting aside of contracts or transactions shall lead to the unwinding in the registry of a transaction that has become final and irrevocable under this Regulation.\nAn account holder or a third party shall not be prevented from exercising any right or claim resulting from the underlying transaction that they may have in law, including to recovery, restitution or damages, in respect of a transaction that has become final in the Union Registry, for instance in case of fraud or technical error, as long as this does not lead to the reversal, revocation or unwinding of the transaction in the Union Registry.\n4.   A purchaser and holder of an allowance acting in good faith shall acquire title to an allowance free of any defects in the title of the transferor.\nSection 2\nCreation of allowances\nArticle 37\nCreation of allowances\n1.   The central administrator may create an EU Total Quantity Account, an EU Aviation Total Quantity Account, an EU Auction Account and an EU Aviation Auction Account as appropriate, and shall create or cancel accounts and allowances as made necessary by Union acts, including as may be required by Directive 2003/87/EC or Article 10(1) of Regulation (EU) No 1031/2010.\n2.   The central administrator shall ensure that the Union Registry assigns each allowance a unique unit identification code upon its creation.\n3.   Allowances created from 1 January 2021 onwards shall include an indication showing in which ten-year period beginning from 1 January 2021 they were created.\n4.   The central administrator shall ensure that the ISIN-codes defined in ISO 6166 for the allowances are displayed in the Union Registry.\n5.   Subject to paragraph 6, allowances created pursuant to the national allocation table of a Member State which has notified the European Council of its intention to withdraw from the Union pursuant to Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union, or to be auctioned by an Auction Platform appointed by such a Member State, shall be identified by a country code and shall be made distinguishable according to the year of creation.\n6.   Allowances created shall not be identified with a country code:\n(a)\nFor years where Union law does not yet cease to apply in that Member State by 30 April of the following year or where it is sufficiently ensured that the surrender of allowances must take place in a legally enforceable manner before the Treaties cease to apply in that Member State;\n(b)\nIf allowances were created in respect of years where ensuring compliance with Directive 2003/87/EC for emissions taking place during these years is required by an agreement setting out arrangements for the withdrawal of a Member State which has notified its intention to withdraw from the Union, and the instruments of ratification of both parties to the withdrawal agreement are deposited.\nSection 3\nAccount transfers before auctions and allocation\nArticle 38\nTransfer of general allowances to be auctioned\n1.

registry for emissions trading system allowances\nSUMMARY OF:\nDelegated Regulation (EU) 2019/1122 on the functioning of the Union registry\nWHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?\n              \nIt aims to guarantee accurate accounting for all allowances issued under the European Union (EU) emissions trading system.\nKEY POINTS\nEU registry\nThe EU registry is a single, centralised online database run by the European Commission that holds accounts for operators of facilities such as power stations and airline operators.\nIt covers all countries taking part in the EU greenhouse gas emissions trading scheme (EU ETS), set up by Directive 2003/87/EC, which aims to reduce emissions in a cost-effective manner as part of the EU’s policy to tackle climate change.\nThe registry records: facilities covered by the directive in each EU Member State and any free allowances allocated to those facilities;accounts of companies or individuals with such allowances;transfers of allowances performed by account holders;verified annual CO2 emissions of facilities and airline operators;the annual reconciliation of allowances and verified emissions.\nPhase IV\nThis regulation sets out the general, operational and maintenance requirements for the EU registry for phase IV of the EU ETS from 2021 to 2030.\nIt replaces Regulation (EU) No 389/2013 (see summary), which covered phase III (2013–2020) of the EU ETS.\nMain elements\nThe regulation covers a number of aspects, including the following.\nThe registries system, which is operated and maintained by a central administrator. The regulation introduces a EU transaction log (EUTL), which automatically checks, records and authorises all transactions between accounts in the registry. It replaces the Community independent transaction log from phase II.\nThe status and administration of accounts.
