In view of the overall positive experience with the application of that Regulation, which expires on 31 December 2010, and taking into account further experience acquired since its adoption, it is appropriate to adopt a new block exemption regulation.\n(3)\nThis Regulation should meet the two requirements of ensuring effective protection of competition and providing adequate legal security for undertakings. The pursuit of those objectives should take account of the need to simplify administrative supervision and the legislative framework to as great an extent as possible. Below a certain level of market power it can in general be presumed, for the application of Article 101(3) of the Treaty, that the positive effects of specialisation agreements will outweigh any negative effects on competition.\n(4)\nFor the application of Article 101(3) of the Treaty by regulation, it is not necessary to define those agreements which are capable of falling within Article 101(1) of the Treaty. In the individual assessment of agreements under Article 101(1) of the Treaty, account has to be taken of several factors, and in particular the market structure on the relevant market.\n(5)\nThe benefit of the exemption established by this Regulation should be limited to those agreements for which it can be assumed with sufficient certainty that they satisfy the conditions of Article 101(3) of the Treaty.\n(6)\nAgreements on specialisation in production are most likely to contribute to improving the production or distribution of goods if the parties have complementary skills, assets or activities, because they can concentrate on the manufacture of certain products and thus operate more efficiently and supply the products more cheaply. The same can generally be said about agreements on specialisation in the preparation of services. Given effective competition, it is likely that consumers will receive a fair share of the resulting benefits.\n(7)\nSuch advantages can arise from agreements whereby one party fully or partly gives up the manufacture of certain products or preparation of certain services in favour of another party (unilateral specialisation), from agreements whereby each party fully or partly gives up the manufacture of certain products or preparation of certain services in favour of another party (reciprocal specialisation) and from agreements whereby the parties undertake to jointly manufacture certain products or prepare certain services (joint production). In the context of this Regulation, the concepts of unilateral and reciprocal specialisation do not require a party to reduce capacity, as it is sufficient if they reduce their production volumes. The concept of joint production, however, does not require the parties to reduce their individual production activities outside the scope of their envisaged joint production arrangement.\n(8)\nThe nature of unilateral and reciprocal specialisation agreements presupposes that the parties are active on the same product market. It is not necessary for the parties to be active on the same geographic market. Consequently, the application of this Regulation to unilateral and reciprocal specialisation agreements should be limited to scenarios where the parties are active on the same product market. Joint production agreements can be entered into by parties who are already active on the same product market but also by parties who wish to enter a product market by way of the agreement. Therefore, joint production agreements should fall within the scope of this Regulation irrespective of whether the parties are already active in the same product market.\n(9)\nTo ensure that the benefits of specialisation will materialise without one party leaving the market downstream of production entirely, unilateral and reciprocal specialisation agreements should only be covered by this Regulation where they provide for supply and purchase obligations or joint distribution. Supply and purchase obligations may, but do not have to, be of an exclusive nature.\n(10)\nIt can be presumed that, where the parties’ share of the relevant market for the products which are the subject matter of a specialisation agreement does not exceed a certain level, the agreements will, as a general rule, give rise to economic benefits in the form of economies of scale or scope or better production technologies, while allowing consumers a fair share of the resulting benefits. However, where the products manufactured under a specialisation agreement are intermediary products which one or more of the parties fully or partly use as an input for their own production of certain downstream products which they subsequently sell on the market, the exemption conferred by this Regulation should also be conditional on the parties’ share on the relevant market for these downstream products not exceeding a certain level. In such a case, merely looking at the parties’ market share at the level of the intermediary product would ignore the potential risk of foreclosing or increasing the price of inputs for competitors at the level of the downstream products. However, there is no presumption that specialisation agreements are either caught by Article 101(1) of the Treaty or that they fail to satisfy the conditions of Article 101(3) of the Treaty once the market share threshold set out in this Regulation is exceeded or other conditions of this Regulation are not met. In such cases, an individual assessment of the specialisation agreement needs to be conducted under Article 101 of the Treaty.\n(11)\nThis Regulation should not exempt agreements containing restrictions which are not indispensable to the attainment of the positive effects generated by a specialisation agreement. In principle, agreements containing certain types of severe restrictions of competition relating to the fixing of prices charged to third parties, limitation of output or sales, and allocation of markets or customers should be excluded from the benefit of the exemption established by this Regulation irrespective of the market share of the parties.\n(12)\nThe market share limitation, the non-exemption of certain agreements and the conditions provided for in this Regulation normally ensure that the agreements to which the block exemption applies do not enable the parties to eliminate competition in respect of a substantial part of the products or services in question.\n(13)\nThe Commission may withdraw the benefit of this Regulation, pursuant to Article 29(1) of Council Regulation (EC) No 1/2003 of 16 December 2002 on the implementation of the rules on competition laid down in Articles 81 and 82 of the Treaty (3), where it finds in a particular case that an agreement to which the exemption provided for in this Regulation applies nevertheless has effects which are incompatible with Article 101(3) of the Treaty.\n(14)\nThe competition authority of a Member State may withdraw the benefit of this Regulation pursuant to Article 29(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1/2003 in respect of the territory of that Member State, or a part thereof where, in a particular case, an agreement to which the exemption established by this Regulation applies nevertheless has effects which are incompatible with Article 101(3) of the Treaty in the territory of that Member State, or in a part thereof, and where such territory has all the characteristics of a distinct geographic market.\n(15)\nThe benefit of this Regulation could be withdrawn pursuant to Article 29 of Regulation (EC) No 1/2003 where, for example, the relevant market is very concentrated and competition is already weak, in particular because of the individual market positions of other market participants or links between other market participants created by parallel specialisation agreements.\n(16)\nIn order to facilitate the conclusion of specialisation agreements, which can have a bearing on the structure of the parties, the period of validity of this Regulation should be fixed at 12 years,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nArticle 1\nDefinitions\n1.

The two Articles are, in substance, identical. For the purposes of this Regulation, references to Article 101 of the TFEU should be understood as references to Article 81 of the EC Treaty where appropriate. The TFEU also introduced certain changes in terminology, such as the replacement of ‘Community’ by ‘Union’ and ‘common market’ by ‘internal market’. The terminology of the TFEU will be used throughout this Regulation.\n(2)  OJ L 304, 5.12.2000, p. 3.\n(3)  OJ L 1, 4.1.2003, p. 1.", "summary": "Exemption for specialisation agreements\nExemption for specialisation agreements\nThis regulation provides a block exemption for specialisation agreements and, in doing so, aims to ensure effective protection of competition and provide adequate legal security for the parties to specialisation agreements.\nACT\nCommission Regulation (EU) No 1218/2010 of 14 December 2010 on the application of Article 101(3) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union to certain categories of specialisation agreements.\nSUMMARY\nArticle 101(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) is not applicable to specialisation agreements * (including joint production agreements), provided the agreement does not contain any hardcore restrictions of competition and the parties' combined market share does not exceed 20 %. The exemption provided for in Regulation (EEC) No 2821/71 also extends to specialisation agreements containing provisions relating to the assignment or licensing of intellectual property rights so long as those provisions are not the primary object of such agreements, but are instead directly related to and necessary for their implementation. Moreover, this regulation also provides an exemption where the parties accept exclusive purchase or supply obligations or jointly distribute the products they manufacture under a specialisation or joint production agreement.\nMarket share is calculated on the basis of the market sales value or, if that data is not available, then estimates based on other reliable market information may be used to establish the market share of the parties. If, after a certain time, the market share exceeds the 20 % threshold but remains below 25 %, the exemption continues to apply for two years. However, if the market share rises over 25 %, the exemption only applies for the following one year.\nHardcore restrictions\nThe exemption does not apply to specialisation agreements aimed, directly or indirectly, at:\nthe fixing of prices;\nthe limitation of output or sales;\nthe allocation of markets or customers.\nKey terms used in the act\nSpecialisation agreement:\nReferences\nAct\nEntry into force – Date of expiry\nDeadline for transposition in the Member States\nOfficial Journal\nRegulation (EU) No 1218/2010\n1.1.2011 – 31.12.2022\n-\nOJ L 335, 18.12.2010\nLast updated: 25.05.2011", "tags": ["intellectual property", "specialisation agreement", "market-sharing agreement", "inter-company agreement", "opt-out clause", "terms for aid"], "subjects": ["Concentrations between undertakings", "Taxation", "Competition"], "split": "train", "reference_annotations": {}, "summary_annotations": {}}
