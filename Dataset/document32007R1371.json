{"celex_id": "32007R1371", "reference": "3.12.2007\nEN\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\nL 315/14\nREGULATION (EC) No 1371/2007 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL\nof 23 October 2007\non rail passengers’ rights and obligations\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 71(1) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the Commission,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee (1),\nHaving regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions (2),\nActing in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty, in the light of the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee on 31 July 2007 (3),\nWhereas:\n(1)\nIn the framework of the common transport policy, it is important to safeguard users’ rights for rail passengers and to improve the quality and effectiveness of rail passenger services in order to help increase the share of rail transport in relation to other modes of transport.\n(2)\nThe Commission’s communication ‘Consumer Policy Strategy 2002-2006’ (4) sets the aim of achieving a high level of consumer protection in the field of transport in accordance with Article 153(2) of the Treaty.\n(3)\nSince the rail passenger is the weaker party to the transport contract, passengers’ rights in this respect should be safeguarded.\n(4)\nUsers’ rights to rail services include the receipt of information regarding the service both before and during the journey. Whenever possible, railway undertakings and ticket vendors should provide this information in advance and as soon as possible.\n(5)\nMore detailed requirements regarding the provision of travel information will be set out in the technical specifications for interoperability (TSIs) referred to in Directive 2001/16/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 19 March 2001 on the interoperability of the conventional rail system (5).\n(6)\nStrengthening of the rights of rail passengers should build on the existing system of international law on this subject contained in Appendix A — Uniform rules concerning the Contract for International Carriage of Passengers and Luggage by Rail (CIV) to the Convention concerning International Carriage by Rail (COTIF) of 9 May 1980, as modified by the Protocol for the modification of the Convention concerning International Carriage by Rail of 3 June 1999 (1999 Protocol). However, it is desirable to extend the scope of this Regulation and protect not only international passengers but domestic passengers too.\n(7)\nRailway undertakings should cooperate to facilitate the transfer of rail passengers from one operator to another by the provision of through tickets, whenever possible.\n(8)\nThe provision of information and tickets for rail passengers should be facilitated by the adaptation of computerised systems to a common specification.\n(9)\nThe further implementation of travel information and reservation systems should be executed in accordance with the TSIs.\n(10)\nRail passenger services should benefit citizens in general. Consequently, disabled persons and persons with reduced mobility, whether caused by disability, age or any other factor, should have opportunities for rail travel comparable to those of other citizens. Disabled persons and persons with reduced mobility have the same right as all other citizens to free movement, freedom of choice and to non-discrimination. Inter alia, special attention should be given to the provision of information to disabled persons and persons with reduced mobility concerning the accessibility of rail services, access conditions of rolling stock and the facilities on board. In order to provide passengers with sensory impairment with the best information on delays, visual and audible systems should be used, as appropriate. Disabled persons and persons with reduced mobility should be enabled to buy tickets on board a train without extra charges.\n(11)\nRailway undertakings and station managers should take into account the needs of disabled persons and persons with reduced mobility, through compliance with the TSI for persons with reduced mobility, so as to ensure that, in accordance with Community public procurement rules, all buildings and rolling stock are made accessible through the progressive elimination of physical obstacles and functional hindrances when acquiring new material or carrying out construction or major renovation work.\n(12)\nRailway undertakings should be obliged to be insured, or to make equivalent arrangements, for their liability to rail passengers in the event of accident. The minimum amount of insurance for railway undertakings should be the subject of future review.\n(13)\nStrengthened rights of compensation and assistance in the event of delay, missed connection or cancellation of a service should lead to greater incentives for the rail passenger market, to the benefit of passengers.\n(14)\nIt is desirable that this Regulation create a system of compensation for passengers in the case of delay which is linked to the liability of the railway undertaking, on the same basis as the international system provided by the COTIF and in particular appendix CIV thereto relating to passengers’ rights.\n(15)\nWhere a Member State grants railway undertakings an exemption from the provisions of this Regulation, it should encourage railway undertakings, in consultation with organisations representing passengers, to put in place arrangements for compensation and assistance in the event of major disruption to a rail passenger service.\n(16)\nIt is also desirable to relieve accident victims and their dependants of short-term financial concerns in the period immediately after an accident.\n(17)\nIt is in the interests of rail passengers that adequate measures be taken, in agreement with public authorities, to ensure their personal security at stations as well as on board trains.\n(18)\nRail passengers should be able to submit a complaint to any railway undertaking involved regarding the rights and obligations conferred by this Regulation, and be entitled to receive a response within a reasonable period of time.\n(19)\nRailway undertakings should define, manage and monitor service quality standards for rail passenger services.\n(20)\nThe contents of this Regulation should be reviewed in respect of the adjustment of financial amounts for inflation and in respect of information and service quality requirements in the light of market developments as well as in the light of the effects on service quality of this Regulation.\n(21)\nThis Regulation should be without prejudice to Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data (6).\n(22)\nMember States should lay down penalties applicable to infringements of this Regulation and ensure that these penalties are applied. The penalties, which might include the payment of compensation to the person in question, should be effective, proportionate and dissuasive.\n(23)\nSince the objectives of this Regulation, namely the development of the Community’s railways and the introduction of passenger rights, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States, and can therefore be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives.\n(24)\nIt is an aim of this Regulation to improve rail passenger services within the Community. Therefore, Member States should be able to grant exemptions for services in regions where a significant part of the service is operated outside the Community.\n(25)\nRailway undertakings in some Member States may experience difficulty in applying the entirety of the provisions of this Regulation on its entry into force. Therefore, Member States should be able to grant temporary exemptions from the application of the provisions of this Regulation to long-distance domestic rail passenger services. The temporary exemption should, however, not apply to the provisions of this Regulation that grant disabled persons or persons with reduced mobility access to travel by rail, nor to the right of those wishing to purchase tickets for travel by rail to do so without undue difficulty, nor to the provisions on railway undertakings’ liability in respect of passengers and their luggage, the requirement that undertakings be adequately insured, and the requirement that those undertakings take adequate measures to ensure passengers’ personal security in railway stations and on trains and to manage risk.\n(26)\nUrban, suburban and regional rail passenger services are different in character from long-distance services. Therefore, with the exception of certain provisions which should apply to all rail passenger services throughout the Community, Member States should be able to grant exemptions from the application of the provisions of this Regulation to urban, suburban and regional rail passenger services.\n(27)\nThe measures necessary for the implementation of this Regulation should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission (7).\n(28)\nIn particular, the Commission should be empowered to adopt implementing measures. Since those measures are of general scope and are designed to amend non-essential elements of this Regulation, or to supplement it with new non-essential elements, they must be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny provided for in Article 5a of Decision 1999/468/EC,\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nCHAPTER I\nGENERAL PROVISIONS\nArticle 1\nSubject matter\nThis Regulation establishes rules as regards the following:\n(a)\nthe information to be provided by railway undertakings, the conclusion of transport contracts, the issuing of tickets and the implementation of a Computerised Information and Reservation System for Rail Transport,\n(b)\nthe liability of railway undertakings and their insurance obligations for passengers and their luggage,\n(c)\nthe obligations of railway undertakings to passengers in cases of delay,\n(d)\nthe protection of, and assistance to, disabled persons and persons with reduced mobility travelling by rail,\n(e)\nthe definition and monitoring of service quality standards, the management of risks to the personal security of passengers and the handling of complaints, and\n(f)\ngeneral rules on enforcement.\nArticle 2\nScope\n1.   This Regulation shall apply to all rail journeys and services throughout the Community provided by one or more railway undertakings licensed in accordance with Council Directive 95/18/EC of 19 June 1995 on the licensing of railway undertakings (8).\n2.   This Regulation does not apply to railway undertakings and transport services which are not licensed under Directive 95/18/EC.\n3.   On the entry into force of this Regulation, Articles 9, 11, 12, 19, 20(1) and 26 shall apply to all rail passenger services throughout the Community.\n4.   With the exception of the provisions set out in paragraph 3, a Member State may, on a transparent and non-discriminatory basis, grant an exemption for a period no longer than five years, which may be renewed twice for a maximum period of five years on each occasion, from the application of the provisions of this Regulation to domestic rail passenger services.\n5.   With the exception of the provisions set out in paragraph 3 of this Article, a Member State may exempt from the application of the provisions of this Regulation urban, suburban and regional rail passenger services. In order to distinguish between urban, suburban and regional rail passenger services, Member States shall apply the definitions contained in Council Directive 91/440/EEC of 29 July 1991 on the development of the Community’s railways (9). In applying these definitions, Member States shall take into account the following criteria: distance, frequency of services, number of scheduled stops, rolling stock employed, ticketing schemes, fluctuations in passenger numbers between services in peak and off-peak periods, train codes and timetables.\n6.   For a maximum period of five years, a Member State may, on a transparent and non-discriminatory basis, grant an exemption, which may be renewed, from the application of the provisions of this Regulation to particular services or journeys because a significant part of the rail passenger service, including at least one scheduled station stop, is operated outside the Community.\n7.   Member States shall inform the Commission of exemptions granted pursuant to paragraphs 4, 5 and 6. The Commission shall take appropriate action if such an exemption is deemed not to be in accordance with the provisions of this Article. No later than 3 December 2014, the Commission shall submit to the European Parliament and the Council a report on exemptions granted pursuant to paragraphs 4, 5 and 6.\nArticle 3\nDefinitions\nFor the purposes of this Regulation the following definitions shall apply:\n1.\n‘railway undertaking’ means a railway undertaking as defined in Article 2 of Directive 2001/14/EC (10), and any other public or private undertaking the activity of which is to provide transport of goods and/or passengers by rail on the basis that the undertaking must ensure traction;

An advance payment shall not constitute recognition of liability and may be offset against any subsequent sums paid on the basis of this Regulation but is not returnable, except in the cases where damage was caused by the negligence or fault of the passenger or where the person who received the advance payment was not the person entitled to compensation.\nArticle 14\nContestation of liability\nEven if the railway undertaking contests its responsibility for physical injury to a passenger whom it conveys, it shall make every reasonable effort to assist a passenger claiming compensation for damage from third parties.\nCHAPTER IV\nDELAYS, MISSED CONNECTIONS AND CANCELLATIONS\nArticle 15\nLiability for delays, missed connections and cancellations\nSubject to the provisions of this Chapter, the liability of railway undertakings in respect of delays, missed connections and cancellations shall be governed by Chapter II of Title IV of Annex I.\nArticle 16\nReimbursement and re-routing\nWhere it is reasonably to be expected that the delay in the arrival at the final destination under the transport contract will be more than 60 minutes, the passenger shall immediately have the choice between:\n(a)\nreimbursement of the full cost of the ticket, under the conditions by which it was paid, for the part or parts of his or her journey not made and for the part or parts already made if the journey is no longer serving any purpose in relation to the passenger’s original travel plan, together with, when relevant, a return service to the first point of departure at the earliest opportunity. The payment of the reimbursement shall be made under the same conditions as the payment for compensation referred to in Article 17; or\n(b)\ncontinuation or re-routing, under comparable transport conditions, to the final destination at the earliest opportunity; or\n(c)\ncontinuation or re-routing, under comparable transport conditions, to the final destination at a later date at the passenger’s convenience.\nArticle 17\nCompensation of the ticket price\n1.   Without losing the right of transport, a passenger may request compensation for delays from the railway undertaking if he or she is facing a delay between the places of departure and destination stated on the ticket for which the ticket has not been reimbursed in accordance with Article 16. The minimum compensations for delays shall be as follows:\n(a)\n25 % of the ticket price for a delay of 60 to 119 minutes,\n(b)\n50 % of the ticket price for a delay of 120 minutes or more.\nPassengers who hold a travel pass or season ticket and who encounter recurrent delays or cancellations during its period of validity may request adequate compensation in accordance with the railway undertaking’s compensation arrangements. These arrangements shall state the criteria for determining delay and for the calculation of the compensation.\nCompensation for delay shall be calculated in relation to the price which the passenger actually paid for the delayed service.\nWhere the transport contract is for a return journey, compensation for delay on either the outward or the return leg shall be calculated in relation to half of the price paid for the ticket. In the same way the price for a delayed service under any other form of transport contract allowing travelling several subsequent legs shall be calculated in proportion to the full price.\nThe calculation of the period of delay shall not take into account any delay that the railway undertaking can demonstrate as having occurred outside the territories in which the Treaty establishing the European Community is applied.\n2.   The compensation of the ticket price shall be paid within one month after the submission of the request for compensation. The compensation may be paid in vouchers and/or other services if the terms are flexible (in particular regarding the validity period and destination). The compensation shall be paid in money at the request of the passenger.\n3.   The compensation of the ticket price shall not be reduced by financial transaction costs such as fees, telephone costs or stamps. Railway undertakings may introduce a minimum threshold under which payments for compensation will not be paid. This threshold shall not exceed EUR 4.\n4.   The passenger shall not have any right to compensation if he is informed of a delay before he buys a ticket, or if a delay due to continuation on a different service or re-routing remains below 60 minutes.\nArticle 18\nAssistance\n1.   In the case of a delay in arrival or departure, passengers shall be kept informed of the situation and of the estimated departure time and estimated arrival time by the railway undertaking or by the station manager as soon as such information is available.\n2.   In the case of any delay as referred to in paragraph 1 of more than 60 minutes, passengers shall also be offered free of charge:\n(a)\nmeals and refreshments in reasonable relation to the waiting time, if they are available on the train or in the station, or can reasonably be supplied;\n(b)\nhotel or other accommodation, and transport between the railway station and place of accommodation, in cases where a stay of one or more nights becomes necessary or an additional stay becomes necessary, where and when physically possible;\n(c)\nif the train is blocked on the track, transport from the train to the railway station, to the alternative departure point or to the final destination of the service, where and when physically possible.\n3.   If the railway service cannot be continued anymore, railway undertakings shall organise as soon as possible alternative transport services for passengers.\n4.   Railway undertakings shall, at the request of the passenger, certify on the ticket that the rail service has suffered a delay, led to a missed connection or that it has been cancelled, as the case might be.\n5.   In applying paragraphs 1, 2 and 3, the operating railway undertaking shall pay particular attention to the needs of disabled persons and persons with reduced mobility and any accompanying persons.\nCHAPTER V\nDISABLED PERSONS AND PERSONS WITH REDUCED MOBILITY\nArticle 19\nRight to transport\n1.   Railway undertakings and station managers shall, with the active involvement of representative organisations of disabled persons and persons with reduced mobility, establish, or shall have in place, non-discriminatory access rules for the transport of disabled persons and persons with reduced mobility.\n2.   Reservations and tickets shall be offered to disabled persons and persons with reduced mobility at no additional cost. A railway undertaking, ticket vendor or tour operator may not refuse to accept a reservation from, or issue a ticket to, a disabled person or a person with reduced mobility, or require that such person be accompanied by another person, unless this is strictly necessary in order to comply with the access rules referred to in paragraph 1.\nArticle 20\nInformation to disabled persons and persons with reduced mobility\n1.   Upon request, a railway undertaking, a ticket vendor or a tour operator shall provide disabled persons and persons with reduced mobility with information on the accessibility of rail services and on the access conditions of rolling stock in accordance with the access rules referred to in Article 19(1) and shall inform disabled persons and persons with reduced mobility about facilities on board.\n2.   When a railway undertaking, ticket vendor and/or tour operator exercises the derogation provided for in Article 19(2), it shall upon request inform in writing the disabled person or person with reduced mobility concerned of its reasons for doing so within five working days of the refusal to make the reservation or to issue the ticket or the imposition of the condition of being accompanied.\nArticle 21\nAccessibility\n1.   Railway undertakings and station managers shall, through compliance with the TSI for persons with reduced mobility, ensure that the station, platforms, rolling stock and other facilities are accessible to disabled persons and persons with reduced mobility.\n2.   In the absence of accompanying staff on board a train or of staff at a station, railway undertakings and station managers shall make all reasonable efforts to enable disabled persons or persons with reduced mobility to have access to travel by rail.\nArticle 22\nAssistance at railway stations\n1.   On departure from, transit through or arrival at, a staffed railway station of a disabled person or a person with reduced mobility, the station manager shall provide assistance free of charge in such a way that that person is able to board the departing service, or to disembark from the arriving service for which he or she purchased a ticket, without prejudice to the access rules referred to in Article 19(1).\n2.   Member States may provide for a derogation from paragraph 1 in the case of persons travelling on services which are the subject of a public service contract awarded in conformity with Community law, on condition that the competent authority has put in place alternative facilities or arrangements guaranteeing an equivalent or higher level of accessibility of transport services.\n3.   In unstaffed stations, railway undertakings and station managers shall ensure that easily accessible information is displayed in accordance with the access rules referred to in Article 19(1) regarding the nearest staffed stations and directly available assistance for disabled persons and persons with reduced mobility.\nArticle 23\nAssistance on board\nWithout prejudice to the access rules as referred to in Article 19(1), railway undertakings shall provide disabled persons and persons with reduced mobility assistance free of charge on board a train and during boarding and disembarking from a train.\nFor the purposes of this Article, assistance on board shall consist of all reasonable efforts to offer assistance to a disabled person or a person with reduced mobility in order to allow that person to have access to the same services in the train as other passengers, should the extent of the person’s disability or reduced mobility not allow him or her to have access to those services independently and in safety.\nArticle 24\nConditions on which assistance is provided\nRailway undertakings, station managers, ticket vendors and tour operators shall cooperate in order to provide assistance to disabled persons and persons with reduced mobility in line with Articles 22 and 23 in accordance with the following points:\n(a)\nassistance shall be provided on condition that the railway undertaking, the station manager, the ticket vendor or the tour operator with which the ticket was purchased is notified of the person’s need for such assistance at least 48 hours before the assistance is needed. Where the ticket permits multiple journeys, one notification shall be sufficient provided that adequate information on the timing of subsequent journeys is provided;\n(b)\nrailway undertakings, station managers, ticket vendors and tour operators shall take all measures necessary for the reception of notifications;\n(c)\nif no notification is made in accordance with point (a), the railway undertaking and the station manager shall make all reasonable efforts to provide assistance in such a way that the disabled person or person with reduced mobility may travel;\n(d)\nwithout prejudice to the powers of other entities regarding areas located outside the railway station premises, the station manager or any other authorised person shall designate points, within and outside the railway station, at which disabled persons and persons with reduced mobility can announce their arrival at the railway station and, if need be, request assistance;\n(e)\nassistance shall be provided on condition that the disabled person or person with reduced mobility present him or herself at the designated point at a time stipulated by the railway undertaking or station manager providing such assistance. Any time stipulated shall not be more than 60 minutes before the published departure time or the time at which all passengers are asked to check in. If no time is stipulated by which the disabled person or person with reduced mobility is required to present him or herself, the person shall present him or herself at the designated point at least 30 minutes before the published departure time or the time at which all passengers are asked to check in.\nArticle 25\nCompensation in respect of mobility equipment or other specific equipment\nIf the railway undertaking is liable for the total or partial loss of, or damage to, mobility equipment or other specific equipment used by disabled persons or persons with reduced mobility, no financial limit shall be applicable.\nCHAPTER VI\nSECURITY, COMPLAINTS AND QUALITY OF SERVICE\nArticle 26\nPersonal security of passengers\nIn agreement with public authorities, railway undertakings, infrastructure managers and station managers shall take adequate measures in their respective fields of responsibility and adapt them to the level of security defined by the public authorities to ensure passengers’ personal security in railway stations and on trains and to manage risks. They shall cooperate and exchange information on best practices concerning the prevention of acts, which are likely to deteriorate the level of security.\nArticle 27\nComplaints\n1.   Railway undertakings shall set up a complaint handling mechanism for the rights and obligations covered in this Regulation. The railway undertaking shall make its contact details and working language(s) widely known to passengers.\n2.   Passengers may submit a complaint to any railway undertaking involved. Within one month, the addressee of the complaint shall either give a reasoned reply or, in justified cases, inform the passenger by what date within a period of less than three months from the date of the complaint a reply can be expected.\n3.   The railway undertaking shall publish in the annual report referred to in Article 28 the number and categories of received complaints, processed complaints, response time and possible improvement actions undertaken.\nArticle 28\nService quality standards\n1.   Railway undertakings shall define service quality standards and implement a quality management system to maintain service quality. The service quality standards shall at least cover the items listed in Annex III.\n2.   Railway undertakings shall monitor their own performance as reflected in the service quality standards. Railway undertakings shall each year publish a report on their service quality performance together with their annual report. The reports on service quality performance shall be published on the Internet website of the railway undertakings. In addition, these reports shall be made available on the Internet website of the ERA.\nCHAPTER VII\nINFORMATION AND ENFORCEMENT\nArticle 29\nInformation to passengers about their rights\n1.   When selling tickets for journeys by rail, railway undertakings, station managers and tour operators shall inform passengers of their rights and obligations under this Regulation. In order to comply with this information requirement, railway undertakings, station managers and tour operators may use a summary of the provisions of this Regulation prepared by the Commission in all official languages of the European Union institutions and made available to them.\n2.

By the contract of carriage the carrier shall undertake to carry the passenger as well as, where appropriate, luggage and vehicles to the place of destination and to deliver the luggage and vehicles at the place of destination.\n2.   The contract of carriage must be confirmed by one or more tickets issued to the passenger. However, subject to Article 9 the absence, irregularity or loss of the ticket shall not affect the existence or validity of the contract which shall remain subject to these Uniform Rules.\n3.   The ticket shall be prima facie evidence of the conclusion and the contents of the contract of carriage.\nArticle 7\nTicket\n1.   The General Conditions of Carriage shall determine the form and content of tickets as well as the language and characters in which they are to be printed and made out.\n2.   The following, at least, must be entered on the ticket:\n(a)\nthe carrier or carriers;\n(b)\na statement that the carriage is subject, notwithstanding any clause to the contrary, to these Uniform Rules; this may be indicated by the acronym CIV;\n(c)\nany other statement necessary to prove the conclusion and contents of the contract of carriage and enabling the passenger to assert the rights resulting from this contract.\n3.   The passenger must ensure, on receipt of the ticket, that it has been made out in accordance with his instructions.\n4.   The ticket shall be transferable if it has not been made out in the passenger’s name and if the journey has not begun.\n5.   The ticket may be established in the form of electronic data registration, which can be transformed into legible written symbols. The procedure used for the registration and treatment of data must be equivalent from the functional point of view, particularly so far as concerns the evidential value of the ticket represented by those data.\nArticle 8\nPayment and refund of the carriage charge\n1.   Subject to a contrary agreement between the passenger and the carrier, the carriage charge shall be payable in advance.\n2.   The General Conditions of Carriage shall determine under what conditions a refund of the carriage charge shall be made.\nArticle 9\nRight to be carried. Exclusion from carriage\n1.   The passenger must, from the start of his journey, be in possession of a valid ticket and produce it on the inspection of tickets. The General Conditions of Carriage may provide:\n(a)\nthat a passenger who does not produce a valid ticket must pay, in addition to the carriage charge, a surcharge;\n(b)\nthat a passenger who refuses to pay the carriage charge or the surcharge upon demand may be required to discontinue his journey;\n(c)\nif and under what conditions a refund of the surcharge shall be made.\n2.   The General Conditions of Carriage may provide that passengers who:\n(a)\npresent a danger for safety and the good functioning of the operations or for the safety of other passengers,\n(b)\ninconvenience other passengers in an intolerable manner,\nshall be excluded from carriage or may be required to discontinue their journey and that such persons shall not be entitled to a refund of their carriage charge or of any charge for the carriage of registered luggage they may have paid.\nArticle 10\nCompletion of administrative formalities\nThe passenger must comply with the formalities required by customs or other administrative authorities.\nArticle 11\nCancellation and late running of trains. Missed connections\nThe carrier must, where necessary, certify on the ticket that the train has been cancelled or the connection missed.\nTITLE III\nCARRIAGE OF HAND LUGGAGE, ANIMALS, REGISTERED LUGGAGE AND VEHICLES\nChapter I\nCommon provisions\nArticle 12\nAcceptable articles and animals\n1.   The passenger may take with him articles which can be handled easily (hand luggage) and also live animals in accordance with the General Conditions of Carriage. Moreover, the passenger may take with him cumbersome articles in accordance with the special provisions, contained in the General Conditions of Carriage. Articles and animals likely to annoy or inconvenience passengers or cause damage shall not be allowed as hand luggage.\n2.   The passenger may consign articles and animals as registered luggage in accordance with the General Conditions of Carriage.\n3.   The carrier may allow the carriage of vehicles on the occasion of the carriage of passengers in accordance with special provisions, contained in the General Conditions of Carriage.\n4.   The carriage of dangerous goods as hand luggage, registered luggage as well as in or on vehicles which, in accordance with this Title are carried by rail, must comply with the Regulation concerning the Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Rail (RID).\nArticle 13\nExamination\n1.   When there is good reason to suspect a failure to observe the conditions of carriage, the carrier shall have the right to examine whether the articles (hand luggage, registered luggage, vehicles including their loading) and animals carried comply with the conditions of carriage, unless the laws and prescriptions of the State in which the examination would take place prohibit such examination. The passenger must be invited to attend the examination. If he does not appear or cannot be reached, the carrier must require the presence of two independent witnesses.\n2.   If it is established that the conditions of carriage have not been respected, the carrier can require the passenger to pay the costs arising from the examination.\nArticle 14\nCompletion of administrative formalities\nThe passenger must comply with the formalities required by customs or other administrative authorities when, on being carried, he has articles (hand luggage, registered luggage, vehicles including their loading) or animals carried. He shall be present at the inspection of these articles save where otherwise provided by the laws and prescriptions of each State.\nChapter II\nHand luggage and animals\nArticle 15\nSupervision\nIt shall be the passenger’s responsibility to supervise the hand luggage and animals that he takes with him.\nChapter III\nRegistered luggage\nArticle 16\nConsignment of registered luggage\n1.   The contractual obligations relating to the forwarding of registered luggage must be established by a luggage registration voucher issued to the passenger.\n2.   Subject to Article 22 the absence, irregularity or loss of the luggage registration voucher shall not affect the existence or the validity of the agreements concerning the forwarding of the registered luggage, which shall remain subject to these Uniform Rules.\n3.   The luggage registration voucher shall be prima facie evidence of the registration of the luggage and the conditions of its carriage.\n4.   Subject to evidence to the contrary, it shall be presumed that when the carrier took over the registered luggage it was apparently in a good condition, and that the number and the mass of the items of luggage corresponded to the entries on the luggage registration voucher.\nArticle 17\nLuggage registration voucher\n1.   The General Conditions of Carriage shall determine the form and content of the luggage registration voucher as well as the language and characters in which it is to be printed and made out. Article 7(5) shall apply mutatis mutandis.\n2.   The following, at least, must be entered on the luggage registration voucher:\n(a)\nthe carrier or carriers;\n(b)\na statement that the carriage is subject, notwithstanding any clause to the contrary, to these Uniform Rules; this may be indicated by the acronym CIV;\n(c)\nany other statement necessary to prove the contractual obligations relating to the forwarding of the registered luggage and enabling the passenger to assert the rights resulting from the contract of carriage.\n3.   The passenger must ensure, on receipt of the luggage registration voucher, that it has been made out in accordance with his instructions.\nArticle 18\nRegistration and carriage\n1.   Save where the General Conditions of Carriage otherwise provide, luggage shall be registered only on production of a ticket valid at least as far as the destination of the luggage. In other respects the registration of luggage shall be carried out in accordance with the prescriptions in force at the place of consignment.\n2.   When the General Conditions of Carriage provide that luggage may be accepted for carriage without production of a ticket, the provisions of these Uniform Rules determining the rights and obligations of the passenger in respect of his registered luggage shall apply mutatis mutandis to the consignor of registered luggage.\n3.   The carrier can forward the registered luggage by another train or by another mode of transport and by a different route from that taken by the passenger.\nArticle 19\nPayment of charges for the carriage of registered luggage\nSubject to a contrary agreement between the passenger and the carrier, the charge for the carriage of registered luggage shall be payable on registration.\nArticle 20\nMarking of registered luggage\nThe passenger must indicate on each item of registered luggage in a clearly visible place, in a sufficiently durable and legible manner:\n(a)\nhis name and address;\n(b)\nthe place of destination.\nArticle 21\nRight to dispose of registered luggage\n1.   If circumstances permit and if customs requirements or the requirements of other administrative authorities are not thereby contravened, the passenger can request luggage to be handed back at the place of consignment on surrender of the luggage registration voucher and, if the General Conditions of Carriage so require, on production of the ticket.\n2.   The General Conditions of Carriage may contain other provisions concerning the right to dispose of registered luggage, in particular modifications of the place of destination and the possible financial consequences to be borne by the passenger.\nArticle 22\nDelivery\n1.   Registered luggage shall be delivered on surrender of the luggage registration voucher and, where appropriate, on payment of the amounts chargeable against the consignment.\nThe carrier shall be entitled, but not obliged, to examine whether the holder of the voucher is entitled to take delivery.\n2.   It shall be equivalent to delivery to the holder of the luggage registration voucher if, in accordance with the prescriptions in force at the place of destination:\n(a)\nthe luggage has been handed over to the customs or octroi authorities at their premises or warehouses, when these are not subject to the carrier’s supervision;\n(b)\nlive animals have been handed over to third parties.\n3.   The holder of the luggage registration voucher may require delivery of the luggage at the place of destination as soon as the agreed time and, where appropriate, the time necessary for the operations carried out by customs or other administrative authorities, has elapsed.\n4.   Failing surrender of the luggage registration voucher, the carrier shall only be obliged to deliver the luggage to the person proving his right thereto; if the proof offered appears insufficient, the carrier may require security to be given.\n5.   Luggage shall be delivered at the place of destination for which it has been registered.\n6.   The holder of a luggage registration voucher whose luggage has not been delivered may require the day and time to be endorsed on the voucher when he requested delivery in accordance with paragraph 3.\n7.   The person entitled may refuse to accept the luggage if the carrier does not comply with his request to carry out an examination of the registered luggage in order to establish alleged damage.\n8.   In all other respects delivery of luggage shall be carried out in accordance with the prescriptions in force at the place of destination.\nChapter IV\nVehicles\nArticle 23\nConditions of carriage\nThe special provisions governing the carriage of vehicles, contained in the General Conditions of Carriage, shall specify in particular the conditions governing acceptance for carriage, registration, loading and carriage, unloading and delivery as well as the obligations of the passenger.\nArticle 24\nCarriage voucher\n1.   The contractual obligations relating to the carriage of vehicles must be established by a carriage voucher issued to the passenger. The carriage voucher may be integrated into the passenger’s ticket.\n2.   The special provisions governing the carriage of vehicles, contained in the General Conditions of Carriage, shall determine the form and content of the carriage voucher as well as the language and the characters in which it is to be printed and made out. Article 7(5) shall apply mutatis mutandis.\n3.   The following, at least, must be entered on the carriage voucher:\n(a)\nthe carrier or carriers;\n(b)\na statement that the carriage is subject, notwithstanding any clause to the contrary, to these Uniform Rules; this may be indicated by the acronym CIV;\n(c)\nany other statement necessary to prove the contractual obligations relating to the carriage of vehicles and enabling the passenger to assert the rights resulting from the contract of carriage.\n4.   The passenger must ensure, on receipt of the carriage voucher, that it has been made out in accordance with his instructions.\nArticle 25\nApplicable law\nSubject to the provisions of this Chapter, the provisions of Chapter III relating to the carriage of luggage shall apply to vehicles.\nTITLE IV\nLIABILITY OF THE CARRIER\nChapter I\nLiability in case of death of, or personal injury to, passengers\nArticle 26\nBasis of liability\n1.   The carrier shall be liable for the loss or damage resulting from the death of, personal injuries to, or any other physical or mental harm to, a passenger, caused by an accident arising out of the operation of the railway and happening while the passenger is in, entering or alighting from railway vehicles whatever the railway infrastructure used.\n2.   The carrier shall be relieved of this liability\n(a)\nif the accident has been caused by circumstances not connected with the operation of the railway and which the carrier, in spite of having taken the care required in the particular circumstances of the case, could not avoid and the consequences of which he was unable to prevent;\n(b)\nto the extent that the accident is due to the fault of the passenger;\n(c)\nif the accident is due to the behaviour of a third party which the carrier, in spite of having taken the care required in the particular circumstances of the case, could not avoid and the consequences of which he was unable to prevent; another undertaking using the same railway infrastructure shall not be considered as a third party; the right of recourse shall not be affected.\n3.   If the accident is due to the behaviour of a third party and if, in spite of that, the carrier is not entirely relieved of his liability in accordance with paragraph 2, letter c), he shall be liable in full up to the limits laid down in these Uniform Rules but without prejudice to any right of recourse which the carrier may have against the third party.\n4.   These Uniform Rules shall not affect any liability which may be incurred by the carrier in cases not provided for in paragraph 1.\n5.   If carriage governed by a single contract of carriage is performed by successive carriers, the carrier bound pursuant to the contract of carriage to provide the service of carriage in the course of which the accident happened shall be liable in case of death of, and personal injuries to, passengers. When this service has not been provided by the carrier, but by a substitute carrier, the two carriers shall be jointly and severally liable in accordance with these Uniform Rules.\nArticle 27\nDamages in case of death\n1.   In case of death of the passenger the damages shall comprise:\n(a)\nany necessary costs following the death, in particular those of transport of the body and the funeral expenses;\n(b)\nif death does not occur at once, the damages provided for in Article 28.\n2.   If, through the death of the passenger, persons whom he had, or would have had, a legal duty to maintain are deprived of their support, such persons shall also be compensated for that loss. Rights of action for damages of persons whom the passenger was maintaining without being legally bound to do so, shall be governed by national law.\nArticle 28\nDamages in case of personal injury\nIn case of personal injury or any other physical or mental harm to the passenger the damages shall comprise:\n(a)\nany necessary costs, in particular those of treatment and of transport;\n(b)\ncompensation for financial loss, due to total or partial incapacity to work, or to increased needs.\nArticle 29\nCompensation for other bodily harm\nNational law shall determine whether and to what extent the carrier must pay damages for bodily harm other than that for which there is provision in Articles 27 and 28.\nArticle 30\nForm and amount of damages in case of death and personal injury\n1.   The damages under Article 27(2) and Article 28(b) must be awarded in the form of a lump sum. However, if national law permits payment of an annuity, the damages shall be awarded in that form if so requested by the injured passenger or by the persons entitled referred to in Article 27(2).\n2.   The amount of damages to be awarded pursuant to paragraph 1 shall be determined in accordance with national law. However, for the purposes of these Uniform Rules, the upper limit per passenger shall be set at 175 000 units of account as a lump sum or as an annual annuity corresponding to that sum, where national law provides for an upper limit of less than that amount.\nArticle 31\nOther modes of transport\n1.   Subject to paragraph 2, the provisions relating to the liability of the carrier in case of death of, or personal injury to, passengers shall not apply to loss or damage arising in the course of carriage which, in accordance with the contract of carriage, was not carriage by rail.\n2.   However, where railway vehicles are carried by ferry, the provisions relating to liability in case of death of, or personal injury to, passengers shall apply to loss or damage referred to in Article 26(1) and Article 33(1), caused by an accident arising out of the operation of the railway and happening while the passenger is in, entering or alighting from the said vehicles.\n3.   When, because of exceptional circumstances, the operation of the railway is temporarily suspended and the passengers are carried by another mode of transport, the carrier shall be liable pursuant to these Uniform Rules.\nChapter II\nLiability in case of failure to keep to the timetable\nArticle 32\nLiability in case of cancellation, late running of trains or missed connections\n1.   The carrier shall be liable to the passenger for loss or damage resulting from the fact that, by reason of cancellation, the late running of a train or a missed connection, his journey cannot be continued the same day, or that a continuation of the journey the same day could not reasonably be required because of given circumstances. The damages shall comprise the reasonable costs of accommodation as well as the reasonable costs occasioned by having to notify persons expecting the passenger.\n2.   The carrier shall be relieved of this liability, when the cancellation, late running or missed connection is attributable to one of the following causes:\n(a)\ncircumstances not connected with the operation of the railway which the carrier, in spite of having taken the care required in the particular circumstances of the case, could not avoid and the consequences of which he was unable to prevent;\n(b)\nfault on the part of the passenger; or\n(c)\nthe behaviour of a third party which the carrier, in spite of having taken the care required in the particular circumstances of the case, could not avoid and the consequences of which he was unable to prevent; another undertaking using the same railway infrastructure shall not be considered as a third party; the right of recourse shall not be affected.\n3.   National law shall determine whether and to what extent the carrier must pay damages for harm other than that provided for in paragraph 1. This provision shall be without prejudice to Article 44.\nChapter III\nLiability in respect of hand luggage, animals, registered luggage and vehicles\nSECTION 1\nHand luggage and animals\nArticle 33\nLiability\n1.   In case of death of, or personal injury to, passengers the carrier shall also be liable for the loss or damage resulting from the total or partial loss of, or damage to, articles which the passenger had on him or with him as hand luggage; this shall apply also to animals which the passenger had brought with him. Article 26 shall apply mutatis mutandis.\n2.   In other respects, the carrier shall not be liable for the total or partial loss of, or damage to, articles, hand luggage or animals the supervision of which is the responsibility of the passenger in accordance with Article 15, unless this loss or damage is caused by the fault of the carrier. The other Articles of Title IV, with exception of Article 51, and Title VI shall not apply in this case.\nArticle 34\nLimit of damages in case of loss of or damage to articles\nWhen the carrier is liable under Article 33(1), he must pay compensation up to a limit of 1 400 units of account per passenger.\nArticle 35\nExclusion of liability\nThe carrier shall not be liable to the passenger for loss or damage arising from the fact that the passenger does not conform to the formalities required by customs or other administrative authorities.\nSECTION 2\nRegistered luggage\nArticle 36\nBasis of liability\n1.   The carrier shall be liable for loss or damage resulting from the total or partial loss of, or damage to, registered luggage between the time of taking over by the carrier and the time of delivery as well as from delay in delivery.\n2.   The carrier shall be relieved of this liability to the extent that the loss, damage or delay in delivery was caused by a fault of the passenger, by an order given by the passenger other than as a result of the fault of the carrier, by an inherent defect in the registered luggage or by circumstances which the carrier could not avoid and the consequences of which he was unable to prevent.\n3.   The carrier shall be relieved of this liability to the extent that the loss or damage arises from the special risks inherent in one or more of the following circumstances:\n(a)\nthe absence or inadequacy of packing;\n(b)\nthe special nature of the luggage;\n(c)\nthe consignment as luggage of articles not acceptable for carriage.\nArticle 37\nBurden of proof\n1.   The burden of proving that the loss, damage or delay in delivery was due to one of the causes specified in Article 36(2) shall lie on the carrier.\n2.   When the carrier establishes that, having regard to the circumstances of a particular case, the loss or damage could have arisen from one or more of the special risks referred to in Article 36(3), it shall be presumed that it did so arise. The person entitled shall, however, have the right to prove that the loss or damage was not attributable either wholly or in part to one of those risks.\nArticle 38\nSuccessive carriers\nIf carriage governed by a single contract is performed by several successive carriers, each carrier, by the very act of taking over the luggage with the luggage registration voucher or the vehicle with the carriage voucher, shall become a party to the contract of carriage in respect of the forwarding of luggage or the carriage of vehicles, in accordance with the terms of the luggage registration voucher or of the carriage voucher and shall assume the obligations arising therefrom. In such a case each carrier shall be responsible for the carriage over the entire route up to delivery.\nArticle 39\nSubstitute carrier\n1.   Where the carrier has entrusted the performance of the carriage, in whole or in part, to a substitute carrier, whether or not in pursuance of a right under the contract of carriage to do so, the carrier shall nevertheless remain liable in respect of the entire carriage.\n2.   All the provisions of these Uniform Rules governing the liability of the carrier shall apply also to the liability of the substitute carrier for the carriage performed by him. Articles 48 and 52 shall apply if an action is brought against the servants or any other persons whose services the substitute carrier makes use of for the performance of the carriage.\n3.   Any special agreement under which the carrier assumes obligations not imposed by these Uniform Rules or waives rights conferred by these Uniform Rules shall be of no effect in respect of the substitute carrier who has not accepted it expressly and in writing. Whether or not the substitute carrier has accepted it, the carrier shall nevertheless remain bound by the obligations or waivers resulting from such special agreement.\n4.   Where and to the extent that both the carrier and the substitute carrier are liable, their liability shall be joint and several.\n5.   The aggregate amount of compensation payable by the carrier, the substitute carrier and their servants and other persons whose services they make use of for the performance of the carriage shall not exceed the limits provided for in these Uniform Rules.\n6.   This Article shall not prejudice rights of recourse which may exist between the carrier and the substitute carrier.\nArticle 40\nPresumption of loss\n1.   The person entitled may, without being required to furnish further proof, consider an item of luggage as lost when it has not been delivered or placed at his disposal within 14 days after a request for delivery has been made in accordance with Article 22(3).\n2.   If an item of luggage deemed to have been lost is recovered within one year after the request for delivery, the carrier must notify the person entitled if his address is known or can be ascertained.\n3.   Within thirty days after receipt of a notification referred to in paragraph 2, the person entitled may require the item of luggage to be delivered to him. In that case he must pay the charges in respect of carriage of the item from the place of consignment to the place where delivery is effected and refund the compensation received less, where appropriate, any costs included therein. Nevertheless he shall retain his rights to claim compensation for delay in delivery provided for in Article 43.\n4.   If the item of luggage recovered has not been claimed within the period stated in paragraph 3 or if it is recovered more than one year after the request for delivery, the carrier shall dispose of it in accordance with the laws and prescriptions in force at the place where the item of luggage is situated.\nArticle 41\nCompensation for loss\n1.   In case of total or partial loss of registered luggage, the carrier must pay, to the exclusion of all other damages:\n(a)\nif the amount of the loss or damage suffered is proved, compensation equal to that amount but not exceeding 80 units of account per kilogram of gross mass short or 1 200 units of account per item of luggage;\n(b)\nif the amount of the loss or damage suffered is not established, liquidated damages of 20 units of account per kilogram of gross mass short or 300 units of account per item of luggage.\nThe method of compensation, by kilogram missing or by item of luggage, shall be determined by the General Conditions of Carriage.\n2.   The carrier must in addition refund the charge for the carriage of luggage and the other sums paid in relation to the carriage of the lost item as well as the customs duties and excise duties already paid.\nArticle 42\nCompensation for damage\n1.   In case of damage to registered luggage, the carrier must pay compensation equivalent to the loss in value of the luggage, to the exclusion of all other damages.\n2.   The compensation shall not exceed:\n(a)\nif all the luggage has lost value through damage, the amount which would have been payable in case of total loss;\n(b)\nif only part of the luggage has lost value through damage, the amount which would have been payable had that part been lost.\nArticle 43\nCompensation for delay in delivery\n1.   In case of delay in delivery of registered luggage, the carrier must pay in respect of each whole period of 24 hours after delivery has been requested, but subject to a maximum of 14 days:\n(a)\nif the person entitled proves that loss or damage has been suffered thereby, compensation equal to the amount of the loss or damage, up to a maximum of 0,80 units of account per kilogram of gross mass of the luggage or 14 units of account per item of luggage, delivered late;\n(b)\nif the person entitled does not prove that loss or damage has been suffered thereby, liquidated damages of 0,14 units of account per kilogram of gross mass of the luggage or 2,80 units of account per item of luggage, delivered late.\nThe methods of compensation, by kilogram missing or by item of luggage, shall be determined by the General Conditions of Carriage.\n2.   In case of total loss of luggage, the compensation provided for in paragraph 1 shall not be payable in addition to that provided for in Article 41.\n3.   In case of partial loss of luggage, the compensation provided for in paragraph 1 shall be payable in respect of that part of the luggage which has not been lost.\n4.   In case of damage to luggage not resulting from delay in delivery the compensation provided for in paragraph 1 shall, where appropriate, be payable in addition to that provided for in Article 42.\n5.   In no case shall the total of compensation provided for in paragraph 1 together with that payable under Articles 41 and 42 exceed the compensation which would be payable in case of total loss of the luggage.\nSECTION 3\nVehicles\nArticle 44\nCompensation for delay\n1.   In case of delay in loading for a reason attributable to the carrier or delay in delivery of a vehicle, the carrier must, if the person entitled proves that loss or damage has been suffered thereby, pay compensation not exceeding the amount of the carriage charge.\n2.   If, in case of delay in loading for a reason attributable to the carrier, the person entitled elects not to proceed with the contract of carriage, the carriage charge shall be refunded to him. In addition the person entitled may, if he proves that loss or damage has been suffered as a result of the delay, claim compensation not exceeding the carriage charge.\nArticle 45\nCompensation for loss\nIn case of total or partial loss of a vehicle the compensation payable to the person entitled for the loss or damage proved shall be calculated on the basis of the usual value of the vehicle.

So far as concerns articles stowed on the outside of the vehicle, including the boxes referred to in paragraph 1, the carrier shall be liable in respect of articles placed on the outside of the vehicle only if it is proved that the loss or damage results from an act or omission, which the carrier has committed either with intent to cause such a loss or damage or recklessly and with knowledge that such loss or damage would probably result.\nArticle 47\nApplicable law\nSubject to the provisions of this Section, the provisions of Section 2 relating to liability for luggage shall apply to vehicles.\nChapter IV\nCommon provisions\nArticle 48\nLoss of right to invoke the limits of liability\nThe limits of liability provided for in these Uniform Rules as well as the provisions of national law, which limit the compensation to a fixed amount, shall not apply if it is proved that the loss or damage results from an act or omission, which the carrier has committed either with intent to cause such loss or damage, or recklessly and with knowledge that such loss or damage would probably result.\nArticle 49\nConversion and interest\n1.   Where the calculation of compensation requires the conversion of sums expressed in foreign currency, conversion shall be at the exchange rate applicable on the day and at the place of payment of the compensation.\n2.   The person entitled may claim interest on compensation, calculated at five per cent per annum, from the day of the claim provided for in Article 55 or, if no such claim has been made, from the day on which legal proceedings were instituted.\n3.   However, in the case of compensation payable pursuant to Articles 27 and 28, interest shall accrue only from the day on which the events relevant to the assessment of the amount of compensation occurred, if that day is later than that of the claim or the day when legal proceedings were instituted.\n4.   In the case of luggage, interest shall only be payable if the compensation exceeds 16 units of account per luggage registration voucher.\n5.

A copy of the report must be supplied free of charge to the person entitled.\n3.   Should the person entitled not accept the findings in the report, he may request that the condition of the luggage or vehicle and the cause and amount of the loss or damage be ascertained by an expert appointed either by the parties to the contract of carriage or by a court or tribunal. The procedure to be followed shall be governed by the laws and prescriptions of the State in which such ascertainment takes place.\nArticle 55\nClaims\n1.   Claims relating to the liability of the carrier in case of death of, or personal injury to, passengers must be addressed in writing to the carrier against whom an action may be brought. In the case of a carriage governed by a single contract and performed by successive carriers the claims may also be addressed to the first or the last carrier as well as to the carrier having his principal place of business or the branch or agency which concluded the contract of carriage in the State where the passenger is domiciled or habitually resident.\n2.   Other claims relating to the contract of carriage must be addressed in writing to the carrier specified in Article 56(2) and (3).\n3.

Article 6(3), Article 16(3) and Article 25 shall also apply to the relations between successive carriers.\nArticle 62\nRight of recourse\n1.   A carrier who has paid compensation pursuant to these Uniform Rules shall have a right of recourse against the carriers who have taken part in the carriage in accordance with the following provisions:\n(a)\nthe carrier who has caused the loss or damage shall be solely liable for it;\n(b)\nwhen the loss or damage has been caused by several carriers, each shall be liable for the loss or damage he has caused; if such distinction is impossible, the compensation shall be apportioned between them in accordance with letter c);\n(c)\nif it cannot be proved which of the carriers has caused the loss or damage, the compensation shall be apportioned between all the carriers who have taken part in the carriage, except those who prove that the loss or damage was not caused by them; such apportionment shall be in proportion to their respective shares of the carriage charge.\n2.   In the case of insolvency of any one of these carriers, the unpaid share due from him shall be apportioned among all the other carriers who have taken part in the carriage, in proportion to their respective shares of the carriage charge.\nArticle 63\nProcedure for recourse\n1.   The validity of the payment made by the carrier exercising a right of recourse pursuant to Article 62 may not be disputed by the carrier against whom the right to recourse is exercised, when compensation has been determined by a court or tribunal and when the latter carrier, duly served with notice of the proceedings, has been afforded an opportunity to intervene in the proceedings. The court or tribunal seized of the principal action shall determine what time shall be allowed for such notification of the proceedings and for intervention in the proceedings.\n2.   A carrier exercising his right of recourse must present his claim in one and the same proceedings against all the carriers with whom he has not reached a settlement, failing which he shall lose his right of recourse in the case of those against whom he has not taken proceedings.\n3.   The court or tribunal shall give its decision in one and the same judgment on all recourse claims brought before it.\n4.   The carrier wishing to enforce his right of recourse may bring his action in the courts or tribunals of the State on the territory of which one of the carriers participating in the carriage has his principal place of business, or the branch or agency which concluded the contract of carriage.\n5.   When the action must be brought against several carriers, the plaintiff carrier shall be entitled to choose the court or tribunal in which he will bring the proceedings from among those having competence pursuant to paragraph 4.\n6.

It may also exempt urban, suburban and regional rail passenger services from this regulation.\nPassengers’ rights\nRail passengers have the following basic rights:\nTransport contract and information\nPassengers should be given clear and accessible information:\nbefore the journey, in particular concerning the relevant conditions applicable to the contract, timetables and the fares applied;\nduring the journey, in particular concerning any delays or interruptions to services;\nconcerning procedures for the submission of complaints;\nThe information provided to persons with disabilities and persons with reduced mobility shall be in an accessible format.\nDelays and cancellations\nIn the case of a delay of more than 60 minutes in the arrival at final destination, passengers have the right to:\nthe reimbursement of the full cost of the ticket for the part of the journey not made; or\ncontinuation or re-routing under comparable transport conditions at the earliest opportunity or at a later date at the passengers’ convenience.\nIf passengers do not opt for reimbursement but for continuation of the journey, they may claim a minimum compensation equivalent to:\n25% of the ticket price for a delay of 60 to 119 minutes;\n50% of the ticket price for a delay of 120 minutes or more.\nIn the case of a delay in arrival or departure of more than 60 minutes, passengers have the right to:\nreceive information on the situation and the estimated departure and arrival time;\nmeals and refreshments within reasonable limits;\naccommodation where a stay of one or more nights becomes necessary;\ntransport to the railway station or to the alternative departure point or to the final destination if the train is blocked on the track.\nPersons with disability and reduced mobility\nThe EU rail passenger rights legislation will ensure that persons with disability and reduced mobility can travel in a way that is comparable to other citizens. Thus, the regulation gives them the following rights:\nthe right to non-discriminatory access to transport at no additional charge;\nupon request, to be provided with information concerning the accessibility of rail services and stations;\nan assistance free of charge on board trains and at staffed stations (passengers are requested to give 48 hours’ notice of their assistance needs before departure);\nthe right to compensation if the rail undertaking is responsible for the loss or damage of their mobility equipment.\nSecurity, complaints and service quality\nPassengers’ personal security is ensured in trains and stations in cooperation with the public authorities.\nAn effective complaints handling mechanism has to be put in place. Passengers may complain to any rail undertaking involved.\nThe minimum service quality standards for rail undertakings include: passenger information and tickets;punctuality of service and general principles to cope with disruptions;cancellation of services;cleanliness of rolling stock and station facilities;customer satisfaction surveys;complaint handling, refunds and compensation for non-compliance with service quality standards;assistance provided to disabled persons and persons with reduced mobility.\nEnforcement by EU countries\nEU countries must designate an independent body or bodies in charge of the enforcement of the regulation. Passengers can submit a complaint to any of these bodies if they feel that their rights have not been respected.\nEU countries must also set up effective, proportionate and dissuasive sanctions for infringements of the regulation.\nFROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?\n              \nIt has applied since 3 December 2009.\nBACKGROUND\n              \nFor more information, see:\nPassenger rights: rail (European Commission).\n            \nFollowing the COVID-19 outbreak and introducing measures to cope with the impact of the crisis, the European Commission adopted:Commission Notice Interpretative Guidelines on EU passenger rights regulations in the context of the developing situation with Covid-19\nCommission Recommendation (EU) 2020/648 of 13 May 2020 on vouchers offered to passengers and travellers as an alternative to reimbursement for cancelled package travel and transport services in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic\nMAIN DOCUMENT\n            \nRegulation (EC) No 1371/2007 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 October 2007 on rail passengers’ rights and obligations (OJ L 315, 3.12.2007, pp  14-41)\nRELATED DOCUMENTS\n            \nDirective 2012/34/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 November 2012 establishing a single European railway area (recast) (OJ L 343, 14.12.2012, pp. 32-77)\nSuccessive amendments to Directive 2012/34/EU have been incorporated into the original document.
