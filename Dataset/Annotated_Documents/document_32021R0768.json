Therefore, the balance to be carried over should be defined.\n(4)\nMember States should conduct checks and enquiries relating to calculating, establishing and making available the Union’s own resources. In order to facilitate the application of the financial rules relating to own resources, it is necessary to ensure that the Member States and the Commission collaborate.\n(5)\nThe transparency of the system of own resources of the Union should be ensured by the provision of adequate information to the European Parliament and to the Council. Therefore, the Member States should put at the disposal of the Commission the documents and information necessary for the Commission to exercise the power conferred upon it as regards the Union’s own resources and, where necessary, send those documents and information to the Commission.\n(6)\nFor the sake of consistency and clarity, provisions should be laid down covering the powers and obligations of officials, other servants and seconded national experts who take part in inspections in relation to the Union’s own resources. In particular, the rules which all Union officials, other servants and seconded national experts have to observe with regard to professional confidentiality and the protection of personal data should be laid down. It is necessary to specify the status of seconded national experts and the possibility for the Member State concerned to object to the presence of officials of other Member States at an inspection.\n(7)\nThe arrangements whereby the Member States responsible for collecting own resources report to the Commission should make it possible for the Commission to monitor the actions of Member States to recover own resources, in particular in cases of fraud and irregularities.\n(8)\nIn order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of this Regulation, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission as regards establishing detailed rules on the reporting of fraud and irregularities that affect entitlements to traditional own resources and Member States’ annual reports on their inspections. Those powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council (4).\n(9)\nThe advisory procedure should be used for the adoption of implementing acts in order to establish detailed rules on the reporting of fraud and irregularities that affect entitlements to traditional own resources and Member States’ annual reports on their inspections, given the technical nature of those acts required for reporting purposes.\n(10)\nAppropriate parliamentary oversight, as set out in the Treaties, is required for provisions of a general nature applicable to all categories of own resources.\n(11)\nCouncil Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 608/2014 (5) should be repealed.\n(12)\nFor reasons of consistency, this Regulation should enter into force on the same day as Decision (EU, Euratom) 2020/2053 and should apply from the same date of application as that Decision, that is, from 1 January 2021,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nCHAPTER I\nDETERMINING OWN RESOURCES\nArticle 1\nCalculation and budgeting of the balance\n1.

By way of derogation from Article 8(1) of the Financial Regulation, the difference shall also be increased or decreased by the following:\n(a)\npayments made in excess of non-differentiated appropriations carried over from the previous financial year under Article 12(1) and (4) of the Financial Regulation as a result of changes in euro rates;\n(b)\nthe balance resulting from exchange gains and losses during the financial year.\n2.   The Commission shall, before the end of October in each financial year, make an estimate of the own resources collected for the entire year, on the basis of the data at its disposal at that time.
