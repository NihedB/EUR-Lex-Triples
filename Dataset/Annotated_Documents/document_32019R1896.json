{"celex_id": "32019R1896", "reference": "14.11.2019\nEN\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\nL 295/1\nREGULATION (EU) 2019/1896 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL\nof 13 November 2019\non the European Border and Coast Guard and repealing Regulations (EU) No 1052/2013 and (EU) 2016/1624\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 77(2)(b) and (d) and Article 79(2)(c) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee (1),\nHaving regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions (2),\nActing in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure (3),\nWhereas:\n(1)\nThe objective of Union policy in the field of external border management is to develop and implement European integrated border management at national and Union level, which is a necessary corollary to the free movement of persons within the Union and is a fundamental component of an area of freedom, security and justice. European integrated border management is central to improving migration management. The aim is to manage the crossing of the external borders efficiently and address migratory challenges and potential future threats at those borders, thereby contributing to addressing serious crime with a cross-border dimension and ensuring a high level of internal security within the Union. At the same time, it is necessary to act in full respect for fundamental rights and in a manner that safeguards the free movement of persons within the Union.\n(2)\nThe European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders of the Member States of the European Union was established by Council Regulation (EC) No 2007/2004 (4). Since taking up its responsibilities on 1 May 2005, it has been successful in assisting Member States with implementing the operational aspects of external border management through joint operations and rapid border interventions, risk analysis, information exchange, relations with third countries and the return of returnees.\n(3)\nThe European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders of the Member States of the European Union has been renamed the European Border and Coast Guard Agency (the ‘Agency’), commonly referred to as Frontex, and its tasks have been expanded with full continuity in all its activities and procedures. The key roles of the Agency should be: to establish a technical and operational strategy as part of the implementation of the multiannual strategic policy cycle for European integrated border management; to oversee the effective functioning of border control at the external borders; to carry out risk analysis and vulnerability assessments; to provide increased technical and operational assistance to Member States and third countries through joint operations and rapid border interventions; to ensure the practical execution of measures in a situation requiring urgent action at the external borders; to provide technical and operational assistance in the support of search and rescue operations for persons in distress at sea; and to organise, coordinate and conduct return operations and return interventions.\n(4)\nSince the beginning of the migratory crisis in 2015, the Commission has taken up important initiatives and has proposed a series of measures with a view to strengthening the protection of the external borders and restoring the normal functioning of the Schengen area. A proposal for significantly enhancing the mandate of the European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders was presented in December 2015 and negotiated swiftly in 2016. The resulting regulation, Regulation (EU) 2016/1624 of the European Parliament and of the Council (5), entered into force on 6 October 2016.\n(5)\nHowever, the Union framework in the areas of external border control, return, combating cross-border crime, and asylum still needs to be further improved. To that end, and to further underpin the current and future envisaged operational efforts, the European Border and Coast Guard should be reformed by giving the Agency a stronger mandate and, in particular, by providing it with the necessary capabilities in the form of a European Border and Coast Guard standing corps (the ‘standing corps’). The standing corps should gradually but swiftly reach the strategic target of having a capacity of 10 000 operational staff, as set out in Annex I, with executive powers, where applicable, to effectively support Member States on the ground in their efforts to protect the external borders, to fight cross-border crime and to significantly step up the effective and sustainable return of irregular migrants. Such a capacity of 10 000 operational staff represents the maximum available capacity required to effectively address existing and future operational needs for border and return operations in the Union and third countries, including a rapid reaction capacity to face future crises.\n(6)\nThe Commission should carry out a review of the overall number and composition of the standing corps, including the size of individual Member States' contributions thereto, as well as of its training, expertise and professionalism. By March 2024, the Commission should, where necessary, submit appropriate proposals to amend Annexes I, II, III and IV. Where the Commission does not present a proposal, it should explain the reason therefor.\n(7)\nThe implementation of this Regulation, in particular the establishment of the standing corps, including after the Commission's review of the standing corps, should be subject to the multiannual financial framework.\n(8)\nIn its conclusions of 28 June 2018, the European Council called for further strengthening of the supportive role of the Agency, including in cooperation with third countries, through increased resources and an enhanced mandate, with a view to ensuring effective external border control and significantly stepping up the effective return of irregular migrants.\n(9)\nIt is necessary to monitor the crossing of the external borders efficiently, to address migratory challenges and potential future threats at the external borders, to ensure a high level of internal security within the Union, to safeguard the functioning of the Schengen area and to respect the overarching principle of solidarity. Those actions and objectives should be accompanied by the proactive management of migration, including the necessary measures in third countries. To that end, it is necessary to consolidate the European Border and Coast Guard and to further expand the mandate of the Agency.\n(10)\nWhen implementing European integrated border management, coherence with other policy objectives should be ensured.\n(11)\nEuropean integrated border management, based on the four-tier access control model, comprises measures in third countries, such as under the common visa policy, measures with neighbouring third countries, border control measures at the external borders, risk analysis and measures within the Schengen area and return.\n(12)\nEuropean integrated border management should be implemented as a shared responsibility of the Agency and the national authorities responsible for border management, including coast guards to the extent that they carry out maritime border surveillance operations and any other border control tasks, as well as the national authorities responsible for return. While Member States retain the primary responsibility for the management of their external borders in their interest and in the interest of all Member States and are responsible for issuing return decisions, the Agency should support the application of Union measures relating to the management of the external borders and return by reinforcing, assessing and coordinating the actions of the Member States which implement those measures. The activities of the Agency should complement the efforts of the Member States.\n(13)\nTo ensure the effective implementation of European integrated border management and increase the efficiency of Union return policy, a European Border and Coast Guard should be established. It should be provided with the requisite financial and human resources and equipment. The European Border and Coast Guard should be composed of the Agency and the national authorities responsible for border management, including coast guards to the extent that they carry out border control tasks, as well as the national authorities responsible for return. As such it will rely upon the common use of information, capabilities and systems at national level and the response of the Agency at Union level.\n(14)\nEuropean integrated border management does not alter the respective competences of the Commission and the Member States in the customs area, in particular regarding controls, risk management and the exchange of information.\n(15)\nThe development of policy and law on external border control and return, including the development of a multiannual strategic policy for European integrated border management, remains a responsibility of the Union institutions. Close coordination between the Agency and those institutions should be guaranteed.\n(16)\nThe effective implementation of European integrated border management by the European Border and Coast Guard should be ensured by means of a multiannual strategic policy cycle. The multiannual cycle should set out an integrated, unified and continuous process for providing strategic guidelines to all the relevant actors at Union level and at national level in the area of border management and return so that those actors are able to implement European integrated border management in a coherent manner. It should also address all relevant interactions of the European Border and Coast Guard with the Commission and other Union institutions, bodies, offices and agencies, and cooperation with other relevant partners, including third countries and third parties as appropriate.\n(17)\nEuropean integrated border management requires integrated planning between the Member States and the Agency for border and return operations in order to prepare responses to challenges at the external borders, for contingency planning and for coordinating the long-term development of capabilities both in terms of recruitment and training and in terms of the acquisition and development of equipment.\n(18)\nThe Agency should develop technical standards for information exchange as provided for in this Regulation. In addition, for the effective implementation of Regulation (EU) 2016/399 of the European Parliament and of the Council (6), common minimum standards for external border surveillance should be developed. To that end, the Agency should be able to contribute to the development of common minimum standards in line with the respective competences of the Member States and the Commission. Those common minimum standards should be developed taking into account the type of borders, the impact levels attributed by the Agency to each external border section and other factors such as geographical particularities. When developing those common minimum standards, possible limitations deriving from national law should be taken into account.\n(19)\nThe technical standards for information systems and software applications should be aligned with the standards used by the European Union Agency for the Operational Management of Large-Scale IT Systems in the Area of Freedom, Security and Justice (eu-LISA) for other IT systems in the area of freedom, security and justice.\n(20)\nThe implementation of this Regulation does not affect the division of competence between the Union and the Member States or the obligations of Member States under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea, the International Convention on Maritime Search and Rescue, the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime and its Protocol against the Smuggling of Migrants by Land, Sea and Air, the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees, the 1967 Protocol thereto, the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, the United Nations Convention relating to the Status of Stateless Persons and other relevant international instruments.\n(21)\nThe implementation of this Regulation does not affect Regulation (EU) No 656/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council (7). Sea operations should be carried out in a way that, in all instances, ensures the safety of the persons intercepted or rescued, the safety of the units that take part in the sea operation in question and the safety of third parties.\n(22)\nThe Agency should carry out its tasks in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity and without prejudice to the responsibilities of the Member States with regard to maintaining law and order and safeguarding internal security.\n(23)\nThe Agency should carry out its tasks without prejudice to the competence of the Member States as regards defence.\n(24)\nThe extended tasks and competence of the Agency should be balanced with strengthened fundamental rights safeguards and increased accountability and liability, in particular in terms of the exercise of executive powers by the statutory staff.\n(25)\nThe Agency relies on the cooperation of Member States to be able to perform its tasks effectively. In that respect, it is important for the Agency and the Member States to act in good faith and to exchange accurate information in a timely manner. No Member State should be obliged to supply information the disclosure of which it considers contrary to the essential interests of its security.\n(26)\nMember States should also, in their own interest and in the interest of the other Member States, contribute relevant data necessary for the activities carried out by the Agency, including for the purposes of situational awareness, risk analysis, vulnerability assessments and integrated planning. Equally, they should ensure that the data are accurate and up-to-date and are obtained and entered lawfully. Where those data include personal data, Union law on data protection should apply in full.\n(27)\nThe communication network established under this Regulation should be based on and replace the EUROSUR communication network developed in the framework of Regulation (EU) No 1052/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council (8). The communication network established under this Regulation should be used for all secured information exchanges within the European Border and Coast Guard. The level of accreditation of the communication network should be increased to the classification level of CONFIDENTIEL UE/EU CONFIDENTIAL in order to improve information assurance between the Member States and with the Agency.\n(28)\nEUROSUR is necessary for the European Border and Coast Guard to be able to provide a framework for the exchange of information and the operational cooperation between Member States' national authorities and with the Agency. EUROSUR provides national authorities and the Agency with the infrastructure and tools needed to improve their situational awareness and to increase reaction capability at the external borders for the purpose of detecting, preventing and combating illegal immigration and cross-border crime, thereby contributing to saving the lives of migrants and ensuring their protection.\n(29)\nMember States should establish national coordination centres to improve the exchange of information and cooperation between Member States and with the Agency with respect to border surveillance and the carrying out of border checks. It is essential for the proper functioning of EUROSUR that all national authorities with a responsibility for external border surveillance under national law cooperate via national coordination centres.\n(30)\nThe role of the national coordination centre to coordinate and exchange information among all authorities with a responsibility for external border control at national level is without prejudice to the competence established at national level with regard to planning and implementing border control.\n(31)\nThis Regulation should not hinder Member States from also making their national coordination centres responsible for coordinating the exchange of information and for cooperation with regard to other components of European integrated border management.\n(32)\nThe quality of the information exchanged between the Member States and the Agency and the timeliness of the exchange of such information are prerequisites for the proper functioning of European integrated border management. Building on the success of EUROSUR, that quality should be ensured through standardisation, the automation of the information exchange across networks and systems, information assurance and control of the quality of the data and information transmitted.\n(33)\nThe Agency should provide the necessary assistance for the development and operation of EUROSUR, including the interoperability of systems, in particular by establishing, maintaining and coordinating EUROSUR.\n(34)\nEUROSUR should provide an exhaustive situational picture not only at the external borders but also within the Schengen area and in the pre-frontier area. It should cover land, sea and air border surveillance and border checks. The provision of situational awareness within the Schengen area should not lead to operational activities of the Agency at the internal borders of the Member States.\n(35)\nAir border surveillance should be an element of border management since both commercial and private flights and remotely piloted aircraft systems are used for illegal activities related to immigration and cross-border crime. Air border surveillance aims to detect and monitor such suspicious flights crossing or intending to cross the external borders and to perform related risk analysis with a view to triggering reaction capabilities by the competent authorities of the Union and the Member States. For that purpose, inter-agency cooperation at Union level should be promoted between the Agency, the Network Manager of the European Air Traffic Management Network (EATMN) and the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA). Where relevant, Member States should be able to receive information on suspicious external flights and react accordingly. The Agency should monitor and support research and innovation activities in that area.\n(36)\nThe reporting of events related to unauthorised secondary movements in EUROSUR will contribute to the monitoring by the Agency of migratory flows towards and within the Union for the purpose of risk analysis and situational awareness. The implementing act laying down the details of the information layers of the situational pictures and the rules for the establishment of specific situational pictures should further define the type of reporting to best meet this objective.\n(37)\nThe EUROSUR fusion services supplied by the Agency should be based on the common application of surveillance tools and inter-agency cooperation at Union level, including the provision of Copernicus security services. EUROSUR fusion services should provide the Member States and the Agency with value-added information services related to European integrated border management. EUROSUR fusion services should be expanded to support border checks, air border surveillance and the monitoring of migration flows.\n(38)\nThe practice of travelling in small and unseaworthy vessels has dramatically increased the number of migrants drowning at the southern maritime external borders. EUROSUR should considerably improve the operational and technical ability of the Agency and the Member States to detect such small vessels and to improve the reaction capability of the Member States, thereby contributing to reducing the loss of lives of migrants, including in the framework of search and rescue operations.\n(39)\nIt is recognised in this Regulation that migratory routes are also taken by persons in need of international protection.\n(40)\nThe Agency should prepare general and tailored risk analyses based on a common integrated risk analysis model, to be applied by the Agency itself and by Member States. The Agency should, based also on information provided by Member States, provide adequate information covering all aspects relevant to European integrated border management, especially border control, return, the phenomenon of unauthorised secondary movements of third-country nationals within the Union in terms of trends, volume and routes, prevention of cross-border crime including facilitation of unauthorised border crossings, trafficking in human beings, terrorism and threats of a hybrid nature, as well as the situation in relevant third countries, so as to allow for appropriate measures to be taken or to tackle identified threats and risks with a view to improving the integrated management of the external borders.\n(41)\nGiven its activities at the external borders, the Agency should contribute to preventing and detecting cross-border crime, such as migrant smuggling, trafficking in human beings and terrorism, where it is appropriate for it to act and where it has obtained relevant information through its activities. It should coordinate its activities with Europol, which is the agency responsible for supporting and strengthening Member States' actions and their cooperation in preventing and combating serious crime affecting two or more Member States. The cross-border dimension is characterised by crimes that are directly linked to unauthorised crossings of the external borders, including trafficking in human beings or smuggling of migrants. In accordance with Council Directive 2002/90/EC (9), Member States are able to decide not to impose sanctions where the aim of the behaviour is to provide humanitarian assistance to migrants.\n(42)\nIn a spirit of shared responsibility, the role of the Agency should be to monitor regularly the management of the external borders, including the respect for fundamental rights in the border management and return activities of the Agency. The Agency should ensure proper and effective monitoring not only through situational awareness and risk analysis, but also through the presence of experts from its own staff in Member States. The Agency should therefore be able to deploy liaison officers to Member States for a period of time during which the liaison officer reports to the executive director. The reports of the liaison officers should form part of the vulnerability assessment.\n(43)\nThe Agency should carry out a vulnerability assessment based on objective criteria to assess the capacity and readiness of the Member States to face challenges at their external borders and to contribute to the standing corps and technical equipment pool. The vulnerability assessment should include an assessment of the equipment, infrastructure, staff, budget and financial resources of Member States as well as their contingency plans to address possible crises at the external borders. Member States should take measures to address any deficiencies identified in that assessment. The executive director should identify the measures to be taken and recommend them to the Member State concerned. The executive director should also set a time limit within which those measures should be taken and closely monitor their timely implementation. Where the necessary measures are not taken within the set time limit, the matter should be referred to the management board for a further decision.\n(44)\nIf the Agency is not provided with the accurate and timely information necessary for carrying out a vulnerability assessment, it should be able to take that fact into account when performing the vulnerability assessment, unless duly justified reasons are provided for withholding the data.\n(45)\nThe vulnerability assessment and the Schengen evaluation mechanism established by Council Regulation (EU) No 1053/2013 (10) are two complementary mechanisms for guaranteeing Union quality control on the proper functioning of the Schengen area and ensuring constant preparedness at both Union and national levels to respond to any challenges at the external borders. While the Schengen evaluation mechanism is the primary method for evaluating the implementation of and compliance with Union law in the Member States, the synergies between the vulnerability assessment and the Schengen evaluation mechanism should be maximised with a view to establishing an improved situational picture of the functioning of the Schengen area, avoiding, to the extent possible, duplication of efforts on the Member States' side, and ensuring the better-coordinated use of the relevant Union financial instruments supporting the management of the external borders. For that purpose, the regular exchange of information between the Agency and the Commission on the results of both mechanisms should be established.\n(46)\nGiven that the Member States establish border sections, to which the Agency attributes impact levels, and that the reaction capabilities of the Member States and of the Agency should be linked to those impact levels, a fourth impact level — the critical impact level — should be established to be attributed to a border section on a temporary basis where the Schengen area is at risk and where the Agency should intervene.\n(47)\nWhere a high or critical impact level is attributed to a maritime border section due to an increase of illegal immigration, the Member States concerned should take that increase into account for the planning and conducting of search and rescue operations since such a situation could generate an increase in requests for assistance for persons in distress at sea.\n(48)\nThe Agency should organise appropriate technical and operational assistance to Member States in order to reinforce their capacity to implement their obligations with regard to external border control and to face challenges at the external borders resulting from an increased number of arrivals of irregular migrants or cross-border crime. Such assistance should be without prejudice to the relevant national authorities' competence to initiate criminal investigations. In that respect, the Agency should, either on its own initiative and with the agreement of the Member State concerned or at the request of that Member State, organise and coordinate joint operations for one or more Member States, deploy border management teams, migration management support teams and return teams (collectively referred to as ‘teams’) from the standing corps and provide the necessary technical equipment.\n(49)\nWhere there is a specific and disproportionate challenge at the external borders, the Agency should, either on its own initiative and with the agreement of the Member State concerned or at the request of that Member State, organise and coordinate rapid border interventions and deploy both teams from the standing corps and technical equipment, including from the rapid reaction equipment pool. The rapid reaction equipment pool should contain a limited number of items of equipment needed for possible rapid border interventions. Rapid border interventions should provide reinforcement for a limited period of time in situations where an immediate response is required and where such an intervention would provide an effective response. To ensure that such intervention is effective, Member States should make staff that they second to the Agency, provide to the Agency for short-term deployment and deploy for the purposes of the reserve for rapid reaction available to form relevant teams and provide the necessary technical equipment. Where the crew deployed with the technical equipment of a Member State originates in that Member State, it should count as part of that Member State's contribution to the standing corps. The Agency and the Member State concerned should agree upon an operational plan.\n(50)\nWhere a Member State faces specific and disproportionate migratory challenges at particular areas of its external borders characterised by large, inward, mixed migratory flows, the Member States should be able to rely on increased technical and operational reinforcements. Those reinforcements should be provided in hotspot areas by migration management support teams. Those teams should be composed of operational staff to be deployed from the standing corps and experts from the European Asylum Support Office (EASO), Europol and, where relevant, the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights, other Union bodies, offices and agencies, and Member States. The Commission should ensure the necessary coordination of the assessment of needs submitted by Member States. The Agency should assist the Commission in the coordination among the different agencies on the ground. The Commission should, in cooperation with the host Member State and relevant Union agencies, establish the terms of cooperation at hotspot areas. The Commission should ensure the cooperation of the relevant agencies within their respective mandates and be responsible for coordinating the activities of the migration management support teams.\n(51)\nMember States should ensure that any authorities which are likely to receive applications for international protection, such as the police, border guards, immigration authorities and personnel of detention facilities, have the relevant information. They should also ensure that such authorities' personnel receive the necessary level of training which is appropriate to their tasks and responsibilities and instructions to inform applicants as to where and how applications for international protection may be lodged and instructions as to how to refer persons in a vulnerable situation to the appropriate referral mechanisms.\n(52)\nIn its conclusions of 28 June 2018, the European Council reconfirmed the importance of relying on a comprehensive approach to migration and considered that migration is a challenge not only for one Member State but also for Europe as a whole. In that respect, it highlighted the importance for the Union of providing full support to ensure an orderly management of migration flows.\n(53)\nThe Agency and EASO should cooperate closely in order to address effectively migratory challenges characterised by large inward mixed migratory flows, in particular at the external borders. In particular, the Agency and EASO should coordinate their activities and support Member States to facilitate procedures regarding international protection and the return procedure with regard to third-country nationals whose applications for international protection are rejected. The Agency and EASO should also cooperate in other common operational activities such as shared risk analysis, the collection of statistical data, training, and support to Member States in connection with contingency planning.\n(54)\nNational authorities carrying out coast guard functions are responsible for a wide range of tasks, which may include maritime safety, security, search and rescue, border control, fisheries control, customs control, general law enforcement and environmental protection. The Agency, the European Fisheries Control Agency (EFCA) and the European Maritime Safety Agency (EMSA) should therefore strengthen their cooperation both with each other and with the national authorities carrying out coast guard functions to increase maritime situational awareness and to support coherent and cost-efficient action. Synergies between the various actors in the maritime environment should be in line with European integrated border management and maritime security strategies.\n(55)\nIn hotspot areas, the Member States should cooperate with the relevant Union agencies, which should act within their respective mandates and powers, under the coordination of the Commission. The Commission, in cooperation with the relevant Union agencies, should ensure that activities in hotspot areas comply with relevant Union law and fundamental rights.\n(56)\nWhere justified by the results of the vulnerability assessment or risk analysis or where a critical impact level has been temporarily attributed to one or more border sections, the executive director of the Agency should recommend to the Member State concerned to initiate and carry out joint operations or rapid border interventions.\n(57)\nWhere external border control is rendered ineffective to such an extent that it risks jeopardising the functioning of the Schengen area, either because a Member State does not take the necessary measures in line with a vulnerability assessment or because a Member State facing specific and disproportionate challenges at the external borders has not requested sufficient support from the Agency or is not implementing such support, a unified, rapid and effective response should be delivered at Union level. For the purpose of mitigating these risks, and to ensure better coordination at Union level, the Commission should propose to the Council a decision that identifies the measures to be implemented by the Agency and requires the Member State concerned to cooperate with the Agency in the implementation of those measures. The implementing power to adopt such a decision should be conferred on the Council because of the potentially politically sensitive nature of the measures to be decided, which are likely to touch on national executive and enforcement powers. The Agency should then determine the actions to be taken for the practical execution of the measures indicated in the Council decision. The Agency should draw up an operational plan with the Member State concerned. The Member State concerned should facilitate the implementation of the Council decision and the operational plan by fulfilling, inter alia, its obligations as provided for in this Regulation. If a Member State does not comply with that Council decision within 30 days and does not cooperate with the Agency in the implementation of the measures contained in that decision, the Commission should be able to trigger the specific procedure provided for in Article 29 of Regulation (EU) 2016/399 to address exceptional circumstances putting the overall functioning of the area without internal border control at risk.\n(58)\nThe standing corps should be composed of four categories of operational staff, namely statutory staff, staff seconded to the Agency by the Member States for a long term, staff provided by Member States for short-term deployments and staff forming part of the reserve for rapid reaction for rapid border interventions. Operational staff should consist of border guards, return escorts, return specialists, and other relevant staff. The standing corps should be deployed in the framework of teams. The actual number of operational staff deployed from the standing corps should depend on operational needs.\n(59)\nOperational staff deployed as members of the teams should have all the necessary powers to carry out border control and return tasks, including the tasks requiring executive powers, set out in relevant national law or in this Regulation. Where statutory staff exercise executive powers, the Agency should be liable for any damage caused.\n(60)\nMember States should contribute to the standing corps in accordance with Annex II for long-term secondments and Annex III for short-term deployments. The individual contributions of Member States should be established on the basis of the distribution key agreed during the negotiations in 2016 on Regulation (EU) 2016/1624 for the purposes of the rapid reaction pool and set out in Annex I to that Regulation. That distribution key should be proportionally adapted to the size of the standing corps. Those contributions should also be established in a proportionate way for the Schengen associated countries.\n(61)\nWhen selecting the numbers and profiles of staff to be indicated in the decision of the management board, the executive director should apply the principles of equal treatment and proportionality, in particular with regard to the national capabilities of Member States.\n(62)\nThe exact timing for short-term deployments from the standing corps and for making available technical equipment co-financed under the specific actions of the Internal Security Fund or any other dedicated Union funding should be agreed between each Member State and the Agency through annual bilateral negotiations, taking into account capacity and proportionality. When requesting national contributions to the standing corps, the executive director should apply as a general rule the principles of proportionality and equal treatment of Member States with the aim of preventing situations that would substantially affect the discharge of national tasks in one Member State by requesting the deployment of the annual contributions of that Member State in one particular period of four months. Such arrangements should include the possibility for Member States to fulfil their obligations regarding deployment periods by means of non-consecutive periods. With regard to short-term deployments from the standing corps, Member States should also be able to fulfil their obligations for short-term deployment in a cumulative manner, by deploying more staff for shorter periods or by deploying the individual staff members for more than four months in accordance with the planning agreed through annual bilateral negotiations.\n(63)\nWithout prejudice to the timely conclusion of the operational plan regarding sea operations, the Agency should provide participating Member States, at the earliest possible stage, with specific information on the relevant jurisdiction and applicable law, in particular on the prerogatives of the commanders of ships and aircraft, the conditions of the use of force and the imposition of restrictive or custodial measures.\n(64)\nThe long-term development of human resources to secure the contributions of the Member States to the standing corps should be supported by a financial support system. For that purpose, it is appropriate to authorise the Agency to use the award of grants to the Member States without a call for proposals under financing not linked to costs subject to the fulfilment of the conditions set out in Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2018/1046 of the European Parliament and of the Council (11). The financial support should enable Member States to hire and train additional staff to provide them with the necessary flexibility to comply with the mandatory contributions to the standing corps. The financial support system should take into account the time required for recruitment and training, and it should therefore be based on the N + 2 rule. The dedicated financing system should strike the right balance between the risks of irregularities and fraud and costs of control. This Regulation sets the essential conditions for triggering the financial support, namely the recruitment and training of the adequate number of border guards or other specialists corresponding to the number of officers seconded to the Agency for a long term or the effective deployment of officers during the Agency's operational activities for a consecutive or non-consecutive period of at least four months or on a pro-rata basis for deployments for a consecutive or a non-consecutive period of less than four months. Given the lack of relevant and comparable data on actual costs across Member States, the development of a cost-based financing scheme would be overly complex and would not address the need for a simple, fast, efficient and effective financing scheme. For the purpose of fixing the amount of such financing to different Member States, it is appropriate to use as a reference amount the annual salary of contractual agents in function group III, grade 8, step 1 of the institutions of the Union, adjusted by a corrective coefficient per Member State in line with the principle of sound financial management and in the spirit of equal treatment. When implementing such financial support, the Agency and Member States should ensure that the principles of co-financing and no double funding are complied with.\n(65)\nIn order to alleviate the possible impact on the national services related to the recruitment of statutory staff for the standing corps, support should be provided to the relevant services of Member States to cover training investments for new personnel replacing such departing personnel.\n(66)\nIn view of the deployment of the standing corps on the territories of third countries, the Agency should develop the capabilities for its own command and control structures as well as a procedure to ensure that the members of the teams can be held civilly and criminally liable.\n(67)\nIn order to allow for effective deployments from the standing corps beginning on 1 January 2021, certain decisions and implementing measures should be taken and put in place as soon as possible. Therefore, the Agency, together with the Member States and the Commission, should engage in the preparation of such implementing measures and decisions for adoption by the management board. Such a preparatory process should encompass the relevant recruitment by the Agency and the Member States as referred to in this Regulation.\n(68)\nIn order to ensure the continuity of the support for operational activities organised by the Agency, however, all deployments, including under the rapid reaction pool, to be made by 31 December 2020 should be planned and implemented in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2016/1624 and in accordance with the annual bilateral negotiations carried out in 2019. To that end, the relevant provisions of that Regulation should only be repealed with effect from 1 January 2021.\n(69)\nThe Agency's workforce should consist of staff performing the tasks devoted to the Agency, either in the Agency's headquarters or as part of the standing corps. Statutory staff within the standing corps should primarily be deployed as members of the teams. It should be possible to recruit only a limited and clearly defined number of statutory staff to perform supportive functions for the establishment of the standing corps, in particular at headquarters.\n(70)\nTo overcome the persistent gaps in the voluntary pooling of technical equipment from Member States, in particular as regards large-scale assets, the Agency should have its own necessary equipment to be deployed in joint operations or rapid border interventions or any other operational activities. Those assets should be authorised by the Member States as being on government service. While the Agency has been legally able to acquire or lease its own technical equipment since 2011, that possibility was significantly hindered by the lack of budgetary resources.\n(71)\nConsequently, in order to match the level of ambition underlying the establishment of the standing corps, the Commission earmarked a significant envelope under the 2021-2027 multiannual financial framework to allow the Agency to acquire, maintain and operate the necessary air, sea and land assets corresponding to its operational needs. While the acquisition of the necessary assets could be a lengthy process, especially for large assets, the Agency's own equipment should ultimately become the backbone of the operational deployments with additional contributions by Member States to be called upon in exceptional circumstances. The Agency's equipment should be largely operated by the Agency's technical crews that are part of the standing corps. In order to ensure the effective use of the proposed financial resources, the acquisition of the necessary assets should be based on a multiannual strategy decided as early as possible by the management board. It is necessary to ensure the sustainability of the Agency by means of future multiannual financial frameworks and to maintain comprehensive European integrated border management.\n(72)\nIn the implementation of this Regulation, the Agency and the Member States should make the best possible use of existing capabilities in terms of human resources as well as technical equipment, both at Union and national level.\n(73)\nThe long-term development of new capabilities within the European Border and Coast Guard should be coordinated between the Member States and the Agency in line with the multiannual strategic policy cycle for European integrated border management, taking into account the long duration of certain processes. That includes the recruitment and training of new border guards, which, during their career, could serve both in Member States and as part of the standing corps, the acquisition, maintenance and disposal of equipment, for which opportunities for interoperability and economies of scale should be sought, and the development of new equipment and related technologies, including through research.\n(74)\nThe capability roadmap should converge the capability development plans of Member States and the multiannual planning of the Agency's resources to optimise long-term investment to best protect the external borders.\n(75)\nTaking into account the enhanced mandate of the Agency, the setting up of the standing corps and its strengthened presence on the ground at the external borders and its increased engagement in the field of return, it should be possible for the Agency to establish antenna offices situated at locations in the proximity of its significant operational activities for the duration of those activities, to act as an interface between the Agency and the host Member State, to deal with coordination and logistical and support tasks and to facilitate cooperation between the Agency and the host Member State.\n(76)\nIn light of the fact that inter-agency cooperation forms part of European integrated border management, the Agency should closely cooperate with all relevant Union bodies, offices and agencies, in particular with Europol and EASO. Such cooperation should take place at the level of headquarters, in operational areas and, where relevant, at the level of antenna offices.\n(77)\nThe Agency and the Member States, in particular their training academies, should cooperate closely with respect to the training of the standing corps, while ensuring that training programmes are harmonised and foster the common values enshrined in the Treaties. The Agency should be able, after obtaining the approval of the management board, to set up an Agency training centre to facilitate further the inclusion of a common European culture in the training provided.\n(78)\nThe Agency should further develop common core curricula and adequate training tools for border management and return, including specific training on the protection of vulnerable persons, including children. It should also offer additional training courses and seminars related to integrated border management tasks, including for officers of the competent national bodies. The Agency should provide the members of the standing corps with specialised training relevant to their tasks and powers. That should include training on relevant Union and international law and on fundamental rights. The Agency should be authorised to organise training activities in cooperation with Member States and third countries on their territories.\n(79)\nThe return of third-country nationals who do not fulfil or who no longer fulfil the conditions for entry, stay or residence in the Member States, in accordance with Directive 2008/115/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (12), is an essential component of the comprehensive efforts to tackle illegal immigration and represents an important issue of substantial public interest.\n(80)\nThe Agency should step up its assistance to Member States for returning third-country nationals, subject to Union return policy and in compliance with Directive 2008/115/EC. In particular, the Agency should coordinate and organise return operations from one or more Member States and organise and conduct return interventions to reinforce the return systems of Member States that require increased technical and operational assistance to comply with their obligation to return third-country nationals in accordance with that Directive.\n(81)\nThe Agency should, in full respect for fundamental rights and without prejudice to the Member States' responsibility for issuing return decisions, provide technical and operational assistance to Member States in the return process, including in the identification of third-country nationals and in other pre-return and return-related activities of the Member States. In addition, the Agency should assist Member States in the acquisition of travel documents for return, in cooperation with the authorities of the relevant third countries.\n(82)\nThe Agency should allow, subject to the agreement of the Member State concerned, the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment of the Council of Europe to conduct visits to where it carries out return operations, within the framework of the monitoring mechanism established by the members of the Council of Europe under the European Convention for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.\n(83)\nThe assistance to Member States in carrying out return procedures should include the provision of practical information on third countries of return relevant for the implementation of this Regulation, such as the provision of contact details or other logistical information necessary for the smooth and dignified conduct of return operations. The assistance should also include the operation and maintenance of a platform for the exchange of data and information necessary for the Agency to provide technical and operational assistance in accordance with this Regulation. That platform should have a communication infrastructure enabling the automated transmission of statistical data by the Member States' return management systems.\n(84)\nThe possible existence of an arrangement between a Member State and a third country does not absolve the Agency or the Member States from their obligations or liability under Union or international law, in particular as regards compliance with the principle of non-refoulement and the prohibition of torture and inhuman or degrading treatment.\n(85)\nMember States should be able to cooperate at operational level with other Member States or third countries at the external borders, including as regards military operations with a law enforcement purpose, to the extent that that cooperation is compatible with the actions of the Agency.\n(86)\nThe Agency should improve the exchange of information and cooperation with other Union bodies, offices and agencies, such as Europol, EASO, EMSA, the European Union Satellite Centre, EASA and the Network Manager of the EATMN in order to make the best use of information, capabilities and systems which are already available at European level, such as Copernicus, the Union Earth observation and monitoring programme.\n(87)\nCooperation with third countries is an important element of European integrated border management. It should serve to promote European border management and return standards, to exchange information and risk analysis, and to facilitate the implementation of returns with a view to increasing their efficiency and to supporting third countries in the area of border management and migration, including through the deployment of the standing corps where such support is required to protect external borders and the effective management of the Union's migration policy.\n(88)\nWhere the Commission recommends that the Council authorise it to negotiate a status agreement with a third country, the Commission should assess the fundamental rights situation relevant to the areas covered by the status agreement in that third country and inform the European Parliament thereof.\n(89)\nCooperation with third countries should take place in the framework of the external action of the Union and in line with the principles and objectives laid down in Article 21 of the Treaty on European Union (TEU). The Commission should ensure consistency between European integrated border management and other Union policies in the field of the Union's external action and, in particular, the Common Security and Defence Policy. The Commission should be assisted by the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy. Such cooperation should take place with regard to, in particular, the activities of the Agency taking place on the territory of third countries or involving the officials of third countries in areas such as risk analysis, planning and conduct of operations, training, information exchange and cooperation.\n(90)\nIn order to ensure that the information contained in EUROSUR is as complete and up to date as possible, in particular with regard to the situation in third countries, the Agency should cooperate with the authorities of third countries either in the framework of bilateral and multilateral agreements between the Member States and third countries, including regional networks, or through working arrangements concluded between the Agency and the relevant authorities of third countries. For those purposes, the European External Action Service and Union delegations and offices should provide all information that could be relevant for EUROSUR.\n(91)\nThis Regulation includes provisions on cooperation with third countries because well-structured and permanent exchange of information and cooperation with such countries, including but not limited to neighbouring third countries, are key factors for achieving the objectives of European integrated border management. It is essential that any exchange of information and any cooperation between Member States and third countries take place in full compliance with fundamental rights.\n(92)\nThe assistance to third countries should complement the Agency's support for Member States in the application of Union measures relating to the implementation of European integrated border management.\n(93)\nIt should be possible for the bilateral and multilateral agreements concluded by Member States with third countries in the areas covered by European integrated border management to contain security sensitive information. Where notified to the Commission, such information should be handled by the Commission in accordance with the applicable security rules.\n(94)\nTo establish a comprehensive situational picture and risk analysis covering the pre-frontier area, the Agency and the national coordination centres should collect information and coordinate with immigration liaison officers deployed in third countries by Member States, the Commission, the Agency or other Union bodies, offices and agencies.\n(95)\nThe False and Authentic Documents Online (‘FADO’) system was established by Council Joint Action 98/700/JHA (13) within the General Secretariat of the Council enabling Member States' authorities to have at their disposal information on any new forgery methods that are detected and on the new genuine documents that are in circulation.\n(96)\nIn its conclusions of 27 March 2017, the Council stated that the management of the FADO system is outdated and that a change of its legal basis is required in order to continue meeting the requirements of justice and home affairs policies. The Council also noted that synergies could be exploited in that regard using the Agency's expertise in the area of document fraud and the work the Agency has already been carrying out in the field. It is therefore intended that the Agency take over the administration and the operational and technical management of the FADO system from the General Secretariat of the Council as soon as the European Parliament and the Council have adopted the relevant legal act on the FADO system replacing Joint Action 98/700/JHA.\n(97)\nPrior to the adoption of the relevant legal act on the FADO system, it is desirable to ensure that the FADO system is fully operational until the transfer is effectively carried out and the existing data are transferred to the new system. The ownership of the existing data would then be transferred to the Agency.\n(98)\nAny processing of personal data by the Agency within the framework of this Regulation should be conducted in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 of the European Parliament and of the Council (14).\n(99)\nAny processing of personal data by Member States within the framework of this Regulation should be conducted in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council (15) or Directive (EU) 2016/680 of the European Parliament and of the Council (16), as applicable.\n(100)\nIn the context of return, third-country nationals frequently do not hold any identification documents and do not cooperate as regards the establishment of their identity by withholding information or providing incorrect personal data. Given the particular policy need for expedient return procedures, it is necessary for the Agency to be able to restrict certain rights of data subjects so as to prevent the abuse of such rights from impeding the proper implementation of return procedures and the successful enforcement of return decisions by the Member States or from preventing the Agency from performing its tasks efficiently. In particular, the exercise of the right to the restriction of processing could significantly delay and obstruct the carrying out of the return operations. Furthermore, in some cases, the right of access by the third-country national could jeopardise a return operation by increasing the risk of absconding should the third-country national learn that the Agency is processing his or her data in the context of a planned return operation. The right to rectification could increase the risk that the third-country national in question will mislead the authorities by providing incorrect data. In order to enable the Agency to restrict certain rights of data subjects, it should be able to adopt internal rules on such restrictions.\n(101)\nIn order to properly implement its tasks in the area of return, including by assisting Member States in the proper implementation of return procedures and the successful enforcement of return decisions, as well as to facilitate return operations, the Agency might need to transfer the personal data of returnees to third countries. The third countries of return are not often subject to adequacy decisions adopted by the Commission under Article 45 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 or under Article 36 of Directive (EU) 2016/680, and have often not concluded or do not intend to conclude a readmission agreement with the Union or otherwise provide for appropriate safeguards within the meaning of Article 48 of Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 or within the meaning of the national provisions transposing Article 37 of Directive (EU) 2016/680. However, despite the extensive efforts of the Union in cooperating with the main countries of origin of illegally staying third-country nationals subject to an obligation to return, it is not always possible to ensure that such third countries systematically comply with the obligation established by international law to readmit their own nationals. Readmission agreements concluded or being negotiated by the Union or the Member States which provide for appropriate safeguards for personal data cover a limited number of such third countries. Where such agreements do not yet exist, personal data should be transferred by the Agency for the purposes of facilitating the return operations of the Union, provided that the conditions laid down in point (d) of Article 50(1) of Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 are met.\n(102)\nAny transfer of personal data by Member States to third countries should be carried out in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2016/679 and Directive (EU) 2016/680, as applicable. In the absence of readmission agreements, and as an exception to the requirement that adequacy decisions have been adopted or appropriate safeguards have been provided for, it should be possible for Member States to transfer personal data to the authorities of third countries for the purposes of implementing Union return policy. It should be possible to use the derogation for specific situations provided for in Article 49 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 and Article 38 of Directive (EU) 2016/680, as applicable, subject to the conditions set out in those articles.\n(103)\nThis Regulation respects the fundamental rights and observes the principles recognised by Articles 2 and 6 TEU and by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (‘the Charter’), in particular respect for human dignity, the right to life, the prohibition of torture and inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, the prohibition of trafficking in human beings, the right to liberty and security, the right to the protection of personal data, the right of access to documents, the right to asylum and to protection against removal and expulsion, non-refoulement, non-discrimination and the rights of the child.\n(104)\nThis Regulation should establish a complaints mechanism for the Agency in cooperation with the fundamental rights officer, to safeguard the respect for fundamental rights in all the activities of the Agency. This should be an administrative mechanism whereby the fundamental rights officer should be responsible for handling complaints received by the Agency in accordance with the right to good administration. The fundamental rights officer should review the admissibility of a complaint, register admissible complaints, forward all registered complaints to the executive director, forward complaints concerning members of the teams to the home Member State, and register the follow-up by the Agency or that Member State. The mechanism should be effective, ensuring that complaints are properly followed up. The complaints mechanism should be without prejudice to access to administrative and judicial remedies and not constitute a requirement for seeking such remedies. Criminal investigations should be conducted by the Member States. In order to increase transparency and accountability, the Agency should report on the complaints mechanism in its annual report. The report should cover in particular the number of complaints it has received, the types of fundamental rights violations involved, the operations concerned and, where possible, the follow-up measures taken by the Agency and Member States. The fundamental rights officer should have access to all information concerning respect for fundamental rights in relation to all the activities of the Agency. The fundamental rights officer should be provided with the resources and staff necessary to enable him or her to effectively perform all his or her tasks in accordance with this Regulation. The staff provided to the fundamental rights officer should have the skills and seniority that correspond to the expansion of activities and powers of the Agency.\n(105)\nThe Agency should be independent as regards technical and operational matters and have legal, administrative and financial autonomy. To that end, it is necessary and appropriate that it should be a Union body having legal personality and exercising the implementing powers that are conferred upon it by this Regulation.\n(106)\nThe Commission and the Member States should be represented within a management board to exercise oversight over the Agency. The management board should, where possible, consist of the operational heads of the national services responsible for border management or their representatives. The parties represented in the management board should make efforts to limit turnover of their representatives in order to ensure continuity of the management board's work. The management board should be entrusted with the necessary powers to establish the Agency's budget, verify its execution, adopt appropriate financial rules, establish transparent working procedures for decision-making by the Agency and appoint the executive director and three deputy executive directors, each of whom should be assigned responsibilities in a certain field of competence of the Agency, such as managing the standing corps, overseeing the Agency's tasks regarding returns or managing the Agency's involvement in large-scale IT systems. The Agency should be governed and operated taking into account the principles of the common approach on Union decentralised agencies adopted on 19 July 2012 by the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission.\n(107)\nGiven the involvement of the European Parliament in the matters governed by this Regulation, the chairperson of the management board should be able to invite an expert of the European Parliament to attend the meetings of the management board.\n(108)\nEach year, the management board should prepare a single programming document. When preparing that document, the management board should take into account the recommendations of the Interinstitutional Working Group on decentralised agencies' resources.\n(109)\nIn order to guarantee the autonomy of the Agency, it should be granted a stand-alone budget with a revenue which comes mostly from a contribution from the Union. The Agency's budget should be prepared in accordance with the principle of performance-based budgeting, taking into account the Agency's objectives and the expected results of its tasks. The Union budgetary procedure should be applicable as far as the Union contribution and any other subsidies chargeable to the general budget of the Union are concerned. The auditing of accounts should be undertaken by the Court of Auditors. In exceptional situations where the available budget is deemed insufficient and the budgetary procedure does not allow an adequate response to fast-developing situations, the Agency should have the possibility of receiving grants from Union funds to fulfil its tasks.\n(110)\nThe executive director, in his or her capacity as an authorising officer, should assess the financial risks related to the Agency's activities on a regular basis and take the necessary mitigating measures in accordance with the financial framework applicable to the Agency and inform the management board accordingly.\n(111)\nThe Agency is expected to face challenging circumstances in the coming years as regards fulfilling exceptional needs for recruiting and retaining qualified staff from the broadest possible geographical basis.\n(112)\nIn the spirit of shared responsibility, the Agency should require the staff it employs, in particular the statutory staff of the standing corps, including statutory staff deployed in operational activities, to possess the same level of training, special expertise and professionalism as staff seconded or employed by the Member States. Therefore, the Agency should review and evaluate whether its statutory staff conduct themselves properly in operational activities in the field of border control and return.\n(113)\nRegulation (EU, Euratom) No 883/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council (17) should apply without restriction to the Agency, which should accede to the Interinstitutional Agreement of 25 May 1999 between the European Parliament, the Council of the European Union and the Commission of the European Communities concerning internal investigations by the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) (18).\n(114)\nIn accordance with Council Regulation (EU) 2017/1939 (19), the European Public Prosecutor's Office should be able to investigate and prosecute fraud and other criminal offences affecting the Union's financial interests as provided for in Directive (EU) 2017/1371 of the European Parliament and of the Council (20).\n(115)\nRegulation (EC) No 1049/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council (21) should apply to the Agency. The Agency should be as transparent as possible about its activities, without jeopardising the attainment of the objective of its operations. It should make public the information about all of its activities. It should likewise ensure that the public and any interested party are rapidly given information with regard to its work.\n(116)\nThe Agency should also report on its activities to the European Parliament, to the Council and to the Commission to the fullest extent.\n(117)\nThe Commission should carry out an evaluation of this Regulation. That evaluation should assess, inter alia, the attractiveness of the Agency as an employer for the recruitment of statutory staff with a view to ensuring the quality of the candidates and geographical balance.\n(118)\nThe external borders referred to in this Regulation are those to which the provisions of Title II of Regulation (EU) 2016/399 apply, which includes the external borders of Schengen Member States in accordance with Protocol No 19 on the Schengen acquis integrated into the framework of the European Union, annexed to the TEU and to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU).\n(119)\nIn order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of this Regulation, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission. Those powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council (22).\n(120)\nSince the objectives of this Regulation, namely the development and implementation of a system of integrated management of the external borders to ensure the proper functioning of the Schengen area, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States acting in an uncoordinated manner but can rather, by reason of the absence of controls at internal borders, the significant migratory challenges at the external borders, the need to monitor efficiently the crossing of those borders, and the need to contribute to a high level of internal security within the Union, be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 TEU. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives.\n(121)\nAs regards Iceland and Norway, this Regulation constitutes a development of the provisions of the Schengen acquis within the meaning of the Agreement concluded by the Council of the European Union and the Republic of Iceland and the Kingdom of Norway concerning the latters' association with the implementation, application and development of the Schengen acquis (23), which fall within the area referred to in Article 1, point A of Council Decision 1999/437/EC (24). The Arrangement between the European Community and the Republic of Iceland and the Kingdom of Norway on the modalities of the participation by those States in the European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders of the Member States of the European Union (25) provides for rules on the participation by those countries in the work of the Agency, including provisions on financial contributions and staff.\n(122)\nAs regards Switzerland, this Regulation constitutes a development of the provisions of the Schengen acquis within the meaning of the Agreement between the European Union, the European Community and the Swiss Confederation on the Swiss Confederation's association with the implementation, application and development of the Schengen acquis (26) which fall within the area referred to in Article 1, point A of Decision 1999/437/EC read in conjunction with Article 3 of Council Decision 2008/146/EC (27).\n(123)\nAs regards Liechtenstein, this Regulation constitutes a development of the provisions of the Schengen acquis within the meaning of the Protocol between the European Union, the European Community, the Swiss Confederation and the Principality of Liechtenstein on the accession of the Principality of Liechtenstein to the Agreement between the European Union, the European Community and the Swiss Confederation on the Swiss Confederation's association with the implementation, application and development of the Schengen acquis (28) which fall within the area referred to in Article 1, point A of Decision 1999/437/EC read in conjunction with Article 3 of Council Decision 2011/350/EU (29).\n(124)\nThe Arrangement between the European Community, of the one part, and the Swiss Confederation and the Principality of Liechtenstein, of the other part, on the modalities of the participation by those States in the European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders of the Member States of the European Union (30) provides for rules on the participation by those countries in the work of the Agency, including provisions on financial contributions and staff.\n(125)\nIn accordance with Articles 1 and 2 of Protocol No 22 on the position of Denmark annexed to the TEU and to the TFEU, Denmark is not taking part in the adoption of this Regulation and is not bound by it, or subject to its application. Given that this Regulation builds upon the Schengen acquis, Denmark shall, in accordance with Article 4 of that Protocol, decide within a period of six months after the Council has decided on this Regulation whether it will implement it in its national law.\n(126)\nThis Regulation constitutes a development of provisions of the Schengen acquis in which the United Kingdom does not take part, in accordance with Council Decision 2000/365/EC (31); the United Kingdom is therefore not taking part in the adoption of this Regulation and is not bound by it or subject to its application.\n(127)\nThis Regulation constitutes a development of provisions of the Schengen acquis in which Ireland does not take part, in accordance with Council Decision 2002/192/EC (32); Ireland is therefore not taking part in the adoption of this Regulation and is not bound by it or subject to its application.\n(128)\nThe Agency should facilitate the organisation of specific activities in which the Member States may avail themselves of the expertise and facilities which Ireland and the United Kingdom may be willing to offer, on terms to be decided on a case-by-case basis by the management board. To that end, representatives of Ireland may be invited to attend meetings of the management board which allow them to participate fully in the preparation of such specific activities. Representatives of the United Kingdom may be invited to attend the meetings of the management board until the day on which the Treaties cease to apply to the United Kingdom pursuant to Article 50(3) TEU.\n(129)\nAlthough the United Kingdom does not participate in this Regulation, it has been granted the possibility to cooperate with the European Border and Coast Guard in view of its position as a Member State. In view of the submission by the United Kingdom of the notification of its intention to withdraw from the Union pursuant to Article 50 TEU, special arrangements applicable to the operational cooperation with the United Kingdom on the basis of this Regulation should be applicable until the day on which the Treaties cease to apply to the United Kingdom pursuant to Article 50(3) TEU or provided that a withdrawal agreement concluded with the United Kingdom in accordance with Article 50 TEU that regulates such special arrangements has entered into force.\n(130)\nA controversy exists between the Kingdom of Spain and the United Kingdom on the demarcation of the borders of Gibraltar.\n(131)\nThe suspension of the applicability of this Regulation to the borders of Gibraltar does not imply any change in the respective positions of the States concerned.\n(132)\nThe European Data Protection Supervisor was consulted in accordance with Article 28(2) of Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council (33) on 7 November 2018 and delivered an opinion on 30 November 2018.\n(133)\nThis Regulation aims to amend and expand the provisions of Regulations (EU) 2016/1624 and (EU) No 1052/2013. Since the amendments to be made are substantial in number and nature, those legal acts should, for the sake of clarity, be repealed,\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nCHAPTER I\nEUROPEAN BORDER AND COAST GUARD\nArticle 1\nSubject matter\nThis Regulation establishes a European Border and Coast Guard to ensure European integrated border management at the external borders with a view to managing those borders efficiently in full compliance with fundamental rights and to increasing the efficiency of the Union return policy.\nThis Regulation addresses migratory challenges and potential future challenges and threats at the external borders. It ensures a high level of internal security within the Union in full respect of fundamental rights, while safeguarding the free movement of persons within the Union.

The Agency shall notify the national coordination centre in due time of the reasons for such a refusal.\n4.   The Agency may use, on its own initiative, the surveillance tools referred to in paragraph 2 for collecting information on the pre-frontier area, which is relevant for the European situational picture.\nSECTION 5\nRisk analysis\nArticle 29\nRisk analysis\n1.   The Agency shall monitor migratory flows towards the Union, and within the Union in terms of migratory trends, volume and routes, and other trends or possible challenges at the external borders and with regard to return. For that purpose, the Agency shall, by a decision of the management board based on a proposal from the executive director, establish a common integrated risk analysis model, which shall be applied by the Agency and the Member States. The common integrated risk analysis model shall be established and updated, where needed, on the basis of the outcome of the evaluation of the implementation of the multiannual strategic policy cycle for European integrated border management referred to in Article 8(7).\n2.   The Agency shall prepare general annual risk analyses, which shall be submitted to the European Parliament, to the Council and to the Commission applying the security rules adopted in accordance with Article 92, and tailored risk analyses for operational activities. Every two years, the Agency, in close consultation with the Member States, shall prepare and submit to the European Parliament, to the Council and to the Commission a strategic risk analysis for European integrated border management. Such strategic risk analyses shall be taken into account for the preparation of the multiannual strategic policy cycle for European integrated border management. The Agency shall prepare such general annual risk analyses and strategic risk analyses on the basis of information received, including from the Member States. Personal data shall be anonymised in the results of such risk analyses.\n3.   The risk analyses referred to in paragraph 2 shall cover all aspects relevant to European integrated border management with a view to developing a pre-warning mechanism.\n4.   The Agency shall publish comprehensive information on the common integrated risk analysis model.\n5.   Member States shall provide the Agency with all necessary information regarding the situation, trends and possible threats at the external borders and in the field of return. Member States shall regularly, or upon the request of the Agency, provide it with all relevant information such as statistical and operational data collected in relation to European integrated border management that is included in the list of mandatory information and data to be exchanged with the Agency as referred to in point (e) of Article 100(2), as well as information from the analysis layers of the national situational pictures as provided for in Article 25.\n6.   The results of the risk analysis shall be submitted to the management board and shared with the competent authorities of the Member States in a timely and accurate manner.\n7.   Member States shall take results of the risk analysis into account when planning their operations and activities at the external borders and their activities with regard to return.\n8.   The Agency shall incorporate the results of a common integrated risk analysis model in its development of common core curricula for training as referred to in Article 62.\nSECTION 6\nPrevention and responsiveness\nArticle 30\nDetermination of external border sections\nFor the purposes of this Regulation, each Member State shall divide its external borders into external border sections. Those sections shall consist of land, sea and, where a Member State so decides, air border sections. Each Member State shall notify such external border sections to the Agency.\nMember States shall notify any change of external border sections to the Agency in a timely manner to ensure the continuity of risk analysis by the Agency.\nArticle 31\nAgency liaison officers in Member States\n1.   The Agency shall ensure the regular monitoring of all Member States' management of the external borders and return through liaison officers of the Agency.\nThe Agency may decide that a liaison officer covers up to four Member States which are geographically close to each other.\n2.   The executive director shall appoint experts from the statutory staff to be deployed as liaison officers. The executive director shall, on the basis of risk analysis and in consultation with the Member States concerned, make a proposal on the nature and terms of the deployment, the Member State or region to which a liaison officer may be deployed and possible tasks not covered by paragraph 3. The proposal from the executive director shall be subject to approval by the management board. The executive director shall notify the Member State concerned of the appointment and shall determine, together with that Member State, the location of deployment.\n3.   The liaison officers shall act on behalf of the Agency, and their role shall be to foster cooperation and dialogue between the Agency and the national authorities responsible for border management, including coast guards to the extent that they carry out border control tasks, as well as the national authorities responsible for return. The liaison officers shall, in particular:\n(a)\nact as an interface between the Agency and the national authorities responsible for border management, including coast guards to the extent that they carry out border control tasks, as well as the national authorities responsible for return;\n(b)\nsupport the collection of information required by the Agency for the monitoring of illegal immigration and risk analyses referred to in Article 29;\n(c)\nsupport the collection of information referred to in Article 32 and required by the Agency to carry out vulnerability assessments and prepare a report for that purpose;\n(d)\nmonitor the measures taken by the Member State at external border sections to which a high or critical impact level has been attributed in accordance with Article 34;\n(e)\ncontribute to promoting the application of the Union acquis relating to the management of the external borders and return, including with regard to respect for fundamental rights;\n(f)\ncooperate with the fundamental rights officer, where necessary, with a view to promoting respect for fundamental rights in the work of the Agency in line with point (e);\n(g)\nwhere possible, assist the Member States in preparing their contingency plans concerning border management;\n(h)\nfacilitate the communication between the Member State concerned and the Agency, share relevant information from the Agency with the Member State concerned, including information about ongoing operations;\n(i)\nreport regularly and directly to the executive director on the situation at the external borders and the capacity of the Member State concerned to deal effectively with the situation at the external borders; report also on the execution of return operations towards relevant third countries;\n(j)\nmonitor the measures taken by the Member State with regard to a situation requiring urgent action at the external borders as referred to in Article 42;\n(k)\nmonitor the measures taken by the Member State with regard to return and support the collection of information required by the Agency to carry out the activities referred to in Article 48.\n4.   If the reporting by the liaison officer referred to in point (i) of paragraph 3 raises concerns about one or more aspects relevant for the Member State concerned, the executive director shall inform that Member State without delay.\n5.   For the purposes of paragraph 3, the liaison officer shall, in compliance with the national and Union security and data protection rules:\n(a)\nreceive information from the national coordination centre concerned and the relevant national situational picture established in accordance with Article 25;\n(b)\nkeep regular contacts with national authorities which are responsible for border management, including coast guards to the extent that they carry out border control tasks, as well as the national authorities responsible for return, whilst informing the national contact point concerned.\n6.   The report of the liaison officer referred to in point (c) of paragraph 3 of this Article shall form part of the vulnerability assessment referred to in Article 32. The report shall be transmitted to the Member State concerned.\n7.   In carrying out their duties, the liaison officers shall take instructions only from the Agency.\nArticle 32\nVulnerability assessment\n1.   The Agency shall establish a common vulnerability assessment methodology by decision of the management board, on the basis of a proposal from the executive director prepared in close cooperation with the Member States and the Commission. That methodology shall include objective criteria against which the Agency shall carry out the vulnerability assessment, the frequency of such assessments, how consecutive vulnerability assessments are to be carried out, and arrangements for an effective system for monitoring the implementation of recommendations of the executive director as referred to in paragraph 7.\n2.   The Agency shall monitor and assess the availability of the technical equipment, systems, capabilities, resources, infrastructure and adequately skilled and trained staff of Member States necessary for border control as referred to in point (a) of Article 3(1). In that context, the Agency shall assess the national capability development plans referred to in Article 9(4) as regards the capacity to perform border control taking into account the fact that some national capabilities may be partially used for purposes other than border control. For future planning, the Agency shall carry out such monitoring and assessment as a preventive measure on the basis of the risk analyses prepared in accordance with Article 29(2). The Agency shall carry out such monitoring and assessment at least once a year, unless the executive director, on the basis of risk analysis or a previous vulnerability assessment, decides otherwise. In any event, each Member State shall be subject to monitoring and assessment at least once every three years.\n3.   Without prejudice to Article 9, Member States shall, at the request of the Agency, provide information as regards technical equipment, staff and, to the extent possible, the financial resources available at national level to carry out border control. Member States shall also provide information on their contingency plans on border management at the Agency's request.\n4.   The aim of the vulnerability assessment is for the Agency: to assess the capacity and readiness of Member States to face present and upcoming challenges at the external borders; to identify, especially for those Member States facing specific and disproportionate challenges, possible immediate consequences at the external borders and subsequent consequences on the functioning of the Schengen area; to assess their capacity to contribute to the standing corps and to the technical equipment pool, including the rapid reaction equipment pool; and to assess the hosting capacity of Member States with regard to support from the European Border and Coast Guard in line with Article 9(3). That assessment shall be without prejudice to the Schengen evaluation mechanism.\n5.   In the vulnerability assessment, the Agency shall assess, in qualitative and quantitative terms, the Member States' capacity to carry out all border management tasks, including their capacity to deal with the potential arrival of large numbers of persons on their territory.\n6.   The preliminary results of the vulnerability assessment shall be submitted to the Member States concerned. The Member States concerned may comment on that assessment.\n7.   Where necessary, the executive director, in consultation with the Member State concerned, shall make a recommendation setting out the necessary measures to be taken by the Member State concerned and the time limit within which such measures are to be implemented. The executive director shall invite the Member States concerned to take the necessary measures on the basis of an action plan developed by the Member State in consultation with the executive director.\n8.   The executive director shall base the measures to be recommended to the Member States concerned on the results of the vulnerability assessment, taking into account the Agency's risk analysis, the comments of the Member State concerned and the results of the Schengen evaluation mechanism.\nThe recommended measures shall be aimed at eliminating the vulnerabilities identified in the assessment in order for Member States to increase their readiness to face present and upcoming challenges at the external borders by enhancing or improving their capabilities, technical equipment, systems, resources and contingency plans. The executive director may offer the technical expertise of the Agency to the Member States to support the implementation of the recommended measures.\n9.   The executive director shall monitor the implementation of the recommended measures by means of regular reports to be submitted by the Member States on the basis of the action plans referred to in paragraph 7.\nWhere there is a risk that a Member State will not implement a recommended measure within the time limit set in accordance with paragraph 7, the executive director shall immediately inform the member of the management board from the Member State concerned and the Commission. In consultation with the member of the management board from the Member State concerned, the executive director shall enquire of the relevant authorities of that Member State about the reasons for the delay and offer support by the Agency to facilitate the implementation of the measure recommended.\n10.   Where a Member State does not implement the necessary measures of the recommendation within the time limit set in accordance with paragraph 7 of this Article, the executive director shall refer the matter to the management board and notify the Commission. The management board shall adopt a decision on the basis of a proposal from the executive director, setting out the necessary measures to be taken by the Member State concerned and the time limit within which such measures are to be implemented. The decision of the management board shall be binding on the Member State. If the Member State does not implement the measures within the time limit provided for in that decision, the management board shall notify the Council and the Commission and further action may be taken in accordance with Article 42.\n11.   The vulnerability assessment, including a detailed description of the outcome of the vulnerability assessment, the measures taken by the Member States in response to the vulnerability assessment and the status of the implementation of any measures previously recommended, shall be transmitted, in accordance with Article 92, on a regular basis and at least once a year to the European Parliament, to the Council and to the Commission.\nArticle 33\nSynergies between the vulnerability assessment and the Schengen evaluation mechanism\n1.   The synergies between the vulnerability assessment and the Schengen evaluation mechanism shall be maximised in order to establish an improved situational picture on the functioning of the Schengen area, avoiding, to the extent possible, the duplication of efforts on the Member States' side, and ensuring a better coordinated use of the relevant Union financial instruments supporting the management of the external borders.\n2.   For the purpose referred to in paragraph 1, the Commission and the Agency shall establish the necessary arrangements to share with each other in a regular, secured and timely manner all information related to the results of vulnerability assessments and the results of the evaluations carried out within the framework of the Schengen evaluation mechanism in the area of border management. Those information-sharing arrangements shall cover the reports of vulnerability assessments and reports of Schengen evaluation visits, subsequent recommendations, action plans and any updates on the implementation of the action plans provided by the Member States.\n3.   For the purposes of the Schengen evaluation mechanism as it relates to external border management, the Commission shall share the results of the vulnerability assessments with all the members of the Schengen evaluation teams involved in the evaluation of the Member State concerned. Such information shall be considered sensitive within the meaning of Regulation (EU) No 1053/2013 and shall be treated accordingly.\n4.   The arrangements referred to in paragraph 2 shall cover results of the evaluations carried out within the framework of the Schengen evaluation mechanism in the area of return to ensure the full awareness of the Agency of the identified deficiencies in view of enabling it to propose appropriate measures to support Member States concerned in that regard.\nArticle 34\nAttribution of impact levels to external border sections\n1.   On the basis of the Agency's risk analysis and vulnerability assessment and in agreement with the Member State concerned, the Agency shall attribute the following impact levels to each external border section or change such levels:\n(a)\nlow impact level where the incidents related to illegal immigration or cross-border crime occurring at the relevant border section have an insignificant impact on border security;\n(b)\nmedium impact level where the incidents related to illegal immigration or cross-border crime occurring at the relevant border section have a moderate impact on border security;\n(c)\nhigh impact level where the incidents related to illegal immigration or cross-border crime occurring at the relevant border section have a significant impact on border security.\n2.   In order to swiftly address a crisis situation at a particular external border section, where the Agency's risk analysis shows that incidents related to illegal immigration or cross-border crime occurring at the relevant external border section have a decisive impact on border security to such an extent that they risk jeopardising the functioning of the Schengen area, the Agency shall, in agreement with the Member State concerned, temporarily attribute a ‘critical’ impact level to that external border section.\n3.   Where there is no agreement between the Member State concerned and the Agency on the attribution of an impact level to an external border section, the impact level that was previously attributed to that border section shall remain unchanged.\n4.   The national coordination centre shall constantly assess in close cooperation with other competent national authorities whether there is a need to change the impact level of any of the external border sections by taking into account the information contained in the national situational picture and inform the Agency accordingly.\n5.   The Agency shall indicate the impact levels attributed to the external border sections in the European situational picture.\nArticle 35\nReaction corresponding to impact levels\n1.   The Member States shall ensure that border control at the external border sections corresponds to the attributed impact levels in the following manner:\n(a)\nwhere a low impact level is attributed to an external border section, the national authorities responsible for external border control shall organise regular border control on the basis of risk analysis and ensure that sufficient personnel and resources are being kept available for that border section;\n(b)\nwhere a medium impact level is attributed to an external border section, the national authorities responsible for external border control shall, in addition to the measures taken under point (a) of this paragraph, ensure that appropriate border control measures are being taken at that border section; where such border control measures are taken, the national coordination centre shall be notified accordingly; the national coordination centre shall coordinate any support given in accordance with Article 21(3);\n(c)\nwhere a high impact level is attributed to an external border section, the Member State concerned, in addition to the measures taken under point (b) of this paragraph, shall ensure, through the national coordination centre, that the national authorities operating at that border section are given the necessary support and that reinforced border control measures are taken; that Member State may request support from the Agency subject to the conditions for initiating joint operations or rapid border interventions as laid down in Article 36;\n(d)\nwhere a critical impact level is attributed to an external border section, the Agency shall notify the Commission thereof; the executive director, in addition to the measures taken under point (c) of this paragraph, shall issue a recommendation in accordance with Article 41(1), taking into account the ongoing support by the Agency; the Member State concerned shall respond to the recommendation in accordance with Article 41(2).\n2.   The national coordination centres shall regularly inform the Agency of the measures taken at national level pursuant to points (c) and (d) of paragraph 1.\n3.   Where a medium, high or critical impact level is attributed to an external border section which is adjacent to the border section of another Member State or of a third country with which agreements, arrangements or regional networks, as referred to in Articles 72 and 73, are in place, the national coordination centre shall contact the national coordination centre of the neighbouring Member State or the competent authority of the neighbouring third country and shall endeavour to coordinate together with the Agency the necessary cross-border measures.\n4.   The Agency shall, together with the Member State concerned, evaluate the attribution of impact levels and the corresponding measures taken at national and Union level. That evaluation shall contribute to the vulnerability assessment to be carried out by the Agency in accordance with Article 32.\nSECTION 7\nAction by the Agency at the external borders\nArticle 36\nActions by the Agency at the external borders\n1.   A Member State may request the Agency's assistance in implementing its obligations with regard to external border control. The Agency shall also carry out measures in accordance with Articles 41 and 42.\n2.   The Agency shall organise the appropriate technical and operational assistance for the host Member State and it may, acting in accordance with the relevant Union and international law, including the principle of non-refoulement, take one or more of the following measures:\n(a)\ncoordinate joint operations for one or more Member States and deploy the standing corps and technical equipment;\n(b)\norganise rapid border interventions and deploy the standing corps and technical equipment;\n(c)\ncoordinate activities for one or more Member States and third countries at the external borders, including joint operations with third countries;\n(d)\ndeploy the standing corps in the framework of the migration management support teams to, inter alia, hotspot areas in order to provide technical and operational assistance, including, where necessary, in return activities;\n(e)\nwithin the framework of operations referred to in points (a), (b) and (c) of this paragraph and in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 656/2014 and international law, provide technical and operational assistance to Member States and third countries in support of search and rescue operations for persons in distress at sea which may arise during border surveillance operations at sea;\n(f)\ngive priority treatment to the EUROSUR fusion services.\n3.   The Agency shall finance or co-finance the activities referred to in paragraph 2 from its budget in accordance with the financial rules applicable to the Agency.\n4.   If the Agency has substantial additional financial needs due to a situation at the external borders, it shall inform the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission thereof without delay.\nArticle 37\nInitiating joint operations and rapid border interventions at the external borders\n1.   A Member State may request that the Agency launch joint operations to face upcoming challenges, including illegal immigration, present or future threats at its external borders or cross-border crime, or provide increased technical and operational assistance when implementing its obligations with regard to external border control. As part of such a request, a Member State may also indicate the profiles of operational staff needed for the joint operation in question, including those staff having executive powers, as applicable.\n2.   At the request of a Member State faced with a situation of specific and disproportionate challenges, especially the arrival at points of the external borders of large numbers of third-country nationals trying to enter the territory of that Member State without authorisation, the Agency may deploy a rapid border intervention for a limited period of time on the territory of that host Member State.\n3.   The executive director shall evaluate, approve and coordinate proposals made by Member States for joint operations or rapid border interventions. Joint operations and rapid border interventions shall be preceded by a thorough reliable and up-to-date risk analysis, thereby enabling the Agency to set an order of priority for the proposed joint operations and rapid border interventions, taking into account the impact levels attributed to external border sections in accordance with Article 34 and the availability of resources.\n4.   The objectives of a joint operation or rapid border intervention may be achieved as part of a multipurpose operation. Such operations may involve coast guard functions and the prevention of cross-border crime, focusing on the fight against migrant smuggling or trafficking in human beings, and migration management, focusing on identification, registration, debriefing and return.\nArticle 38\nOperational plans for joint operations\n1.   In preparation of a joint operation the executive director, in cooperation with the host Member State, shall draw up a list of technical equipment, staff and profiles of staff needed, including those staff having executive powers, as applicable, to be authorised in accordance with Article 82(2). That list shall be drawn up taking into account the host Member State's available resources and the host Member State's request under Article 37. On the basis of those elements, the Agency shall define a package of technical and operational reinforcement as well as capacity-building activities to be included in the operational plan.\n2.   The executive director shall draw up an operational plan for joint operations at the external borders. The executive director and the host Member State, in close and timely consultation with the participating Member States, shall agree on the operational plan detailing the organisational and procedural aspects of the joint operation.\n3.   The operational plan shall be binding on the Agency, the host Member State and the participating Member States. It shall cover all aspects considered necessary for carrying out the joint operation, including the following:\n(a)\ndescription of the situation, with modus operandi and objectives of the deployment, including the operational aim;\n(b)\nthe estimated time that the joint operation is expected to last in order to achieve its objectives;\n(c)\nthe geographical area where the joint operation will take place;\n(d)\na description of the tasks, including those requiring executive powers, responsibilities, including with regard to the respect for fundamental rights and data protection requirements, and special instructions for the teams, including on permissible consultation of databases and permissible service weapons, ammunition and equipment in the host Member State;\n(e)\nthe composition of the teams as well as the deployment of other relevant staff;\n(f)\ncommand and control provisions, including the names and ranks of the border guards of the host Member State responsible for cooperating with the members of the teams and the Agency, in particular the names and ranks of those border guards who are in command during the period of deployment, and the place of the members of the teams in the chain of command;\n(g)\nthe technical equipment to be deployed during the joint operation, including specific requirements such as conditions for use, requested crew, transport and other logistics, and financial provisions;\n(h)\ndetailed provisions on immediate incident reporting by the Agency to the management board and to relevant national authorities;\n(i)\na reporting and evaluation scheme containing benchmarks for the evaluation report, including with regard to the protection of fundamental rights, and final date of submission of the final evaluation report;\n(j)\nregarding sea operations, specific information on the application of the relevant jurisdiction and applicable law in the geographical area where the joint operation takes place, including references to national, international and Union law regarding interception, rescue at sea and disembarkation; in that regard the operational plan shall be established in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 656/2014;\n(k)\nthe terms of cooperation with third countries, other Union bodies, offices and agencies or international organisations;\n(l)\ngeneral instructions on how to ensure the safeguarding of fundamental rights during the operational activity of the Agency;\n(m)\nprocedures whereby persons in need of international protection, victims of trafficking in human beings, unaccompanied minors and persons in a vulnerable situation are directed to the competent national authorities for appropriate assistance;\n(n)\nprocedures setting out a mechanism to receive and transmit to the Agency complaints against any person participating in an operational activity of the Agency, including border guards or other relevant staff of the host Member State and members of the teams, alleging breaches of fundamental rights in the context of their participation in an operational activity of the Agency;\n(o)\nlogistical arrangements, including information on working conditions and the environment of the areas in which the joint operation is to take place.\n4.   Any amendments to or adaptations of the operational plan shall require the agreement of the executive director and the host Member State, after consultation of the participating Member States. A copy of the amended or adapted operational plan shall immediately be sent by the Agency to the participating Member States.\n5.   This Article shall apply mutatis mutandis to all operations of the Agency.\nArticle 39\nProcedure for launching a rapid border intervention\n1.   A request by a Member State to launch a rapid border intervention shall include a description of the situation, possible aims and envisaged needs, and the profiles of staff needed, including those staff having executive powers, as applicable. If required, the executive director may immediately send experts from the Agency to assess the situation at the external borders of the Member State concerned.\n2.   The executive director shall immediately inform the management board of a Member State's request to launch a rapid border intervention.\n3.   When deciding on the request of a Member State, the executive director shall take into account the findings of the Agency's risk analyses and the analysis layer of the European situational picture as well as the outcome of the vulnerability assessment referred to in Article 32 and any other relevant information provided by the Member State concerned or another Member State.\n4.   The executive director shall immediately assess the possibilities for redeployment of available members of the teams within the standing corps, in particular statutory staff and staff seconded to the Agency by the Member States, present in other operational areas. The executive director shall also assess the additional need to deploy operational staff in accordance with Article 57 and, once staff within the required profiles have been exhausted, to activate the reserve for rapid reaction in accordance with Article 58.\n5.   The executive director shall take a decision on the request to launch a rapid border intervention within two working days from the date of receipt of the request. The executive director shall simultaneously notify the Member State concerned and the management board in writing of the decision. The decision shall state the main reasons on which it is based.\n6.   When taking the decision referred to in paragraph 5 of this Article, the executive director shall inform the Member States about the possibility of requesting additional operational staff in accordance with Article 57 and, where applicable, Article 58 by indicating possible numbers and profiles of staff to be provided by each Member State.\n7.   If the executive director decides to launch a rapid border intervention, he or she shall deploy available border management teams from the standing corps and equipment from the technical equipment pool in accordance with Article 64, and where necessary, he or she shall decide on the immediate reinforcement by one or more border management teams, in accordance with Article 57.\n8.   The executive director together with the host Member State shall draw up and agree upon an operational plan as referred to in Article 38(2) immediately and, in any event, no later than three working days from the date of the decision.\n9.   As soon as the operational plan has been agreed upon and provided to the Member States, the executive director shall immediately deploy the operational staff available through redeployments from other operational areas or other duties.\n10.   In parallel to the deployment referred to in paragraph 9, and where necessary to secure the immediate reinforcement of the border management teams redeployed from other areas or duties, the executive director shall request from each Member State the number and profiles of additional staff to be additionally deployed from their national lists for short-term deployments as referred to in Article 57.\n11.   If a situation arises where the border management teams referred to in paragraph 7 and the staff referred to in paragraph 10 of this Article are insufficient, the executive director may activate the reserve for rapid reaction by requesting from each Member State the number and profiles of additional staff to be deployed as provided for in Article 58.\n12.   The information referred to paragraphs 10 and 11 shall be provided in writing to the national contact points and shall indicate the date on which the deployments of staff from each category are to take place. A copy of the operational plan shall also be provided to the national contact points.\n13.   Member States shall ensure that the number and profiles of staff are immediately made available to the Agency to guarantee a complete deployment in accordance with Article 57 and, if applicable, Article 58.\n14.   The deployment of the first border management teams redeployed from other areas and other duties shall take place no later than five working days after the date on which the operational plan is agreed between the executive director and the host Member State. Additional deployment of border management teams shall take place, where necessary, no later than 12 working days after the date on which the operational plan is agreed.\n15.   Where the rapid border intervention is to take place, the executive director shall, in consultation with the management board, immediately consider the priorities with regard to the Agency's ongoing and planned joint operations at other external borders in order to provide for possible reallocation of resources to the areas of the external borders where a strengthened deployment is most needed.\nArticle 40\nMigration management support teams\n1.   Where a Member State faces disproportionate migratory challenges at particular hotspot areas of its external borders characterised by large inward mixed migratory flows, that Member State may request technical and operational reinforcement by migration management support teams composed of experts from relevant Union bodies, offices and agencies that shall operate in accordance with their mandates.\nThat Member State shall submit a request for reinforcement and an assessment of its needs to the Commission. On the basis of that assessment of needs, the Commission shall transmit the request, as appropriate, to the Agency, to EASO, to Europol and to other relevant Union bodies, offices and agencies.\n2.   The relevant Union bodies, offices and agencies shall examine, in accordance with their respective mandates, the Member State's request for reinforcement and the assessment of its needs for the purpose of defining a comprehensive reinforcement package consisting of various activities coordinated by the relevant Union bodies, offices and agencies, to be agreed upon by the Member State concerned. The Commission shall coordinate that process.\n3.   The Commission, in cooperation with the host Member State and the relevant Union bodies, offices and agencies in accordance with their respective mandates, shall establish the terms of cooperation at the hotspot area and shall be responsible for the coordination of the activities of the migration management support teams.\n4.   The technical and operational reinforcement provided, with full respect for fundamental rights, by the standing corps in the framework of migration management support teams may include the provision of:\n(a)\nassistance, with full respect for fundamental rights, in the screening of third-country nationals arriving at the external borders, including the identification, registration, and debriefing of those third-country nationals and, where requested by the Member State, the fingerprinting of third-country nationals and providing information regarding the purpose of these procedures;\n(b)\ninitial information to persons who wish to apply for international protection and the referral of those persons to the competent national authorities of the Member State concerned or to the experts deployed by EASO;\n(c)\ntechnical and operational assistance in the field of return in accordance with Article 48, including the preparation and organisation of return operations;\n(d)\nnecessary technical equipment.\n5.   Migration management support teams shall include, where necessary, staff with expertise in child protection, trafficking in human beings, protection against gender-based persecution or fundamental rights.\nArticle 41\nProposed actions at the external borders\n1.   On the basis of the results of the vulnerability assessment or where a critical impact level is attributed to one or more external border sections and taking into account the relevant elements in the Member State's contingency plans, the Agency's risk analysis and the analysis layer of the European situational picture, the executive director shall recommend to the Member State concerned to request that the Agency initiate, carry out or adjust joint operations, rapid border interventions or any other relevant actions by the Agency as set out in Article 36.\n2.   The Member State concerned shall respond to the recommendation of the executive director referred to in paragraph 1 within six working days. In the event of a negative response to the recommendation, the Member State shall also provide the justifications underlying that response. The executive director shall notify the management board and the Commission without delay about the recommended actions and the justifications for the negative response, with a view to assessing whether urgent action may be required in accordance with Article 42.\nArticle 42\nSituation at the external borders requiring urgent action\n1.   Where external border control is rendered ineffective to such an extent that it risks jeopardising the functioning of the Schengen area because:\n(a)\na Member State does not implement the necessary measures in accordance with a decision of the management board referred to in Article 32(10); or\n(b)\na Member State facing specific and disproportionate challenges at the external borders has either not requested sufficient support from the Agency under Article 37, 39 or 40 or is not taking the necessary steps to implement actions under those Articles or under Article 41;\nthe Council, on the basis of a proposal from the Commission, may adopt without delay a decision by means of an implementing act to identify measures to mitigate those risks to be implemented by the Agency and requiring the Member State concerned to cooperate with the Agency in the implementation of those measures. The Commission shall consult the Agency before making its proposal.\n2.   Where a situation requiring urgent action arises, the European Parliament shall be informed of that situation without delay as well as of any subsequent measures and decisions taken in response.\n3.   To mitigate the risk of putting the Schengen area in jeopardy, the Council decision referred to in paragraph 1 shall provide for one or more of the following measures to be taken by the Agency:\n(a)\norganise and coordinate rapid border interventions and deploy the standing corps, including teams from the reserve for rapid reaction;\n(b)\ndeploy the standing corps in the framework of the migration management support teams, in particular at hotspot areas;\n(c)\ncoordinate activities for one or more Member States and third countries at the external borders, including joint operations with third countries;\n(d)\ndeploy technical equipment;\n(e)\norganise return interventions.\n4.   The executive director shall, within two working days from the date of adoption of the Council decision referred to in paragraph 1:\n(a)\ndetermine the actions to be taken for the practical execution of the measures identified in that decision, including the technical equipment and the number and profiles of the operational staff needed to meet the objectives of that decision;\n(b)\ndraw up a draft operational plan and submit it to the Member States concerned.\n5.   The executive director and the Member State concerned shall agree on the operational plan referred to in point (b) of paragraph 4 within three working days from the date of its submission.\n6.   The Agency shall, without delay, and in any case within five working days from the establishment of the operational plan, deploy the necessary operational staff from the standing corps for the practical execution of the measures identified in the Council decision referred to in paragraph 1. Additional teams shall be deployed as necessary at a second stage, and in any case within 12 working days from the establishment of the operational plan.\n7.   The Agency and the Member States shall, without delay, and in any case within 10 working days from the establishment of the operational plan, send the necessary technical equipment and competent staff to the destination of deployment for the practical execution of the measures identified in the Council decision referred to in paragraph 1.\nAdditional technical equipment shall be deployed as necessary at a second stage in accordance with Article 64.\n8.   The Member State concerned shall comply with the Council decision referred to in paragraph 1. For that purpose, it shall immediately cooperate with the Agency and take the necessary action to facilitate the implementation of that decision and the practical execution of the measures set out in that decision and in the operational plan agreed upon with the executive director, in particular by implementing the obligations provided for in Articles 43, 82 and 83.\n9.   In accordance with Article 57 and, where relevant, Article 39, the Member States shall make available the operational staff determined by the executive director in accordance with paragraph 4 of this Article.\n10.   The Commission shall monitor the implementation of the measures identified in the Council decision referred to in paragraph 1 and the actions that the Agency takes for that purpose. If the Member State concerned does not comply with the Council decision referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article within 30 days and does not cooperate with the Agency in accordance with to paragraph 8 of this Article, the Commission may trigger the procedure provided for in Article 29 of Regulation (EU) 2016/399.\nArticle 43\nInstructions to the teams\n1.   During the deployment of border management teams, return teams and migration management support teams, the host Member State or, in the case of cooperation with a third country in accordance with a status agreement, the third country concerned, shall issue instructions to the teams in accordance with the operational plan.\n2.   The Agency, through its coordinating officer, may communicate its views to the host Member State on the instructions given to the teams. In that case, the host Member State shall take those views into consideration and follow them to the extent possible.\n3.   In cases where the instructions issued to the teams are not in compliance with the operational plan, the coordinating officer shall immediately report to the executive director, who may, if appropriate, take action in accordance with Article 46(3).\n4.   Members of the teams shall, in the performance of their tasks and in the exercise of their powers, fully respect fundamental rights, including access to asylum procedures and human dignity, and shall pay particular attention to vulnerable persons. Any measures taken in the performance of their tasks and in the exercise of their powers shall be proportionate to the objectives pursued by such measures.

The executive director shall notify the host Member State of the appointment.\n3.   The coordinating officer shall act on behalf of the Agency in all aspects of the deployment of the teams. The role of the coordinating officer shall be to foster cooperation and coordination among host and participating Member States. At least one fundamental rights monitor shall assist and advise the coordinating officer. In particular, the coordinating officer shall:\n(a)\nact as an interface between the Agency, the host Member State and the members of the teams, providing assistance, on behalf of the Agency, on all issues relating to the conditions of the deployment to the teams;\n(b)\nmonitor the correct implementation of the operational plan, including, in cooperation with the fundamental rights monitors, as regards the protection of fundamental rights and report to the executive director on this;\n(c)\nact on behalf of the Agency in all aspects of the deployment of the teams and report to the Agency on all those aspects;\n(d)\nreport to the executive director where the instructions issued to the teams by the host Member States are not in compliance with the operational plan, in particular as regards fundamental rights and, where appropriate, suggest that the executive director consider taking a decision in accordance with Article 46.\n4.   In the context of joint operations or rapid border interventions, the executive director may authorise the coordinating officer to assist in resolving any disagreement on the execution of the operational plan and deployment of the teams.\nArticle 45\nCosts\n1.   The Agency shall fully cover the following costs incurred by Member States in making available their staff for the purposes of deploying them from the standing corps as members of the teams to the Member States and to third countries for a short term in accordance with Article 57 or to the Member States through the reserve for rapid reaction in accordance with Article 58:\n(a)\ntravel costs from the home Member State to the host Member State, from the host Member State to the home Member State, within the host Member State for the purposes of deployment or redeployment within that host Member State or to another host Member State, and for the purposes of deployments to, and redeployments within or to, another third country;\n(b)\ncosts related to vaccinations;\n(c)\ncosts related to special insurance needs;\n(d)\ncosts related to health care, including psychological assistance;\n(e)\ndaily subsistence allowances, including accommodation costs.\n2.   On the basis of a proposal of the executive director, the management board shall adopt detailed rules as regards the reimbursement of the costs incurred by staff deployed for a short term in accordance with Articles 57 and 58, and shall update them as necessary. To ensure compliance with the applicable legal framework, the executive director shall make such proposal after receiving the positive opinion of the Commission. The detailed rules shall be based to the extent possible on simplified cost options in accordance with points (c), (d) and (e) of Article 125(1) of Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2018/1046. Where relevant, the management board shall ensure consistency with the rules applicable to mission expenses of statutory staff.\nArticle 46\nDecisions to suspend, terminate or not launch activities\n1.   The executive director shall terminate any activity of the Agency if the conditions to conduct those activities are no longer fulfilled. The executive director shall inform the Member State concerned prior to such termination.\n2.   The Member States participating in an operational activity by the Agency may request that the executive director terminate that operational activity. The executive director shall inform the management board of such request.\n3.   The executive director may, after informing the Member State concerned, withdraw the financing of an activity or suspend or terminate it if the operational plan is not respected by the host Member State.\n4.   The executive director shall, after consulting the fundamental rights officer and informing the Member State concerned, withdraw the financing for any activity by the Agency, or suspend or terminate any activity by the Agency, in whole or in part, if he or she considers that there are violations of fundamental rights or international protection obligations related to the activity concerned that are of a serious nature or are likely to persist.\n5.   The executive director shall, after consulting the fundamental rights officer, decide not to launch any activity by the Agency where he or she considers that there would already be serious reasons at the beginning of the activity to suspend or terminate it because it could lead to violations of fundamental rights or international protection obligations of a serious nature. The executive director shall inform the Member State concerned of that decision.\n6.   The decisions referred to in paragraphs 4 and 5 shall be based on duly justified grounds. When taking such decisions, the executive director shall take into account relevant information such as the number and substance of registered complaints that have not been resolved by a national competent authority, reports of serious incidents, reports from coordinating officers, relevant international organisations and Union institutions, bodies, offices and agencies in the areas covered by this Regulation.

of service weapons and non-lethal equipment, applicable to statutory staff deployed as members of the teams\n1.   General Principles Governing the Use of Force and Weapons\nFor the purposes of this Regulation, ‘use of force’ refers to recourse by statutory staff deployed as members of the teams to physical means for the purposes of performing their functions or ensuring self-defence, which includes the use of hands and body and the use of any instruments, weapons, including firearms, or equipment.\nWeapons, ammunition and equipment shall only be carried and used during operations. Carrying or using weapons, ammunition and equipment during off duty periods shall be prohibited.\nIn accordance with Article 82(8), the use of force and weapons by statutory staff deployed as members of the teams shall be exercised in accordance with the national law of the host Member State, in the presence of border guards of the host Member State.\nWithout prejudice to the authorisation by the host Member State and the applicability of its national law to the use of force during operations, the use of force and weapons by statutory staff deployed as members of the teams shall comply with the principles of necessity, proportionality and precaution (the ‘core principles’) as set out below.\nThe operational plan agreed between the executive director and the host Member State shall define the conditions for carrying and using weapons in accordance with national law or operating procedures during operations.\nThe Principle of Necessity\nThe use of force, whether through direct physical contact or by the use of weapons or equipment, shall be exceptional and shall only take place where it is strictly necessary to ensure the performance of the Agency’s duties or in self-defence. Force shall only be used as a last resort, after every reasonable effort has been made to resolve a situation using non-violent means, including by means of persuasion, negotiation, or mediation. The use of force or coercive measures shall never be arbitrary or abusive.\nThe Principle of Proportionality\nWhenever the lawful use of force or firearms is unavoidable, statutory staff deployed as members of the teams shall act in proportion to the seriousness of the situation and the legitimate objective to be achieved. During operational activities, the proportionality principle shall guide both the nature of the force used (e.g. the need for the use of weapons) as well as the extent of the force applied. Statutory staff deployed as members of the teams shall not use more force than is absolutely necessary to achieve the legitimate law enforcement objective. If a firearm is used, statutory staff deployed as members of the teams shall ensure that such use causes the least possible injury and minimises injury and damage to the greatest possible extent. Where the measures lead to an unacceptable result, statutory staff deployed as members of the teams may waive the measure. The principle of proportionality requires the Agency to provide equipment and self-defensive tools to statutory staff deployed as members of the teams which are necessary to enable the appropriate level of force to be applied.\nThe Duty of Precaution\nOperational activities carried out statutory staff deployed as members of the teams shall fully respect and aim to preserve human life and human dignity. All necessary steps that can minimise the risk of injury and damage during operations shall be taken. This obligation includes a general obligation for statutory staff deployed as members of the teams to give clear warnings of their intention to use force, unless giving such a warning would unduly place the members of the teams at risk or would create a risk of death or serious harm to others, or would be clearly inappropriate or ineffective in the particular circumstances.\n2.   Specific rules for the most commonly used instruments of force (equipment of statutory staff deployed as members of the teams)\nIn accordance with the core principles, the use of force shall only be permissible to the extent that the use of force is necessary for achieving the immediate law enforcement aim, and only after:\n—\nattempts to resolve a potentially violent confrontation by means of persuasion, negotiation, mediation have been exhausted and failed,\n—\na warning of the intention to use force has been given.\nWhere it is necessary to escalate the level of intervention (for example, using a weapon or a different kind of weapon), clear warning of such an escalation shall also be given unless giving such a warning would unduly place members of teams at risk or would create a risk of death or serious harm to others, or would be clearly inappropriate or ineffective in the particular circumstances.\nFirearms\nStatutory staff deployed as members of the teams shall not use firearms against persons, except in the following circumstances, and only when less extreme means are insufficient to achieve the necessary objectives:\n—\nthe use of firearms by statutory staff deployed as members of the teams is a last resort in an extreme emergency, especially if there is any risk that bystanders might be endangered,\n—\nthe use of firearms by statutory staff deployed as members of the teams is necessary to defend themselves or others against an imminent threat of death or serious injury,\n—\nthe use of firearms by statutory staff deployed as members of the teams is to prevent an imminent threat of death or serious injury,\n—\nthe use of firearms by statutory staff deployed as members of the teams is to repel an actual attack or prevent an impending dangerous attack on essential institutions, services or facilities.\nPrior to the use of firearms, statutory staff deployed as members of the teams must give a clear warning of their intention to use such firearms. Warnings may be given orally or by the firing of warning shots.\nNon-lethal weapons\nBaton\nApproved batons may be used as a means of defence or as a weapon, as appropriate, in line with the core principles, as follows:\n—\nwhen lesser use of force is considered clearly unsuitable for the purpose,\n—\nto avert an actual or impending attack on property.\nPrior to the use of batons, statutory staff deployed as members of the teams must give a clear warning of their intention to use batons. In using batons, statutory staff deployed as members of the teams shall always aim to minimise the risk of injury suffered and avoid contact with the head.\nLachrymatory agents (e.g. pepper spray)\nApproved lachrymatory agents may be used as a means of defence or as a weapon, as appropriate, in line with the core principles, as follows:\n—\nwhen lesser use of force is considered clearly unsuitable for the purpose,\n—\nto avert an actual or impending attack.\nOther equipment\nHandcuffs\nHandcuffs shall only be placed on persons who are considered to present a danger to themselves or to others, in order to ensure their safe detention or transportation and to ensure the safety of statutory staff deployed as members of the teams and other members of the teams. Handcuffs shall only be used for the shortest time possible and only where strictly necessary.\n3.   Practical rules on the use of force, service weapons, ammunition and equipment during operations\nGeneral practical rules on the use of force, weapons and other equipment during operations\nIn accordance with Article 82(8), statutory staff deployed as members of the teams are to exercise their executive power, including the use of force, under the command and control of the host Member State, and shall only use force, including using weapons, ammunition and equipment, in the presence of the border guards of the host Member State following the authorisation of the competent authorities of the host Member State. Nevertheless, the competent authorities of the host Member State may authorise statutory staff deployed as members of the teams, with the consent of the Agency, to use force in the absence of officers of the host Member State.\nThe host Member State may prohibit the carrying of certain service weapons, ammunition and equipment in accordance with the second subparagraph of Article 82(8).\nWithout prejudice to the authorisation by the host Member State and the applicability of its national law to the use of force during operations, the use of force and weapons by statutory staff deployed as members of the teams shall:\n(a)\ncomply with the core principles and specific rules referred to in Part 2;\n(b)\nrespect fundamental rights as guaranteed under international and Union law, including, in particular, under the Charter, the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, the United Nations Basic Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials, and the United Nations Code of Conduct for Law Enforcement Officials;\n(c)\ncomply with the Agency’s code of conduct.\n4.   Control Mechanism\nThe Agency shall provide the following safeguards in relation to the use of force, weapons, ammunition and equipment, and shall provide a stocktaking in its annual report.\nTraining\nThe training provided in accordance with Article 62(2) shall cover theoretical and practical aspects in relation to the prevention of and use of force. The theoretical training shall incorporate psychological training, including training in resilience and working in situations of high pressure, as well as techniques for avoiding the use of force, such as negotiation and mediation. The theoretical training shall be followed by obligatory and adequate theoretical and practical training on the use of force, weapons, ammunition and equipment and on applicable fundamental rights safeguards. In order to ensure a common practical understanding and approach, the practical training shall end with a simulation relevant to the activities to be carried out during the deployment and shall include a practical simulation involving the operationalisation of fundamental rights safeguards.\nThe Agency shall provide statutory staff deployed as members of the teams with annual ongoing training on the use of force. Such training shall take place as per the training provided for in Article 62(2). In order for statutory staff deployed as members of the teams to be permitted to carry service weapons and to use force, they shall be required to have successfully completed the annual ongoing training. The annual ongoing training shall cover theoretical and practical aspects as described in the first paragraph. The annual ongoing training shall last at least 24 hours in total, with the theoretical training taking at least 8 hours and the practical training taking at least 16 hours. The practical training shall be divided into at least 8 hours for physical training, using physical restraint techniques, and at least 8 hours for the use of firearms.\nUse of narcotics, drugs and alcohol consumption\nStatutory staff deployed as members of the teams shall not consume or be under the influence of alcohol while on duty.\nStatutory staff deployed as members of the teams shall not possess or use narcotics or drugs, unless prescribed on medical grounds. Statutory staff deployed as members of the teams requiring drugs for medical purposes shall immediately inform their immediate superior of such a requirement. Their participation in operational activities may be reviewed having regard to potential effects and side-effects associated with the use of the substance.\nThe Agency shall establish a control mechanism to ensure that its statutory staff deployed as members of the teams do not carry out their functions under the influence of narcotics, drugs or alcohol. That mechanism shall be based on regular medical testing of statutory staff deployed as members of the teams in order to identify any possible consumption of narcotics, drugs or alcohol. Any positive test results shall be immediately reported to the executive director.\nReporting\nAny incidents involving the use of force shall be immediately reported through the chain of command to the coordination structure relevant for each operation and to the fundamental rights officer and the executive director. The report shall provide full details of the circumstances in which such use arose.\nDuty to cooperate and inform\nStatutory staff deployed as members of the teams and any other participants in operations shall cooperate in the gathering of facts related to any incident which was reported during an operational activity.\nSupervisory mechanism\nThe Agency shall establish a supervisory mechanism as referred to in point (a) of Article 55(5).\nComplaints mechanism\nAny person may report suspected breaches by statutory staff deployed as members of the teams of the rules on the use of force applicable under this Annex through the complaints mechanism provided for in Article 111.\nSanctions\nWithout prejudice to Article 85, where the Agency establishes that a member of its statutory staff deployed as a member of the teams has performed activities in breach of the rules applicable under this Regulation, including fundamental rights protected under the Charter, the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms and international law, the executive director shall take adequate measures, which may include the immediate recall of that statutory staff member from the operational activity, and any disciplinary measures in accordance with the Staff Regulations, including the removal of the statutory staff member from the Agency.\nRole of the fundamental rights officer\nThe fundamental rights officer shall verify and provide feedback on the content of induction and refresher training paying special regard to aspects relating to fundamental rights and how fundamental rights can be protected in situations where the use of force is necessary, and ensure relevant preventive techniques are included.\nThe fundamental rights officer shall report on the respect for fundamental rights within the law enforcement practices of the host Member State or host third country. That report shall be submitted to the executive director and shall be taken into account in the design of the operational plan.\nThe fundamental rights officer shall ensure that incidents related to the use of force and use of weapons, ammunition and equipment are thoroughly investigated and reported without delay to the executive director. The results of such investigations shall be transmitted to the consultative forum.\nAll activities related to the use of force, weapons, ammunition and equipment shall be regularly monitored by the fundamental rights officer, and all incidents shall be reported in the fundamental rights officer’s reports as well in the annual report of the Agency.\n5.   Provision of service weapons\nAuthorisation of weapons\nFor the purposes of determining the exact service weapons, ammunition and other equipment to be used by statutory staff deployed as members of the teams, the Agency shall establish an exhaustive list of items to be included in personal equipment sets.\nPersonal equipment sets shall be used by all statutory staff deployed as members of the teams. The Agency may also complement personal equipment sets with additional weapons, ammunition or other equipment specific for the purpose of carrying out specific tasks within one or two types of teams.\nThe Agency shall ensure that all weapons, including firearms, ammunition and equipment provided to statutory staff deployed as members of the teams comply with all the necessary technical standards.\nWeapons, ammunition and equipment that are authorised for use shall be listed in the operational plan in line with the requirements on admissible and prohibited weapons of the host Member State.\nInstructions for duty period\nWeapons, ammunition and equipment may be carried during operations and shall be used only as measures of last resort. Carrying or using weapons, ammunition and equipment during off-duty periods shall not be allowed. The Agency shall establish specific rules and measures to facilitate the storage of weapons, ammunition and other equipment of statutory staff deployed as members of the teams during off-duty periods in secured facilities as referred to in point (c) of Article 55(5).\nANNEX VI\nCorrelation Table\nRegulation (EU) 2016/1624\nRegulation (EU) No 1052/2013\nThis Regulation\nArticle 1, first

"summary": "European Border and Coast Guard\nEuropean Border and Coast Guard\nSUMMARY OF:\nRegulation (EU) 2019/1896 on the European Border and Coast Guard\nWHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?\nIt establishes a European Border and Coast Guard agency to:\nassure European integrated management at the EU’s border;\nmanage border crossing efficiently; and\nmake the EU’s return* policy more effective as a key component of sustainable migration management.\nIt aims to address migratory challenges and potential future threats at the borders, combat serious international crime, and ensure internal EU security while fully respecting fundamental rights and safeguarding free movement.\nKEY POINTS\nA standing corps of 10,000 border guards:\nwill ensure that the agency can support EU Member States whenever and wherever needed;\nwill bring together agency staff, as well as border guards and return experts seconded or deployed by Member States, who will support the over 100,000 national border guards in their tasks.\nIn addition, the agency will have a budget to acquire its own equipment, such as vessels, planes and vehicles.\nExecutive powers\nThe standing corps will be able to carry out border control and return tasks, such as identity checks, authorising entry at the external borders, and carrying out border surveillance — only with the agreement of the host Member State.\nMore support on return\nIn addition to organising and financing joint return operations, the agency will now also be able to support Member States at all stages of return process with Member States remaining responsible for taking return decisions.\nThis support can now also include, for example, providing assistance to returnees before, during and post-arrival, as well as identifying non-EU nationals with no right to stay or acquiring travel documents.\nStronger cooperation with non-EU countries\nThe agency will be able — subject to prior agreement of the country concerned — to launch joint operations and deploy staff outside the EU, beyond countries neighbouring the EU, to provide support on border management.\nAntenna offices\nThe agency will be able to set up antenna offices in Member States and in a non-EU country (subject to a status agreement) to support logistically its operational activities and guarantee the smooth running of operations.\nEuropean Border Surveillance System (Eurosur)\nTo improve Eurosur’s operation, the regulation incorporates it in the functioning of the European Border and Coast Guard.\nThe regulation enlarges Eurosur’s scope to cover most of the components of European integrated border management. This means being able to better detect, anticipate and react to crisis situations at the EU’s external borders and in non-EU countries.\nA European Commission\nimplementing act, Implementing Regulation (EU) 2021/581 sets out the rules concerning information exchange and cooperation for the purposes of Eurosur including situational awareness, risk analysis and for supporting the planning and conduct of border control operations. It lays down:\nthe rules for reporting in Eurosur, including the type of information to be provided and the time limits for reporting;\nthe details of the information layers\n* of the situational pictures\n*;\nthe procedures for establishing specific situational pictures;\nthe responsibilities related to the reporting, to managing the situational pictures and for operating and maintaining the various technical systems and networks that support Eurosur;\nEurosur’s data security and data protection rules;\nquality control mechanisms.\nRepeal\nIt repeals Regulations (EU) No 1052/2013 on Eurosur from 4 December 2019 and (EU) 2016/1624 from 31 December 2020.\nFROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?\nIt has applied since 4 December 2019.\nBACKGROUND\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nFor more information, see:\nEuropean Border and Coast Guard: The Commission welcomes agreement on a standing corps of 10,000 border guards by 2027 — press release (European Commission)\nEU Protects: European Border and Coast Guard — YouTube (European Commission).\nKEY TERMS\nReturn: the process of a non-EU national going back voluntarily or enforced to their country of origin, an agreed country of transit, or another Member State to which the person concerned voluntarily decides to return and where they will be accepted.\nInformation layers: situational pictures (see next entry) comprise 3 information layers:\nan events layer (reports on events likely to have an impact on the external border);\nan operational layer (reports on Member States’ own assets, reports on operational plans, as well as reports on environmental information including, in particular, meteorological and oceanographic information); and\nan analysis layer, based on risks analysis reports. Analysis reports aim to enhance the understanding of events at the external border which can facilitate the forecasting of trends, the planning and conduct of border control operations, as well as strategic risk analysis.\nSituational pictures: these contain information on the situation at European borders and the pre-frontier area.\nMAIN DOCUMENT\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nRegulation (EU) 2019/1896 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 November 2019 on the European Border and Coast Guard and repealing Regulations (EU) No 1052/2013 and (EU) 2016/1624 (OJ L 295, 14.11.2019, pp. 1-131)\nRELATED DOCUMENTS\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nCommission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2021/581 of 9 April 2021 on the situational pictures of the European Border Surveillance System (EUROSUR) (OJ L 124, 12.4.2021, pp. 3-39)\nRegulation (EU) 2016/399 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 9 March 2016 on a Union Code on the rules governing the movement of persons across borders (Schengen Borders Code) (OJ L 77, 23.3.2016, pp. 1-52)\nSuccessive amendments to Regulation (EU) 2016/399 have been incorporated into the original text.
