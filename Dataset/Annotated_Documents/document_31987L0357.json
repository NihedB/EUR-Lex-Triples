This Directive applies to the products, defined in paragraph 2 below, which, appearing to be other than they are, endanger the health or safety of consumers.  2. The products referred to in paragraph 1 above are those which, although not foodstuffs, possess a form, odour, colour, appearance, packaging, labelling, volume or size, such that it is likely that consumers, especially children, will confuse them with foodstuffs and in consequence place them in their mouths, or suck or ingest them, which might be dangerous and cause, for example, suffocation, poisoning, or the perforation or obstruction of the digestive tract.  Article 2  Member States shall take all the measures necessary to prohibit the marketing, import and either manufacture or export of the products referred to in this Directive.  Article 3  Member States shall in particular ensure that checks are carried out on products on the market to ascertain that no product falling within the scope of this Directive is being marketed and shall take all necessary measures to ensure that their competent authorities withdraw or cause to be withdrawn from their markets any product covered by this Directive.  Article 4  1. If a Member State takes a specific measure persuant to Articles 2 and 3, it shall inform the Commission thereof. It shall give a description of the product and the grounds for its decision.  Where details of the product are already required under Decision 84/133/EEC, no further notification is required under this Directive.  The Commission shall forward the details to the other Member States at the earliest opportunity.  2. The Committee set up by Decision 84/133/EEC may be requested by the Commission or a Member State to enter into an exchange of views on questions relating to the application of this Directive.  Article 5  Two years after the date referred to in Article 6, on the basis of a Commission report on experience gained, accompanied by appropriate proposals, the Council shall take a decision on a possible adjustment to this Directive, in particular with a view to extending its scope to cover dangerous imitations other than imitations of foodstuffs and any review of the procedures laid down in Article 4.  Article 6  1. Member States shall take the measures necessary to comply with this Directive not later than 26 June 1989. They shall forthwith inform the Commission thereof.  2. Member States shall communicate to the Commission the texts of provisions of national law which they adopt in the field governed by this Directive.

Children are particularly vulnerable and could be tempted to try to eat such products.\nKEY POINTS\nEU countries must:\ntake all necessary measures to ban the sale, import, export and manufacture of the products covered by the legislation;\ncheck that such dangerous products are not being sold on their territory;\ntake off the market any products being sold and inform the European Commission of the product and the reason for the decision.\nThe Commission must inform all other EU governments of the decision as quickly as possible.\nBy 26 June 1989 and on the basis of a Commission report on implementation of the legislation, EU governments had to decide whether the directive should be extended to cover other dangerous products.\nOn 3 December 2001, EU governments and the European Parliament agreed on legislation on general product safety which requires manufacturers to ensure that their products are safe before selling them.\nFROM WHEN DOES THE DIRECTIVE APPLY?\n              \nIt has applied since 26 June 1987. EU countries had to incorporate it into national law by 26 June 1989.\nBACKGROUND\n              \nIn an opinion adopted in March 2011, the Scientific Committee on Consumer Safety noted that there was a low risk of acute poisoning in either children or the elderly from accidentally eating cosmetics. For household products, there is a slight increase of a more serious outcome. In addition, there is a lack of specific data on accidental ingestion from consumer products resembling food and/or having child-appealing properties.\nACT\n            \nCouncil Directive 87/357/EEC of 25 June 1987 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States concerning products which, appearing to be other than they are, endanger the health or safety of consumers (OJ L 192, 11.7.1987, pp. 49-50)\nRELATED ACTS\n            \nDirective 2001/95/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 3 December 2001 on general product safety (OJ L 11, 15.1.2002, pp. 4-17)\nSuccessive amendments to Directive 2001/95/EC have been incorporated in the original text.
