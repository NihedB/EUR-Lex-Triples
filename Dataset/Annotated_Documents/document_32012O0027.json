Since further amendments to this Guideline are now required to incorporate material previously internal to the Eurosystem and to add necessary definitions, as well as provisions with regard to inapplicability of sanctions to non-Union banks, information sharing with regard to suspension or termination of access to monetary policy operations and the consequences of such suspension or termination, it should be recast in the interests of clarity and transparency.\n(2)\nTARGET2 has a decentralised structure linking together national real-time gross settlement (RTGS) systems and the ECB Payment Mechanism.\n(3)\nTARGET2 is characterised by a single technical platform called the Single Shared Platform (SSP). TARGET2 is legally structured as a multiplicity of payment systems, where the TARGET2 component systems are harmonised to the greatest extent possible, with certain exceptions in the event of national law constraints.\n(4)\nThere are three separate levels of governance for TARGET2. Level 1 (Governing Council) has final competence in relation to TARGET2 and safeguards its public function. Level 2 (Eurosystem central banks) has subsidiary competence for TARGET2, while Level 3 (SSP-providing NCBs) builds and operates the SSP for the Eurosystem’s benefit.\n(5)\nActing on the Eurosystem’s behalf, the European Central Bank (ECB) enters into a Framework Agreement, as well as a Confidentiality and Non-Disclosure Agreement, with the network service provider designated by the Governing Council, which sets out the main elements relating to network provision to the participants, including pricing.\n(6)\nTARGET2 is essential for the performance of certain basic Eurosystem tasks, i.e. implementing the Union’s monetary policy and promoting the smooth operation of payment systems,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS GUIDELINE:\nSECTION I\nGENERAL PROVISIONS\nArticle 1\nSubject matter and scope\n1.   TARGET2 provides RTGS for payments in euro, with settlement in central bank money.

Without prejudice to Article 8 of the Statute of the European System of Central Banks and of the European Central Bank (hereinafter the ‘Statute of the ESCB’), the management of TARGET2 shall be based on a three-level governance scheme. The tasks assigned to the Governing Council (Level 1), the Eurosystem CBs (Level 2) and the SSP-providing NCBs (Level 3) are laid down in Annex I.\n2.   The Governing Council shall be responsible for the direction, management and control of TARGET2. The tasks assigned to Level 1 fall within the exclusive competence of the Governing Council. The ESCB’s Payment and Settlement Systems Committee (PSSC) shall assist the Governing Council as an advisory body in all matters relating to TARGET2.\n3.   In accordance with the third paragraph of Article 12.1 of the Statute of the ESCB, the Eurosystem CBs shall be responsible for the tasks assigned to Level 2, within the general framework defined by the Governing Council. In addition to its advisory role, the PSSC shall conduct the execution of the tasks assigned to Level 2. The connected NCBs shall participate without voting rights on Level 2-related issues. Member States’ NCBs that are neither Eurosystem CBs nor connected NCBs shall have observer status only at Level 2.\n4.   The Eurosystem CBs organise themselves through the conclusion of appropriate agreements. Within the context of such agreements, decision-making shall be based on a simple majority, and each Eurosystem CB shall have one vote.\n5.   In accordance with the third paragraph of Article 12.1 of the Statute of the ESCB, the SSP-providing NCBs shall be responsible for the tasks assigned to Level 3, within the general framework defined by the Governing Council.\n6.   The SSP-providing NCBs shall conclude an agreement with the Eurosystem CBs governing the services to be provided by the former to the latter. Such agreement shall also include, where appropriate, the connected NCBs.\nSECTION III\nOPERATION OF TARGET2\nArticle 8\nHarmonised Conditions for participation in TARGET2\n1.   Each euro area NCB shall adopt arrangements implementing the Harmonised Conditions. These arrangements shall exclusively govern the relationship between the relevant euro area NCB and its participants in respect of the processing of payments in the PM. A PM account can be accessed using either internet-based access or via the network service provider. These two methods of accessing a PM account shall be mutually exclusive, although a participant may choose to have one or more PM accounts, each of which will be accessible by either the internet or the network service provider.\n2.   The ECB shall adopt the terms and conditions of TARGET2-ECB by implementing Annex II except that TARGET2-ECB shall only provide services to clearing and settlement organisations, including entities established outside the EEA, provided that they are subject to oversight by a competent authority and their access to TARGET2-ECB has been approved by the Governing Council.\n3.   The arrangements adopted by the Eurosystem CBs implementing the Harmonised Conditions shall be made public.\n4.   The Eurosystem CBs may request derogations from the Harmonised Conditions on the basis of national law constraints. The Governing Council shall consider such requests on a case-by-case basis and shall grant derogations where appropriate.\n5.   Subject to the relevant monetary agreement, the ECB may determine appropriate conditions for participation in TARGET2 of entities referred to in Article 4(2)(e) of Annex II.\n6.   The Eurosystem CBs shall not allow any entity to be an indirect participant or to be registered as an addressable BIC holder in their TARGET2 component system if this entity acts via a direct participant that is an NCB of a Member State but is neither a Eurosystem CB nor a connected NCB.\nArticle 9\nPricing\n1.   The Eurosystem CBs shall ensure that:\n(a)\nthe fees for core TARGET2 services provided to their indirect participants and their addressable BIC holders that are eligible to participate in TARGET2 as indirect participants are higher than the fees for direct participants specified in paragraph 1(a) of Appendix VI to Annex II;\n(b)\nthe fees for payments between credit institutions established in the EEA settled on Home Accounts are higher than the fees for direct participants specified in paragraph 1(a) of Appendix VI to Annex II;\n(c)\npayments in relation to open market operations settled on a Home Account shall be charged in accordance with Appendix VI to Annex II;\n(d)\nthe pricing for all of the following operations and transactions is outside the scope of the fee schedule laid down in Appendix VI to Annex II:\n(i)\nliquidity transfers initiated from and processed within Home Accounts;\n(ii)\noperations relating to minimum reserve management and standing facilities;\n(iii)\ncash transactions settled on Home Accounts.\n2.   For ancillary system-related transactions settled on Home Accounts during the transition period the following shall be charged: Fixed Fee I, Fixed Fee II and a transaction fee higher than the ancillary system transaction fee specified in paragraph 18(1) of Annex IV. The Eurosystem CBs may apply other pricing schemes for ancillary system-related transactions settled on Home Accounts during the transition period, provided that the revenues are the same as or higher than revenues that would be received if the Eurosystem CB were to apply the scheme referred to in the first sentence of this paragraph.\nArticle 10\nLiquidity pooling arrangements\n1.   The AL NCBs shall exchange all information that is necessary for the performance of their duties and obligations under an AL agreement. The AL NCBs shall immediately notify the managing NCB of any enforcement event of which they become aware relating to the AL group or any AL group member, including the head office and branches thereof.\n2.   When the managing NCB is notified that an enforcement event has occurred it shall, having regard to the AL agreement, instruct the relevant AL NCBs regarding the enforcement action to be taken in relation to the AL group or the relevant AL group member. The AL NCBs shall be responsible for enforcing their rights under the AL agreement and the arrangements implementing Annex II. The managing NCB shall be responsible for calculating and giving instructions in relation to the apportionment of claims.\n3.   If, on the occurrence of an enforcement event, intraday credit provided to any AL group member has not been fully reimbursed, an AL NCB shall, on receiving instructions from the managing NCB, enforce the rights it may have in relation to its respective AL group members, including rights deriving from the relevant pledge, set-off, close-out netting or any other relevant provision in the arrangements implementing Annex II, in order to obtain full and timely discharge of the claims that such AL NCB may have against its respective AL group members under the AL agreement. Such claims shall be enforced before the enforcement of any other claims of the relevant AL NCB towards its respective AL group members.\n4.   Any payments received in discharge of a claim under the AL agreement following enforcement action shall be forwarded to the AL NCBs that have extended intraday credit to the respective AL group members. Such payments shall be allocated to the AL NCBs in proportion to the amount of intraday credit that is not reimbursed by the AL group members to their respective AL NCBs.\n5.   Any AL NCB that wishes to claim it has incurred loss that should be borne by all AL NCBs shall send a submission to the managing NCB setting out the grounds for the claim. The managing NCB shall forward such request to the relevant AL NCBs and shall calculate the compensation due from each such AL NCB in equal shares.\nArticle 11\nGuarantee Fund Accounts and Remuneration\n1.   To the extent that a central counterparty (CCP) is required by regulation, including on oversight grounds, to hold a Guarantee Fund Account, funds held on such an account of a CCP shall be remunerated at the main refinancing operations rate minus 15 basis points.\n2.   Funds otherwise credited to a Guarantee Fund Account of a CCP shall be remunerated at the deposit rate.\nArticle 12\nIntraday credit\n1.   The euro area NCBs may grant intraday credit, provided that this is done in accordance with the arrangements implementing the rules on the provision of intraday credit laid down in Annex III. No intraday-credit shall be granted to a participant whose eligibility as a counterparty for Eurosystem monetary policy operations has been suspended or terminated.\n2.   The eligibility criteria for intraday credit of ECB counterparties are defined in Decision ECB/2007/7 of 24 July 2007 concerning the terms and conditions of TARGET2-ECB (5). Intraday credit granted by the ECB shall remain limited to the day in question with no possibility of an extension to overnight credit.\nArticle 13\nAncillary systems\n1.   The Eurosystem CBs shall provide fund transfer services in central bank money to ancillary systems in the PM accessed through the network service provider or, during the transition period and if applicable, on Home Accounts. Such services shall be governed by bilateral arrangements between the Eurosystem CBs and the respective ancillary systems.\n2.   Bilateral arrangements with ancillary systems that use the ASI shall be in conformity with Annex IV. In addition, the Eurosystem CBs shall ensure that in such bilateral arrangements the following provisions of Annex II apply mutatis mutandis:\n—\nArticle 8(1) (technical and legal requirements),\n—\nArticle 8(2) to (5) (application procedure), except that instead of being required to meet the access criteria in Article 4 the ancillary system shall be required to meet the access criteria in the definition of ‘ancillary system’ set out in Article 1 of Annex II,\n—\nthe operating schedule in Appendix V,\n—\nArticle 11 (requirements for cooperation and information exchange), except paragraph 8,\n—\nArticles 27 and 28 (business continuity and contingency procedures and security requirements),\n—\nArticle 31 (liability regime),\n—\nArticle 32 (evidence rules),\n—\nArticles 33 and 34 (duration, termination and suspension of participation), except Article 34(1)(b),\n—\nArticle 35, where relevant (closure of PM accounts),\n—\nArticle 38 (confidentiality rules),\n—\nArticle 39 (Union requirements for data protection, prevention of money laundering and related issues),\n—\nArticle 40 (requirements for notices),\n—\nArticle 41 (contractual relationship with the network service provider),\n—\nArticle 44 (rules for governing law, jurisdiction and place of performance).\n3.   Bilateral arrangements with ancillary systems that use the PI shall be in conformity with:\n(a)\nAnnex II, with the exception of Title V and Appendices VI and VII; and\n(b)\nArticle 18 of Annex IV.\n4.   By derogation from paragraph 3, bilateral arrangements with ancillary systems that use the PI, but only settle payments for the benefit of their customers, shall be in conformity with:\n(a)\nAnnex II, with the exception of Title V, Article 36 and Appendices VI and VII; and\n(b)\nArticle 18 of Annex IV.\nArticle 14\nFinancing and cost methodology\n1.   The Governing Council shall determine the rules applicable to the financing of the SSP. Any surplus or deficit resulting from the functioning of the SSP shall be distributed among the euro area NCBs in accordance with the key for subscription to the ECB’s capital, pursuant to Article 29 of the Statute of the ESCB.\n2.   The Governing Council shall determine a common cost methodology and pricing structure for core TARGET2 services.\nArticle 15\nSecurity provisions\n1.   The Governing Council shall specify the security policy and security requirements and controls for the SSP and, during the transition period, for the Home Account technical infrastructure. The Governing Council shall also specify the principles applicable to the security of certificates used for internet-based access.\n2.   The Eurosystem CBs shall comply with, and shall ensure that the SSP complies with, the measures referred to in paragraph 1.\nArticle 16\nAudit rules\nAudit assessments shall be performed in accordance with the principles and arrangements set out in the Governing Council’s ESCB Audit Policy.\nArticle 17\nObligations in the event of suspension or termination\n1.   Eurosystem CBs shall immediately terminate without prior notice or suspend a participant’s participation in the relevant TARGET2 component system if:\n(a)\ninsolvency proceedings are opened in relation to a participant; or\n(b)\na participant no longer meets the access criteria for the participation in the relevant TARGET2 component system.\n2.   If a Eurosystem CB suspends or terminates a participant’s participation in TARGET2 in accordance with paragraph 1 or on the grounds of prudence in accordance with Article 19, it shall immediately notify all other Eurosystem CBs thereof, providing all of the following:\n(a)\nthe participant’s name, Monetary Financial Institution code and BIC;\n(b)\nthe information upon which the euro area NCB based its decision, including any information or opinion obtained from the relevant supervisory authority;\n(c)\nthe measure taken and a proposed time-frame for its application.\nEach Eurosystem CB shall, if so requested by another Eurosystem CB, exchange information in relation to such participant, including information in relation to payments addressed to it.\n3.   A Eurosystem CB that has terminated or suspended the participation of a participant in its TARGET2 component system in accordance with paragraph 1 shall assume liability in relation to the other Eurosystem CBs if it either:\n(a)\nsubsequently authorises the settlement of payment orders addressed to participants whose participation it has suspended or terminated; or\n(b)\ndoes not comply with the obligations in paragraphs 1 and 2.\n4.   The Eurosystem CBs’ obligations set out in paragraphs 1 to 3 shall also apply in the event of suspension or termination of the use of the ASI by ancillary systems.\nArticle 18\nProcedures for the rejection on the grounds of prudence of an application for participation in TARGET2\nWhere, pursuant to Article 8(4)(c) of Annex II, a Eurosystem CB rejects on the grounds of prudence an application to join TARGET2, that Eurosystem CB shall promptly inform the ECB of such rejection.\nArticle 19\nProcedures for the suspension, limitation or termination on the grounds of prudence of participation in TARGET2 and access to intraday credit\n1.   Where on the grounds of prudence, a euro area NCB suspends, limits or terminates a participant’s access to intraday credit pursuant to paragraph 12(d) of Annex III or a Eurosystem CB suspends or terminates a participant’s participation in TARGET2 pursuant to Article 34(2)(e) of Annex II, the decision shall, to the extent possible, take effect at the same time in all TARGET2 component systems.\n2.   The euro area NCB shall provide the information of Article 17(2) without delay to the relevant supervisory authorities in the euro area NCB’s Member State, with the request that the supervisory authorities share information with the supervisory authorities of other Member States in which the participant has a subsidiary or branch. Taking into account the decision pursuant to paragraph 1, other euro area NCBs shall take appropriate action and provide information thereof to the ECB without delay.\n3.   The ECB’s Executive Board may propose to the Governing Council to take any decisions in order to ensure uniform implementation of the measures taken pursuant to paragraphs 1 and 2.\n4.

If an event affecting the normal operation of the PM and/or the ICM occurs, the Eurosystem CB concerned shall immediately notify the TARGET2 coordinator, who together with the settlement manager of the Eurosystem CB concerned shall decide on the further steps to be taken. The TARGET2 settlement managers shall agree on the information that should be communicated to TARGET2 participants.\n3.   The Eurosystem CBs shall report the participant’s failure to the TARGET2 coordinator if such failure might affect the settlement in ancillary systems or create systemic risk. The SSP’s closure shall normally not be delayed due to a participant’s failure.\n4.   A failure affecting an ancillary system shall be reported by the Eurosystem CBs to the TARGET2 coordinator for information purposes. The TARGET2 coordinator shall initiate a teleconference of the TARGET2 settlement managers in the event that there is an unavoidable systemic impact, in particular when this is of a cross-border nature.\n5.   In exceptional circumstances, the SSP’s closure may be delayed if there is a failure affecting an ancillary system. A request to delay the SSP’s closure shall be communicated by the Eurosystem CBs to the TARGET2 crisis managers.\nArticle 22\nTreatment of claims under the TARGET2 compensation scheme\n1.   Unless otherwise decided by the Governing Council, the compensation procedure set out in Appendix II to Annex II shall be managed in accordance with this Article.\n2.

Where necessary for the assessment of claims, such CB shall be assisted by other CBs concerned. The relevant CB shall inform the ECB and all other CBs concerned as soon as it becomes aware of pending claims.\n3.   Within nine weeks following a technical malfunction of TARGET2, the CB of the participant submitting the claim shall:\n(a)\nprepare a preliminary assessment report containing the CB’s assessment of the claims received; and\n(b)\nsubmit the preliminary assessment report to the ECB and all other CBs concerned.\n4.   Within five weeks following receipt of the preliminary assessment report, the Governing Council shall carry out the final assessment of all claims received, and shall decide on the compensation offers to be made to the participants concerned. Within five business days following the completion of the final assessment, the ECB shall communicate the outcome of the final assessment to the CBs concerned. Those CBs shall without delay inform their participants of the outcome of the final assessment and, where applicable, details of the compensation offer, together with the form constituting the letter of acceptance.\n5.   Within two weeks following expiry of the period referred to in the last sentence of Article 4(d) of Appendix II to Annex II, the CB shall inform the ECB and all other CBs concerned about which compensation offers have been accepted and which compensation offers have been rejected.\n6.   The CBs shall inform the ECB of any claim submitted by their participants to those CBs outside the scope of the TARGET2 compensation scheme, but relating to a technical malfunction of TARGET2.\nArticle 23\nTreatment of losses caused by a technical malfunction of TARGET2\n1.   In the event of a technical malfunction of TARGET2:\n(a)\nOn the payer’s side, any CB with which a payer has placed a deposit benefits from certain financial gains which amount to the difference between the Eurosystem’s main refinancing operations rate and the deposit rate applied to the marginal increase in the use of the Eurosystem’s deposit facility for the period of the technical malfunction of TARGET2 and up to the amount of the non-settled payment orders. Where the payer is left with non-remunerated surplus funds, the financial gains amount to the Eurosystem’s main refinancing operations rate, applied to the amount of the non-interest-bearing surplus funds for the period of the technical malfunction of TARGET2 and up to the amount of the non-settled payment orders.\n(b)\nOn the payee’s side, the CB from whom the payee has borrowed by using the marginal lending facility benefits from certain financial gains which amount to the difference between the marginal lending rate and the Eurosystem’s main refinancing operations rate, applied to the marginal increase in the use of the marginal lending facility for the period of the technical malfunction of TARGET2 and up to the amount of the non-settled payment orders.\n2.   The ECB’s financial gains amount to:\n(a)\nthe earnings in relation to the connected NCBs arising from the different remuneration of end-of-day balances of those connected NCBs in relation to the ECB; and\n(b)\nthe amount of penalty interest the ECB receives from connected NCBs whenever one of those connected NCBs imposes a penalty on a participant for a failure to reimburse intraday credit on time, as provided for in the agreement between the Eurosystem CBs and the connected NCBs.\n3.   The financial gains referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 shall be pooled by the CBs and the resulting pooled amount shall be used to reimburse those CBs that incur the costs of compensating their participants. Any remaining financial gains or costs incurred by the CBs in compensating their participants shall be shared among the Eurosystem CBs in accordance with the key for subscription to the ECB’s capital.\nArticle 24\nSecurity rights in relation to funds on sub-accounts and intra-Eurosystem guarantee\n1.   For the purpose of the settlement of ancillary system-related payment instructions, any Eurosystem CB that has opened sub-accounts for its participants shall ensure that the balances on such sub-accounts (including increases or reductions of the frozen balance resulting from crediting or debiting cross system settlement payments to or from the sub-account or from crediting liquidity transfers to the sub-account) that are frozen during the ancillary system processing cycle can be used for the settlement of ancillary system related payment instructions. This is notwithstanding any insolvency proceedings with respect to the relevant participant and notwithstanding any individual enforcement measure relating to such participant’s sub-account.\n2.   Each time liquidity is transferred to a participant’s sub-account and where the Eurosystem CB is not the ancillary system’s CB, such Eurosystem CB shall, upon communication by the ancillary system (via a ‘start-of-cycle’ message), confirm the freezing of the balances on the sub-account to the relevant ancillary system and, in doing so, guarantee to the ancillary system’s CB payment up to the amount of this particular balance. The confirmation of the freezing to the ancillary system shall also entail a legally binding declaration of will by the ancillary system’s CB that the latter guarantees to the ancillary system payment up to the amount of the frozen balance. By confirming the increase or reduction of the frozen balance upon crediting or debiting cross-system settlement payments to or from the sub-account or crediting liquidity transfers to the sub-account, both the Eurosystem CB that is not the ancillary system’s CB and the ancillary system’s CB declare an increase or a reduction of the guarantee in the amount of the payment. Both guarantees shall be irrevocable, unconditional and payable on first demand. Both guarantees and the freezing of the balances shall expire upon communication by the ancillary system that the settlement has been completed (via an ‘end-of-cycle’ message).\nSECTION IV\nTRANSITIONAL AND FINAL PROVISIONS\nArticle 25\nDispute resolution and applicable law\n1.   In the event of a dispute between Eurosystem CBs in relation to this Guideline, the affected parties shall seek to settle the dispute in accordance with the Memorandum of Understanding on an Intra-ESCB Dispute Settlement Procedure.\n2.   By derogation from paragraph 1, if a dispute relating to the division of the tasks between Level 2 and Level 3 cannot be settled by agreement between the affected parties, the Governing Council shall resolve the dispute.\n3.   In the event of a dispute of the type referred to in paragraph 1, the parties’ respective rights and obligations shall primarily be determined by the rules and procedures laid down in this Guideline.

Multi-addressee access through branches may be provided as follows:\n(a)\nA credit institution within the meaning of Article 4(1)(a) or (b), which has been admitted as a direct participant, may grant access to its PM account to one or more of its branches established in the EEA in order to submit payment orders and/or receive payments directly, provided that [insert name of the CB] has been informed accordingly.\n(b)\nWhere a branch of a credit institution has been admitted as a direct participant, the other branches of the same legal entity and/or its head office, in both cases provided that they are established in the EEA, may access the branch’s PM account, provided that it has informed the [insert name of CB].\nArticle 6\nIndirect participants\n1.   Credit institutions established in the EEA may each enter into a contract with one direct participant that is either a credit institution within the meaning of Article 4(1)(a) or (b), or a CB, in order to submit payment orders and/or receive payments, and to settle them via the PM account of that direct participant. TARGET2-[insert CB/country reference] shall recognise indirect participants by registering such indirect participation in the TARGET2 directory, the latter as described in Article 9.\n2.   Where a direct participant, which is a credit institution within the meaning of Article 4(1)(a) or (b), and an indirect participant belong to the same group, the direct participant may expressly authorise the indirect participant to use the direct participant’s PM account directly to submit payment orders and/or receive payments by way of group-related multi-addressee access.\nArticle 7\nDirect participant’s responsibility\n1.   For the avoidance of doubt, payment orders submitted or payments received by indirect participants pursuant to Article 6, and by branches under Article 5(4), shall be deemed to have been submitted or received by the direct participant itself.\n2.   The direct participant shall be bound by such payment orders, regardless of the content of, or any non-compliance with, the contractual or other arrangements between that participant and any of the entities referred to in paragraph 1.\nArticle 8\nApplication procedure\n1.   To join TARGET2-[insert CB/country reference], applicant participants shall:\n(a)\nfulfil the following technical requirements:\n(i)\ninstall, manage, operate and monitor and ensure the security of the necessary IT infrastructure to connect to TARGET2-[insert CB/country reference] and submit payment orders to it.

In particular, applicant participants shall enter into an agreement with the network service provider to obtain the necessary connection and admissions, in accordance with the technical specifications in Appendix I; and\n(ii)\nhave passed the tests required by the [insert name of CB]; and\n(b)\nfulfil the following legal requirements:\n(i)\nprovide a capacity opinion in the form specified in Appendix III, unless the information and representations to be provided in such capacity opinion have already been obtained by the [insert name of CB] in another context; and\n(ii)\nfor the entities referred to in Article 4(1)(b), provide a country opinion in the form specified in Appendix III, unless the information and representations to be provided in such country opinion have already been obtained by the [insert name of CB] in another context.\n2.   Applicants shall apply in writing to the [insert name of CB], as a minimum enclosing the following documents/information:\n(a)\ncompleted static data collection forms as provided by [insert name of CB];\n(b)\nthe capacity opinion, if required by the [insert name of CB]; and\n(c)\nthe country opinion, if required by the [insert name of CB].\n3.   The [insert name of CB] may also request any additional information it deems necessary to decide on the application to participate.\n4.   The [insert name of CB] shall reject the application to participate if:\n(a)\naccess criteria referred to in Article 4 are not met;\n(b)\none or more of the participation criteria referred to in paragraph 1 are not met; and/or\n(c)\nin the [insert name of CB]’s assessment, such participation would endanger the overall stability, soundness and safety of TARGET2-[insert CB/country reference] or of any other TARGET2 component system, or would jeopardise the [insert name of CB]’s performance of its tasks as described in [refer to relevant national law] and the Statute of the European System of Central Banks and of the European Central Bank, or poses risks on the grounds of prudence.\n5.   The [insert name of CB] shall communicate its decision on the application to participate to the applicant within one month of the [insert name of CB]’s receipt of the application to participate. Where the [insert name of CB] requests additional information pursuant to paragraph 3, the decision shall be communicated within one month of the [insert name of CB]’s receipt of this information from the applicant. Any rejection decision shall contain reasons for the rejection.\nArticle 9\nTARGET2 directory\n1.   The TARGET2 directory is the database of BICs used for the routing of payment orders addressed to:\n(a)\nTARGET2 participants and their branches with multi-addressee access;\n(b)\nindirect participants of TARGET2, including those with multi-addressee access; and\n(c)\naddressable BIC holders of TARGET2.\nIt shall be updated weekly.\n2.   Unless otherwise requested by the participant, its BICs shall be published in the TARGET2 directory.\n3.   Participants may only distribute the TARGET2 directory to their branches and entities with multi-addressee access.\n4.   Entities specified in paragraph 1(b) and (c) shall only use their BIC in relation to one direct participant.\n5.   Participants acknowledge that the [insert name of CB] and other CBs may publish participants’ names and BICs. In addition, names and BICs of indirect participants registered by participants may be published and participants shall ensure that indirect participants have agreed to such publication.\nTITLE III\nOBLIGATIONS OF THE PARTIES\nArticle 10\nObligations of the [insert name of CB] and the participants\n1.   The [insert name of CB] shall offer the services described in Title IV. Save where otherwise provided in these Conditions or required by law, the [insert name of CB] shall use all reasonable means within its power to perform its obligations under these Conditions, without guaranteeing a result.\n2.   Participants shall pay to the [insert name of CB] the fees laid down in Appendix VI.\n3.   Participants shall ensure that they are connected to TARGET2-[insert CB/country reference] on business days, in accordance with the operating schedule in Appendix V.\n4.   The participant represents and warrants to the [insert name of CB] that the performance of its obligations under these Conditions does not breach any law, regulation or by-law applicable to it or any agreement by which it is bound.\nArticle 11\nCooperation and information exchange\n1.   In performing their obligations and exercising their rights under these Conditions, the [insert name of CB] and participants shall cooperate closely to ensure the stability, soundness and safety of TARGET2-[insert CB/country reference]. They shall provide each other with any information or documents relevant for the performance of their respective obligations and the exercise of their respective rights under these Conditions, without prejudice to any banking secrecy obligations.\n2.   The [insert name of CB] shall establish and maintain a system support desk to assist participants in relation to difficulties arising in connection with system operations.\n3.   Up-to-date information on the SSP’s operational status shall be available on the TARGET2 Information System (T2IS). The T2IS may be used to obtain information on any event affecting the normal operation of TARGET2.\n4.   The [insert name of CB] may either communicate messages to participants by means of an ICM broadcast or by any other means of communication.\n5.   Participants are responsible for the timely update of existing static data collection forms and the submission of new static data collection forms to the [insert name of CB]. Participants are responsible for verifying the accuracy of information relating to them that is entered into TARGET2-[insert CB/country reference] by the [insert name of CB].\n6.   The [insert name of CB] shall be deemed to be authorised to communicate to the SSP-providing NCBs any information relating to participants which the SSP-providing NCBs may need in their role as service administrators, in accordance with the contract entered into with the network service provider.\n7.   Participants shall inform the [insert name of CB] about any change in their legal capacity and relevant legislative changes affecting issues covered by the country opinion relating to them.\n8.

Participants shall immediately inform the [insert name of CB] if an event of default occurs in relation to them.\nTITLE IV\nMANAGEMENT OF PM ACCOUNTS AND PROCESSING OF PAYMENT ORDERS\nArticle 12\nOpening and management of PM accounts\n1.   The [insert name of CB] shall open and operate at least one PM account for each participant. Upon request by a participant acting as a settlement bank, the [insert name of CB] shall open one or more sub-accounts in TARGET2-[insert CB/country reference] to be used for dedicating liquidity.\n2.   [Insert if applicable: No debit balance shall be allowed on PM accounts].\n3.   [Insert if applicable: At the beginning and end of a business day, there shall be a zero balance on the PM accounts. Participants shall be deemed to have instructed the [insert name of CB] to transfer any balance at the end of a business day to the account designated by the participant].\n4.   [Insert if applicable: At the beginning of the next business day such balance shall be retransferred to the participant’s PM account].\n5.   PM accounts and their sub-accounts shall be interest free, unless they are used to hold minimum reserves. In such a case, the calculation and payment of the remuneration of holdings of minimum reserves shall be governed by Council Regulation (EC) No 2531/98 of 23 November 1998 concerning the application of minimum reserves by the European Central Bank (9) and Regulation (EC) No 1745/2003 of the European Central Bank of 12 September 2003 on the application of minimum reserves (ECB/2003/9) (10).\n6.   In addition to the settlement of payment orders in the Payments Module, a PM account may be used to settle payment orders to and from Home Accounts, according to the rules laid down by the [insert name of CB].\n7.   Participants shall use the ICM to obtain information on their liquidity position. The [insert name of CB] shall provide a daily statement of accounts to any participant that has opted for such service.\nArticle 13\nTypes of payment orders\nThe following are classified as payment orders for the purposes of TARGET2:\n(a)\ncredit transfer orders;\n(b)\ndirect debit instructions carried out under a direct debit authorisation; and\n(c)\nliquidity transfer orders.\nArticle 14\nAcceptance and rejection of payment orders\n1.   Payment orders submitted by participants are deemed accepted by the [insert name of CB] if:\n(a)\nthe payment message complies with the rules established by the network service provider;\n(b)\nthe payment message complies with the formatting rules and conditions of TARGET2-[insert CB/country reference] and passes the double-entry check described in Appendix I; and\n(c)\nin cases where a payer or a payee has been suspended, the suspended participant’s CB’s explicit consent has been obtained.\n2.   The [insert name of CB] shall immediately reject any payment order that does not fulfil the conditions laid down in paragraph 1. The [insert name of CB] shall inform the participant of any rejection of a payment order, as specified in Appendix I.\n3.   The SSP determines the timestamp for the processing of payment orders on the basis of the time when it receives and accepts the payment order.\nArticle 15\nPriority rules\n1.   Instructing participants shall designate every payment order as one of the following:\n(a)\nnormal payment order (priority class 2);\n(b)\nurgent payment order (priority class 1);\n(c)\nhighly urgent payment order (priority class 0).\nIf a payment order does not indicate the priority, it shall be treated as a normal payment order.\n2.   Highly urgent payment orders may only be designated by:\n(a)\nCBs; and\n(b)\nparticipants, in cases of payments to and from CLS International Bank and liquidity transfers in relation to ancillary system settlement using the ASI.\nAll payment instructions submitted by an ancillary system through the ASI to debit or credit the participants’ PM accounts shall be deemed to be highly urgent payment orders.\n3.   Liquidity transfer orders initiated via the ICM are urgent payment orders.\n4.   In the case of urgent and normal payment orders, the payer may change the priority via the ICM with immediate effect. It shall not be possible to change the priority of a highly urgent payment order.\nArticle 16\nLiquidity limits\n1.   A participant may limit the use of available liquidity for payment orders in relation to other TARGET2 participants, except any of the CBs, by setting bilateral or multilateral limits. Such limits may only be set in relation to normal payment orders.\n2.   Limits may only be set by or in relation to an AL group in its entirety. Limits shall not be set in relation to either a single PM account of an AL group member or by AL group members in relation to each other.\n3.   By setting a bilateral limit, a participant instructs the [insert name of CB] that an accepted payment order shall not be settled if the sum of its outgoing normal payment orders to another TARGET2 participant’s PM account minus the sum of all incoming urgent and normal payments from such TARGET2 participant’s PM account would exceed this bilateral limit.\n4.   A participant may set a multilateral limit for any relationship that is not subject to a bilateral limit. A multilateral limit may only be set if the participant has set at least one bilateral limit. If a participant sets a multilateral limit, it instructs the [insert name of CB] that an accepted payment order shall not be settled if the sum of its outgoing normal payment orders to all TARGET2 participants’ PM accounts in relation to which no bilateral limit has been set, minus the sum of all incoming urgent and normal payments from such PM accounts would exceed this multilateral limit.\n5.   The minimum amount of any of the limits shall be EUR 1 million. A bilateral or a multilateral limit with an amount of zero shall be treated as if no limit has been set. Limits between zero and EUR 1 million are not possible.\n6.   Limits may be changed in real time with immediate effect or with effect from the next business day via the ICM. If a limit is changed to zero, it shall not be possible to change it again on the same business day. The setting of a new bilateral or multilateral limit shall only be effective from the next business day.\nArticle 17\nLiquidity reservation facilities\n1.   Participants may reserve liquidity for highly urgent or urgent payment orders via the ICM.\n2.   The AL group manager may only reserve liquidity for the AL group in its entirety. Liquidity shall not be reserved for single accounts within an AL group.\n3.   By requesting to reserve a certain amount of liquidity for highly urgent payment orders, a participant instructs the [insert name of CB] only to settle urgent and normal payment orders if there is available liquidity after the amount reserved for highly urgent payment orders has been deducted.\n4.   By requesting to reserve a certain amount of liquidity for urgent payment orders, a participant instructs the [insert name of CB] only to settle normal payment orders if there is available liquidity after the amount reserved for urgent and highly urgent payment orders has been deducted.\n5.   After receipt of the reservation request the [insert name of CB] shall check whether the amount of liquidity on the participant’s PM account is sufficient for the reservation. If this is not the case, only the liquidity available on the PM account shall be reserved. The rest of the requested liquidity shall be reserved if additional liquidity becomes available.\n6.   The level of the liquidity reservation may be changed. Participants may make a request via the ICM to reserve new amounts with immediate effect or with effect from the next business day.\nArticle 17a\nStanding instructions for liquidity reservation and dedication of liquidity\n1.   Participants may predefine the default amount of liquidity reserved for highly urgent or urgent payment orders via the ICM. Such standing instruction or a change to such instruction shall take effect from the next business day.\n2.   Participants may predefine via the ICM the default amount of liquidity set aside for ancillary system settlement. Such standing instruction or a change to such instruction shall take effect from the next business day. Participants shall be deemed to have instructed the [insert name of CB] to dedicate liquidity on their behalf if the relevant ancillary system so requests.\nArticle 18\nPredetermined settlement times\n1.   Instructing participants may predetermine the settlement time of the payment orders within a business day by using the Earliest Debit Time Indicator or the Latest Debit Time Indicator.\n2.   When the Earliest Debit Time Indicator is used, the accepted payment order is stored and only entered into the entry disposition at the indicated time.\n3.   When the Latest Debit Time Indicator is used, the accepted payment order shall be returned as non-settled if it cannot be settled by the indicated debit time. 15 minutes prior to the defined debit time, the instructing participant shall be sent an automatic notification via the ICM. Instructing participant may also use the Latest Debit Time Indicator solely as a warning indicator. In such cases, the payment order concerned shall not be returned.\n4.   Instructing participants can change the Earliest Debit Time Indicator and the Latest Debit Time Indicator via the ICM.\n5.   Further technical details are contained in Appendix I.\nArticle 19\nPayment orders submitted in advance\n1.   Payment orders may be submitted up to five business days before the specified settlement date (warehoused payment orders).\n2.   Warehoused payment orders shall be accepted and entered into the entry disposition on the date specified by the instructing participant at the start of daytime processing, as referred to in Appendix V. They shall be placed in front of payment orders of the same priority.\n3.   Article 15(3), Article 22(2) and Article 29(1)(a) shall apply mutatis mutandis to warehoused payment orders.\nArticle 20\nSettlement of payment orders in the entry disposition\n1.   Unless instructing participants have indicated the settlement time in the manner described in Article 18, accepted payment orders shall be settled immediately or at the latest by the end of the business day on which they were accepted, provided that sufficient funds are available on the payer’s PM account and taking into account any liquidity limits and liquidity reservations as referred to in Articles 16 and 17.\n2.   Funding may be provided by:\n(a)\nthe available liquidity on the PM account; or\n(b)\nincoming payments from other TARGET2 participants, subject to the applicable optimisation procedures.\n3.   For highly urgent payment orders the ‘first in, first out’ (FIFO) principle shall apply. This means that highly urgent payment orders shall be settled in chronological order. Urgent and normal payment orders shall not be settled for as long as highly urgent payment orders are queued.\n4.   For urgent payment orders the FIFO principle shall also apply. Normal payment orders shall not be settled if urgent and highly urgent payment orders are queued.\n5.   By derogation from paragraphs 3 and 4, payment orders with a lower priority (or of the same priority but accepted later) may be settled before payment orders with a higher priority (or of the same priority which were accepted earlier), if the payment orders with a lower priority would net out with payments to be received and result on balance in a liquidity increase for the payer.\n6.   Normal payment orders shall be settled in accordance with the FIFO by-passing principle. This means that they may be settled immediately (independently of other queued normal payments accepted at an earlier time) and may therefore breach the FIFO principle, provided that sufficient funds are available.\n7.   Further details on the settlement of payment orders in the entry disposition are contained in Appendix I.\nArticle 21\nSettlement and return of queued payment orders\n1.   Payment orders that are not settled immediately in the entry disposition shall be placed in the queues in accordance with the priority to which they were designated by the relevant participant, as referred to in Article 15.\n2.   To optimise the settlement of queued payment orders, the [insert name of CB] may use the optimisation procedures described in Appendix I.\n3.   Except for highly urgent payment orders, the payer may change the queue position of payment orders in a queue, i.e. reorder them, via the ICM. Payment orders may be moved either to the front or to the end of the respective queue with immediate effect at any time during daytime processing, as referred to in Appendix V.\n4.   At the request of a payer, the [insert name of CB] or, in the case of an AL group, the CB of the AL group manager may decide to change the queue position of a highly urgent payment order (except for highly urgent payment orders in the context of settlement procedures 5 and 6) provided that this change would not affect the smooth settlement by ancillary systems in TARGET2 or would not otherwise give rise to systemic risk.\n5.   Liquidity transfer orders initiated in the ICM shall be immediately returned as non-settled if there is insufficient liquidity. Other payment orders shall be returned as non-settled if they cannot be settled by the cut-off times for the relevant message type, as specified in Appendix V.\nArticle 22\nEntry of payment orders into the system and their irrevocability\n1.   For the purposes of the first sentence of Article 3(1) of Directive 98/26/EC and [insert national law provisions implementing this Article of Directive 98/26/EC], payment orders are deemed entered into TARGET2-[insert CB/country reference] at the moment that the relevant participant’s PM account is debited.\n2.   Payment orders may be revoked until they are entered into TARGET2-[insert CB/country reference] in accordance with paragraph 1. Payment orders that are included in an algorithm, as referred to in Appendix I, may not be revoked during the period that the algorithm is running.\nTITLE V\nLIQUIDITY POOLING\nArticle 23\nLiquidity pooling modes\nThe [insert name of CB] shall offer a consolidated account information (CAI) mode and an aggregated liquidity (AL) mode.\nArticle 24\nConsolidated account information mode\n1.   The following may use the CAI mode:\n(a)\na credit institution and/or its branches (whether or not such entities participate in the same TARGET2 component system), provided that the entities concerned have several PM accounts identified by different BICs; or\n(b)\ntwo or more credit institutions which belong to the same group and/or their branches, each having one or more PM accounts identified by different BICs.\n2.\n(a)\nUnder the CAI mode, each member of the CAI group and their respective CBs are provided with the list of PM accounts of the group members and the following additional information consolidated at the level of the CAI group:\n(i)\nintraday credit lines (if applicable);\n(ii)\nbalances, including balances on sub-accounts;\n(iii)\nturnover;\n(iv)\nsettled payments;\n(v)\nqueued payment orders.\n(b)\nThe CAI group manager and its respective CB shall have access to information on each of the above items in relation to any PM account of the CAI group.\n(c)\nInformation referred to in this paragraph is provided via the ICM.\n3.   The CAI group manager shall be entitled to initiate liquidity transfers via the ICM between the PM accounts, including their sub-accounts, forming part of the same CAI group.\n4.   A CAI group may also include PM accounts which are included in an AL group. In such a case, all the PM accounts of the AL group shall form part of the CAI group.\n5.   Where two or more PM accounts form part of an AL group and, at the same time, of a CAI group (comprising additional PM accounts), the rules applicable to the AL group shall prevail as to the relationship within the AL group.\n6.   A CAI group, which includes PM accounts of an AL group, may appoint a CAI group manager that is different from the AL group manager.\n7.   The procedure for obtaining authorisation to use the AL mode, set out in Article 25(4) and (5), shall apply mutatis mutandis to the procedure for obtaining authorisation to use the CAI mode. The CAI group manager shall not address an executed CAI mode agreement to the managing NCB.\nArticle 25\nAggregated liquidity mode\n1.   The following may use the AL mode:\n(a)\na credit institution and/or its branches (whether or not such entities participate in the same TARGET2 component system), provided that the entities concerned are established in the euro area and have several PM accounts identified by different BICs;\n(b)\nbranches established in the euro area (whether or not such branches participate in the same TARGET2 component system) of a credit institution established outside the euro area, provided that such branches have several PM accounts identified by different BICs; or\n(c)\ntwo or more credit institutions referred to in subparagraph (a) and/or branches referred to in subparagraph (b) which belong to the same group.\nIn each case referred in subparagraphs (a) to (c) it shall also be a requirement that the entities concerned have established intraday credit arrangements with the respective euro area NCB.\n2.   Under the AL mode, for the purpose of checking whether a payment order is sufficiently covered, available liquidity on all the AL group members’ PM accounts is aggregated. Notwithstanding the above, the bilateral PM account relationship between the AL group member and its AL NCB shall continue to be governed by the arrangements of the relevant TARGET2 component system, subject to the modifications set out in the AL agreement. Intraday credit extended to any AL group member on its PM account may be covered by the available liquidity on the other PM accounts held by such AL group member or PM accounts held by any other AL group members with the same or any other AL NCB.\n3.   In order to use the AL mode, one or more TARGET2 participants meeting the criteria in paragraph 1 shall enter into an AL agreement with the [insert name of CB] and, if applicable, other CBs of the TARGET2 component systems in which other AL group members participate. A TARGET2 participant may only enter into one AL agreement in relation to a particular PM account. The AL agreement shall be in conformity with the relevant template in Appendix VII.\n4.   Each AL group shall designate an AL group manager. In the event that the AL group consists of only one participant, this participant shall act as the AL group manager. The AL group manager shall address to the managing NCB a written request to use the AL mode (containing static data collection forms as provided by [insert name of CB]), together with the executed AL agreement on the basis of the template provided by the managing NCB. The remaining AL group members shall address their written requests (containing static data collection forms as provided by [insert name of CB]) to their respective AL NCBs. The managing NCB may request any additional information or document that it deems appropriate in order to decide on the request. In addition, the managing NCB, in agreement with the other AL NCBs, may require the insertion of any additional provision in the AL agreement that it deems appropriate in order to ensure the proper and timely discharge of any existing and/or future obligation of all AL group members towards any AL NCB.\n5.   The managing NCB shall verify whether the applicants fulfil the requirements to form an AL group and whether the AL agreement has been properly executed. To this end, the managing NCB may liaise with the other AL NCBs. The managing NCB’s decision shall be addressed, in writing, to the AL group manager within one month of receipt of the request referred to in paragraph 4 by the managing NCB, or, if the managing NCB requests additional information, within one month of receipt of such information by the managing NCB. Any rejection decision shall contain reasons for the rejection.\n6.   AL group members shall automatically have access to the CAI mode.\n7.   The provision of information and all interactive control measures within an AL group shall be accessed via the ICM.\n[Insert if applicable:\nArticle 25a\nPledge/enforcement\n1.   The [insert name of CB]’s current and future claims arising from the legal relationship between an AL group member and the [insert name of CB] and which are secured by the [insert the applicable term: pledge/floating charge] under Article 36(1) and (2) of these Conditions shall include the [insert name of CB]’s claims against such AL group member arising under the AL agreement to which both are party.\n2.   [Insert if required under the laws of the relevant jurisdiction: Without prejudice to the AL agreement, such pledge shall not prevent the participant from using the cash deposited in its PM accounts during the business day.]\n3.   [Insert if required under the laws of the relevant jurisdiction: Special allocation clause: The AL group member allocates the cash deposited in its PM account for the execution of all its obligations arising from the [insert reference to the arrangements implementing the Harmonised Conditions].]\n[If applicable and if required under the laws of the relevant jurisdiction:\nArticle 25b\nEnforcement of the pledge\nUpon the occurrence of an enforcement event, the [insert name of CB] shall have an unrestricted right to realise the pledge without any prior notice. [Insert if deemed appropriate under the laws of the relevant jurisdiction: in accordance with [insert relevant national law provisions governing enforcement of the pledge].]\n[If applicable and if required under the laws of the relevant jurisdiction:\nArticle 25c\nEnforcement of collateral\nUpon occurrence of the enforcement event, the [insert name of the CB] shall have the right to realise collateral under Article 36.]\nArticle 26\nSet-off of claims under Article 36(4) and (5)\nOn the occurrence of an enforcement event, any claim of the [insert name of CB] against such AL group member shall be automatically and immediately accelerated and shall be subject to Article 36(4) and (5) of these Conditions.\nTITLE VI\nSECURITY REQUIREMENTS AND CONTINGENCY ISSUES\nArticle 27\nBusiness continuity and contingency procedures\nIn the event of an abnormal external event or any other event which affects the operation of the SSP, the business continuity and contingency procedures described in Appendix IV shall apply.\nArticle 28\nSecurity requirements\n1.   Participants shall implement adequate security controls to protect their systems from unauthorised access and use. Participants shall be exclusively responsible for the adequate protection of the confidentiality, integrity and availability of their systems.\n2.   Participants shall inform the [insert name of CB] of any security-related incidents in their technical infrastructure and, where appropriate, security-related incidents that occur in the technical infrastructure of the third party providers. The [insert name of CB] may request further information about the incident and, if necessary, request that the participant take appropriate measures to prevent a recurrence of such an event.\n3.   The [insert name of CB] may impose additional security requirements on all participants and/or on participants that are considered critical by the [insert name of CB].\nTITLE VII\nTHE INFORMATION AND CONTROL MODULE\nArticle 29\nUse of the ICM\n1.   The ICM:\n(a)\nallows participants to access information relating to their accounts and to manage liquidity;\n(b)\nmay be used to initiate liquidity transfer orders; and\n(c)\nallows participants to initiate backup liquidity redistribution and backup contingency payments in the event of a failure of the participant’s payment infrastructure.\n2.   Further technical details relating to the ICM are contained in Appendix I.\nTITLE VIII\nCOMPENSATION, LIABILITY REGIME AND EVIDENCE\nArticle 30\nCompensation scheme\nIf a payment order cannot be settled on the same business day on which it was accepted due to a technical malfunction of TARGET2, the [insert name of CB] shall offer to compensate the direct participants concerned in accordance with the special procedure laid down in Appendix II.\nArticle 31\nLiability regime\n1.   In performing their obligations pursuant to these Conditions, the [insert name of CB] and the participants shall be bound by a general duty of reasonable care in relation to each other.\n2.   The [insert name of CB] shall be liable to its participants in cases of fraud (including but not limited to wilful misconduct) or gross negligence, for any loss arising out of the operation of TARGET2-[insert CB/country reference]. In cases of ordinary negligence, the [insert name of CB]’s liability shall be limited to the participant’s direct loss, i.e. the amount of the transaction in question and/or the loss of interest thereon, excluding any consequential loss.\n3.   The [insert name of CB] is not liable for any loss that results from any malfunction or failure in the technical infrastructure (including but not limited to the [insert name of CB]’s computer infrastructure, programmes, data, applications or networks), if such malfunction or failure arises in spite of the [insert name of CB] having adopted those measures that are reasonably necessary to protect such infrastructure against malfunction or failure, and to resolve the consequences of such malfunction or failure (the latter including but not limited to initiating and completing the business continuity and contingency procedures referred to in Appendix IV).\n4.   The [insert name of CB] shall not be liable:\n(a)\nto the extent that the loss is caused by the participant; or\n(b)\nif the loss arises out of external events beyond the [insert name of CB]’s reasonable control (force majeure).\n5.   Notwithstanding the [insert national law provisions implementing Directive 2007/64/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 November 2007 on payment services in the internal market amending Directives 97/7/EC, 2002/65/EC, 2005/60/EC and 2006/48/EC and repealing Directive 97/5/EC (11) paragraphs 1 to 4 shall apply to the extent that the [insert name of CB]’s liability can be excluded.\n6.   The [insert name of CB] and the participants shall take all reasonable and practicable steps to mitigate any damage or loss referred to in this Article.\n7.   In performing some or all of its obligations under these Conditions, the [insert name of CB] may commission third parties in its own name, particularly telecommunications or other network providers or other entities, if this is necessary to meet the [insert name of CB]’s obligations or is standard market practice. The [insert name of CB]’s obligation shall be limited to the due selection and commissioning of any such third parties and the [insert name of CB]’s liability shall be limited accordingly. For the purposes of this paragraph, the SSP-providing NCBs shall not be considered as third parties.\nArticle 32\nEvidence\n1.   Unless otherwise provided in these Conditions, all payment and payment processing-related messages in relation to TARGET2, such as confirmations of debits or credits, or statement messages, between the [insert name of CB] and participants shall be made through the network service provider.\n2.   Electronic or written records of the messages retained by the [insert name of CB] or by the network service provider shall be accepted as a means of evidence of the payments processed through the [insert name of CB]. The saved or printed version of the original message of the network service provider shall be accepted as a means of evidence, regardless of the form of the original message.\n3.   If a participant’s connection to the network service provider fails, the participant shall use the alternative means of transmission of messages laid down in Appendix IV. In such cases, the saved or printed version of the message produced by the [insert name of CB] shall have the same evidential value as the original message, regardless of its form.\n4.   The [insert name of CB] shall keep complete records of payment orders submitted and payments received by participants for a period of [insert period required by relevant national law] from the time at which such payment orders are submitted and payments are received, provided that such complete records shall cover a minimum of five years for any participant in TARGET2 that is subject to continuous vigilance pursuant to restrictive measures adopted by the Council of the European Union or Member States, or more if required by specific regulations.\n5.   The [insert name of CB]’s own books and records (whether kept on paper, microfilm, microfiche, by electronic or magnetic recording, in any other mechanically reproducible form or otherwise) shall be accepted as a means of evidence of any obligations of the participants and of any facts and events that the parties rely on.\nTITLE IX\nTERMINATION OF PARTICIPATION AND CLOSURE OF ACCOUNTS\nArticle 33\nDuration and ordinary termination of participation\n1.   Without prejudice to Article 34, participation in TARGET2-[insert CB/country reference] is for an indefinite period of time.\n2.   A participant may terminate its participation in TARGET2-[insert CB/country reference] at any time giving 14 business days’ notice thereof, unless it agrees a shorter notice period with the [insert name of CB].\n3.   The [insert name of CB] may terminate a participant’s participation in TARGET2-[insert CB/country reference] at any time giving three months’ notice thereof, unless it agrees a different notice period with that participant.\n4.   On termination of participation, the confidentiality duties laid down in Article 38 remain in force for a period of five years starting on the date of termination.\n5.   On termination of participation, the PM accounts of the participant concerned shall be closed in accordance with Article 35.\nArticle 34\nSuspension and extraordinary termination of participation\n1.   A participant’s participation in TARGET2-[insert CB/country reference] shall be immediately terminated without prior notice or suspended if one of the following events of default occurs:\n(a)\nthe opening of insolvency proceedings; and/or\n(b)\nthe participant no longer meets the access criteria laid down in Article 4.\n2.   The [insert name of CB] may terminate without prior notice or suspend the participant’s participation in TARGET2-[insert CB/country reference] if:\n(a)\none or more events of default (other than those referred to in paragraph 1) occur;\n(b)\nthe participant is in material breach of these Conditions;\n(c)\nthe participant fails to carry out any material obligation to the [insert name of CB];\n(d)\nthe participant is excluded from, or otherwise ceases to be a member of, a TARGET2 CUG;\n(e)\nany other participant-related event occurs which, in the [insert name of CB]’s assessment, would threaten the overall stability, soundness and safety of TARGET2-[insert CB/country reference] or of any other TARGET2 component system, or which would jeopardise the [insert name of CB]’s performance of its tasks as described in [refer to relevant national law] and the Statute of the European System of Central Banks and of the European Central Bank, or poses risks on the grounds of prudence; and/or\n(f)\nan NCB suspends or terminates the participant’s access to intraday credit pursuant to paragraph 12 of Annex III.\n3.   In exercising its discretion under paragraph 2, the [insert name of CB] shall take into account, inter alia, the seriousness of the event of default or events mentioned in subparagraphs (a) to (c).\n4.\n(a)\nIn the event that the [insert name of CB] suspends or terminates a participant’s participation in TARGET2-[insert CB/country reference] under paragraph 1 or 2, the [insert name of CB] shall immediately inform that participant, other CBs and the other participants of such suspension or termination by means of an ICM broadcast message.\n(b)\nIn the event that the [insert name of CB] is informed by another CB of a suspension or termination of a participant in another TARGET2 component system, the [insert name of CB] shall immediately inform its participants of such suspension or termination by means of an ICM broadcast message.\n(c)\nOnce such an ICM broadcast message has been received by the participants, the latter shall be deemed informed of the termination/suspension of a participant’s participation in TARGET2-[insert CB/country reference] or another TARGET2 component system. The participants shall bear any losses arising from the submission of a payment order to participants whose participation has been suspended or terminated if such payment order was entered into TARGET2-[insert CB/country reference] after receipt of the ICM broadcast message.\n5.   Upon termination of a participant’s participation, TARGET2-[insert CB/country reference] shall not accept any new payment orders from such participant. Payment orders in the queue, warehoused payment orders or new payment orders in favour of such participant shall be returned.\n6.   If a participant is suspended from TARGET2-[insert CB/country reference], all its incoming payments and outgoing payment orders shall be stored and only entered into the entry disposition after they have been explicitly accepted by the suspended participant’s CB.\nArticle 35\nClosure of PM accounts\n1.   Participants may close their PM accounts at any time provided they give the [insert name of CB] 14 business days’ notice thereof.\n2.   On termination of participation, pursuant to either Article 33 or 34, the [insert name of CB] shall close the PM accounts of the participant concerned, after having:\n(a)\nsettled or returned any queued payment orders; and\n(b)\nmade use of its rights of pledge and set-off under Article 36.\nTITLE X\nFINAL PROVISIONS\nArticle 36\nThe [insert name of CB]’s rights of pledge and set-off\n1.   [Insert if applicable: The [insert name of CB] shall have a pledge over the participant’s existing and future credit balances on its PM accounts, thereby collateralising any current and future claims arising out of the legal relationship between the parties.]\n1a.   [Insert if applicable: A participant’s current and future claims towards the [insert name of the CB] arising from a credit balance on the PM account shall be transferred to the [insert name of the CB] as collateral, i.e. as a fiduciary transfer, for any current or future claim of the [insert name of the CB] towards the participant arising out of the [insert reference to the arrangement implementing these Conditions]. Such collateral shall be established by the mere fact that the funds have been credited to the participant’s PM account.]\n1b.   [Insert if applicable: The [insert name of CB] shall have a floating charge over the participant’s existing and future credit balances on their PM accounts, thereby collateralising any current and future claims arising out of the legal relationship between the parties.]\n2.   [Insert if applicable: The [insert name of CB] shall have the right referred to in paragraph 1 even if its claims are only contingent or not yet due.]\n3.   [Insert if applicable: The participant, acting in its capacity as a PM account holder, hereby acknowledges the creation of a pledge in favour of [insert name of CB], with whom that account has been opened; this acknowledgement shall constitute the provision of pledged assets to the [insert name of CB] referred to under [insert relevant national adjective] law. Any amounts paid into the PM account whose balance is pledged shall, by the mere fact of being paid in, be irrevocably pledged, without any limitation whatsoever, as collateral security for the full performance of the secured obligations.]\n4.   On the occurrence of:\n(a)\nan event of default, referred to in Article 34(1); or\n(b)\nany other event of default or event referred to in Article 34(2) that has led to the termination or suspension of the participant’s participation, notwithstanding the commencement of any insolvency proceedings in respect of a participant and notwithstanding any assignment, judicial or other attachment or other disposition of or in respect of the participant’s rights, all obligations of the participant shall be automatically and immediately accelerated, without prior notice and without the need for any prior approval of any authority, so as to be immediately due. In addition, the mutual obligations of the participant and the [insert name of CB] shall automatically be set off against each other, and the party owing the higher amount shall pay to the other the difference.\n5.   The [insert name of CB] shall promptly give the participant notice of any set-off pursuant to paragraph 4 after such set-off has taken place.\n6.   The [insert name of CB] may without prior notice debit any participant’s PM account by any amount which the participant owes the [insert name of CB] resulting from the legal relationship between the participant and the [insert name of CB].\nArticle 37\nSecurity rights in relation to funds on sub-accounts\n1.   The [insert name of CB] shall have [insert reference to a collateralisation technique under the applicable legal system] over the balance on a participant’s sub-account opened for the settlement of ancillary system-related payment instructions under the arrangements between the relevant ancillary system and its CB. Such balance shall collateralise the participant’s obligation referred to in paragraph 7 towards the [insert name of CB] in relation to such settlement.\n2.   The [insert name of CB] shall freeze the balance on the sub-account of the participant upon communication by the ancillary system (via a ‘start-of-cycle’ message). Where applicable, the [insert name of CB] shall thereafter increase or reduce the frozen balance by crediting or debiting cross-system settlement payments to or from the sub-account or crediting liquidity transfers to the sub-account. Such freezing shall expire upon communication by the ancillary system (via an ‘end-of-cycle’ message).\n3.   By confirming the freezing of the balance on the participant’s sub-account, the [insert name of CB] guarantees to the ancillary system payment up to the amount of this particular balance. By confirming, where applicable, the increase or reduction of the frozen balance upon crediting or debiting cross-system settlement payments to or from the sub-account or crediting liquidity transfers to the sub-account, the guarantee is automatically increased or reduced in the amount of the payment. Without prejudice to the abovementioned increase or reduction of the guarantee, the guarantee shall be irrevocable, unconditional and payable on first demand. If the [insert name of CB] is not the ancillary system’s CB, the [insert name of CB] shall be deemed instructed to issue the abovementioned guarantee to the ancillary system’s CB.\n4.   In the absence of any insolvency proceedings in relation to the participant, the ancillary system-related payment instructions for the squaring of the participant’s settlement obligation shall be settled without drawing on the guarantee and without recourse to the security right over the balance on the participant’s sub-account.\n5.   In the event of the participant’s insolvency, the ancillary system-related payment instruction for the squaring of the participant’s settlement obligation shall be a first demand for payment under the guarantee; the debiting of the instructed amount from the participant’s sub-account (and crediting of the ancillary system’s technical account) shall therefore equally involve the discharge of the guarantee obligation by the [insert name of the CB] and a realisation of its collateral right over the balance on the participant’s sub-account.\n6.   The guarantee shall expire upon communication by the ancillary system that the settlement has been completed (via an ‘end-of-cycle’ message).\n7.   The participant shall be obliged to reimburse to the [insert name of CB] any payment made by the latter under such guarantee.\nArticle 38\nConfidentiality\n1.   The [insert name of CB] shall keep confidential all sensitive or secret information, including when such information relates to payment, technical or organisational information belonging to the participant or the participant’s customers, unless the participant or its customer has given its written consent to disclose [insert the following phrase if applicable under national law: or such disclosure is permitted or required under [insert adjective relating to country name] law].\n2.   By derogation from paragraph 1, the participant agrees that the [insert name of CB] may disclose payment, technical or organisational information regarding the participant or the participant’s customers obtained in the course of the operation of TARGET2-[insert CB/country reference] to other CBs or third parties that are involved in the operation of TARGET2-[insert CB/country reference], to the extent that this is necessary for the efficient functioning of TARGET2, or to supervisory and oversight authorities of Member States and the Union to the extent that this is necessary for the performance of their public tasks, and provided in all such cases that the disclosure is not in conflict with the applicable law. The [insert name of CB] shall not be liable for the financial and commercial consequences of such disclosure.\n3.   By derogation from paragraph 1 and provided this does not make it possible, whether directly or indirectly, to identify the participant or the participant’s customers, the [insert name of CB] may use, disclose or publish payment information regarding the participant or the participant’s customers for statistical, historical, scientific or other purposes in the exercise of its public functions or of functions of other public entities to whom the information is disclosed.\n4.   Information relating to the operation of TARGET2-[insert CB/country reference] to which participants have had access, may only be used for the purposes laid down in these Conditions. Participants shall keep such information confidential, unless the [insert name of CB] has explicitly given its written consent to disclose. Participants shall ensure that any third parties to whom they outsource, delegate or subcontract tasks which have or may have an impact on the performance of their obligations under these Conditions are bound by the confidentiality requirements in this Article.\n5.   The [insert name of CB] shall be authorised, in order to settle payment orders, to process and transfer the necessary data to the network service provider.\nArticle 39\nData protection, prevention of money laundering, administrative or restrictive measures and related issues\n1.   Participants shall be deemed to be aware of, and shall comply with, all obligations on them relating to legislation on data protection, prevention of money laundering and the financing of terrorism, proliferation-sensitive nuclear activities and the development of nuclear weapons delivery systems, in particular in terms of implementing appropriate measures concerning any payments debited or credited on their PM accounts. Participants shall also acquaint themselves with the network service provider’s data retrieval policy prior to entering into the contractual relationship with the network service provider.\n2.   Participants shall be deemed to have authorised the [insert name of CB] to obtain any information relating to them from any financial or supervisory authority or trade body, whether national or foreign, if such information is necessary for the participant’s participation in TARGET2-[insert CB/country reference].\n3.   Participants, when acting as the payment service provider of a payer or payee, shall comply with all requirements resulting from administrative or restrictive measures imposed pursuant to Article 75 or 215 of the Treaty to which they are subject, including with respect to notification and/or the obtaining of consent from a competent authority in relation to the processing of transactions. In addition:\n(a)\nwhen the [insert name of CB] is the payment service provider of a participant that is a payer:\n(i)\nthe participant shall make the required notification or obtain consent on behalf of the central bank that is primarily required to make notification or obtain consent, and shall provide the [insert name of CB] with evidence of having made a notification or having received consent;\n(ii)\nthe participant shall not enter any credit transfer order into TARGET2 until it has obtained confirmation from the [insert name of CB] that the required notification has been made or the consent has been obtained by or on behalf of the payment service provider of the payee;\n(b)\nwhen the [insert name of CB] is a payment service provider of a participant that is a payee, the participant shall make the required notification or obtain consent on behalf of the central bank that is primarily required to make notification or obtain consent, and shall provide the [insert name of CB] with evidence of having made a notification or having received consent.\nFor the purposes of this paragraph, the terms ‘payment service provider’, ‘payer’ and ‘payee’ shall have the meanings ascribed to them in the applicable administrative or restrictive measures.\nArticle 40\nNotices\n1.   Except where otherwise provided for in these Conditions, all notices required or permitted pursuant to these Conditions shall be sent by registered post, facsimile or otherwise in writing or by an authenticated message through the network service provider. Notices to the [insert name of CB] shall be submitted to the head of the [insert payment systems department or relevant CB unit] of [insert name of CB], [include relevant address of CB] or to the [insert BIC address of the CB]. Notices to the participant shall be sent to it at the address, fax number or its BIC address as the participant may from time to time notify to the [insert name of CB].\n2.   To prove that a notice has been sent, it shall be sufficient to prove that the notice was delivered to the relevant address or that the envelope containing such notice was properly addressed and posted.\n3.   All notices shall be given in [insert relevant national language and/or ‘English’].\n4.   Participants shall be bound by all forms and documents of the [insert name of CB] that the participants have filled in and/or signed, including but not limited to static data collection forms, as referred to in Article 8(2)(a), and information provided under Article 11(5), which were submitted in compliance with paragraphs 1 and 2 and which the [insert name of CB] reasonably believes to have received from the participants, their employees or agents.\nArticle 41\nContractual relationship with network service provider\n1.   For the purposes of these Conditions, the network service provider is SWIFT. Each participant shall enter into a separate agreement with SWIFT regarding the services to be provided by SWIFT in relation to the participant’s use of TARGET2-[insert CB/country reference]. The legal relationship between a participant and SWIFT shall be exclusively governed by SWIFT’s terms and conditions.\n2.   Each participant shall also participate in a TARGET2 CUG, as specified by the SSP-providing NCBs acting as the SWIFT service administrator for the SSP. Admission and exclusion of a participant to or from a TARGET2 CUG shall take effect once communicated to SWIFT by the SWIFT service administrator.\n3.   Participants shall comply with the TARGET2 SWIFT Service Profile, as made available by the [insert name of CB].\n4.   The services to be provided by SWIFT shall not form part of the services to be performed by the [insert name of CB] in respect of TARGET2.\n5.   The [insert name of CB] shall not be liable for any acts, errors or omissions of SWIFT (including its directors, staff and subcontractors) as provider of SWIFT services, or for any acts, errors or omissions of network providers selected by participants to gain access to the SWIFT network.\nArticle 42\nAmendment procedure\nThe [insert name of CB] may at any time unilaterally amend these Conditions, including its Appendices. Amendments to these Conditions, including its Appendices, shall be announced by means of [insert relevant means of announcement]. Amendments shall be deemed to have been accepted unless the participant expressly objects within 14 days of being informed of such amendments. In the event that a participant objects to the amendment, the [insert name of CB] is entitled immediately to terminate that participant’s participation in TARGET2-[insert CB/country reference] and close any of its PM accounts.\nArticle 43\nThird party rights\n1.   Any rights, interests, obligations, responsibilities and claims arising from or relating to these Conditions shall not be transferred, pledged or assigned by participants to any third party without the [insert name of CB]’s written consent.\n2.   These Conditions do not create any rights in favour of or obligations in relation to any entity other than the [insert name of CB] and participants in TARGET2-[insert CB/country reference].\nArticle 44\nGoverning law, jurisdiction and place of performance\n1.   The bilateral relationship between the [insert name of CB] and participants in TARGET2-[insert CB/country reference] shall be governed by [insert adjective relating to country name] law.\n2.   Without prejudice to the competence of the Court of Justice of the European Union, any dispute arising from a matter relating to the relationship referred to in paragraph 1 falls under the exclusive competence of the competent courts of [insert place of the seat of the CB].\n3.   The place of performance concerning the legal relationship between the [insert reference to CB] and the participants shall be [insert place of the seat of the CB].\nArticle 45\nSeverability\nIf any provision in these Conditions is or becomes invalid, this shall not prejudice the applicability of all the other provisions of these Conditions.\nArticle 46\nEntry into force and binding nature\n1.   These Conditions become effective from [insert relevant date].\n2.   [Insert if appropriate under relevant national law: By participating in TARGET2-[insert CB/country reference], participants automatically agree to these Conditions between themselves and in relation to the [insert name of CB].]\n(1)  The Eurosystem’s current policy for the location of infrastructure is set out in the following statements, which are all available on the ECB’s website at www.ecb.europa.eu: (a) the Policy statement on euro payment and settlement systems located outside the euro area of 3 November 1998; (b) The Eurosystem’s policy line with regard to consolidation in central counterparty clearing of 27 September 2001; (c) The Eurosystem policy principles on the location and operation of infrastructures settling in euro-denominated payment transaction of 19 July 2007; and (d) The Eurosystem policy principles on the location and operation of infrastructures settling euro-denominated payment transactions: specification of legally and operationally located in the euro area of 20 November 2008; (e) The Eurosystem oversight policy framework of July 2011.\n(2)  OJ L 30, 30.1.2013, p. 1.\n(3)  OJ L 177, 30.6.2006, p. 1.\n(4)  Commission Regulation (EC) No 2238/2004 of 29 December 2004 amending Regulation (EC) No 1725/2003 adopting certain international accounting standards in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1606/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council, as regards IASs IFRS 1, IASs Nos 1 to 10, 12 to 17, 19 to 24, 27 to 38, 40 and 41 and SIC Nos 1 to 7, 11 to 14, 18 to 27 and 30 to 33 (OJ L 394, 31.12.2004, p. 1).\n(5)  OJ L 166, 11.6.1998, p. 45.\n(6)  OJ L 145, 30.4.2004, p. 1.\n(7)  OJ L 332, 31.12.1993, p. 1.\n(8)  OJ L 267, 10.10.2009, p. 7.\n(9)  OJ L 318, 27.11.1998, p. 1.\n(10)  OJ L 250, 2.10.2003, p. 10.\n(11)  OJ L 319, 5.2.2007, p. 1.\nAppendix I\nTECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS FOR THE PROCESSING OF PAYMENT ORDERS\nIn addition to the Harmonised Conditions, the following rules shall apply to the processing of payment orders:\n1.   Technical requirements for participation in TARGET2-[insert CB/country reference] regarding infrastructure, network and formats\n(1)\nTARGET2 uses SWIFT services for the exchange of messages. Each participant therefore needs a connection to SWIFT’s Secure IP Network. Each participant’s PM account shall be identified by an eight- or 11-digit SWIFT BIC. Furthermore, each participant shall pass a series of tests to prove its technical and operational competence before it may participate in TARGET2-[insert CB/country reference].\n(2)\nFor the submission of payment orders and the exchange of payment messages in the PM the SWIFTNet FIN Y-copy service shall be used. A dedicated SWIFT Closed User Group (CUG) shall be set up for this purpose. Payment orders within such TARGET2 CUG shall be directly addressed to the receiving TARGET2 participant by entering its BIC in the header of the SWIFTNet FIN message.\n(3)\nFor the information and control services the following SWIFTNet services may be used:\n(a)\nSWIFTNet InterAct;\n(b)\nSWIFTNet FileAct; and/or\n(c)\nSWIFTNet Browse.\n(4)\nThe security of the message exchange between participants shall rely exclusively on SWIFT’s Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) service. Information on the PKI service is available in the documentation provided by SWIFT.\n(5)\nThe ‘bilateral relationship management’ service provided by SWIFT’s Relationship Management Application (RMA) shall only be used with the central destination BIC of the SSP and not for payment messages between TARGET2 participants.\n2.   Payment message types\n(1)\nThe following SWIFTNet FIN/SWIFT system message types are processed:\nMessage Type\nType of use\nDescription\nMT 103\nMandatory\nCustomer payment\nMT 103+\nMandatory\nCustomer payment (Straight Through Processing)\nMT 202\nMandatory\nBank-to-bank payment\nMT 202COV\nMandatory\nCover payments\nMT 204\nOptional\nDirect debit payment\nMT 011\nOptional\nDelivery notification\nMT 012\nOptional\nSender notification\nMT 019\nMandatory\nAbort notification\nMT 900\nOptional\nConfirmation of debit/Credit line change\nMT 910\nOptional\nConfirmation of credit/Credit line change\nMT 940/950\nOptional\n(Customer) statement message\nMT 011, MT 012 and MT 019 are SWIFT system messages.\n(2)\nWhen they register with TARGET2-[insert CB/country reference], direct participants shall declare which optional message types they will use, with the exception of MT 011 and MT 012 messages in relation to which direct participants shall decide from time to time whether or not to receive them with reference to specific messages.\n(3)\nParticipants shall comply with the SWIFT message structure and field specifications, as defined in the SWIFT documentation and under the restrictions set out for TARGET2, as described in Chapter 9.1.2.2 of the User Detailed Functional Specifications (UDFS), Book 1.\n(4)\nField contents shall be validated at the level of TARGET2-[insert country/CB reference] in accordance with the UDFS requirements. Participants may agree among each other on specific rules regarding the field contents. However, in TARGET2-[insert country/CB reference] there shall be no specific checks as to whether participants comply with any such rules.\n(5)\nMT 202COV messages shall be used for making cover payments, i.e. payments made by correspondent banks to settle (cover) credit transfer messages which are submitted to a customer’s bank by other, more direct means. Customer details contained in MT 202COV shall not be displayed in the ICM.\n3.   Double-entry check\n(1)\nAll payment orders shall pass a double-entry check, the aim of which is to reject payment orders that have been submitted more than once by mistake.\n(2)\nThe following fields of the SWIFT message types shall be checked:\nDetails\nPart of the SWIFT message\nField\nSender\nBasic header\nLT address\nMessage type\nApplication header\nMessage type\nReceiver\nApplication header\nDestination address\nTransaction reference number (TRN)\nText block\n:20\nRelated reference\nText block\n:21\nValue date\nText block\n:32\nAmount\nText block\n:32\n(3)\nIf all the fields described in subparagraph 2 in relation to a newly submitted payment order are identical to those in relation to a payment order that has already been accepted, the newly submitted payment order shall be returned.\n4.   Error codes\nIf a payment order is rejected, the instructing participant shall receive an abort notification (MT 019) indicating the reason for the rejection by using error codes. The error codes are defined in Chapter 9.4.2 of the UDFS.\n5.   Predetermined settlement times\n(1)\nFor payment orders using the Earliest Debit Time Indicator, the codeword ‘/FROTIME/’ shall be used.\n(2)\nFor payment orders using the Latest Debit Time Indicator, two options shall be available.\n(a)\nCodeword ‘/REJTIME/’: if the payment order cannot be settled by the indicated debit time, the payment order shall be returned.\n(b)\nCodeword ‘/TILTIME/’: if the payment order cannot be settled by the indicated debit time, the payment order shall not be returned but shall be kept in the relevant queue.\nUnder both options, if a payment order with a Latest Debit Time Indicator is not settled 15 minutes prior to the time indicated therein, a notification shall automatically be sent via the ICM.\n(3)\nIf the codeword ‘/CLSTIME/’ is used, the payment shall be treated in the same way as a payment order referred to in subparagraph 2(b).\n6.   Settlement of payment orders in the entry disposition\n(1)\nOffsetting checks and, if appropriate, extended offsetting checks (both terms as defined in paragraphs 2 and 3) shall be carried out on payment orders entered into the entry disposition to provide quick, liquidity-saving gross settlement of payment orders.\n(2)\nAn offsetting check shall determine whether the payee’s payment orders that are at the front of the highly urgent or, if inapplicable, the urgent queue are available to be offset against the payer’s payment order (hereinafter ‘offsetting payment orders’). If an offsetting payment order does not provide sufficient funds for the respective payer’s payment order in the entry disposition, it shall be determined whether there is sufficient available liquidity on the payer’s PM account.\n(3)\nIf the offsetting check fails, the [insert name of CB] may apply an extended offsetting check. An extended offsetting check determines whether offsetting payment orders are available in any of the payee’s queues regardless of when they joined the queue. However, if in the queue of the payee there are higher priority payment orders addressed to other TARGET2 participants, the FIFO principle may only be breached if settling such an offsetting payment order would result in a liquidity increase for the payee.\n7.   Settlement of payment orders in the queue\n(1)\nThe treatment of payment orders placed in queues depends on the priority class to which it was designated by the instructing participant.\n(2)\nPayment orders in the highly urgent and urgent queues shall be settled by using the offsetting checks described in paragraph 6, starting with the payment order at the front of the queue in cases where there is an increase in liquidity or there is an intervention at queue level (change of queue position, settlement time or priority, or revocation of the payment order).\n(3)\nPayments orders in the normal queue shall be settled on a continuous basis including all highly urgent and urgent payment orders that have not yet been settled. Different optimisation mechanisms (algorithms) are used. If an algorithm is successful, the included payment orders will be settled; if an algorithm fails, the included payment orders will remain in the queue. Three algorithms (1 to 3) shall be applied to offset payment flows. By means of Algorithm 4, settlement procedure 5 (as defined in Chapter 2.8.1 of the UDFS) shall be available for the settlement of payment instructions of ancillary systems. To optimise the settlement of highly urgent ancillary system transactions on participants’ sub-accounts, a special algorithm (Algorithm 5) shall be used.\n(a)\nUnder Algorithm 1 (‘all-or-nothing’) the [insert name of CB] shall, both for each relationship in respect of which a bilateral limit has been set and also for the total sum of relationships for which a multilateral limit has been set:\n(i)\ncalculate the overall liquidity position of each TARGET2 participant’s PM account by establishing whether the aggregate of all outgoing and incoming payment orders pending in the queue is negative or positive and, if it is negative, check whether it exceeds that participant’s available liquidity (the overall liquidity position shall constitute the ‘total liquidity position’); and\n(ii)\ncheck whether limits and reservations set by each TARGET2 participant in relation to each relevant PM account are respected.\nIf the outcome of these calculations and checks is positive for each relevant PM account, the [insert name of CB] and other CBs involved shall settle all payments simultaneously on the PM accounts of the TARGET2 participants concerned.\n(b)\nUnder Algorithm 2 (‘partial’) the [insert name of CB] shall:\n(i)\ncalculate and check the liquidity positions, limits and reservations of each relevant PM account as under Algorithm 1; and\n(ii)\nif the total liquidity position of one or more relevant PM accounts is negative, extract single payment orders until the total liquidity position of each relevant PM account is positive.\nThereafter, the [insert name of CB] and the other CBs involved shall, provided there are sufficient funds, settle all remaining payments (except the extracted payment orders) simultaneously on the PM accounts of the TARGET2 participants concerned.\nWhen extracting payment orders, the [insert name of CB] shall start from the TARGET2 participant’s PM account with the highest negative total liquidity position and from the payment order at the end of the queue with the lowest priority. The selection process shall only run for a short time, to be determined by the [insert name of CB] at its discretion.\n(c)\nUnder Algorithm 3 (‘multiple’) the [insert name of CB] shall:\n(i)\ncompare pairs of TARGET2 participants’ PM accounts to determine whether queued payment orders can be settled within the available liquidity of the two TARGET2 participants’ PM accounts concerned and within the limits set by them (by starting from the pair of PM accounts with the smallest difference between the payment orders addressed to each other), and the CBs involved shall book those payments simultaneously on the two TARGET2 participants’ PM accounts; and\n(ii)\nif, in relation to a pair of PM accounts as described under point (i), liquidity is insufficient to fund the bilateral position, extract single payment orders until there is sufficient liquidity. In this case the CBs involved shall settle the remaining payments, except the extracted ones, simultaneously on the two TARGET2 participants’ PM accounts.\nAfter performing the checks specified under subparagraphs (i) to (ii), the [insert name of CB] shall check the multilateral settlement positions (between a participant’s PM account and other TARGET2 participants’ PM accounts in relation to which a multi-lateral limit has been set). For this purpose, the procedure described under subparagraphs (i) to (ii) shall apply mutatis mutandis.\n(d)\nUnder Algorithm 4 (‘partial plus ancillary system settlement’) the [insert name of CB] shall follow the same procedure as for Algorithm 2, but without extracting payment orders in relation to the settlement of an ancillary system (which settles on a simultaneous multilateral basis).\n(e)\nUnder Algorithm 5 (‘ancillary system settlement via sub-accounts’) the [insert name of CB] shall follow the same procedure as for Algorithm 1, subject to the modification that the [insert name of CB] shall start Algorithm 5 via the ASI and shall only check whether sufficient funds are available on participants’ sub-accounts. Moreover, no limits and reservations shall be taken into account. Algorithm 5 shall also run during night-time settlement.\n(4)\nPayment orders entered into the entry disposition after the start of any of Algorithms 1 to 4 may nevertheless be settled immediately in the entry disposition if the positions and limits of the TARGET2 participants’ PM accounts concerned are compatible with both the settlement of these payment orders and the settlement of payment orders in the current optimisation procedure. However, two algorithms shall not run simultaneously.\n(5)\nDuring daytime processing the algorithms shall run sequentially. As long as there is no pending simultaneous multilateral settlement of an ancillary system, the sequence shall be as follows:\n(a)\nAlgorithm 1;\n(b)\nif Algorithm 1 fails, then algorithm 2;\n(c)\nif Algorithm 2 fails, then Algorithm 3, or if Algorithm 2 succeeds, repeat Algorithm 1.\nWhen simultaneous multilateral settlement (‘procedure 5’) in relation to an ancillary system is pending, Algorithm 4 shall run.\n(6)\nThe algorithms shall run flexibly by setting a pre-defined time lag between the application of different algorithms to ensure a minimum interval between the running of two algorithms. The time sequence shall be automatically controlled. Manual intervention shall be possible.\n(7)\nWhile included in a running algorithm, a payment order shall not be reordered (change of the position in a queue) or revoked. Requests for reordering or revocation of a payment order shall be queued until the algorithm is complete. If the payment order concerned is settled while the algorithm is running, any request to reorder or revoke shall be rejected. If the payment order is not settled, the participant’s requests shall be taken into account immediately.\n8.   Use of the ICM\n(1)\nThe ICM may be used for obtaining information and managing liquidity. SWIFT’s Secure IP Network (SIPN) shall be the underlying technical communications network for exchanging information and running control measures.\n(2)\nWith the exception of warehoused payment orders and static data information, only data in relation to the current business day shall be available via the ICM. The screens shall be offered in English only.\n(3)\nInformation shall be provided in ‘pull’ mode, which means that each participant has to ask to be provided with information.\n(4)\nThe following modes shall be available for using the ICM:\n(a)\nApplication-to-application mode (A2A)\nIn A2A, information and messages are transferred between the PM and the participant’s internal application. The participant therefore has to ensure that an appropriate application is available for the exchange of XML messages (requests and responses) with the ICM via a standardised interface. Further details are contained in the ICM User Handbook and in Book 4 of the UDFS.\n(b)\nUser-to-application mode (U2A)\nU2A permits direct communication between a participant and the ICM. The information is displayed in a browser running on a PC system (SWIFT Alliance WebStation or another interface, as may be required by SWIFT). For U2A access the IT infrastructure has to be able to support cookies and JavaScript. Further details are described in the ICM User Handbook.\n(5)\nEach participant shall have at least one SWIFT Alliance WebStation, or another interface, as may be required by SWIFT, to have access to the ICM via U2A.\n(6)\nAccess rights to the ICM shall be granted by using SWIFT’s ‘Role Based Access Control’. The SWIFT ‘Non-repudiation of emission’ (NRE) service, which may be used by participants, allows the recipient of an XML message to prove that such message has not been altered.\n(7)\nIf a participant has technical problems and is unable to submit any payment order, it may generate preformatted backup liquidity redistribution and backup contingency payments by using the ICM. The [insert name of CB] shall open such functionality upon request of the participant.\n(8)\nParticipants may also use the ICM to transfer liquidity:\n(a)\n[insert if applicable] from their PM account to their account outside the PM;\n(b)\nbetween the PM account and the participant’s sub-accounts; and\n(c)\nfrom the PM account to the mirror account managed by the ancillary system.\n9.   The UDFS and the ICM User Handbook\nFurther details and examples explaining the above rules are contained in the UDFS and the ICM User Handbook, as amended from time to time and published on the [insert name of CB]’s website and the ECB’s website in English.\nAppendix II\nTARGET2 COMPENSATION SCHEME\n1.   General principles\n(a)\nIf there is a technical malfunction of TARGET2, direct participants may submit claims for compensation in accordance with the TARGET2 compensation scheme laid down in this Appendix.\n(b)\nUnless otherwise decided by the ECB’s Governing Council, the TARGET2 compensation scheme shall not apply if the technical malfunction of TARGET2 arises out of external events beyond the reasonable control of the CBs concerned or as a result of acts or omissions by third parties.\n(c)\nCompensation under the TARGET2 compensation scheme shall be the only compensation procedure offered in the event of a technical malfunction of TARGET2. Participants may, however, use other legal means to claim for losses. If a participant accepts a compensation offer under the TARGET2 compensation scheme, this shall constitute the participant’s irrevocable agreement that it thereby waives all claims in relation to the payment orders concerning which it accepts compensation (including any claims for consequential loss) it may have against any CB, and that the receipt by it of the corresponding compensation payment constitutes full and final settlement of all such claims. The participant shall indemnify the CBs concerned, up to a maximum of the amount received under the TARGET2 compensation scheme, in respect of any further claims which are raised by any other participant or any other third party in relation to the payment order or payment concerned.\n(d)\nThe making of a compensation offer shall not constitute an admission of liability by the [insert name of CB] or any other CB in respect of a technical malfunction of TARGET2.\n2.   Conditions for compensation offers\n(a)\nA payer may submit a claim for an administration fee and interest compensation if, due to a technical malfunction of TARGET2 a payment order was not settled on the business day on which it was accepted.\n(b)\nA payee may submit a claim for an administration fee if due to a technical malfunction of TARGET2 it did not receive a payment that it was expecting to receive on a particular business day. The payee may also submit a claim for interest compensation if one or more of the following conditions are met:\n(i)\nin the case of participants that have access to the marginal lending facility: due to a technical malfunction of TARGET2, a payee had recourse to the marginal lending facility; and/or\n(ii)\nin the case of all participants: it was technically impossible to have recourse to the money market or such refinancing was impossible on other, objectively reasonable grounds.\n3.   Calculation of compensation\n(a)\nWith respect to a compensation offer for a payer:\n(i)\nthe administration fee shall be EUR 50 for the first non-settled payment order, EUR 25 for each of the next four such payment orders and EUR 12,50 for each further such payment order. The administration fee shall be calculated separately in relation to each payee;\n(ii)\ninterest compensation shall be determined by applying a reference rate to be fixed from day to day. This reference rate shall be the lower of the euro overnight index average (EONIA) rate and the marginal lending rate. The reference rate shall be applied to the amount of the payment order not settled as a result of the technical malfunction of TARGET2 for each day in the period from the date of the actual or, in relation to payment orders referred to in paragraph 2(b)(ii), intended submission of the payment order until the date on which the payment order was or could have been successfully settled. Any proceeds made by placing funds resulting from non-settled payment orders on deposit with the Eurosystem shall be deducted from the amount of any compensation; and\n(iii)\nno interest compensation shall be payable if and in so far as funds resulting from non-settled payment orders were placed in the market or used to fulfil minimum reserve requirements.\n(b)\nWith respect to a compensation offer for a payee:\n(i)\nthe administration fee shall be EUR 50 for the first non-settled payment order, EUR 25 for each of the next four such payment orders and EUR 12,50 for each further such payment order. The administration fee shall be calculated separately in relation to each payer;\n(ii)\nthe method set out in subparagraph (a)(ii) for calculating interest compensation shall apply except that interest compensation shall be payable at a rate equal to the difference between the marginal lending rate and the reference rate, and shall be calculated on the amount of any recourse to the marginal lending facility occurring as a result of the technical malfunction of TARGET2.\n4.   Procedural rules\n(a)\nA claim for compensation shall be submitted on the claim form available on the website of the [insert name of CB] in English (see [insert reference to website of CB]). Payers shall submit a separate claim form in respect of each payee and payees shall submit a separate claim form in respect of each payer. Sufficient additional information and documents shall be provided to support the information indicated in the claim form. Only one claim may be submitted in relation to a specific payment or payment order.\n(b)\nWithin four weeks of a technical malfunction of TARGET2, participants shall submit their claim forms to the [insert name of CB]. Any additional information and evidence requested by the [insert name of CB] shall be supplied within two weeks of such request being made.\n(c)\nThe [insert name of CB] shall review the claims and forward them to the ECB. Unless otherwise decided by the ECB’s Governing Council and communicated to the participants, all received claims shall be assessed no later than 14 weeks after the technical malfunction of TARGET2 occurs.\n(d)\nThe [insert name of CB] shall communicate the result of the assessment referred to in subparagraph (c) to the relevant participants. If the assessment entails a compensation offer, the participants concerned shall, within four weeks of the communication of such offer, either accept or reject it, in respect of each payment or payment order comprised within each claim, by signing a standard letter of acceptance (in the form available on the website of the [insert name of CB] (see [insert reference to website of CB]). If such letter has not been received by the [insert name of CB] within four weeks, the participants concerned shall be deemed to have rejected the compensation offer.\n(e)\nThe [insert name of CB] shall make compensation payments on receipt of a participant’s letter of acceptance of compensation. No interest shall be payable on any compensation payment.\nAppendix III\nTERMS OF REFERENCE FOR CAPACITY AND COUNTRY OPINIONS\n[Insert name of CB]\n[address]\nParticipation in the [name of the system]\n[location]\n[date]\nDear Sir or Madam,\nWe have been asked to provide this Opinion as [in-house or external] legal advisers to [specify name of Participant or branch of Participant] in respect of issues arising under the laws of [jurisdiction in which the Participant is established; hereinafter the ‘jurisdiction’] in connection with the participation of [specify name of Participant] (hereinafter the ‘Participant’) in the [name of the TARGET2 component system] (hereinafter the ‘System’).\nThis Opinion is confined to the laws of [jurisdiction] as they exist as on the date of this Opinion.

ASSUMPTIONS\nFor the purposes of this Opinion we have assumed in relation to the System Documents that:\n(1)\nthe System Documents are within the capacity and power of and have been validly authorised, adopted or executed and, where necessary, delivered by the relevant parties;\n(2)\nthe terms of the System Documents and the rights and obligations created by them are valid and legally binding under the laws of [insert reference to the Member State of the System], by which they are expressed to be governed, and the choice of the laws of [insert reference to the Member State of the System] to govern the System Documents is recognised by the laws of [insert reference to the Member State of the System];\n(3)\nthe participants in the System through which any payment orders are sent or payments are received, or through which any rights or obligations under the System Documents are executed or performed, are licensed to provide funds transfer services, in all relevant jurisdictions; and\n(4)\nthe documents submitted to us in copy or as specimens conform to the originals.\n3.   OPINION\nBased on and subject to the foregoing, and subject in each case to the points set out below, we are of the opinion that:\n3.1.   Country-specific legal aspects [to the extent applicable]\nThe following characteristics of the legislation of [jurisdiction] are consistent with and in no way set aside the obligations of the Participant arising out of the System Documents: [list of country-specific legal aspects].\n3.2.   General insolvency issues\n3.2.a.   Types of insolvency proceedings\nThe only types of insolvency proceedings (including composition or rehabilitation) which, for the purpose of this Opinion, shall include all proceedings in respect of the Participant’s assets or any branch it may have in [jurisdiction] to which the Participant may become subject in [jurisdiction], are the following: [list proceedings in original language and English translation] (together collectively referred to as ‘Insolvency Proceedings’).\nIn addition to Insolvency Proceedings, the Participant, any of its assets, or any branch it may have in [jurisdiction] may become subject in [jurisdiction] to [list any applicable moratorium, receivership, or any other proceedings as a result of which payments to and/or from the Participant may be suspended, or limitations can be imposed in relation to such payments, or similar proceedings in original language and English translation] (hereinafter collectively referred to as ‘Proceedings’).\n3.2.b.   Insolvency treaties\n[jurisdiction] or certain political subdivisions within [jurisdiction], as specified, is/are party to the following insolvency treaties: [specify, if applicable which have or may have an impact on this Opinion].\n3.3.   Enforceability of System Documents\nSubject to the points set out below, all provisions of the System Documents will be binding and enforceable in accordance with their terms under the laws of [jurisdiction], in particular in the event of the opening of any Insolvency Proceedings or Proceedings with respect to the Participant.\nIn particular, we are of the opinion that:\n3.3.a.   Processing of payment orders\nThe provisions on processing of payment orders [list of sections] of the Rules are valid and enforceable. In particular, all payment orders processed pursuant to such sections will be valid, binding and will be enforceable under the laws of [jurisdiction]. The provision of the Rules which specifies the precise point in time at which payment orders submitted by the Participant to the System become enforceable and irrevocable ([add section of the Rules]) is valid, binding and enforceable under the laws of [jurisdiction].\n3.3.b.   Authority of the [insert name of CB] to perform its functions\nThe opening of Insolvency Proceedings or Proceedings in respect of the Participant will not affect the authority and powers of the [insert name of CB] arising out of the System Documents. [Specify [to the extent applicable] that: the same opinion is also applicable in respect of any other entity which provides the Participants with services directly and necessarily required for participation in the System, e.g. network service provider].\n3.3.c.   Remedies in the event of default\n[Where applicable to the Participant, the provisions contained in [list of sections] of the Rules regarding accelerated performance of claims which have not yet matured, the set-off of claims for using the deposits of the Participant, the enforcement of a pledge, suspension and termination of participation, claims for default interest, and termination of agreements and transactions ([insert other relevant clauses of the Rules or the System Documents]) are valid and enforceable under the laws of [jurisdiction].]\n3.3.d.   Suspension and termination\nWhere applicable to the Participant, the provisions contained in [list of sections] of the Rules (in respect of suspension and termination of the Participant’s participation in the System on the opening of Insolvency Proceedings or Proceedings or other events of default, as defined in the System Documents, or if the Participant represents any kind of systemic risk or has serious operational problems) are valid and enforceable under the laws of [jurisdiction].\n3.3.e.

Assignment of rights and obligations\nThe rights and obligations of the Participant cannot be assigned, altered or otherwise transferred by the Participant to third parties without the prior written consent of the [insert name of CB].\n3.3.g.   Choice of governing law and jurisdiction\nThe provisions contained in [list of sections] of the Rules, and in particular in respect of the governing law, the resolution of a dispute, competent courts, and service of process are valid and enforceable under the laws of [jurisdiction].\n3.4.   Voidable preferences\nWe are of the opinion that no obligation arising out of the System Documents, the performance thereof, or compliance therewith prior to the opening of any Insolvency Proceedings or Proceedings in respect of the Participant may be set aside in any such proceedings as a preference, voidable transaction or otherwise under the laws of [jurisdiction].\nIn particular, and without limitation to the foregoing, we express this opinion in respect of any payment orders submitted by any participant in the System. In particular, we are of the opinion that the provisions of [list of sections] of the Rules establishing the enforceability and irrevocability of payment orders will be valid and enforceable and that a payment order submitted by any participant and processed pursuant to [list of sections] of the Rules may not be set aside in any Insolvency Proceedings or Proceedings as a preference, voidable transaction or otherwise under the laws of [jurisdiction].\n3.5.   Attachment\nIf a creditor of the Participant seeks an attachment order (including any freezing order, order for seizure or any other public or private law procedure that is intended to protect the public interest or the rights of the Participant’s creditors) — hereinafter referred to as an ‘Attachment’ — under the laws of [jurisdiction] from a court or governmental, judicial or public authority that is competent in [jurisdiction], we are of the opinion that [insert the analysis and discussion].\n3.6.   Collateral [if applicable]\n3.6.a.   Assignment of rights or deposit of assets for collateral purposes, pledge and/or repo\nAssignments for collateral purposes will be valid and enforceable under the laws of [jurisdiction]. Specifically, the creation and enforcement of a pledge or repo under the [insert reference to the relevant arrangement with the CB] will be valid and enforceable under the laws of [jurisdiction].\n3.6.b.   Priority of assignees’, pledgees’ or repo purchasers’ interest over that of other claimants\nIn the event of Insolvency Proceedings or Proceedings in respect of the Participant, the rights or assets assigned for collateral purposes, or pledged by the Participant in favour of the [insert reference to CB] or other participants in the System, will rank in priority of payment above the claims of all other creditors of the Participant and will not be subject to priority or preferential creditors.\n3.6.c.   Enforcing title to security\nEven in the event of Insolvency Proceedings or Proceedings in respect of the Participant, other participants in the System and the [insert name of CB] as [assignees, pledgees or repo purchasers as applicable] will still be free to enforce and collect the Participant’s rights or assets through the action of the [insert name of CB] pursuant to the Rules.\n3.6.d.   Form and registration requirements\nThere are no form requirements for the assignment for collateral purposes of, or the creation and enforcement of a pledge or repo over the Participant’s rights or assets and it is not necessary for the [assignment for collateral purposes, pledge or repo, as applicable], or any particulars of such [assignment, pledge or repo, as applicable,] to be registered or filed with any court or governmental, judicial or public authority that is competent in [jurisdiction].\n3.7.   Branches [to the extent applicable]\n3.7.a.   Opinion applies to action through branches\nEach of the statements and opinions presented above with regard to the Participant applies with equal accuracy and validity under the laws of [jurisdiction] in situations where the Participant acts through its one or more of its branches established outside [jurisdiction].\n3.7.b.   Conformity with law\nNeither the execution and performance of the rights and obligations under the System Documents nor the submission, transmission or receipt of payment orders by a branch of the Participant will in any respect breach the laws of [jurisdiction].\n3.7.c.   Required authorisations\nNeither the execution and performance of the rights and obligations under the System Documents nor the submission, transmission or receipt of payment orders by a branch of a Participant will require any additional authorisations, approvals, consents, filings, registrations, notarisations or other certifications of or with any court or governmental, judicial or public authority that is competent in [jurisdiction].\nThis Opinion is stated as of its date and is addressed solely to the [insert name of CB] and the [Participant]. No other persons may rely on this Opinion, and the contents of this Opinion may not be disclosed to persons other than its intended recipients and their legal counsel without our prior written consent, with the exception of the European Central Bank and the national central banks of the European System of Central Banks [and [the national central bank/relevant regulatory authorities] of [jurisdiction]].\nYours faithfully,\n[signature]\nAppendix IV\nBUSINESS CONTINUITY AND CONTINGENCY PROCEDURES\n1.   General provisions\n(a)\nThis Appendix sets out the arrangements between the [insert name of CB] and participants, or ancillary systems, if one or more components of the SSP or the telecommunications network fail or are affected by an abnormal external event, or if the failure affects any participant or ancillary system.\n(b)\nAll references to specific times in this Appendix are to the local time at the seat of the ECB, i.e. Central European Time (CET (1)).\n2.   Measures of business continuity and contingency processing\n(a)\nIn the event that an abnormal external event occurs and/or there is a failure of the SSP or the telecommunications network which affects the normal operation of TARGET2, the [insert name of CB] shall be entitled to adopt business continuity and contingency processing measures.\n(b)\nThe following main business continuity and contingency processing measures shall be available in TARGET2:\n(i)\nrelocating the operation of the SSP to an alternative site;\n(ii)\nchanging the SSP’s operating hours; and\n(iii)\ninitiating contingency processing of very critical and critical payments, as defined in paragraph 6(c) and (d) respectively.\n(c)\nIn relation to business continuity and contingency processing measures, the [insert name of CB] shall have full discretion regarding whether and which measures are adopted to settle payment orders.\n3.   Incident communication\n(a)\nInformation about the failure of the SSP and/or an abnormal external event shall be communicated to participants through the domestic communication channels, the ICM and T2IS. In particular, communications to participants shall include the following information:\n(i)\na description of the event;\n(ii)\nthe anticipated delay in processing (if known);\n(iii)\ninformation on the measures already taken; and\n(iv)\nthe advice to participants.\n(b)\nIn addition, the [insert name of CB] may notify participants of any other existing or anticipated event which has the potential to affect the normal operation of TARGET2.\n4.   Relocation of the operation of the SSP to an alternative site\n(a)\nIn the event that any of the events referred to in paragraph 2(a) occurs, the operation of the SSP may be relocated to an alternative site, either within the same region or in another region.\n(b)\nIn the event that the operation of the SSP is relocated to another region, the participants shall use best efforts to reconcile their positions up to the point of the failure or the occurrence of the abnormal external event and provide to the [insert name of CB] all relevant information in this respect.\n5.   Change of operating hours\n(a)\nThe daytime processing of TARGET2 may be extended or the opening time of a new business day may be delayed. During any extended operating time of TARGET2, payment orders shall be processed in accordance with the [insert reference to arrangements implementing the Harmonised Conditions], subject to the modifications contained in this Appendix.\n(b)\nDaytime processing may be extended and the closing time thereby delayed if an SSP failure has occurred during the day but has been resolved before 18.00. Such a closing time delay shall in normal circumstances not exceed two hours and shall be announced as early as possible to participants. If such a delay is announced before 16.50, the minimum period of one hour between the cut-off time for customer and interbank payment orders shall remain in place. Once such a delay is announced it may not be withdrawn.\n(c)\nThe closing time shall be delayed in cases where an SSP failure has occurred before 18.00 and has not been resolved by 18.00. The [insert name of CB] shall immediately communicate the delay of closing time to participants.\n(d)\nUpon recovery of the SSP, the following steps shall take place:\n(i)\nthe [insert name of CB] shall seek to settle all queued payments within one hour; this time is reduced to 30 minutes in the event that the SSP failure occurs at 17.30 or later (in cases where the SSP failure was on-going at 18.00);\n(ii)\nparticipants’ final balances shall be established within one hour; this time shall be reduced to 30 minutes in the event that the SSP failure occurs at 17.30 or later, in cases where the SSP failure was on-going at 18.00;\n(iii)\nat the cut-off time for interbank payments, the end-of-day processing, including recourse to the Eurosystem standing facilities shall take place;\n(e)\nancillary systems that require liquidity in the early morning need to have established means to cope with cases where the daytime processing cannot be started in time due to an SSP failure on the previous day.\n6.   Contingency processing\n(a)\nIf it deems it necessary to do so, the [insert name of CB] shall initiate the contingency processing of payment orders in the Contingency Module of the SSP. In such cases, only a minimum service level shall be provided to participants. The [insert name of CB] shall inform its participants of the start of contingency processing by means of any available means of communication.\n(b)\nIn contingency processing, payment orders shall be processed manually by the [insert name of CB].\n(c)\nThe following payments shall be considered as ‘very critical’ and the [insert name of CB] shall use best efforts to process them in contingency situations:\n(i)\nCLS Bank International-related payments;\n(ii)\nend-of-day settlement of EURO1;\n(iii)\ncentral counterparty margin calls.\n(d)\nThe following types of payments shall be considered as ‘critical’ and the [insert name of CB] may decide to initiate contingency processing in relation to them:\n(i)\npayments in relation to the real-time settlement of interfaced securities settlement systems; and\n(ii)\nadditional payments, if required to avoid systemic risk.\n(e)\nParticipants shall submit payment orders for contingency processing and information to payees shall be provided through [insert communication means]. Information concerning account balances and debit and credit entries may be obtained via the [insert name of CB].\n(f)\nPayment orders that have already been submitted to TARGET2-[insert CB/country reference], but are queued, may also undergo contingency processing. In such cases the [insert name of CB] shall endeavour to avoid the double processing of payment orders, but the participants shall bear the risk of such double processing if it occurred.\n(g)\nFor contingency processing of payment orders, participants shall provide additional collateral. During contingency processing, incoming contingency payments may be used to fund outgoing contingency payments. For the purposes of contingency processing, participants’ available liquidity may not be taken into account by the [insert name of CB].\n7.   Failures linked to participants or ancillary systems\n(a)\nIn the event that a participant has a problem that prevents it from settling payments in TARGET2 it shall be its responsibility to resolve the problem. In particular, a participant may use in-house solutions or the ICM functionality, i.e. backup liquidity redistribution payments and backup contingency payments (CLS, EURO1, STEP2 pre-fund).\n(b)\nIf a participant decides to use the ICM functionality for making backup liquidity redistribution payments, the [insert name of CB] shall, if the participant so requests, open this functionality via the ICM. If the participant so requests, the [insert name of CB] shall transmit an ICM broadcast message to inform other participants about the participant’s use of backup liquidity redistribution payments. The participant shall be responsible for sending such backup liquidity redistribution payments exclusively to other participants with which it has bilaterally agreed on the use of such payments and for any further steps in relation to such payments.\n(c)\nIf the measures referred to in subparagraph (a) are exhausted or if they are inefficient, the participant may request support from the [insert name of CB].\n(d)\nIn the event that a failure affects an ancillary system, that ancillary system shall be responsible for resolving the failure. If the ancillary system so requests, the [insert name of CB] may act on its behalf. The [insert name of CB] shall have discretion to decide what support it gives to the ancillary system, including during the night-time operations of the ancillary system. The following contingency measures may be taken:\n(i)\nthe ancillary system initiates clean payments, i.e. payments that are not linked to the underlying transaction, via the Participant Interface;\n(ii)\nthe [insert name of CB] creates and/or processes XML instructions/files on behalf of the ancillary system; and/or\n(iii)\nthe [insert name of CB] makes clean payments on behalf of the ancillary system.\n(e)\nThe detailed contingency measures with respect to ancillary systems shall be contained in the bilateral arrangements between the [insert name of CB] and the relevant ancillary system.\n8.   Other provisions\n(a)\nIn the event that certain data are unavailable because one of the events referred to in paragraph 3(a) has occurred, the [insert name of CB] is entitled to start or continue processing payment orders and/or operate TARGET2-[insert CB/country reference] on the basis of the last available data, as determined by the [insert name of CB]. If so requested by the [insert name of CB], participants and ancillary systems shall resubmit their FileAct/Interact messages or take any other action deemed appropriate by the [insert name of CB].\n(b)\nIn the event of a failure of the [insert name of CB], some or all of its technical functions in relation to TARGET2-[insert CB/country reference] may be performed by other Eurosystem CBs.\n(c)\nThe [insert name of CB] may require that the participants participate in regular or ad hoc testing of business continuity and contingency processing measures, training or any other preventive arrangements, as deemed necessary by the [insert name of CB]. Any costs incurred by the participants as a result of such testing or other arrangements shall be borne solely by the participants.\n(1)  CET takes into account the change to Central European Summer Time.\nAppendix V\nOPERATING SCHEDULE\n1.\nTARGET2 is open on all days, except Saturdays, Sundays, New Year’s Day, Good Friday and Easter Monday (according to the calendar applicable at the seat of the ECB), 1 May, Christmas Day and 26 December.\n2.\nThe reference time for the system is the local time at the seat of the ECB, i.e. CET.\n3.\nThe current business day is opened during the evening of the previous business day and operates to the following schedule:\nTime\nDescription\n6.45-7.00\nBusiness window to prepare daytime operations (1)\n7.00-18.00\nDaytime processing\n17.00\nCut-off time for customer payments, i.e. payments where the originator and/or the beneficiary of a payment is not a direct or indirect participant as identified in the system by the use of an MT 103 or MT 103+ message\n18.00\nCut-off time for interbank payments, i.e. payments other than customer payments\n18.00-18.45 (2)\nEnd-of-day processing\n18.15 (2)\nGeneral cut-off time for the use of standing facilities\n(Shortly after) 18.30 (3)\nData for the update of accounting systems are available to CBs\n18.45-19.30 (3)\nStart-of-day processing (new business day)\n19.00 (3)-19.30 (2)\nProvision of liquidity on the PM account\n19.30 (3)\n‘Start-of-procedure’ message and settlement of the standing orders to transfer liquidity from the PM accounts to the sub-accounts/mirror account (ancillary system-related settlement)\n19.30 (3)-22.00\nExecution of additional liquidity transfers via the ICM before the ancillary system sends the ‘start-of-cycle’ message; settlement period of night-time ancillary system operations (only for ancillary system settlement procedure 6)\n22.00-1.00\nTechnical maintenance period\n1.00-7.00\nSettlement procedure of night-time ancillary system operations (only for ancillary system settlement procedure 6)\n4.\nThe ICM is available for liquidity transfers from 19.30 (4) until 18.00 the next day, except during the technical maintenance period from 22.00 until 1.00.\n5.\nThe operating hours may be changed in the event that business continuity measures are adopted in accordance with paragraph 5 of Appendix IV.\n(1)  ‘Daytime operations’ means daytime processing and end-of-day processing.\n(2)  Ends 15 minutes later on the last day of the Eurosystem reserve maintenance period.\n(3)  Starts 15 minutes later on the last day of the Eurosystem reserve maintenance period.\n(4)  Starts 15 minutes later on the last day of the Eurosystem reserve maintenance period.\nAppendix VI\nFEE SCHEDULE AND INVOICING\nFees for direct participants\n1.\nThe monthly fee for the processing of payment orders in TARGET2-[insert CB/country reference] for direct participants, depending on which option the direct participant has chosen, shall be either:\n(a)\nEUR 150 per PM account plus a flat fee per transaction (debit entry) of EUR 0,80; or\n(b)\nEUR 1 875 per PM account plus a fee per transaction (debit entry) determined as follows, based on the volume of transactions (number of processed items) per month:\nBand\nFrom\nTo\nPrice (EUR)\n1\n1\n10 000\n0,60\n2\n10 001\n25 000\n0,50\n3\n25 001\n50 000\n0,40\n4\n50 001\n100 000\n0,20\n5\nAbove 100 000\n—\n0,125\nLiquidity transfers between a participant’s PM account and its sub-accounts shall not be subject to a charge.\n2.\nThe monthly fee for multi-addressee access shall be EUR 80 for each eight-digit BIC address other than the BIC of the direct participant’s account.\n3.\nThere shall be an additional monthly fee for direct participants who do not wish the BIC of their account to be published in the TARGET2 directory of EUR 30 per account.\n4.\nThe monthly fee for each registration by a direct participant of an indirect participant in the TARGET2 directory shall be EUR 20.\n5.\nThe one time fee for each registration in the TARGET2 directory of an addressable BIC holder, for branches of direct and indirect participants, branches of correspondents and addressable BIC holders that are members of the same group, as defined in Article 1, shall be EUR 5.\n6.\nThe monthly fee for each registration in the TARGET2 directory of an addressable BIC holder for a correspondent shall be EUR 5.\nFees for liquidity pooling\n7.\nFor the CAI mode, the monthly fee shall be EUR 100 for each account included in the group.\n8.\nFor the AL mode, the monthly fee shall be EUR 200 for each account included in the AL group.

If an AL group is part of a CAI group, and the AL group manager is the same as the CAI group manager, the monthly fee of EUR 1 875 shall only be paid once. If the AL group is a part of a CAI group and the CAI group manager is different from the AL group manager, then the CAI group manager shall pay an additional monthly fee of EUR 1 875. In such cases the invoice for the total fees for all the accounts in the CAI group (including the AL group accounts) shall be sent to the CAI group manager.\nInvoicing\n11.\nIn the case of direct participants, the following invoicing rules apply.

The resulting debit position on one or more of these PM accounts constitutes intraday credit, the provision of which is governed by the respective national arrangements, subject to the modifications described in this agreement; in particular, such debit position is collateralised with the available liquidity on the PM accounts of other AL group members.\n(4)\nThe effect of this mechanism is in no way to merge the various PM accounts, which, subject to the limitations described in this agreement, continue to be exclusively held by their respective holders.\n(5)\nSuch a mechanism aims to avoid the fragmentation of liquidity in the different TARGET2 component systems and simplify the liquidity management within a group of credit institutions.\n(6)\nThis mechanism improves the overall efficiency of settlement of payments in TARGET2.\n(7)\n[Participant], [participant] and [participant] are respectively connected to TARGET2-[insert CB/country reference], TARGET2-[insert CB/country reference], and TARGET2-[insert CB/country reference] and are bound by the [insert reference to the arrangements implementing the Harmonised Conditions] of [insert relevant dates],\nNow, therefore, the Parties agree the following:\nArticle 1\nEffectiveness of this agreement\nThis agreement and any amendment made hereto shall only be effective when the managing NCB, after having obtained any information or documents that it deems appropriate, confirms in writing that this agreement or amendments thereto comply with the requirements laid down in the respective conditions for participation in the TARGET2 component systems.\nArticle 2\nMutual interest of AL group members and of AL NCBs\n1.   The AL group members expressly declare and acknowledge that their entry into this agreement serves their mutual economic, social and financial interests since the payment orders of all AL group members may be settled in their respective TARGET2 component systems, up to an amount corresponding to the available liquidity on all the AL group members’ PM accounts, thereby leveraging the liquidity available in other TARGET2 component systems.\n2.   The AL NCBs have a mutual interest in providing intraday credit to the AL group members, as this promotes the overall efficiency of settling payments in TARGET2. The intraday credit is collateralised in accordance with Article 18 of the Statute of the European System of Central Banks and of the European Central Bank since the debit balance resulting from the execution of a payment order is covered by the available liquidity on the PM accounts held by the other AL group members with their respective AL NCBs, which are collateralised for the discharge of the obligations owed by any of the AL group members to the AL NCBs.\nArticle 3\nAL group members’ rights and obligations\n1.   AL group members shall be jointly and severally liable towards all AL NCBs in relation to all claims resulting from the settlement in their respective TARGET2 component system of the payment order of any AL group member. AL group members shall not be entitled to rely on any internal group arrangements on the division of liabilities to avoid any liability to the AL NCBs in relation to the aggregation of all abovementioned liabilities.\n2.   The total value of all payment orders settled by the AL group members on their PM accounts may never exceed the aggregate amount of all available liquidity on all such PM accounts.\n3.   AL group members shall be authorised to use the CAI mode, as described in the [insert the reference to the arrangements implementing the Harmonised Conditions].\n4.   The AL group members shall ensure that there is an internal agreement between them containing inter alia:\n(a)\nthe rules of internal organisation of the AL group;\n(b)\nthe conditions under which the AL group manager has a duty to report to the AL group members;\n(c)\nthe costs of the AL mode (including their allocation between AL group members); and\n(d)\nthe fees to be paid as remuneration between the AL group members for the services under the AL agreement and the rules for calculating the financial consideration.\nWith the exception of subparagraph (d), the AL group members may decide whether or not to disclose this internal agreement or parts of it to the AL NCBs. The AL group members shall disclose information referred to in subparagraph (d) to the AL NCBs.\nArticle 4\nAL NCBs’ rights and obligations\n1.   When an AL group member submits a payment order to its respective TARGET2 component system for an amount exceeding the available liquidity on that AL group member’s PM account, its respective AL NCB shall extend intraday credit that is collateralised with the available liquidity on other PM accounts held by the AL group member with its respective AL NCB or on the PM accounts held by the other AL group members with their respective AL NCBs. Such intraday credit shall be governed by the rules applicable to the provision of intraday credit by such AL NCB.\n2.   Payment orders submitted by any of the AL group members which have the effect of exceeding the available liquidity on all PM accounts of the AL group members shall be queued until sufficient liquidity is available.\n3.   Except on the opening of insolvency proceedings against one or more AL group members, an AL NCB may claim from each of the AL group members the full discharge of all obligations resulting from the settlement of payment orders of any AL group member in the latter’s TARGET2 component system.\nArticle 5\nDesignation and role of the AL group manager\n1.   The AL group members hereby designate as AL group manager [indicate the participant designated as AL group manager], which shall be the contact point for all administrative matters relating to the AL group.\n2.   All AL group members shall provide their respective AL NCB, as well as the AL group manager, with any information which may affect the validity, enforceability and implementation of this agreement, including, without limitation, any modification or ending of the links between the AL group members needed to comply with the definition of a group laid down in the [insert reference to the relevant provisions in the arrangements implementing the Harmonised Conditions], the occurrence of any events of default within the meaning of the [insert reference to the arrangements implementing the Harmonised Conditions] or any event which may affect the validity and/or enforceability of the [insert reference to the pledge, close-out netting provisions or any other relevant provisions of the arrangements implementing the Harmonised Conditions].\n3.   The AL group manager shall immediately convey to the managing NCB any information described in paragraph 2 relating to itself or to any other AL group member.\n4.   The AL group manager shall be responsible in respect of intraday monitoring of the liquidity available within the AL group.\n5.   The AL group manager shall have power of attorney over the PM accounts of the AL group members and, in particular, shall act as agent of the AL group members in respect of the following operations:\n(a)\nany ICM operations in respect of the AL group members’ PM accounts, including, but not limited to, any change in priority of a payment order, revocation, change of settlement time, liquidity transfers (including from and to sub-accounts), reordering of queued transactions, reservation of liquidity in respect of the AL group, and setting and changes of limits in respect of the AL group;\n(b)\nall end-of-day liquidity transactions between the PM accounts of the AL group members ensuring that all balances of the AL group members’ PM accounts are levelled out, so that none of these accounts have a debit balance at the end of the day or, where applicable, a debit balance not secured by eligible collateral (hereinafter such procedure is referred to as ‘levelling out’);\n(c)\ngeneral instructions according to which automatic levelling out shall be performed, i.e. defining the sequence of AL group members’ PM accounts with available liquidity to be debited within the levelling out;\n(d)\nin the absence of any explicit instructions by the AL group manager, as set out in subparagraphs (b) and (c), automatic levelling out shall be performed starting with the PM account with the highest credit balance towards the PM account with the highest debit balance.\nThe same criteria as defined in subparagraphs (c) and (d) shall be used if an enforcement event, as defined in [insert reference to the relevant provisions in the arrangements implementing the Harmonised Conditions], occurs.\n6.   The AL group members explicitly waive any rights they may have against the AL group manager under [insert, if applicable, a reference to the relevant provision of national law], resulting from the combination of such manager’s capacity as a PM account holder and AL group member with its capacity as AL group manager.\nArticle 6\nRole of the managing NCB\n1.   The managing NCB shall be the contact point for all administrative matters relating to the AL group.\n2.   All of the AL NCBs shall immediately provide the managing NCB with any information relating to their respective AL group members which may affect the validity, enforceability and implementation of this agreement, including, but not limited to, any modification or ending of the links between the AL group members needed to comply with the definition of a group, the occurrence of any events of default within the meaning of the [insert reference to the arrangements implementing the Harmonised Conditions] or events which may affect the validity and/or enforceability of the [insert reference to the pledge, close-out netting or any other relevant provisions of the arrangements implementing the Harmonised Conditions].\n3.   The managing NCB shall have access to all relevant information in respect of all PM accounts of the AL group members, including, but not limited to, information in respect of any credit line, the balance, total turnover, settled payments, queued payments, as well as information on the AL group members’ limits and liquidity reservations.\nArticle 7\nDuration and termination of this agreement\n1.   This agreement shall be of unlimited duration.\n2.   Each of the AL group members may unilaterally terminate its participation in this agreement, provided it gives 14 business days’ written notice to the AL NCB in whose TARGET2 component system it participates and to the managing NCB. The managing NCB shall confirm to that AL group member the date of its termination of participation in the AL agreement and shall communicate such date to all AL NCBs which shall inform their AL group members accordingly. If that AL group member was the AL group manager, the remaining AL group members shall immediately appoint a new AL group manager.\n3.   This agreement or the participation of any AL group member in this agreement, as the case may be, shall automatically be terminated without prior notice and with immediate effect if one or more of the following events occurs:\n(a)\nmodification or ending of the links between all AL group members needed to comply with the definition of a group, as laid down in the [insert reference to the arrangements implementing the Harmonised Conditions], or affecting one or more AL group members; and/or\n(b)\nany other requirements for using the AL mode, as described in the [insert reference to the arrangements implementing the Harmonised Conditions] are no longer met by all AL group members, or one or more AL group members.\n4.   Notwithstanding the occurrence of any of the events described in paragraph 3, a payment order that has already been submitted by any AL group member into the relevant TARGET2 component system shall remain valid and enforceable in respect of all AL group members and the AL NCBs. [Insert if relevant: In addition, the [insert reference to pledge and/or close-out netting or other relevant security arrangement] shall remain valid after the termination of this agreement until all debit positions on the PM accounts whose liquidity was aggregated are fully discharged by the AL group members.]\n5.   Without prejudice to paragraph 3, the managing NCB, in agreement with the relevant AL NCB, may at any time terminate without prior notice and with immediate effect the participation of any AL group member in this agreement if such AL group member is in breach of any of the provisions hereof. Such decision shall be addressed in writing to all the AL group members setting out the reasons for the decision. If participation is terminated in this way, the AL group members whose participation in this agreement has not been terminated are entitled to terminate their participation in this agreement provided that they give the managing NCB and the relevant AL NCB five business days’ written notice thereof. If the AL group manager’s participation is terminated, the remaining AL group members shall immediately appoint a new AL group manager.\n6.   The managing NCB, in agreement with the other AL NCBs, may terminate this agreement without prior notice and with immediate effect if the maintenance of it would endanger the overall stability, soundness and safety of TARGET2 or jeopardise the performance by the AL NCBs of their tasks pursuant to the Statute of the European System of Central Banks and of the European Central Bank. Any decision to do so shall be addressed in writing to the AL group members, setting out the reasons for the decision.\n7.   This agreement shall remain valid for as long as there are at least two AL group members.\nArticle 8\nAmendment procedure\nAny change to this agreement, including the extension of the AL group to other participants, shall only be valid and enforceable if expressly agreed to by all parties in writing.\nArticle 9\nGoverning law\nThis agreement shall be governed, construed and implemented in accordance with the [insert reference to the law governing the PM account of the AL group manager held with the managing NCB]. This shall be without prejudice to:\n(a)\nthe relationship between an AL group member and its respective AL NCB governed by the law of the respective AL NCB; and\n(b)\nthe rights and obligations between the AL NCBs governed by the law of the AL NCB which maintains the PM account of the AL group member whose available liquidity is used as collateral.\nArticle 10\nApplication of the [insert reference to the arrangements implementing the Harmonised Conditions]\n1.   In relation to each of the AL group members and their respective AL NCBs, the relevant provisions of the [insert reference to the arrangements implementing the Harmonised Conditions] shall govern any matter not expressly governed by this agreement.\n2.   [Insert reference to the arrangements implementing the Harmonised Conditions] and this agreement shall be deemed to form part of the same contractual relationship.\nMade, in as many copies as there are parties, the […date….]\nAGGREGATED LIQUIDITY AGREEMENT — VARIANT B\nTemplate for use of the AL mode by one credit institution\nBetween, on the one hand: [name and address of a credit institution] represented by […], acting as [participant], holder of PM accounts No […], with [insert name of CB],\n[participant], holder of PM accounts No […], with [insert name of CB],\n[participant], holder of PM accounts No […], with [insert name of CB],\n(the participants hereinafter mentioned as the ‘AL group members’)\nand on the other hand, [insert name of AL NCB] [insert name of AL NCB] [insert name of AL NCB] (hereinafter the ‘AL NCBs’)\n(AL group members and AL NCBs hereinafter collectively referred to as the ‘Parties’)\nWhereas:\n(1)\nTARGET2 is legally structured as a multiplicity of payment systems, each of which is designated as a system under the relevant national legislation implementing Directive 98/26/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 19 May 1998 on settlement finality in payment and securities settlement systems (2).\n(2)\nA credit institution with several PM accounts in one or more TARGET2 component systems may, under certain conditions laid down in the respective conditions for participation in TARGET2 component systems, set up an AL group, whereby the liquidity on such PM accounts of the AL group members is aggregated.\n(3)\nAggregation of liquidity enables the AL group members to settle payment orders for an amount exceeding the available liquidity on one PM account, provided that the total value of all such payment orders never exceeds the aggregate amount of the available liquidity on all PM accounts of the AL group members.

Role of SCBs\nEach Eurosystem CB shall act as the SCB in relation to any settlement bank for which it holds a PM account.\n3.   Management of relationship between CBs, ancillary systems and settlement banks\n(1)\nThe ASCBs shall ensure that the ancillary systems with which they have bilateral arrangements provide a list of settlement banks containing the settlement banks’ PM account details, which the ASCB shall store in the Static Data (Management) Module of the SSP. Any ancillary system may access the list of its respective settlement banks via the ICM.\n(2)\nThe ASCBs shall ensure that the ancillary systems with which they have bilateral arrangements inform them without delay of any changes with regard to the list of settlement banks. The ASCBs shall inform the relevant SCB regarding any such changes via an ICM broadcast message.\n(3)\nThe ASCBs shall ensure that the ancillary systems with which they have bilateral arrangements collect the debit mandates and other relevant documents from their settlement banks and submit them to the ASCB. Such documents shall be provided in English and/or the ASCB’s relevant national languages. If the ASCB’s national language(s) is/are not identical with the SCB’s national languages, the necessary documents shall be provided in English only or both in English and in the ASCB’s relevant national language(s). In the case of ancillary systems that settle via TARGET2-ECB, the documents shall be provided in English.\n(4)\nIf a settlement bank is a participant in the relevant ASCB’s TARGET2 component system, the ASCB shall verify the validity of the debit mandate given by the settlement bank and make any necessary entries in the Static Data (Management) Module. If a settlement bank is not a participant in the relevant ASCB’s TARGET2 component system, the ASCB shall forward the debit mandate (or an electronic copy thereof, if so agreed between ASCB and SCB) to the relevant SCBs for verification of its validity. The SCBs shall perform such verification and shall inform the relevant ASCB of the outcome of verification within five business days after receipt of such request. After verification, the ASCB shall update the list of settlement banks in the ICM.\n(5)\nThe verification undertaken by the ASCB shall be without prejudice to the ancillary system’s responsibility to restrict payment instructions to the list of settlement banks referred to in subparagraph 1.\n(6)\nUnless they are one and the same, the ASCBs and SCBs shall exchange information regarding any significant event during the settlement process.\n(7)\nThe ASCBs shall ensure that the ASs with which they have bilateral arrangements provide the name and the BIC of the ancillary system with which they intend to execute cross-system settlement and the date from which cross-system settlement with a particular ancillary system should begin or stop. This information shall be recorded in the Static Data (Management) Module.\n4.   Initiation of payment instructions via the ASI\n(1)\nAll payment instructions submitted by an ancillary system via the ASI shall be in the form of XML messages.\n(2)\nAll payment instructions submitted by an ancillary system via the ASI shall be considered as ‘highly urgent’ and shall be settled in accordance with the provisions laid down in Annex II.\n(3)\nA payment instruction shall be deemed accepted if:\n(a)\nthe payment instruction complies with the rules established by the network service provider;\n(b)\nthe payment instruction complies with the formatting rules and conditions of the ASCB’s TARGET2 component system;\n(c)\nthe settlement bank is on the list of settlement banks referred to in paragraph 3(1);\n(d)\nin the case of a cross-system settlement, the relevant ancillary system is on the list of ASs with which cross-system settlement may be executed;\n(e)\nin the event that a settlement bank’s participation in TARGET2 has been suspended, the explicit consent of the SCB of the suspended settlement bank has been obtained.\n5.

Debit instructions shall be deemed to be entered in the relevant TARGET2 component system at the moment and irrevocable from the moment that they are accepted by the SCB.\n(2)\nThe application of subparagraph 1 shall not have any effect on any rules of ASs which stipulate a moment of entry into the ancillary system and/or irrevocability of transfer orders submitted to such ancillary system at a point in time earlier than the moment of entry of the respective payment instruction in the relevant TARGET2 component system.\n6.   Settlement procedures\n(1)\nIf an ancillary system requests use of a settlement procedure, the ASCB concerned shall offer one or more of the settlement procedures specified below:\n(a)\nsettlement procedure 1\n(liquidity transfer);\n(b)\nsettlement procedure 2\n(real-time settlement);\n(c)\nsettlement procedure 3\n(bilateral settlement);\n(d)\nsettlement procedure 4\n(standard multilateral settlement);\n(e)\nsettlement procedure 5\n(simultaneous multilateral settlement);\n(f)\nsettlement procedure 6\n(dedicated liquidity and cross-system settlement).\n(2)\nThe SCBs shall support the settlement of ancillary system payment instructions in accordance with the choice of settlement procedures referred to in subparagraph 1 by, inter alia, settling payment instructions on the settlement banks’ PM accounts or sub-accounts.\n(3)\nFurther details relating to the settlement procedures referred to in subparagraph 1 are contained in paragraphs 9 to 14.\n7.   No obligation to open PM account\nASs shall not be obliged to become direct participants in a TARGET2 component system or to maintain a PM account while using the ASI.\n8.   Accounts to support settlement procedures\n(1)\nIn addition to PM accounts, the following types of accounts may be opened in the PM and used by ASCBs, ASs and settlement banks for the settlement procedures referred to in paragraph 6(1):\n(a)\ntechnical accounts;\n(b)\nmirror accounts;\n(c)\nguarantee fund accounts;\n(d)\nsub-accounts.\n(2)\nWhen an ASCB offers settlement procedure 4, 5 or 6 for interfaced models, it shall open a technical account in its TARGET2 component system for the ASs concerned. Such accounts may be offered by the ASCB as an option for settlement procedures 2 and 3. Separate technical accounts shall be opened in respect of settlement procedures 4 and 5. The balance on technical accounts shall be zero or positive at the end of the relevant ancillary system’s settlement process and the end-of-day balance shall be zero. Technical accounts shall be identified by means of the relevant ancillary system’s BIC.\n(3)\nWhen offering settlement procedure 1 or 6 for integrated models, an ASCB shall, and when offering settlement procedure 3 or 6 for interfaced models, an ASCB may open mirror accounts in its TARGET2 component system. Mirror accounts are specific PM accounts held by the ASCB in its TARGET2 component system for use by the ancillary system. Mirror accounts are identified by the relevant ASCB’s BIC.\n(4)\nWhen offering settlement procedure 4 or 5, an ASCB may open a guarantee fund account in its TARGET2 component system for ASs. The balances of these accounts shall be used to settle the ancillary system’s payment instructions in the event that there is no available liquidity on the settlement bank’s PM account. Guarantee fund account holders may be ASCBs, ASs or guarantors. Guarantee fund accounts are identified by the relevant accounts holder’s BIC.\n(5)\nWhen settlement procedure 6 is offered by an ASCB for interfaced models, SCBs shall open one or more sub-accounts in their TARGET2 component systems for settlement banks, to be used for dedicating liquidity and, if relevant, cross-system settlement. Sub-accounts shall be identified by the BIC of the PM account to which they relate, in combination with an account number that is specific to the relevant sub-account. The account number is composed of the country code plus up to 32 characters (depending on the relevant national bank account structure).\n(6)\nThe accounts referred to in subparagraph 1(a) to (d) shall not be published in the TARGET2 directory. If so requested by the participant, the relevant statements of accounts (MT 940 and MT 950) for all such accounts may be provided to the account holder at the end of every business day.\n(7)\nThe detailed rules on the opening of the account types mentioned in this paragraph and on their application while supporting the settlement procedures may be further specified in bilateral arrangements between the ASs and the ASCBs.\n9.   Settlement procedure 1 — Liquidity transfer\n(1)\nWhen offering settlement procedure 1, the ASCBs and SCBs shall support the liquidity transfer from a mirror account to a settlement bank’s PM account via the ASI. The liquidity transfer can be initiated either by the ancillary system or by the ASCB acting on the ancillary system’s behalf.\n(2)\nSettlement procedure 1 shall only be used for the integrated model where the relevant ancillary system has to use a mirror account, firstly to collect the necessary liquidity that has been dedicated by its settlement bank and, secondly, to transfer this liquidity back to the PM account of the settlement bank.\n(3)\nThe ASCBs may offer the settlement of payment instructions within certain time limits to be defined by the ancillary system, as referred to in paragraph 15(2) and (3).\n(4)\nThe settlement banks and ASs shall have access to information via the ICM. The ASs shall be notified on completion or failure of the settlement. If the ancillary system initiates the liquidity transfer from the mirror account to the settlement bank’s PM account, the settlement banks accessing TARGET2 via the network service provider shall be informed of the crediting via a SWIFT MT 202 message. Participants using internet-based access shall be informed by a message on the ICM.\n10.   Settlement procedure 2 — Real-time settlement\n(1)\nWhen offering settlement procedure 2, the ASCBs and SCBs shall support the settlement of the cash leg of ancillary system transactions by settling payment instructions submitted by the ancillary system on an individualised basis, rather than in batches. If a payment instruction to debit a short settlement bank’s PM account is queued in line with Annex II, the SCB concerned shall inform the settlement bank via an ICM broadcast message.\n(2)\nSettlement procedure 2 may also be offered to the ancillary system for the settlement of multilateral balances and in such cases the ASCB shall open a technical account for such ancillary system. Furthermore, the ASCB shall not offer the ancillary system the service of properly managing the sequence of incoming and outgoing payments as may be required for such multilateral settlement. The ancillary system itself shall assume responsibility for the necessary sequencing.\n(3)\nThe ASCB may offer the settlement of payment instructions within certain time limits to be defined by the ancillary system, as referred to in paragraph 15(2) and (3).\n(4)\nThe settlement banks and ASs shall have access to information via the ICM. The ASs shall be notified on completion or failure of the settlement by a message on the ICM. If they so request, settlement banks accessing TARGET2 via the network service provider shall be notified of the successful settlement via a SWIFT MT 900 or MT 910 message. Participants using internet-based access shall be informed by a message on the ICM.\n11.   Settlement procedure 3 — Bilateral settlement\n(1)\nWhen offering settlement procedure 3, the ASCBs and SCBs shall support settlement of the cash leg of ancillary system transactions by settling payment instructions which the ancillary system submits in batch mode. If a payment instruction to debit a short settlement bank’s PM account is queued in line with Annex II, the SCB concerned shall inform this settlement bank via an ICM broadcast message.\n(2)\nSettlement procedure 3 may also be offered to the ancillary system for the settlement of multilateral balances. Paragraph 10(2) shall apply mutatis mutandis, subject to the modifications that:\n(a)\npayment instructions: (i) to debit the short settlement banks’ PM accounts and credit the ancillary system’s technical account; and (ii) to debit the ancillary system’s technical account and credit the long settlement banks’ PM accounts are submitted in separate files; and\n(b)\nthe long settlement banks’ PM accounts shall be credited only after all short settlement banks’ PM accounts are debited.\n(3)\nIf multilateral settlement fails (for example, because not all collections from short settlement banks’ accounts are successful), the ancillary system shall submit payment instructions in order to reverse already settled debit transactions.\n(4)\nThe ASCBs may offer:\n(a)\nthe settlement of payment instructions within certain time limits defined by the ancillary system, as referred to in paragraph 15(3); and/or\n(b)\nthe ‘information period’ functionality, as referred to in paragraph 15(1).\n(5)\nThe settlement banks and ASs shall have access to information via the ICM. The ASs shall be notified on completion or failure of the settlement based on the selected option — single or global notification. If they so request, settlement banks shall be notified of the successful settlement via a SWIFT MT 900 or MT 910 message. Participants using internet-based access shall be informed by a message on the ICM.\n12.   Settlement procedure 4 — Standard multilateral settlement\n(1)\nWhen offering settlement procedure 4, the ASCBs and SCBs shall support the settlement of multilateral cash balances of ancillary system transactions by settling payment instructions submitted by the ancillary system in batch mode. The ASCBs shall open a specific technical account for such an ancillary system.\n(2)\nThe ASCBs and SCBs shall ensure the required sequencing of payment instructions. They shall only book credits if all debits have been collected successfully. Payment instructions: (a) to debit short settlement banks’ accounts and credit the ancillary system’s technical account; and (b) to credit long settlement banks’ accounts and debit the ancillary system’s technical account are submitted in a single file.\n(3)\nPayment instructions to debit the short settlement banks’ PM account and to credit the ancillary system’s technical account will be settled first; only upon settlement of all such payment instructions (including possible funding of the technical account by a guarantee fund mechanism), the PM accounts of the long settlement banks shall be credited.\n(4)\nIf a payment instruction to debit a short settlement bank’s PM account is queued in line with Annex II, the SCBs shall inform such settlement bank via an ICM broadcast message.\n(5)\nIf a short settlement bank has insufficient funds on its PM account, a guarantee fund mechanism shall be activated by the ASCB if that is provided for in the bilateral arrangement between the ASCB and the ancillary system.\n(6)\nIf no guarantee fund mechanism is provided for and the entire settlement fails, then the ASCBs and SCBs shall be deemed to have been instructed to return all payment instructions in the file and shall reverse payment instructions which have already been settled.\n(7)\nThe ASCBs shall inform settlement banks of a settlement failure via an ICM broadcast message.\n(8)\nThe ASCBs may offer:\n(a)\nthe settlement of payment instructions within certain time limits defined by the ancillary system, as referred to in paragraph 15(3);\n(b)\nthe ‘information period’ functionality, as referred to in paragraph 15(1);\n(c)\na guarantee fund mechanism, as referred to in paragraph 15(4).\n(9)\nThe settlement banks and ASs shall have access to information via the ICM. ASs shall be notified on completion or failure of the settlement. If they so request, settlement banks shall be notified of the successful settlement via a SWIFT MT 900 or MT 910 message. Participants using internet-based access shall be informed by a message on the ICM.\n13.   Settlement procedure 5 — Simultaneous multilateral settlement\n(1)\nWhen offering settlement procedure 5, the ASCBs and SCBs shall support the settlement of multilateral cash balances of ancillary system transactions by settling payment instructions submitted by the ancillary system. In order to settle relevant payment instructions Algorithm 4 shall be used (see Appendix I to Annex II). Unlike in settlement procedure 4, settlement procedure 5 operates on an ‘all-or-nothing’ basis. In this procedure the debiting of short settlement banks’ PM accounts and the crediting of long settlement banks’ PM accounts shall be done simultaneously (rather than sequentially, as in settlement procedure 4). Paragraph 12 shall apply mutatis mutandis subject to the following modification. If one or more of the payment instructions cannot be settled, all payment instructions shall be queued, and Algorithm 4, as described in paragraph 16(1), shall be repeated in order to settle the ancillary system’s payment instructions in the queue.\n(2)\nThe ASCBs may offer:\n(a)\nthe settlement of payment instructions within certain time limits defined by the ancillary system, as referred to in paragraph 15(3);\n(b)\nthe ‘information period’ functionality, as referred to in paragraph 15(1);\n(c)\na guarantee fund mechanism, as referred to in paragraph 15(4).\n(3)\nThe settlement banks and ASs shall have access to information via the ICM. The ASs shall be notified on completion or failure of the settlement. If they so request, settlement banks shall be notified of successful settlement via a SWIFT MT 900 or MT 910 message. Participants using internet-based access shall be informed by a message on the ICM.\n(4)\nIf a payment instruction to debit a short settlement bank’s PM account is queued in line with Annex II, the SCB concerned shall inform the settlement banks via an ICM broadcast message.\n14.   Settlement procedure 6 — Dedicated liquidity and cross-system settlement\n(1)\nSettlement procedure 6 can be used for both the interfaced and the integrated model, as described in subparagraphs 4 to 13 and 14 to 18 below, respectively. In the case of the integrated model, the relevant ancillary system has to use a mirror account to collect the necessary liquidity set aside by its settlement banks. In the case of the interfaced model, the settlement bank has to open at least one sub-account relating to a specific ancillary system.\n(2)\nIf they so request, the settlement banks shall be notified via a SWIFT MT 900 or MT 910 message and participants using internet-based access shall be informed by a message on the ICM of the crediting and debiting of their PM accounts and, if applicable, of their sub-accounts.\n(3)\nWhen offering cross-system settlement under settlement procedure 6, the ASCBs and SCBs shall support cross-system settlement payments, if they are initiated by the relevant ASs. An ancillary system can only initiate cross-system settlement during its processing cycle, and settlement procedure 6 has to be running in the ancillary system receiving the payment instruction. Cross-system settlement shall be offered for both daytime and night-time processing under settlement procedure 6. The possibility to execute cross-system settlement between two individual ASs shall be recorded in the Static Data (Management) Module.\n(A)   Interfaced model\n(4)\nWhen offering settlement procedure 6, the ASCBs and SCBs shall support the settlement of bilateral and/or multilateral cash balances of ancillary system transactions by:\n(a)\nenabling a settlement bank to pre-fund its prospective settlement obligation through liquidity transfers from its PM account into its sub-account (hereinafter ‘dedicated liquidity’) prior to the ancillary system processing; and\n(b)\nsettling the ancillary system’s payment instructions subsequent to the completion of the ancillary system processing: in relation to short settlement banks by debiting their sub-accounts (within the limits of the funds provided on such account) and crediting the ancillary system’s technical account and in relation to long settlement banks by crediting their sub-accounts and debiting the ancillary system’s technical account.\n(5)\nWhen offering settlement procedure 6:\n(a)\nthe SCBs shall open at least one sub-account in relation to a single ancillary system for each settlement bank; and\n(b)\nthe ASCB shall open a technical account for the ancillary system for: (i) crediting funds collected from the sub-accounts of the short settlement banks; and (ii) debiting funds when making credits to the dedicated sub-accounts of the long settlement banks.\n(6)\nSettlement procedure 6 shall be offered both for daytime processing and night-time operations of ASs. In the latter case, the new business day shall start immediately upon fulfilment of the minimum reserve requirements; any debit or credit made on the relevant accounts thereafter shall be for value of the new business day.\n(7)\nUnder settlement procedure 6 and with regard to dedicating liquidity, the ASCBs and SCBs shall offer the following types of liquidity transfer service into and from the sub-account:\n(a)\nstanding orders which settlement banks may submit or modify at any time during a business day via the ICM (when it is available). Standing orders submitted after the sending of the ‘start-of-procedure’ message on a given business day shall be valid only for the next business day. If there are several standing orders to credit different sub-accounts, they shall be settled in the order of their amount, starting with the highest. During night-time ancillary system operations, if there are standing orders for which there are insufficient funds on the PM account, such orders shall be settled following a pro-rata reduction of all orders;\n(b)\ncurrent orders, which may only be submitted either by a settlement bank (via the ICM) or the relevant ancillary system via an XML message during the running of settlement procedure 6 (identified by the time span from the ‘start-of-procedure’ to the ‘end-of-procedure’ message) and which will be settled only as long as the ancillary system processing cycle has not yet started. If there is a current order submitted by the ancillary system for which there are insufficient funds on the PM account, such order shall be partially settled;\n(c)\nSWIFT orders that go via an MT 202 message or by automatic mapping to an MT202 from the screens for participants using internet-based access, which may only be submitted during the running of settlement procedure 6 and only during daytime processing. Such orders shall be settled immediately.\n(8)\nSettlement procedure 6 shall start by means of a ‘start-of-procedure’ message and finish by means of an ‘end-of-procedure’ message, with both messages to be sent by the ancillary system. However, for night-time ancillary system operations, the ‘start-of-procedure’ message is sent by the ASCB. ‘Start-of-procedure’ messages shall trigger the settlement of standing orders for the transfer of liquidity into the sub-accounts. The ‘end-of-procedure’ message leads to an automatic retransfer of liquidity from the sub-account to the PM account.\n(9)\nUnder settlement procedure 6, dedicated liquidity on the sub-accounts shall be frozen as long as the ancillary system processing cycle is running (starting with a ‘start-of-cycle’ message and ending with an ‘end-of-cycle’ message, both to be sent by the ancillary system) and released thereafter. The frozen balance can be changed during the processing cycle as a result of cross-system settlement payments or if a settlement bank transfers liquidity from its PM account. The ASCB shall notify the ancillary system of the reduction or increase of liquidity on the sub-account as a result of cross-system settlement payments. If the ancillary system so requests, the ASCB shall also notify it of the increased liquidity on the sub-account as a result of liquidity transfer by the settlement bank.\n(10)\nWithin each ancillary system processing cycle, payment instructions shall be settled out of dedicated liquidity whereby Algorithm 5 (as referred to in Appendix I to Annex II) shall be used as a rule.\n(11)\nWithin each ancillary system processing cycle, a settlement bank’s dedicated liquidity can be increased by crediting certain incoming payments directly to its sub-accounts, i.e. coupons and redemption payments. In such cases, the liquidity first has to be credited on the technical account, then debited from such account before crediting the liquidity on the sub-account (or on the PM account).\n(12)\nCross-system settlement between two interfaced ASs can only be initiated by an ancillary system (or its ASCB on its behalf) whose participant’s sub-account is debited. The payment instruction is settled by debiting the amount indicated in the payment instruction from the sub-account of a participant of the ancillary system initiating the payment instruction and crediting the sub-account of a participant of another ancillary system.\nThe ancillary system initiating the payment instruction and the other ancillary system shall be notified on completion of the settlement. If they so request, settlement banks shall be notified of successful settlement via a SWIFT MT 900 or MT 910 message. Participants using internet-based access shall be informed by a message on the ICM.\n(13)\nCross-system settlement from an ancillary system using the interfaced model to an ancillary system using the integrated model can be initiated by the ancillary system using the interfaced model (or its ASCB on its behalf). The payment instruction is settled by debiting the amount indicated in the payment instruction from the sub-account of a participant of the ancillary system using the interfaced model and crediting the mirror account used by the ancillary system using the integrated model. The payment instruction cannot be initiated by the ancillary system using the integrated model whose mirror account will be credited.\nThe ancillary system initiating the payment instruction and the other ancillary system shall be notified on completion of the settlement. If they so request, settlement banks shall be notified of successful settlement via a SWIFT MT 900 or MT 910 message. Participants using internet-based access shall be informed by a message on the ICM.\n(B)   Integrated model\n(14)\nWhen offering settlement procedure 6 for integrated models, the ASCBs and SCBs shall support such settlement. In the event that settlement procedure 6 is used for the integrated model during daytime processing, only limited functionality is offered.\n(15)\nUnder settlement procedure 6 and with regard to the integrated model, the ASCBs and SCBs shall offer the following types of liquidity transfer service into a mirror account:\n(a)\nstanding orders (for daytime processing and for night-time ancillary system operations), which settlement banks may submit or modify at any time during a business day via the ICM (when it is available). Standing orders submitted after the sending of the ‘start-of-procedure’ message on a given business day shall be valid only for the next business day. If there are several standing orders, they shall be settled in the order of their amount, starting with the highest. If a standing order for daytime processing is not covered, it will be rejected. During night-time ancillary system operations, if there are standing orders for which there are insufficient funds on the PM account, such orders shall be settled following a pro-rata reduction of all orders;\n(b)\ncurrent orders, which may only be submitted either by a settlement bank (via the ICM) or the relevant ancillary system via an XML message during the running of settlement procedure 6 (identified by the time span from the ‘start-of-procedure’ to the ‘end-of-procedure’ message) and which will be settled only as long as the ancillary system processing cycle has not yet started. If there is a current order for which there are insufficient funds on the PM account, such order shall be partially settled;\n(c)\nSWIFT orders that go via an MT 202 message, which may only be submitted during daytime processing. Such orders shall be settled immediately.\n(16)\nThe rules regarding the ‘start-of-procedure’ and ‘end-of-procedure’ messages, as well as regarding the start and end of cycle for the interfaced model, shall apply mutatis mutandis.\n(17)\nCross-system settlement between two ASs using the integrated model can only be initiated by an ancillary system (or its ASCB on its behalf) whose mirror account is debited. The payment instruction is settled by debiting the amount indicated in the payment instruction from the mirror account used by the ancillary system initiating the payment instruction and crediting the mirror account used by another ancillary system. The payment instruction cannot be initiated by the ancillary system whose mirror account will be credited.\nThe ancillary system initiating the payment instruction and the other ancillary system shall be notified on completion of the settlement. If they so request, settlement banks shall be notified of successful settlement via a SWIFT MT 900 or MT 910 message. Participants using internet-based access shall be informed by a message on the ICM.\n(18)\nCross-system settlement from an ancillary system using the integrated model to an ancillary system using the interfaced model can be initiated by the ancillary system using the integrated model (or its ASCB on its behalf). The payment instruction is settled by debiting the amount indicated in the payment instruction from the mirror account used by the ancillary system using the integrated model and crediting the sub-account of a participant of another ancillary system. The payment instruction cannot be initiated by the ancillary system using the interfaced model whose participant’s sub-account will be credited.\nThe ancillary system initiating the payment instruction and the other ancillary system shall be notified on completion of the settlement. If they so request, settlement banks shall be notified of successful settlement via a SWIFT MT 900 or MT 910 message. Participants using internet-based access shall be informed by a message on the ICM.\n15.   Optional connected mechanisms\n(1)\nThe optional connected mechanism ‘information period’ may be offered by the ASCBs for settlement procedures 3, 4 and 5. If the ancillary system (or its ASCB on its behalf) has specified an optional ‘information period’ time, the settlement bank shall receive an ICM broadcast message indicating the time until which the settlement bank may request a reversal of the relevant payment instruction. Such request shall be taken into account by the SCB only if it is communicated via and approved by the ancillary system. The settlement shall start if the SCB does not receive such request until the ‘information period’ time has elapsed. Upon receipt by the SCB of such request within the ‘information period’:\n(a)\nwhen settlement procedure 3 is used for bilateral settlement, the relevant payment instruction shall be reversed; and\n(b)\nwhen settlement procedure 3 is used for the settlement of multilateral balances, or if in settlement procedure 4 the entire settlement fails, all payment instructions in the file shall be reversed and all settlement banks and the ancillary system shall be informed via an ICM broadcast message.\n(2)\nIf an ancillary system sends the settlement instructions before the scheduled settlement time (‘from’), the instructions are stored until the scheduled time is reached. In this case, the payment instructions are only submitted to the entry disposition when the ‘from’ time is reached. This optional mechanism can be used in settlement procedures 1 and 2.\n(3)\nThe settlement period (till) makes it possible to allocate a limited period of time for ancillary system settlement in order not to prevent or delay the settlement of other ancillary system-related or TARGET2 transactions. If any payment instruction is not settled until the ‘till’ time is reached or within the defined settlement period, these payment instructions are either returned or, in the case of settlement procedures 4 and 5, the guarantee fund mechanism may be activated. The settlement period (till) can be specified for settlement procedures 1 to 5.\n(4)\nThe guarantee fund mechanism may be used if a settlement bank’s liquidity is insufficient to cover its obligations stemming from ancillary system settlement. In order to allow the settlement of all payment instructions involved in an ancillary system settlement, this mechanism is used to provide the complementary liquidity needed. This mechanism may be used for settlement procedures 4 and 5. If the guarantee fund mechanism is to be used, it is necessary to maintain a special guarantee fund account where ‘emergency liquidity’ is available or made available on demand.\n16.   Algorithms used\n(1)\nAlgorithm 4 supports settlement procedure 5. To facilitate settlement and to reduce the liquidity needed, all ancillary system payment instructions are included (regardless of their priority). Ancillary system payment instructions to be settled following settlement procedure 5 bypass the entry disposition and are kept in the PM separately until the end of the current optimisation process. In the same run of Algorithm 4, several ASs using settlement procedure 5 will be included if they intend to settle at the same time.\n(2)\nIn settlement procedure 6, the settlement bank can dedicate a liquidity amount to settle balances coming from a specific ancillary system. Dedication is brought about by setting aside the necessary liquidity on a specific sub-account (interfaced model). Algorithm 5 is used both for night-time ancillary system operations and daytime processing. The settlement process takes place by means of debiting the short settlement banks’ sub-accounts in favour of the ancillary system technical account and then debiting the ancillary system technical account in favour of the long settlement banks’ sub-accounts. In the case of credit balances the booking can take place directly — if indicated by the ancillary system within the relevant transaction — on the settlement bank’s PM account. If the settlement of one or more debit instructions is unsuccessful, i.e. as the result of an ancillary system’s error, the payment concerned is queued on the sub-account. Settlement procedure 6 can make use of Algorithm 5 running on sub-accounts. Furthermore, Algorithm 5 does not have to take account of any limits or reservations. For every settlement bank the total position is calculated and if all total positions are covered, all transactions will be settled. Transactions which are not covered are put back into the queue.\n17.   Effect of suspension or termination\nIf suspension or termination of the use of the ASI by an ancillary system takes effect during the settlement cycle of ancillary system payment instructions, the ASCB shall be deemed to be authorised to complete the settlement cycle on behalf of the ancillary system.\n18.   Fee schedule and invoicing\n(1)\nAn ancillary system using the ASI or the Participant Interface, irrespective of the number of any accounts it may hold with the ASCB and/or the SCB, shall be subject to a fee schedule consisting of three elements, as set out below.\n(a)\nA fixed monthly fee of EUR 1 000 to be charged to each ancillary system (Fixed Fee I).\n(b)\nA second monthly fixed fee of between EUR 417 and EUR 4 167, in proportion to the underlying gross value of the ancillary system’s euro cash settlement transactions (Fixed Fee II):\nBand\nFrom (EUR million/day)\nTo (EUR million/day)\nAnnual fee (EUR)\nMonthly fee (EUR)\n1\n0\nbelow 1 000\n5 000\n417\n2\n1 000\nbelow 2 500\n10 000\n833\n3\n2 500\nbelow 5 000\n20 000\n1 667\n4\n5 000\nbelow 10 000\n30 000\n2 500\n5\n10 000\nbelow 50 000\n40 000\n3 333\n6\nAbove 50 000\n—\n50 000\n4 167\nThe gross value of the ancillary system’s euro cash settlement transactions shall be calculated by the ASCB once a year on the basis of such gross value during the previous year and the calculated gross value shall be applied for calculating the fee as from 1 January of each calendar year.\n(c)\nA transaction fee calculated on the same basis as the schedule established for TARGET2 participants in Appendix VI to Annex II. The ancillary system may choose one of the two options: either to pay a flat EUR 0,80 fee per payment instruction (Option A) or to pay a fee calculated on a degressive basis (Option B), subject to the following modifications:\n(i)\nfor Option B, the limits of the bands relating to volume of payment instructions are divided by two; and\n(ii)\na monthly fixed fee of EUR 150 (under Option A) or EUR 1 875 (under Option B) shall be charged in addition to Fixed Fee I and Fixed Fee II.\n(2)\nAny fee payable in relation to a payment instruction submitted or payment received by an ancillary system, via either the Participant Interface or the ASI, shall be exclusively charged to this ancillary system. The Governing Council may establish more detailed rules for the determination of billable transactions settled via the ASI.\n(3)\nEach ancillary system shall receive an invoice from its respective ASCB for the previous month based on the fees referred to in subparagraph 1, no later than the fifth business day of the following month. Payments shall be made no later than the 10th business day of this month to the account specified by the ASCB or shall be debited from an account specified by the ancillary system.\n(4)\nFor the purposes of this paragraph, each ancillary system that has been designated under Directive 98/26/EC shall be treated separately, even if two or more of them are operated by the same legal entity. The same rule shall apply to the ASs that have not been designated under Directive 98/26/EC, in which case the ASs shall be identified by reference to the following criteria: (a) a formal arrangement, based on a contractual or legislative instrument, e.g. an agreement among the participants and the system operator; (b) with multiple membership; (c) common rules and standardised arrangements; and (d) for the clearing, netting and/or settlement of payments and/or securities between the participants.\nANNEX V\nSUPPLEMENTAL AND MODIFIED HARMONISED CONDITIONS FOR PARTICIPATION IN TARGET2 USING INTERNET-BASED ACCESS\nArticle 1\nScope\nThe Conditions set out in Annex II apply to participants using internet-based access to access one or more PM accounts subject to the provisions of this Annex.\nArticle 2\nDefinitions\nFor the purposes of this Annex, in addition to the definitions laid down in Annex II, the following definitions apply:\n(1)\n‘certification authorities’ means one or more NCBs designated as such by the Governing Council to act on behalf of the Eurosystem to issue, manage, revoke and renew electronic certificates;\n(2)\n‘electronic certificates’ or ‘certificates’ means an electronic file, issued by the certification authorities, that binds a public key with an identity and which is used for the following: to verify that a public key belongs to an individual, to authenticate the holder, to check a signature from this individual or to encrypt a message addressed to this individual. Certificates are held on a physical device such as a smart card or USB stick, and references to certificates include such physical devices. The certificates are instrumental in the authentication process of the participants accessing TARGET2 through the internet and submitting payment messages or control messages;\n(3)\n‘certificate holder’ means a named, individual person, identified and designated by a TARGET2 participant as authorised to have internet-based access to the participant’s TARGET2 account. Their application for certificates will have been verified by the participant’s home NCB and transmitted to the certification authorities, which will in turn have delivered certificates binding the public key with the credentials that identify the participant;\n(4)\n‘Internet-based access’ means that the participant has opted for a PM account that can only be accessed via the internet and the participant submits payment messages or control messages to TARGET2 by means of the internet;\n(5)\n‘Internet service provider’ means the company or organisation, i.e. the gateway, used by the TARGET2 participant for the purpose of accessing their TARGET2 account using internet-based access.\nArticle 3\nInapplicable provisions\nThe following provisions of Annex II shall not apply with regard to internet-based access:\nArticle 4(1)(c) and (2)(d); Article 5(2), (3) and (4); Articles 6 and 7; Article 11(8); Article 14(1)(a); Article 17(2); Articles 23 to 26; Article 41; and Appendices I, VI and VII.\nArticle 4\nSupplemental and modified provisions\nThe following provisions of Annex II shall apply with regard to internet-based access as modified below:\n(1)\nArticle 2(1) is replaced by the following:\n‘1.

Limits may only be set in relation to an AL group in its entirety. Limits shall not be set in relation to a single PM account of an AL group member.’.\n(12)\nArticle 18(3) is replaced by the following:\n‘3.   When the Latest Debit Time Indicator is used, the accepted payment order shall be returned as non-settled if it cannot be settled by the indicated debit time. 15 minutes prior to the defined debit time, the instructing participant shall be informed via the ICM, rather than sent an automatic notification via the ICM. Instructing participant may also use the Latest Debit Time Indicator solely as a warning indicator. In such cases, the payment order concerned shall not be returned.’.\n(13)\nArticle 21(4) is replaced by the following:\n‘4.   At the request of a payer, the [insert name of CB] may decide to change the queue position of a highly urgent payment order (except for highly urgent payment orders in the context of settlement procedures 5 and 6) provided that this change would not affect the smooth settlement by ancillary systems in TARGET2 or would not otherwise give rise to systemic risk.’.\n(14)\nArticle 28 is modified as follows:\n(a)\nparagraph 1 is replaced by the following:\n‘1.   Participants using internet-based access shall implement adequate security controls, in particular those specified in Appendix IA to Annex V, to protect their systems from unauthorised access and use. Participants shall be exclusively responsible for the adequate protection of the confidentiality, integrity and availability of their systems.’; and\n(b)\nthe following paragraph 4 is added:\n‘4.   Participants using internet-based access shall inform [insert name of CB] immediately of any event that may affect the validity of the certificates, in particular those events specified in Appendix IA to Annex V, including, without limitation, any loss or improper use.’.\n(15)\nArticle 29 is replaced by the following:\n‘Article 29\nUse of the ICM\n1.   The ICM:\n(a)\nallows participants to input payments;\n(b)\nallows participants to access information relating to their accounts and to manage liquidity;\n(c)\nmay be used to initiate liquidity transfer orders; and\n(d)\nallows participants to access system messages.\n2.   Further technical details relating to the ICM to be used in connection with internet-based access are contained in Appendix IA to Annex V.’.\n(16)\nArticle 32 is modified as follows:\n(a)\nparagraph 1 is replaced with the following:\n‘1.   Unless otherwise provided in these Conditions, all payment and payment processing-related messages in relation to TARGET2, such as confirmations of debits or credits, or statement messages, between the [insert name of CB] and participants shall be made available for the participant on the ICM.’; and\n(b)\nparagraph 3 is replaced by the following:\n‘3.   If a participant’s connection fails, the participant shall use the alternative means of transmission of messages laid down in Appendix IV to Annex II. In such cases, the saved or printed version of the message produced by the [insert name of CB] shall be accepted as evidence.’.\n(17)\nArticle 34(4)(c) is replaced by the following:\n‘(c)\nOnce such an ICM broadcast message has been made available to participants using internet-based access, those participants shall be deemed informed of the termination/- suspension of a participant’s participation in TARGET2-[insert CB/country reference] or another TARGET2 component system. The participants shall bear any losses arising from the submission of a payment order to participants whose participation has been suspended or terminated if such payment order was entered into TARGET2-[insert CB/country reference] after the ICM broadcast message was made available.’.\n(18)\nArticle 39(1) is replaced by the following:\n‘1.   Participants shall be deemed to be aware of, and shall comply with, all obligations on them relating to legislation on data protection, prevention of money laundering and the financing of terrorism, proliferation-sensitive nuclear activities and the development of nuclear weapons delivery systems, in particular in terms of implementing appropriate measures concerning any payments debited or credited on their PM accounts. Prior to entering into a contractual relationship with an internet service provider, participants using internet-based access shall acquaint themselves with that internet service provider’s data retrieval policy.’.\n(19)\nArticle 40(1) is replaced by the following:\n‘1.   Except where otherwise provided for in these Conditions, all notices required or permitted pursuant to these Conditions shall be sent by registered post, facsimile or otherwise in writing. Notices to the [insert name of CB] shall be submitted to the head of the [insert payment systems department or relevant CB unit] of [insert name of CB], [include relevant address of CB] or to the [insert BIC address of the CB]. Notices to the participant shall be sent to it at the address, fax number or its BIC address as the participant may from time to time notify to the [insert name of CB].’.\n(20)\nArticle 45 is replaced by the following:\n‘Article 45\nSeverability\nIf any provision in these Conditions or Annex V is or becomes invalid, this shall not prejudice the applicability of all the other provisions of these Conditions or Annex V.’.\nAppendix IA\nTECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS FOR THE PROCESSING OF PAYMENT ORDERS FOR INTERNET-BASED ACCESS\nIn addition to the Conditions, the following rules shall apply to the processing of payment orders using internet-based access:\n1.   Technical requirements for participation in TARGET2-[insert CB/country reference] regarding infrastructure, network and formats\n(1)\nEach participant using internet-based access must connect to the ICM of TARGET2 using a local client, operating system and internet browser as specified in the Annex ‘Internet-based participation — System requirements for internet access’ to the User Detailed Functional Specifications (UDFS), with settings defined. Each participant’s PM account shall be identified by an eight- or 11-digit BIC. Furthermore, each participant shall pass a series of tests to prove its technical and operational competence before it may participate in TARGET2-[insert CB/country reference].\n(2)\nFor the submission of payment orders and the exchange of payment messages in the PM the TARGET2 platform BIC, TRGTXEPMLVP, will be used as the message sender/receiver. Payment orders sent to a participant using internet-based access should identify that receiving participant in the beneficiary institution field. Payment orders made by a participant using internet-based access will identify that participant as the ordering institution.\n(3)\nParticipants using internet-based access shall use public key infrastructure services as specified in the ‘User Manual: internet Access for the public-key certification service’.\n2.   Payment message types\n(1)\nInternet-based participants can make the following types of payments:\n(a)\ncustomer payments, i.e. credit transfers for which the ordering and/or beneficiary customer are not financial institutions;\n(b)\ncustomer payments STP, i.e. credit transfers for which the ordering and/or beneficiary customer are not financial institutions, executed in straight through processing mode;\n(c)\nbank-to-bank transfers to request the movement of funds between financial institutions;\n(d)\ncover payments to request the movement of funds between financial institutions related to an underlying customer credit transfer.\nIn addition, participants using internet-based access to a PM account can receive direct debit orders.\n(2)\nParticipants shall comply with the field specifications, as defined in Chapter 9.1.2.2 of the UDFS, Book 1.\n(3)\nField contents shall be validated at the level of TARGET2-[insert country/CB reference] in accordance with the UDFS requirements. Participants may agree among each other on specific rules regarding the field contents. However, in TARGET2-[insert country/CB reference] there shall be no specific checks as to whether participants comply with any such rules.\n(4)\nParticipants using internet-based access may make cover payments via TARGET2, i.e. payments made by correspondent banks to settle (cover) credit transfer messages which are submitted to a customer’s bank by other, more direct means. Customer details contained in these cover payments shall not be displayed in the ICM.\n3.   Double-entry check\n(1)\nAll payment orders shall pass a double-entry check, the aim of which is to reject payment orders that have been submitted more than once by mistake.\n(2)\nThe following fields of the message types shall be checked:\nDetails\nPart of the message\nField\nSender\nBasic Header\nBIC Address\nMessage Type\nApplication Header\nMessage Type\nReceiver\nApplication Header\nDestination Address\nTransaction Reference Number (TRN)\nText Block\n:20\nRelated Reference\nText Block\n:21\nValue Date\nText Block\n:32\nAmount\nText Block\n:32\n(3)\nIf all the fields described in subparagraph 2 in relation to a newly submitted payment order are identical to those in relation to a payment order that has already been accepted, the newly submitted payment order shall be returned.\n4.   Error codes\nIf a payment order is rejected, an abort notification shall be provided via the ICM indicating the reason for the rejection by using error codes. The error codes are defined in Chapter 9.4.2 of the UDFS.\n5.   Predetermined settlement times\n(1)\nFor payment orders using the Earliest Debit Time Indicator, the codeword ‘/FROTIME/’ shall be used.\n(2)\nFor payment orders using the Latest Debit Time Indicator, two options shall be available.\n(a)\nCodeword ‘/REJTIME/’: if the payment order cannot be settled by the indicated debit time, the payment order shall be returned.\n(b)\nCodeword ‘/TILTIME/’: if the payment order cannot be settled by the indicated debit time, the payment order shall not be returned but shall be kept in the relevant queue.\nUnder both options, if a payment order with a Latest Debit Time Indicator is not settled 15 minutes prior to the time indicated therein, a notification shall automatically be provided via the ICM.\n(3)\nIf the codeword ‘/CLSTIME/’ is used, the payment shall be treated in the same way as a payment order referred to in subparagraph 2(b).\n6.   Settlement of payment orders in the entry disposition\n(1)\nOffsetting checks and, if appropriate, extended offsetting checks (both terms as defined in paragraphs 2 and 3) shall be carried out on payment orders entered into the entry disposition to provide quick, liquidity-saving gross settlement of payment orders.\n(2)\nAn offsetting check shall determine whether the payee’s payment orders that are at the front of the highly urgent or, if inapplicable, the urgent queue are available to be offset against the payer’s payment order (hereinafter ‘offsetting payment orders’). If an offsetting payment order does not provide sufficient funds for the respective payer’s payment order in the entry disposition, it shall be determined whether there is sufficient available liquidity on the payer’s PM account.\n(3)\nIf the offsetting check fails, the [insert name of CB] may apply an extended offsetting check. An extended offsetting check determines whether offsetting payment orders are available in any of the payee’s queues regardless of when they joined the queue. However, if in the queue of the payee there are higher priority payment orders addressed to other TARGET2 participants, the FIFO principle may only be breached if settling such an offsetting payment order would result in a liquidity increase for the payee.\n7.   Settlement of payment orders in the queue\n(1)\nThe treatment of payment orders placed in queues depends on the priority class to which it was designated by the instructing participant.\n(2)\nPayment orders in the highly urgent and urgent queues shall be settled by using the offsetting checks described in paragraph 6, starting with the payment order at the front of the queue in cases where there is an increase in liquidity or there is an intervention at queue level (change of queue position, settlement time or priority, or revocation of the payment order).\n(3)\nPayments orders in the normal queue shall be settled on a continuous basis including all highly urgent and urgent payment orders that have not yet been settled. Different optimisation mechanisms (algorithms) are used. If an algorithm is successful, the included payment orders will be settled; if an algorithm fails, the included payment orders will remain in the queue. Three algorithms (1 to 3) shall be applied to offset payment flows. By means of Algorithm 4, settlement procedure 5 (as defined in Chapter 2.8.1 of the UDFS) shall be available for the settlement of payment instructions of ancillary systems. To optimise the settlement of highly urgent ancillary system transactions on participants’ sub-accounts, a special algorithm (Algorithm 5) shall be used.\n(a)\nUnder Algorithm 1 (‘all-or-nothing’) the [insert name of CB] shall, both for each relationship in respect of which a bilateral limit has been set and also for the total sum of relationships for which a multilateral limit has been set:\n(i)\ncalculate the overall liquidity position of each TARGET2 participants’ PM account by establishing whether the aggregate of all outgoing and incoming payment orders pending in the queue is negative or positive and, if it is negative, check whether it exceeds that participant’s available liquidity (the overall liquidity position shall constitute the ‘total liquidity position’); and\n(ii)\ncheck whether limits and reservations set by each TARGET2 participant in relation to each relevant PM account are respected.\nIf the outcome of these calculations and checks is positive for each relevant PM account, the [insert name of CB] and other CBs involved shall settle all payments simultaneously on the PM accounts of the TARGET2 participants concerned.\n(b)\nUnder Algorithm 2 (‘partial’) the [insert name of CB] shall:\n(i)\ncalculate and check the liquidity positions, limits and reservations of each relevant PM account as under Algorithm 1; and\n(ii)\nif the total liquidity position of one or more relevant PM accounts is negative, extract single payment orders until the total liquidity position of each relevant PM account is positive.\nThereafter, the [insert name of CB] and the other CBs involved shall, provided there are sufficient funds, settle all remaining payments (except the extracted payment orders) simultaneously on the PM accounts of the TARGET2 participants concerned.\nWhen extracting payment orders, the [insert name of CB] shall start from the TARGET2 participants’ PM account with the highest negative total liquidity position and from the payment order at the end of the queue with the lowest priority. The selection process shall only run for a short time, to be determined by the [insert name of CB] at its discretion.\n(c)\nUnder Algorithm 3 (‘multiple’) the [insert name of CB] shall:\n(i)\ncompare pairs of TARGET2 participants’ PM accounts to determine whether queued payment orders can be settled within the available liquidity of the two TARGET2 participants’ PM accounts concerned and within the limits set by them (by starting from the pair of PM accounts with the smallest difference between the payment orders addressed to each other), and the CBs involved shall book those payments simultaneously on the two TARGET2 participants’ PM accounts; and\n(ii)\nif, in relation to a pair of PM accounts as described under point (i), liquidity is insufficient to fund the bilateral position, extract single payment orders until there is sufficient liquidity. In this case the CBs involved shall settle the remaining payments, except the extracted ones, simultaneously on the two TARGET2 participants’ PM accounts.\nAfter performing the checks specified under subparagraphs (i) to (ii), the [insert name of CB] shall check the multilateral settlement positions (between a participant’s PM account and other TARGET2 participants’ PM accounts in relation to which a multi-lateral limit has been set). For this purpose, the procedure described under subparagraphs (i) to (ii) shall apply mutatis mutandis.\n(d)\nUnder Algorithm 4 (‘partial plus ancillary system settlement’) the [insert name of CB] shall follow the same procedure as for Algorithm 2, but without extracting payment orders in relation to the settlement of an ancillary system (which settles on a simultaneous multilateral basis).\n(e)\nUnder Algorithm 5 (‘ancillary system settlement via sub-accounts’) the [insert name of CB] shall follow the same procedure as for Algorithm 1, subject to the modification that the [insert name of CB] shall start Algorithm 5 via the Ancillary System Interface and shall only check whether sufficient funds are available on participants’ sub-accounts. Moreover, no limits and reservations shall be taken into account. Algorithm 5 shall also run during night-time settlement.\n(4)\nPayment orders entered into the entry disposition after the start of any of Algorithms 1 to 4 may nevertheless be settled immediately in the entry disposition if the positions and limits of the TARGET2 participants’ PM accounts concerned are compatible with both the settlement of these payment orders and the settlement of payment orders in the current optimisation procedure. However, two algorithms shall not run simultaneously.\n(5)\nDuring daytime processing the algorithms shall run sequentially. As long as there is no pending simultaneous multilateral settlement of an ancillary system, the sequence shall be as follows:\n(a)\nAlgorithm 1;\n(b)\nif Algorithm 1 fails, then Algorithm 2;\n(c)\nif Algorithm 2 fails, then Algorithm 3, or if Algorithm 2 succeeds, repeat Algorithm 1.\nWhen simultaneous multilateral settlement (‘procedure 5’) in relation to an ancillary system is pending, Algorithm 4 shall run.\n(6)\nThe algorithms shall run flexibly by setting a pre-defined time lag between the application of different algorithms to ensure a minimum interval between the running of two algorithms. The time sequence shall be automatically controlled. Manual intervention shall be possible.\n(7)\nWhile included in a running algorithm, a payment order shall not be reordered (change of the position in a queue) or revoked. Requests for reordering or revocation of a payment order shall be queued until the algorithm is complete. If the payment order concerned is settled while the algorithm is running, any request to reorder or revoke shall be rejected. If the payment order is not settled, the participant’s requests shall be taken into account immediately.\n8.   Use of the ICM\n(1)\nThe ICM may be used for inputting payment orders.\n(2)\nThe ICM may be used for obtaining information and managing liquidity.\n(3)\nWith the exception of warehoused payment orders and static data information, only data in relation to the current business day shall be available via the ICM. The screens shall be offered in English only.\n(4)\nInformation shall be provided in ‘pull’ mode, which means that each participant has to ask to be provided with information. Participants shall check the ICM regularly throughout the business day for important messages.\n(5)\nOnly user-to-application mode (U2A) shall be available for participants using internet-based access. U2A permits direct communication between a participant and the ICM. The information is displayed in a browser running on a PC. Further details are described in the ICM User Handbook.\n(6)\nEach participant shall have at least one workstation with internet access to access the ICM via U2A.\n(7)\nAccess rights to the ICM shall be granted by using certificates, the use of which is described more fully in paragraphs 10 to 13.\n(8)\nParticipants may also use the ICM to transfer liquidity:\n(a)\n[insert if applicable] from their PM account to their account outside the PM;\n(b)\nbetween the PM account and the participant’s sub-accounts; and\n(c)\nfrom the PM account to the mirror account managed by the ancillary system.\n9.   The UDFS, the ICM User Handbook and the ‘User Manual: internet Access for the Public Key Certification Service’\nFurther details and examples explaining the above rules are contained in the UDFS and the ICM User Handbook, as amended from time to time and published on the [insert name of CB]’s website and the TARGET2 website in English, and in the ‘User Manual: internet Access for the Public Key Certification Service’.\n10.   Issuance, suspension, reactivation, revocation and renewal of certificates\n(1)\nThe participant shall request from [insert name of CB] the issuance of certificates to allow them to access TARGET2 [insert CB/country reference] using internet-based access.\n(2)\nThe participant shall request from [insert name of CB] the suspension and reactivation of certificates, as well as the revocation and renewal of certificates, when a certificate holder no longer wishes to have access to TARGET2 or if the participant ceases its activities in TARGET2-[insert CB/country reference], e.g. as the result of a merger or acquisition.\n(3)\nThe participant shall adopt every precaution and organisational measure to ensure that certificates are used only in conformity with the Harmonised Conditions.\n(4)\nThe participant shall promptly notify [insert name of CB] of any material change to any of the information contained in the forms submitted to [insert name of CB] in connection with the issuance of certificates.\n11.   Handling of certificates by the participant\n(1)\nThe participant shall ensure the safekeeping of all certificates and adopt robust organisational and technical measures to avoid injury to third parties and to ensure that each certificate is only used by the specific certificate holder to which it was issued.\n(2)\nThe participant shall promptly provide all information requested by [insert name of CB] and guarantee the reliability of that information. Participants shall at all times remain fully responsible for the continued accuracy of all information provided to [insert name of CB] in connection with the issuance of certificates.\n(3)\nThe participant shall assume full responsibility for ensuring that all of its certificate holders keep their assigned certificates separate from the secret PIN and PUK codes.\n(4)\nThe participant shall assume full responsibility for ensuring that none of its certificate holders use the certificates for functions or purposes other than those for which the certificates were issued.\n(5)\nThe participant shall immediately inform [insert name of CB] of any request and rationale for suspension, reactivation, revocation or renewal of certificates.\n(6)\nThe participant shall immediately request [insert name of CB] to suspend any certificates, or the keys contained therein, that are defective or that are no longer in the possession of its certificate holders.\n(7)\nThe participant shall immediately notify the [insert name of CB] of any loss or theft of certificates.\n12.   Security requirements\n(1)\nThe computer system that a participant uses to access TARGET2 using internet-based access shall be located in premises owned or leased by the participant. Access to TARGET2-[insert CB/country reference] shall only be allowed from such premises, and, for the avoidance of doubt, no remote access shall be allowed.\n(2)\nThe participant shall run all software on computer systems that are installed and customised in accordance with current international IT security standards, which as a minimum shall include the requirements detailed in paragraph 12(3) and paragraph 13(4). The participant shall establish appropriate measures, including in particular anti-virus and malware protection, anti-phishing measures, hardening, and patch management procedures. All such measures and procedures shall be regularly updated by the participant.\n(3)\nThe participant shall establish an encrypted communication link with TARGET2-[insert CB/country reference] for internet access.\n(4)\nUser computer accounts in the participant’s workstations shall not have administrative privileges. Privileges shall be assigned in accordance with the ‘least privilege’ principle.\n(5)\nThe participant shall at all times protect the computer systems used for TARGET2-[insert CB/country reference] internet access as follows:\n(a)\nThey shall protect the computer systems and workstations from unauthorised physical and network access, at all times using a firewall to shield the computer systems and workstations from incoming internet traffic, and the workstations from unauthorised access over the internal network. They shall use a firewall that protects against incoming traffic, as well as a firewall on work-stations that ensures that only authorised programs communicate with the outside.\n(b)\nParticipants shall only be permitted to install on workstations the software that is necessary to access TARGET2 and that is authorised under the participant’s internal security policy.\n(c)\nParticipants shall at all times ensure that all software applications that run on the workstations are regularly updated and patched with the latest version. This applies in particular in respect of the operating system, the internet browser and plug-ins.\n(d)\nParticipants shall at all times restrict outgoing traffic from the workstations to business-critical sites, as well as to sites required for legitimate and reasonable software updates.\n(e)\nParticipants shall ensure that all critical internal flows to or from the workstations are protected against disclosure and malicious changes, especially if files are transferred through a network.\n(6)\nThe participant shall ensure that its certificate holders at all times follow secure browsing practices, including:\n(a)\nreserving certain workstations to access sites of the same criticality level and only accessing those sites from those workstations;\n(b)\nalways restarting the browser session before and after accessing TARGET2-[insert CB/country reference] internet access;\n(c)\nverifying any server’s SSL certificate authenticity at each logon to TARGET2-[insert CB/country reference] internet access;\n(d)\nbeing suspicious of e-mails that appear to come from TARGET2-[insert CB/country reference], and never providing the certificate’s password if asked for that password, as TARGET2-[insert CB/country reference] will never ask for a certificate’s password in an e-mail or otherwise.\n(7)\nThe participant shall at all times implement the following management principles to alleviate risks to its system:\n(a)\nestablishing user management practices which ensure that only authorised users are created and remain on the system and maintaining an accurate and up-to-date list of authorised users;\n(b)\nreconciling daily payment traffic to detect mismatches between authorised and actual daily payment traffic, both sent and received;\n(c)\nensuring that a certificate holder does not simultaneously browse any other internet site at the same time as it accesses TARGET2-[insert CB/country reference].\n13.   Additional security requirements\n(1)\nThe participant shall at all times ensure by means of appropriate organisational and/or technical measures that user IDs disclosed for the purpose of controlling access rights (Access Right Review) are not abused, and, in particular, that no unauthorised persons gain knowledge of them.\n(2)\nThe participant shall have in place a user administration process to ensure the immediate and permanent deletion of the related user ID in the event that an employee or other user of a system on the premises of a participant leaves the participant’s organisation.\n(3)\nThe participant shall have in place a user administration process and shall immediately and permanently block user IDs that are in any way compromised, including in cases where certificates are lost or stolen, or where a password has been phished.\n(4)\nIf a participant is unable to eliminate security-related faults or configuration errors, e.g. resulting from malware infected systems, after three occurrences, the SSP-providing NCBs may permanently block all the participant’s user IDs.\nAppendix IIA\nFEE SCHEDULE AND INVOICING FOR INTERNET-BASED ACCESS\nFees for direct participants\n1.\nThe monthly fee for the processing of payment orders in TARGET2-[insert CB/country reference] for direct participants shall be EUR 70 per PM account internet access fee plus EUR 150 per PM account plus a flat fee per transaction (debit entry) of EUR 0,80;\n2.\nThere shall be an additional monthly fee for direct participants who do not wish the BIC of their account to be published in the TARGET2 directory of EUR 30 per account.\n3.\nThe [insert name of CB] shall issue and maintain up to five active certificates per participant for each PM account free of charge. The [insert name of CB] shall charge a fee of EUR 50 for the issuance of each additional subsequent active certificate. The [insert name of CB] shall charge an annual maintenance fee of EUR 11 per each additional subsequent active certificate. Active certificates shall be valid for three years.\nInvoicing\n4.\nIn the case of direct participants, the following invoicing rules apply. The direct participant shall receive the invoice for the previous month specifying the fees to be paid, no later than on the fifth business day of the following month. Payment shall be made at the latest on the 10th working day of that month to the account specified by the [insert name of CB] and shall be debited from that participant’s PM account.\nANNEX VI\nREPEALED GUIDELINE WITH ITS SUCCESSIVE AMENDMENTS\nGuideline ECB/2007/2 (OJ L 237, 8.9.2007, p. 1).\nGuideline ECB/2009/9 (OJ L 123, 19.5.2009, p. 94).\nGuideline ECB/2009/21 (OJ L 260, 3.10.2009, p. 31).\nGuideline ECB/2010/12 (OJ L 261, 5.10.2010, p. 6).\nGuideline ECB/2011/2 (OJ L 86, 1.4.2011, p. 75).\nGuideline ECB/2011/15 (OJ L 279, 26.10.2011, p. 5).\nANNEX VII\nCORRELATION TABLE\nGuideline ECB/2007/2\nThis Guideline\nArticles 1-4\nArticles 1-4\n—\nArticles 5-6\nArticle 5\nArticle 7\nArticle 6\nArticle 8\n—\nArticles 9-11\nArticle 7\nArticle 12\nArticle 8\nArticle 13\nArticle 9\nArticle 14\nArticle 10\nArticle 15\nArticle 11\nArticle 16\n—\nArticles 17-24\nArticle 12\nArticle 25\nArticle 14\nArticle 26\nArticle 15\nArticle 27\nArticle 16\nArticle 28\nAnnexes I-V\nAnnexes I-V", "summary": "ECB Guideline on TARGET2\nECB Guideline on TARGET2\nSUMMARY OF:\nGuideline of the European Central Bank 2013/47/EU on a trans-European automated real-time gross settlement express transfer system (TARGET2) (ECB/2012/27)\nWHAT IS THE AIM OF THE GUIDELINE?\n              \nIt regulates the trans-European automated real-time gross settement express transfer (TARGET2) real-time gross settlement (RTGS) system. TARGET2 is a payment system that enables EU banks to transfer money between each other in real time. Central and commercial banks can submit payment orders in euro to TARGET2 where they are processed and settled in money held in an account with a central bank.\nTARGET2 aims to:\nsupport the implementation of the Eurosystem’s monetary policy and the functioning of the euro money market;\nminimise systemic risk in the payment market, i.e. the possibility of a single actor causing an entire market to collapse;\nensure the efficient processing of cross-border payments in euro.\nKEY POINTS\n              \nTARGET2 is owned and managed by the Eurosystem. Each central bank in the Eurosystem operates its own TARGET2 component.\nCentral banks in non-euro-area countries may participate and settle euro transactions via the platform and comply with the guideline to that effect.\nOther financial institutions can participate in TARGET2 via a participating central bank through:\ndirect participation (being in the European Economic Area (EEA) and sending and receiving payments on their own or their customers’ behalf);\nindirect participation (in the EEA and channelling payments via a direct participant in TARGET2);\nmulti-addressee access (branches and subsidiaries of a direct participant in the EEA authorised to process payments through its account);\naddressable BIC, a correspondent of a direct participant that holds a Bank Identifier Code (BIC), irrespective of its place of establishment.\nManagement of TARGET2 is based on three levels of governance.\nLevel 1: the ECB’s Governing Council is responsible for overall direction, management and control of TARGET2, including common cost and pricing methodology, security and policies.\nLevel 2: the Eurosystem central banks are responsible for certain technical and operational management tasks related to TARGET2.\nLevel 3: Deutsche Bundesbank, Banque de France and Banca d’Italia are acting as a service provider for the single shared platform infrastructure on behalf of the Eurosystem.\nThe four main tasks and responsibilities within the TARGET2 system are:\nframework setting by the Eurosystem by producing guidelines with common requirements for the users;\ncompliance check by the central banks;\nproviding central banks with the relevant information by the users;\nmonitoring and follow-up activities by central banks.\nThe guideline contains specific rules for the operation of TARGET2, i.e.:\nthe opening and operation of an account;\nfees for core TARGET2 services;\npooling liquidity;\nintraday credit (a short period when an account may be overdrawn);\nsuspension or termination of participation;\nrejection of an application for participation in TARGET2;\ncompensation and treatment of losses from technical malfunction;\ndispute resolution.\nFROM WHEN DOES THE GUIDELINE APPLY?\n              \nIt entered into force on 7 December 2012 and has applied since 1 January 2013. Guideline ECB/2012/27 repealed Guideline ECB/2007/2.\nBACKGROUND\nTARGET2 is the Eurosystem’s interbank funds transfer system, which is designed to support the Eurosystem’s objectives of defining and implementing the monetary policy of the euro area and promoting the smooth operation of payment systems.\nTARGET2 services are developed and operated by the Eurosystem to ensure the safe and efficient flow of cash, securities and collateral across Europe. This contributes to the stability of the euro.\nThe predecessor of TARGET2, TARGET, linked different national RTGS structures together and commenced operations on 4 January 1999, a few days after the launch of the euro.\nTARGET2, launched on 19 November 2007, fully replaced the first-generation TARGET by May 2008 by providing harmonised core services on a single shared platform developed by the Banque de France, Deutsche Bundesbank and Banca d’Italia (known as 3CB).\nTARGET2 is one of the largest payment systems in the world, reaching over 52,000 banks and processing payments close to the entire euro-area GDP every 5 days.\nThe Eurosystem has launched a project to consolidate TARGET2 and TARGET2-Securities in terms of both technical and functional aspects.
