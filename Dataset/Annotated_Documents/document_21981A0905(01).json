This Convention applies to the Antarctic marine living resources of the area south of 60º South latitude and to the Antarctic marine living resources of the area between that latitude and the Antarctic Convergence which form part of the Antarctic marine ecosystem.  2. Antarctic marine living resources means the populations of fin fish, molluscs, crustaceans and all other species of living organisms, including birds, found south of the Antarctic.  3. The Antarctic marine ecosystem means the complex of relationships of Antarctic marine living resources with each other and with their physical environment.   4. The Antarctic Convergence shall be deemed to be a line joining the following points along parallels of latitude and meridians of longitude:  50ºS, 0º ; 50ºS, 30ºE ; 45ºS, 30ºE ; 45ºS, 80ºE ; 55ºS, 80ºE ; 55ºS, 150ºE ; 60ºS, 150ºE ; 60ºS, 50ºW ; 50ºS, 50ºW ; 50ºS, 0º.   Article II 1. The objective of this Convention is the conservation of Antarctic marine living resources.  2. For the purposes of this Convention, the term \"conservation\" includes rational use.  3. Any harvesting and associated activities in the area to which this Convention applies shall be conducted in accordance with the provisions of this Convention and with the following principles of conservation:  (a) prevention of decrease in the size of any harvested population to levels below those which ensure its stable recruitment. For this purpose its size should not be allowed to fall below a level close to that which ensures the greatest net annual increment;   (b) maintenance of the ecological relationships between harvested, dependent and related populations of Antarctic marine living resources and the restoration of depleted populations to the levels defined in subparagraph (a) above ; and   (c) prevention of changes or minimization of the risk of changes in the marine ecosystem which are not potentially reversible over two or three decades, taking into account the state of available knowledge of the direct and indirect impact of harvesting, the effect of the introduction of alien species, the effects of associated activities on the marine ecosystem and of the effects of environmental changes, with the aim of making possible the sustained conservation of Antarctic marine living resources.     Article III The Contracting Parties, whether or not they are Parties to the Antarctic Treaty, agree that they will not engage in any activities in the Antarctic Treaty area contrary to the principles and purposes of that Treaty and that, in their relations with each other, they are bound by the obligations contained in Articles I and V of the Antarctic Treaty.   Article IV 1. With respect to the Antarctic Treaty area, all Contracting Parties, whether or not they are Parties to the Antarctic Treaty, are bound by Articles IV and VI of the Antarctic Treaty in their relations with each other.  2.

For the purposes of the Convention, the term ‘conservation’ includes rational use.\nThe decision approves the Convention on behalf of the EU.\nKEY POINTS\n              \nTo conserve marine life, the Convention requires that any fishing and associated activities must follow the following principles:\nensure that the population of any species targeted by such activities does not fall below the levels needed to maintain stable populations.\nmaintain the ecological relationships between targeted populations and dependent and related populations of Antarctic marine life, and restore depleted populations to the levels defined above; and\nprevent changes or minimise the risk of changes in the marine ecosystem which are not potentially reversible over two or three decades, taking into account various factors including environmental changes, with the aim of making possible the sustained conservation of Antarctic marine living resources.\nThe Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) and the Scientific Committee\nAn international Commission, the CCAMLR, set up by the Convention, is responsible for the adoption of conservation measures at its annual meetings designed to ensure the conservation of Antarctic marine living resources, including their rational use.\nThe Scientific Committee is a consultative body set up by the Convention to provide a forum for consultation and cooperation concerning the collection, study and exchange of information of the marine life covered by the Convention. In exercising its functions, the Commission takes full account of the recommendations and advice of the Scientific Committee.\nCouncil Decision (EU) 2019/867, adopted in May 2019, sets out the EU position within the Commission for the period 2019-2023\nDATE OF ENTRY INTO FORCE\n              \nThe convention entered into force on 7 April 1982.\nBACKGROUND\n              \nFor more information, see:\nAbout CCAMLR (Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources).\nKEY TERMS\n              \nAntarctic convergence: a line joining the following points along parallels of latitude and meridians of longitude:50oS, 0o; 50oS, 30oE; 45oS, 30oE; 45oS, 80oE; 55oS, 80oE; 55oS, 150oE; 60oS, 150oE; 60oS, 50oW; 50oS, 50oW; 50oS, 0o.\nMAIN DOCUMENTS\n            \nConvention on the conservation of Antarctic marine living resources (OJ L 252, 5.9.1981, pp. 27-35)\nCouncil Decision 81/691/EEC of 4 September 1981 on the conclusion of the Convention on the conservation of Antarctic marine living resources (OJ L 252, 5.9.1981, p. 26)\nRELATED DOCUMENTS\n            \nCouncil Decision (EU) 2019/867 of 14 May 2019 on the position to be taken on behalf of the European Union in the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR), and repealing the Decision of 24 June 2014 on the position to be adopted, on behalf of the Union, in the CCAMLR (OJ L 140, 28.5.2019, pp. 72-77)\nCommunication from the Commission to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions — A European Strategy for Plastics in a Circular Economy (COM(2018) 28 final, 16.1.2018)\nRegulation (EU) 2017/2403 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 December 2017 on the sustainable management of external fishing fleets, and repealing Council Regulation (EC) No 1006/2008 (OJ L 347, 28.12.2017, pp. 81-104)\nJoint Communication to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions — International ocean governance: an agenda for the future of our oceans (JOIN(2016) 49 final, 10.11.2016)\nCouncil Regulation (EC) No 1224/2009 of 20 November 2009 establishing a Community control system for ensuring compliance with the rules of the common fisheries policy, amending Regulations (EC) No 847/96, (EC) No 2371/2002, (EC) No 811/2004, (EC) No 768/2005, (EC) No 2115/2005, (EC) No 2166/2005, (EC) No 388/2006, (EC) No 509/2007, (EC) No 676/2007, (EC) No 1098/2007, (EC) No 1300/2008, (EC) No 1342/2008 and repealing Regulations (EEC) No 2847/93, (EC) No 1627/94 and (EC) No 1966/2006 (OJ L 343, 22.12.2009, pp. 1-50)\nSuccessive amendments to Regulation (EC) No 1224/2009 have been incoporated into the original text.
