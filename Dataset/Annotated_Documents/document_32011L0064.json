{"celex_id": "32011L0064", "reference": "5.7.2011\nEN\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\nL 176/24\nCOUNCIL DIRECTIVE 2011/64/EU\nof 21 June 2011\non the structure and rates of excise duty applied to manufactured tobacco\n(codification)\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 113 thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European Parliament,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee,\nActing in accordance with a special legislative procedure,\nWhereas:\n(1)\nCouncil Directives 92/79/EEC of 19 October 1992 on the approximation of taxes on cigarettes (1), 92/80/EEC of 19 October 1992 on the approximation of taxes on manufactured tobacco other than cigarettes (2) and 95/59/EC of 27 November 1995 on taxes other than turnover taxes which affect the consumption of manufactured tobacco (3) have been substantially amended several times (4). In the interests of clarity and rationality the said Directives should be codified by assembling them in a single act.\n(2)\nThe Union’s fiscal legislation on tobacco products needs to ensure the proper functioning of the internal market and, at the same time, a high level of health protection, as required by Article 168 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, bearing in mind that tobacco products can cause serious harm to health and that the Union is Party to the World Health Organization’s Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC). Account should be taken of the situation prevailing for each of the various types of manufactured tobacco.\n(3)\nOne of the objectives of the Treaty on European Union is to maintain an economic union, whose characteristics are similar to those of a domestic market, within which there is healthy competition. As regards manufactured tobacco, achievement of this aim presupposes that the application in the Member States of taxes affecting the consumption of products in this sector does not distort conditions of competition and does not impede their free movement within the Union.\n(4)\nThe various types of manufactured tobacco, distinguished by their characteristics and by the way in which they are used, should be defined.\n(5)\nA distinction needs to be made between fine-cut tobacco for the rolling of cigarettes and other smoking tobacco.\n(6)\nRolls of tobacco capable of being smoked as they are after simple handling should also be deemed to be cigarettes for the purposes of uniform taxation of these products.\n(7)\nA manufacturer needs to be defined as a natural or legal person who actually prepares tobacco products and sets the maximum retail selling price for each of the Member States for which the products in question are to be released for consumption.\n(8)\nIn the interests of uniform and fair taxation, a definition of cigarettes, cigars and cigarillos and of other smoking tobacco should be laid down so that, respectively, rolls of tobacco which according to their length can be considered as two cigarettes or more are treated as two cigarettes or more for excise purposes, a type of cigar which is similar in many respects to a cigarette is treated as a cigarette for excise purposes, smoking tobacco which is similar in many respects to fine-cut tobacco intended for the rolling of cigarettes is treated as fine-cut tobacco for excise purposes, and tobacco refuse is clearly defined. In view of the economic difficulties that immediate implementation could cause for the German and Hungarian operators concerned, Germany and Hungary should be authorised to postpone the application of the definition of cigars and cigarillos until 1 January 2015.\n(9)\nAs far as excise duties are concerned, harmonisation of structures must, in particular, result in competition in the different categories of manufactured tobacco belonging to the same group not being distorted by the effects of the charging of the tax and, consequently, in the opening of the national markets of the Member States.\n(10)\nThe imperative needs of competition imply a system of freely formed prices for all groups of manufactured tobacco.\n(11)\nThe structure of the excise duty on cigarettes must include, in addition to a specific component calculated per unit of the product, a proportional component based on the retail selling price, inclusive of all taxes. The turnover tax on cigarettes has the same effect as an ad valorem excise duty and this fact should be taken into account when the ratio between the specific component of the excise duty and the total tax burden is being established.\n(12)\nWithout prejudice to the mixed tax structure and the maximum percentage of the specific component of the total tax burden, Member States should be given effective means to levy specific or minimum excise duty on cigarettes, so as to ensure that at least a certain minimum amount of taxation applies throughout the Union.\n(13)\nFor the proper functioning of the internal market, it is necessary to establish minimum excise duties for all categories of manufactured tobacco.\n(14)\nAs regards cigarettes, neutral conditions of competition for manufacturers should be assured, the partitioning of the tobacco markets should be reduced and health objectives should be underscored. Thus, a price related minimum requirement should refer to the weighted average retail selling price, whereas a monetary minimum should be applicable to all cigarettes. For the same reasons, the weighted average retail selling price should also serve as a reference for measuring the importance of specific excise duty within the total tax burden.\n(15)\nAs regards prices and excise levels, in particular for cigarettes — by far the most important category of tobacco products — as well as for fine cut-tobacco intended for the rolling of cigarettes, there are still considerable differences between Member States which may disturb the operation of the internal market. A certain degree of convergence between the tax levels applied in the Member States would help to reduce fraud and smuggling within the Union.\n(16)\nSuch convergence would also help to ensure a high level of protection for human health. The level of taxation is a major factor in the price of tobacco products, which in turn influences consumers’ smoking habits. Fraud and smuggling undermine tax induced price levels, in particular of cigarettes and fine-cut tobacco intended for the rolling of cigarettes, and thus jeopardise the achievement of tobacco control and health protection objectives.\n(17)\nAs regards products other than cigarettes, a harmonised incidence of tax should be established for all products belonging to the same group of manufactured tobacco. The setting of an overall minimum excise duty expressed as a percentage, as an amount per kilogram or for a given number of items is the most appropriate for the functioning of the internal market.\n(18)\nAs regards fine-cut tobacco intended for the rolling of cigarettes, a Union price related minimum requirement should be expressed in such a way as to obtain effects similar to those in the field of cigarettes and should take the weighted average retail selling price as the point of reference.\n(19)\nIt is necessary to bring the minimum levels for fine-cut tobacco intended for the rolling of cigarettes closer to the minimum levels applicable to cigarettes, so as to better take account of the degree of competition existing between the two products, reflected in consumption patterns observed, as well as their equally harmful character.\n(20)\nPortugal should be granted the possibility of applying a reduced rate for cigarettes made by small-scale producers and consumed in the most remote regions of the Azores and Madeira.\n(21)\nTransitional periods should allow Member States to adapt smoothly to the levels of the overall excise duty, thus limiting possible side effects.\n(22)\nIn order to prevent damage to Corsica’s economic and social equilibrium, it is both essential and justifiable to provide for a derogation, until 31 December 2015, by which France may apply a rate of excise duty that is lower than the national rate to cigarettes and other manufactured tobaccos released for consumption in Corsica. By that date, the tax rules for manufactured tobaccos released for consumption there should be brought fully into line with the rules for mainland France. Nevertheless, too abrupt a change should be avoided and there should therefore be a stepwise increase in the excise duty currently levied on cigarettes and fine-cut tobacco intended for the rolling of cigarettes in Corsica.\n(23)\nA majority of Member States grant exemptions from excise duty or make refunds of excise duty in respect of certain types of manufactured tobacco depending on the use which is made of them, and the exemptions or refunds for particular uses need to be specified in this Directive.\n(24)\nA procedure should be provided for to enable the rates or amounts laid down in this Directive to be reviewed periodically on the basis of a Commission report taking account of all the appropriate factors.\n(25)\nThis Directive should be without prejudice to the obligations of the Member States relating to the time-limits for transposition into national law and application of the Directives set out in Annex I, Part B,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:\nCHAPTER 1\nSUBJECT MATTER\nArticle 1\nThis Directive lays down general principles for the harmonisation of the structure and rates of the excise duty to which the Member States subject manufactured tobacco.\nCHAPTER 2\nDEFINITIONS\nArticle 2\n1.   For the purposes of this Directive manufactured tobacco shall mean:\n(a)\ncigarettes;\n(b)\ncigars and cigarillos;\n(c)\nsmoking tobacco:\n(i)\nfine-cut tobacco for the rolling of cigarettes;\n(ii)\nother smoking tobacco.\n2.   Products consisting in whole or in part of substances other than tobacco but otherwise conforming to the criteria set out in Article 3 or Article 5(1) shall be treated as cigarettes and smoking tobacco.\nNotwithstanding the first subparagraph, products containing no tobacco and used exclusively for medical purposes shall not be treated as manufactured tobacco.\n3.   Notwithstanding existing Union provisions, the definitions referred to in paragraph 2 of this Article and Articles 3, 4 and 5 shall be without prejudice to the choice of system or the level of taxation which shall apply to the different groups of products referred to in these Articles.\nArticle 3\n1.   For the purposes of this Directive cigarettes shall mean:\n(a)\nrolls of tobacco capable of being smoked as they are and which are not cigars or cigarillos within the meaning of Article 4(1);\n(b)\nrolls of tobacco which, by simple non-industrial handling, are inserted into cigarette-paper tubes;\n(c)\nrolls of tobacco which, by simple non-industrial handling, are wrapped in cigarette paper.\n2.   A roll of tobacco referred to in paragraph 1 shall, for excise duty purposes, be considered as two cigarettes where, excluding filter or mouthpiece, it is longer than 8 cm but not longer than 11 cm, as three cigarettes where, excluding filter or mouthpiece, it is longer than 11 cm but not longer than 14 cm, and so on.\nArticle 4\n1.   For the purposes of this Directive the following shall be deemed to be cigars or cigarillos if they can be and, given their properties and normal consumer expectations, are exclusively intended to be smoked as they are:\n(a)\nrolls of tobacco with an outer wrapper of natural tobacco;\n(b)\nrolls of tobacco with a threshed blend filler and with an outer wrapper of the normal colour of a cigar, of reconstituted tobacco, covering the product in full, including, where appropriate, the filter but not, in the case of tipped cigars, the tip, where the unit weight, not including filter or mouthpiece, is not less than 2,3 g and not more than 10 g, and the circumference over at least one third of the length is not less than 34 mm.\n2.   By way of derogation from paragraph 1, the following subparagraph may continue to be applied by Germany and Hungary until 31 December 2014.\nThe following shall be deemed to be cigars or cigarillos if they can be smoked as they are:\n(a)\nrolls of tobacco made entirely of natural tobacco;\n(b)\nrolls of tobacco with an outer wrapper of natural tobacco;\n(c)\nrolls of tobacco with a threshed blend filler and with an outer wrapper of the normal colour of a cigar covering the product in full, including, where appropriate, the filter but not, in the case of tipped cigars, the tip, and a binder, both being of reconstituted tobacco, where the unit weight, not including filter or mouthpiece, is not less than 1,2 g and where the wrapper is fitted in spiral form with an acute angle of at least 30° to the longitudinal axis of the cigar;\n(d)\nrolls of tobacco with a threshed blend filler and with an outer wrapper of the normal colour of a cigar, of reconstituted tobacco, covering the product in full, including where appropriate the filter but not, in the case of tipped cigars, the tip, where the unit weight, not including filter or mouth-piece, is not less than 2,3 g and the circumference over at least one third of the length is not less than 34 mm.\n3.   Products which consist in part of substances other than tobacco but otherwise fulfil the criteria set out in paragraph 1 shall be treated as cigars and cigarillos.\nArticle 5\n1.   For the purposes of this Directive smoking tobacco shall mean:\n(a)\ntobacco which has been cut or otherwise split, twisted or pressed into blocks and is capable of being smoked without further industrial processing;\n(b)\ntobacco refuse put up for retail sale which does not fall under Article 3 and Article 4(1) and which can be smoked. For the purpose of this Article, tobacco refuse shall be deemed to be remnants of tobacco leaves and by-products obtained from tobacco processing or the manufacture of tobacco products.\n2.   Smoking tobacco in which more than 25 % by weight of the tobacco particles have a cut width of less than 1,5 millimetre shall be deemed to be fine-cut tobacco for the rolling of cigarettes.\nMember States may also deem smoking tobacco in which more than 25 % by weight of the tobacco particles have a cut width of 1,5 millimetre or more and which was sold or intended to be sold for the rolling of cigarettes to be fine-cut tobacco for the rolling of cigarettes.\nArticle 6\nA natural or legal person established in the Union who converts tobacco into manufactured products prepared for retail sale shall be deemed to be a manufacturer.\nCHAPTER 3\nPROVISIONS APPLICABLE TO CIGARETTES\nArticle 7\n1.   Cigarettes manufactured in the Union and those imported from third countries shall be subject to an ad valorem excise duty calculated on the maximum retail selling price, including customs duties, and also to a specific excise duty calculated per unit of the product.\nNotwithstanding the first subparagraph, Member States may exclude customs duties from the basis for calculating the ad valorem excise duty on cigarettes.\n2.   The rate of the ad valorem excise duty and the amount of the specific excise duty must be the same for all cigarettes.\n3.   At the final stage of harmonisation of structures, the same ratio shall be established for cigarettes in all Member States between the specific excise duty and the sum of the ad valorem excise duty and the turnover tax, in such a way that the range of retail selling prices reflects fairly the difference in the manufacturers’ delivery prices.\n4.   Where necessary, the excise duty on cigarettes may include a minimum tax component, provided that the mixed structure of taxation and the band of the specific component of the excise duty as laid down in Article 8 is strictly respected.\nArticle 8\n1.   The percentage of the specific component of excise duty in the amount of the total tax burden on cigarettes shall be established by reference to the weighted average retail selling price.\n2.   The weighted average retail selling price shall be calculated by reference to the total value of all cigarettes released for consumption, based on the retail selling price including all taxes, divided by the total quantity of cigarettes released for consumption. It shall be determined by 1 March at the latest of each year on the basis of data relating to all such releases for consumption made in the preceding calendar year.\n3.   Until 31 December 2013, the specific component of the excise duty shall not be less than 5 % and shall not be more than 76,5 % of the amount of the total tax burden resulting from the aggregation of the following:\n(a)\nspecific excise duty;\n(b)\nthe ad valorem excise duty and the value added tax (VAT) levied on the weighted average retail selling price.\n4.   From 1 January 2014, the specific component of the excise duty on cigarettes shall not be less than 7,5 % and shall not be more than 76,5 % of the amount of the total tax burden resulting from the aggregation of the following:\n(a)\nspecific excise duty;\n(b)\nthe ad valorem excise duty and the VAT levied on the weighted average retail selling price.\n5.   By way of derogation from paragraphs 3 and 4, where a change in the weighted average retail selling price of cigarettes occurs in a Member State, thereby bringing the specific component of the excise duty, expressed as a percentage of the total tax burden, below the percentage of 5 % or 7,5 %, whichever is applicable, or above the percentage of 76,5 % of the total tax burden, the Member State concerned may refrain from adjusting the amount of the specific excise duty until 1 January of the second year following that in which the change occurs.\n6.   Subject to paragraphs 3, 4 and 5 of this Article and the second subparagraph of Article 7(1), Member States may levy a minimum excise duty on cigarettes.\nArticle 9\n1.   Member States shall apply to cigarettes minimum consumption taxes in accordance with the rules provided for in this Chapter.\n2.   Paragraph 1 shall apply to the taxes which, pursuant to this Chapter, are levied on cigarettes and which comprise:\n(a)\na specific excise duty per unit of the product;\n(b)\nan ad valorem excise duty calculated on the basis of the maximum retail selling price;\n(c)\na VAT proportional to the retail selling price.\nArticle 10\n1.   The overall excise duty (specific duty and ad valorem duty excluding VAT) on cigarettes shall represent at least 57 % of the weighted average retail selling price of cigarettes released for consumption. That excise duty shall not be less than EUR 64 per 1 000 cigarettes irrespective of the weighted average retail selling price.\nHowever, Member States which levy an excise duty of at least EUR 101 per 1 000 cigarettes on the basis of the weighted average retail selling price need not to comply with the 57 % requirement set out in the first subparagraph.\n2.   From 1 January 2014, the overall excise duty on cigarettes shall represent at least 60 % of the weighted average retail selling price of cigarettes released for consumption. That excise duty shall not be less than EUR 90 per 1 000 cigarettes irrespective of the weighted average retail selling price.\nHowever, Member States which levy an excise duty of at least EUR 115 per 1 000 cigarettes on the basis of the weighted average retail selling price need not to comply with the 60 % requirement set out in the first subparagraph.\nBulgaria, Estonia, Greece, Latvia, Lithuania, Hungary, Poland and Romania shall be allowed a transitional period until 31 December 2017 in order to reach the requirements laid down in the first and second subparagraphs.\n3.   Member States shall gradually increase excise duties in order to reach the requirements referred to in paragraph 2 on the dates set therein.\nArticle 11\n1.   Where a change in the weighted average retail selling price of cigarettes occurs in a Member State, thereby bringing the overall excise duty below the levels specified in the first sentence of paragraph 1 and in the first sentence of paragraph 2 of Article 10 respectively, the Member State concerned may refrain from adjusting that duty until 1 January of the second year following that in which the change occurs.\n2.   Where a Member State increases the rate of VAT on cigarettes, it may reduce the overall excise duty up to an amount which, expressed as a percentage of the weighted average retail selling price, is equal to the increase in the rate of VAT, also expressed as a percentage of the weighted average retail selling price, even if such an adjustment has the effect of reducing the overall excise duty to below the levels, expressed as a percentage of the weighted average retail selling price, laid down in the first sentence of paragraph 1 and in the first sentence of paragraph 2 of Article 10 respectively.\nHowever, the Member State shall raise that duty again so as to reach at least those levels by 1 January of the second year after that in which the reduction took place.\nArticle 12\n1.   Portugal may apply a reduced rate of up to 50 % less than that laid down in Article 10 to cigarettes consumed in the most remote regions of the Azores and Madeira, made by small-scale manufacturers each of whose annual production does not exceed 500 tonnes.\n2.   By way of derogation from Article 10, France may continue to apply for the period from 1 January 2010 to 31 December 2015 a reduced rate of excise duty to cigarettes released for consumption in the departments of Corsica up to an annual quota of 1 200 tonnes. The reduced rate shall be:\n(a)\nuntil 31 December 2012, at least 44 % of the price for cigarettes in the price category most in demand in those departments;\n(b)\nfrom 1 January 2013, at least 50 % of the weighted average retail selling price of cigarettes released for consumption; the excise duty shall not be less than EUR 88 per 1 000 cigarettes irrespective of the weighted average retail selling price;\n(c)\nfrom 1 January 2015, at least 57 % of the weighted average retail selling price of cigarettes released for consumption; the excise duty shall not be less than EUR 90 per 1 000 cigarettes irrespective of the weighted average retail selling price.\nCHAPTER 4\nPROVISIONS APPLICABLE TO MANUFACTURED TOBACCO OTHER THAN CIGARETTES\nArticle 13\nThe following groups of manufactured tobacco produced in the Union and imported from third countries shall be subject, in each Member State, to a minimum excise duty as laid down in Article 14:\n(a)\ncigars and cigarillos;\n(b)\nfine-cut tobacco intended for the rolling of cigarettes;\n(c)\nother smoking tobaccos.\nArticle 14\n1.   Member States shall apply an excise duty which may be:\n(a)\neither an ad valorem duty calculated on the basis of the maximum retail selling price of each product, freely determined by manufacturers established in the Union and by importers from third countries in accordance with Article 15; or\n(b)\na specific duty expressed as an amount per kilogram, or in the case of cigars and cigarillos, alternatively for a given number of items; or\n(c)\na mixture of both, combining an ad valorem element and a specific element.\nIn cases where excise duty is either ad valorem or mixed, Member States may establish a minimum amount of excise duty.\n2.   The overall excise duty (specific duty and/or ad valorem duty excluding VAT), expressed as a percentage, as an amount per kilogram or for a given number of items, shall be at least equivalent to the rates or minimum amounts laid down for:\n(a)   cigars or cigarillos: 5 % of the retail selling price inclusive of all taxes or EUR 12 per 1 000 items or per kilogram;\n(b)   fine-cut smoking tobacco intended for the rolling of cigarettes: 40 % of the weighted average retail selling price of fine-cut smoking tobacco intended for the rolling of cigarettes released for consumption, or EUR 40 per kilogram;\n(c)   other smoking tobaccos: 20 % of the retail selling price inclusive of all taxes, or EUR 22 per kilogram.\nFrom 1 January 2013, the overall excise duty on fine-cut smoking tobacco intended for the rolling of cigarettes shall represent at least 43 % of the weighted average retail selling price of fine-cut smoking tobacco intended for the rolling of cigarettes released for consumption, or at least EUR 47 per kilogram.\nFrom 1 January 2015 the overall excise duty on fine-cut smoking tobacco intended for the rolling of cigarettes shall represent at least 46 % of the weighted average retail selling price of fine-cut smoking tobacco intended for the rolling of cigarettes released for consumption, or at least EUR 54 per kilogram.\nFrom 1 January 2018, the overall excise duty on fine-cut smoking tobacco intended for the rolling of cigarettes shall represent at least 48 % of the weighted average retail selling price of fine-cut smoking tobacco intended for the rolling of cigarettes released for consumption, or at least EUR 60 per kilogram.\nFrom 1 January 2020, the overall excise duty on fine-cut smoking tobacco intended for the rolling of cigarettes shall represent at least 50 % of the weighted average retail selling price of fine-cut smoking tobacco intended for the rolling of cigarettes released for consumption, or at least EUR 60 per kilogram.\nThe weighted average retail selling price shall be calculated by reference to the total value of fine-cut smoking tobacco intended for the rolling of cigarettes released for consumption, based on retail selling price including all taxes, divided by the total quantity of fine-cut smoking tobacco intended for the rolling of cigarettes released for consumption. It shall be determined by 1 March at the latest of each year on the basis of data relating to all such releases for consumption made in the preceding calendar year.\n3.   The rates or amounts referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 shall be effective for all products belonging to the group of manufactured tobaccos concerned, without distinction within each group as to quality, presentation, origin of the products, the materials used, the characteristics of the firms involved or any other criterion.\n4.   By way of derogation from paragraphs 1 and 2, France may continue to apply, for the period from 1 January 2010 to 31 December 2015, a reduced rate of excise duty to manufactured tobacco other than cigarettes released for consumption in the departments of Corsica. The reduced rate shall be:\n(a)   for cigars and cigarillos: at least 10 % of the retail selling price, inclusive of all taxes;\n(b)   for fine-cut smoking tobacco intended for the rolling of cigarettes:\n(i)\nuntil 31 December 2012, at least 27 % of the retail selling price, inclusive of all taxes;\n(ii)\nfrom 1 January 2013, at least 30 % of the retail selling price, inclusive of all taxes;\n(iii)\nfrom 1 January 2015, at least 35 % of the retail selling price, inclusive of all taxes;\n(c)   for other smoking tobacco: at least 22 % of the retail selling price, inclusive of all taxes.\nCHAPTER 5\nDETERMINATION OF THE MAXIMUM RETAIL SELLING PRICE OF MANUFACTURED TOBACCO, COLLECTION OF EXCISE DUTY, EXEMPTIONS AND REFUNDS\nArticle 15\n1.   Manufacturers or, where appropriate, their representatives or authorised agents in the Union, and importers of tobacco from third countries shall be free to determine the maximum retail selling price for each of their products for each Member State for which the products in question are to be released for consumption.\nThe first subparagraph may not, however, hinder implementation of national systems of legislation regarding the control of price levels or the observance of imposed prices, provided that they are compatible with Union legislation.\n2.   In order to facilitate the levying of the excise duty, Member States may, for each group of manufactured tobacco, fix a scale of retail selling prices on condition that each scale has sufficient scope and variety to correspond in fact with the variety of products originating in the Union.\nEach scale shall be valid for all the products belonging to the group of manufactured tobacco which it concerns, without distinction on the basis of quality, presentation, the origin of the products or of the materials used, the characteristics of the undertakings or of any other criterion.\nArticle 16\n1.   At the final stage of harmonisation of the excise duty, at the latest the rules for collecting the excise duty shall be harmonised. During the preceding stage, the excise duty shall, in principle, be collected by means of tax stamps. If they collect the excise duty by means of tax stamps, Member States shall be obliged to make these stamps available to manufacturers and dealers in other Member States. If they collect the excise duty by other means, Member States shall ensure that no obstacle, either administrative or technical, affects trade between Member States on that account.\n2.   Importers and Union manufacturers of manufactured tobacco shall be subject to the system set out in paragraph 1 as regards the detailed rules for levying and paying the excise duty.\nArticle 17\nThe following may be exempted from excise duty or excise duty already paid on them may be refunded:\n(a)\ndenatured manufactured tobacco used for industrial or horticultural purposes;\n(b)\nmanufactured tobacco which is destroyed under administrative supervision;\n(c)\nmanufactured tobacco which is solely intended for scientific tests and for tests connected with product quality;\n(d)\nmanufactured tobacco which is reworked by the producer.\nMember States shall determine the conditions and formalities to which the abovementioned exemptions or refunds are subject.\nCHAPTER 6\nFINAL PROVISIONS\nArticle 18\n1.   The Commission shall publish once a year the value of the euro in national currencies to be applied to the amounts of the overall excise duty.\nThe exchange rates to be applied shall be those obtained on the first working day of October and published in the Official Journal of the European Union and shall apply from 1 January of the following calendar year.\n2.   Member States may maintain the amounts of the excise duties in force at the time of the annual adjustment provided for in paragraph 1 if the conversion of the amounts of the excise duties expressed in euro would result in an increase of less than 5 % or less than EUR 5, whichever is the lower amount, in the excise duty expressed in national currency.\nArticle 19\n1.   Every four years, the Commission shall submit to the Council a report and, where appropriate, a proposal concerning the rates and the structure of excise duty laid down in this Directive.\nThe report by the Commission shall take into account the proper functioning of the internal market, the real value of the rates of excise duty and the wider objectives of the Treaty.\n2.   The report referred to in paragraph 1 shall be based in particular on the information provided by the Member States.\n3.   The Commission shall, in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 43 of Council Directive 2008/118/EC (5), determine a list of statistical data needed for the report, excluding data relating to individual natural persons or legal entities. Apart from data readily available to Member States, the list shall only contain data the collection and assembly of which does not involve a disproportionate administrative burden on the part of the Member States.\n4.   The Commission shall not publish or otherwise divulge data where it would lead to the disclosure of a commercial, industrial or professional secret.\nArticle 20\nMember States shall communicate to the Commission the text of the main provisions of national law which they adopt in the field covered by this Directive.\nArticle 21\nDirectives 92/79/EEC, 92/80/EEC and 95/59/EC, as amended by the Directives listed in Annex I, Part A, are repealed, without prejudice to the obligations of the Member States relating to the time-limits for transposition into national law and application of the Directives set out in Annex I, Part B.\nReferences to the repealed Directives shall be construed as references to this Directive and shall be read in accordance with the correlation table set out in Annex II.\nArticle 22\nThis Directive shall enter into force on 1 January 2011.\nArticle 23\nThis Directive is addressed to the Member States.\nDone at Luxembourg, 21 June 2011.\nFor the Council\nThe

manufactured tobacco\nExcise duty on manufactured tobacco\nSUMMARY OF:\nCouncil Directive 2011/64/EU — structure and rates of excise duty applied to manufactured tobacco\nWHAT IS THE AIM OF THE DIRECTIVE?\n              \nIt lays down general principles and minimum rates of excise duty on manufactured tobacco (i.e. cigarettes, cigars and cigarillos, fine-cut tobacco for rolling cigarettes and other smoking tobacco) across the EU.\nKEY POINTS\nRules applying to cigarettes\nEU countries must apply minimum excise duties to cigarettes whether they are manufactured in the EU or imported. This tax includes:\nan ad valorem* excise duty calculated on the maximum retail selling price, including customs duties (EU countries may, however exclude customs duties from the calculation of ad valorem excise duty on cigarettes) and the value-added tax levied on the weighted average retail selling price*;\na specific excise duty calculated per unit of the product.\nThe rate of the ad valorem excise duty and the amount of the specific excise duty must be identical for all cigarettes.\nSince 1 January 2014:\nthe specific component of the excise duty must be between 7.5% and 76.5%.\nthe overall excise duty on cigarettes must constitute at least 60% of the weighted average retail selling price of cigarettes released for consumption. This excise duty must not be less than €90 per 1 000 cigarettes irrespective of the weighted average retail selling price. EU countries which impose an excise duty of at least €115 per 1000 cigarettes are not required to comply with the 60% condition. Certain countries (Bulgaria, Estonia, Greece, Latvia, Lithuania, Hungary, Poland, Romania and Croatia) were allowed a transitional period until 31 December 2017 to adapt to these conditions.\nWhen an EU country increases the rate of VAT on cigarettes, it may reduce the overall excise duty up to an amount which, expressed as a percentage of the weighted average retail selling price, is equal to the increase in the rate of VAT. However, the EU country in question must raise the excise duty again so as to reach at least the original level by 1 January of the second year in which the reduction took place.\nRules applying to manufactured tobacco other than cigarettes\nEU countries shall apply an excise duty to manufactured tobacco other than cigarettes, which may be:\nan ad valorem duty calculated on the basis of the maximum retail selling price of each product;\na specific duty expressed as an amount per kilogram or per 1000 pieces;\na mixture of an ad valorem element and a specific element.\nThe overall excise duty must be at least equivalent to the rates or minimum amounts established for:\ncigars or cigarillos: 5% of the retail selling price or €12 per 1000 items or per kilogram;\nfine-cut smoking tobacco intended for the rolling of cigarettes: 46% of the weighted average retail selling price or € 54 per kilogram; these minimum rates will gradually increase, by 2020, to 50% or €60;\nother smoking tobaccos: 20% of the retail selling price or €22 per kilogram.\nMaximum retail selling price\nManufacturers, their representatives or authorised agents in EU countries, and importers of tobacco from non-EU countries have the right to determine the maximum retail selling price for each of their products for each EU country in which the products concerned are to be released for consumption. This does not however affect the implementation of national legislation regarding price control or the observance of imposed prices, provided that they are compatible with EU legislation.\nFROM WHEN DOES THE DIRECTIVE APPLY?\n              \nIt has applied since 1 January 2011. Directive 2011/64/EU codifies and replaces Directives 92/79/EEC, 92/80/EEC and 95/59/EC (and their subsequent amendments).\nBACKGROUND\n              \nFor more information, see:\nExcise duties: tobacco legislation (European Commission).\nKEY TERMS\n              \nAd valorem: a duty that is linked to the value of the product in question.\nWeighted average retail selling price: calculated in accordance with the total value of all cigarettes released for consumption, based on the retail selling price including all taxes, divided by the total quantity of cigarettes released for consumption.\nMAIN DOCUMENT\n            \nCouncil Directive 2011/64/EU of 21 June 2011 on the structure and rates of excise duty applied to manufactured tobacco (codification) (OJ L 176, 5.7.2011, pp. 24-36)\nlast update 14.11.2017", "tags": ["excise duty", "tax harmonisation", "manufactured goods", "tobacco", "agro-industry"], "subjects": ["Protocol on Ireland/Northern Ireland", "Taxation", "Tobacco"], "split": "train", "reference_annotations": {}, "summary_annotations": {"32011L0064_p1": {"text": "It has applied since 1 January 2011. directive 2011/64/eu codifies and replaces directive 92/79/eec directive 92/80/eec directive 95/59/ec (and their subsequent amendments).", "triples": [" directive 2011/64/eu,  replaces,  directive 92/79/eec", " directive 2011/64/eu,  replaces,  directive 92/80/eec", " directive 2011/64/eu,  replaces,  directive 95/59/ec"]}}}
