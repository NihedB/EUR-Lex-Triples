Since further amendments are to be made, it should be recast in the interests of clarity.\n(2)\nTo carry out the tasks entrusted to it in the context of the common maritime transport policy, the Commission (Eurostat) should have at its disposal comparable, reliable, synchronised and regular statistical data on the scale and development of the carriage of goods and passengers by sea to and from the Community, between Member States and for domestic sea transport.\n(3)\nIt is also important for Member States and economic operators to have a good knowledge of the maritime transport market.\n(4)\nThe collection of Community statistical data on a comparable or harmonised basis makes it possible to establish an integrated system providing reliable, consistent and up-to-date information.\n(5)\nThe data on the transport of goods and passengers by sea have to be made comparable between Member States and between the different modes of transport.\n(6)\nIn accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, the creation of common statistical standards enabling harmonised information to be produced can only be tackled efficiently at Community level. Data will be collected in each Member State under the authority of the bodies and institutions in charge of compiling official statistics.\n(7)\nThe measures necessary for the implementation of this Directive should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission (4).\n(8)\nIn particular, the Commission should be empowered to adopt certain detailed rules for implementing this Directive. Since those measures are of general scope and are designed to amend non-essential elements of this Directive, inter alia, by supplementing it with new non-essential elements, they must be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny provided for in Article 5a of Decision 1999/468/EC.\n(9)\nThe new elements introduced into this Directive only concern the committee procedures. They therefore do not need to be transposed by the Member States.\n(10)\nThis Directive should be without prejudice to the obligations of the Member States relating to the time limits for transposition into national law of the Directive set out in Annex IX, Part B,\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:\nArticle 1\nCollection of statistical data\nMember States shall collect Community statistics on the carriage of goods and passengers by seagoing vessels calling at ports in their territories.\nArticle 2\nDefinitions\nFor the purposes of this Directive:\n(a)\n‘carriage of goods and passengers by sea’ means the movement of goods and passengers using seagoing vessels, on voyages which are undertaken wholly or partly at sea.\nThe scope of this Directive shall also include goods:\n(i)\nshipped to offshore installations;\n(ii)\nreclaimed from the seabed and unloaded in ports.\nBunkers and stores supplied to vessels shall be excluded from the scope of this Directive;\n(b)\n‘seagoing vessels’ means vessels other than those which navigate exclusively in inland waters or in waters within, or closely adjacent to, sheltered waters or areas where port regulations apply.\nThis Directive shall not apply to fish-catching vessels, fish-processing vessels, vessels for drilling and exploration, tugs, pusher craft, research and survey vessels, dredgers, naval vessels or vessels used solely for non-commercial purposes;\n(c)\n‘port’ means a place having facilities for merchant ships to moor and to load or unload cargo or to disembark or embark passengers to or from vessels;\n(d)\n‘nationality of the maritime transport operator’ means that corresponding to the country in which the effective centre of the transport operator’s commercial activity is located;\n(e)\n‘maritime transport operator’ means any person by whom or on behalf of whom a contract for the transport of goods or persons by sea is concluded with a shipper or a passenger.\nArticle 3\nData collection characteristics\n1.   Member States shall collect data relating to:\n(a)\ncargo and passenger information;\n(b)\ninformation on the vessel.\nVessels with a gross tonnage of less than 100 may be excluded from the data collection.\n2.   The characteristics of the data collection, namely the statistical variables in each domain and the nomenclatures for their classification, as well as their periodicity of observation, are set out in Annexes I to VIII.\n3.   The data collection shall be based, in so far as possible, on available sources, limiting the burden on respondents.\n4.   The Commission shall adapt the data collection characteristics and the content of Annexes I to VIII to economic and technical developments in so far as such adaptation does not involve a substantial increase in cost for the Member States and/or in the burden on respondents.\nThose measures, designed to amend non-essential elements of this Directive by supplementing it, shall be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny referred to in Article 10(3).\nArticle 4\nPorts\n1.   For the purposes of this Directive, the Commission shall draw up a list of ports, coded and classified according to countries and maritime coastal areas.\nThose measures, designed to amend non-essential elements of this Directive by supplementing it, shall be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny referred to in Article 10(3).\n2.   Each Member State shall select from the list referred to in paragraph 1 any port handling more than one million tonnes of goods or recording more than 200 000 passenger movements annually.\nFor each port selected, detailed data are to be provided, in conformity with Annex VIII, for the domains (goods and passengers) in which that port meets the selection criterion, and with summary data, if appropriate, for the other domain.\n3.   For the ports which are not selected from the list, summary data are to be provided in conformity with Annex VIII, data set A3.\nArticle 5\nAccuracy of statistics\nThe methods of collecting data shall be such that Community sea transport statistics display the precision required for the statistical data sets described in Annex VIII.\nThe Commission shall draw up the standards of accuracy.\nThose measures, designed to amend non-essential elements of this Directive by supplementing it, shall be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny referred to in Article 10(3).\nArticle 6\nProcessing of the results of the data collection\nMember States shall process the statistical information collected pursuant to Article 3, in order to obtain comparable statistics, with the standard of accuracy referred to in Article 5.\nArticle 7\nTransmission of the results of the data collection\n1.   Member States shall transmit the results of the data collection referred to in Article 3 to the Commission (Eurostat), including the data declared confidential by the Member States pursuant to domestic legislation or practice concerning statistical confidentiality, in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 223/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 2009 on European statistics (5).\n2.   The results shall be transmitted in accordance with the structure of the statistical data sets defined in Annex VIII. The technical details for transmission of the results shall be specified in accordance with the management procedure referred to in Article 10(2).\n3.   The transmission of the results shall take place within five months of the end of the period of observation for data of quarterly periodicity and within eight months for data of annual periodicity.\nThe first transmission shall cover the first quarter of 1997.\nArticle 8\nReports\nMember States shall provide the Commission (Eurostat) with all relevant information on the methods used in compiling the data. They shall also forward details of substantial changes in the methods used to collect the data.\nArticle 9\nDissemination of statistical data\nThe Commission (Eurostat) shall disseminate appropriate statistical data with a periodicity comparable to that of the results transmitted.\nThe arrangements for publication or dissemination of the statistical data by the Commission (Eurostat) shall be adopted in accordance with the management procedure referred to in Article 10(2).\nArticle 10\nCommittee procedure\n1.   The Commission shall be assisted by the European Statistical System Committee set up by Regulation (EC) No 223/2009.\n2.   Where reference is made to this paragraph, Articles 4 and 7 of Decision 1999/468/EC shall apply, having regard to the provisions of Article 8 thereof.\nThe period laid down in Article 4(3) of Decision 1999/468/EC shall be set at three months.\n3.   Where reference is made to this paragraph, Article 5a(1) to (4) and Article 7 of Decision 1999/468/EC shall apply, having regard to the provisions of Article 8 thereof.\nArticle 11\nCommunication of national provisions\nMember States shall communicate to the Commission the text of the main provisions of national law which they adopt in the field governed by this Directive.\nArticle 12\nRepeal\nDirective 95/64/EC, as amended by the acts listed in Annex IX, Part A, is repealed, without prejudice to the obligations of the Member States relating to the time limits for transposition into national law of the Directive set out in Annex IX, Part B.\nReferences to the repealed Directive shall be construed as references to this Directive and shall be read in accordance with the correlation table in Annex X.\nArticle 13\nEntry into force\nThis Directive shall enter into force on the 20th day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nArticle 14\nAddressees\nThis Directive is addressed to the Member States.\nDone at Strasbourg, 6 May 2009.\nFor the European Parliament\nThe President\nH.-G.

returns in respect of carriage of goods and passengers calling at EU ports\nWHAT IS THE AIM OF THE DIRECTIVE?\n              \nIt sets out how European Union (EU) countries should compile statistics on the carriage of goods and passengers by sea calling at EU ports.\nKEY POINTS\nThe data\nThese statistical data relate to cargo and passenger information and to information on the vessel itself. The annexes to this directive specify the characteristics of the data collection, including:\ngross weight and description of goods;\nreporting port;\ntype of cargo classification;\nnumber of passengers;\ntype and size of vessels.\nVessels with a gross tonnage of under 100 tonnes may be excluded from the data collection.\nCollection\nThe European Commission is responsible for drawing up a list of all EU ports for which summary data are to be provided. In addition, each EU country must select from this list any port which:\nhandles more than one million tonnes of goods; or\nrecords more than 200,000 passenger movements annually.\nThese selected ports are then subject to a more detailed data collection.\nTransmitting the data\nEU countries must transmit the results of the collection to the Commission (Eurostat):\nwithin 5 months of the end of the period of observation for data collected quarterly;\nwithin 8 months for data collected annually.\nEU countries must inform Eurostat of the methods used to compile the data, as well as details of any substantial changes in the methods used. Eurostat must then publish the appropriate statistics collected.\nThe directive was amended by Regulation (EU) No 1090/2010 in order to bring data collection on goods transported by seagoing vessels into line with other modes of transport.\nDecision 2010/216/EU amended some technical characteristics in relation to the data collection, including the codes to be used for the nationality of the registration of vessels and the structure for data sets.\nDecision 2012/186/EU amended some of the statistical variables used in the data collection and clarified some definitions and types of cargo classification.\nFROM WHEN DOES THE DIRECTIVE APPLY?\n              \nDirective 2009/42/EC has applied since 26 June 2009. It is a recast version of Directive 95/64/EC  — and its subsequent amendments — which had to be incorporated into national law by 31 December 1996.\nMAIN DOCUMENT\n            \nDirective 2009/42/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 May 2009 on statistical returns in respect of carriage of goods and passengers by sea (recast) (OJ L 141, 6.6.2009, pp. 29-47)\nSuccessive amendments to Directive 2009/42/EC have been incorporated into the basic text.
