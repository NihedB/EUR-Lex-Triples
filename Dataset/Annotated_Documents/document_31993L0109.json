whereas one of its tasks is to organize, in a manner demonstrating consistency and solidarity, relations between the peoples of the Member States; whereas its fundamental objectives include a strengthening of the protection of the rights and interests of the nationals of its Member States through the introduction of a citizenship of the Union;\nWhereas to that end Title II of the Treaty on European Union, amending the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, with a view to establishing the European Community, introduces a citizenship of the Union for all nationals of the Member States and confers on such nationals on that basis a number of rights;\nWhereas the right to vote and to stand as a candidate in elections to the European Parliament in the Member State of residence, laid down in Article 8b (2) of the Treaty establishing the European Community, is an instance of the application of the principle of non-discrimination between nationals and non-nationals and a corollary of the right to move and reside freely enshrined in Article 8a of that Treaty;\nWhereas Article 8b (2) of the EC Treaty is concerned only with the possibility of exercising the right of vote and to stand as a candidate in elections to the European Parliament, without prejudice to Article 138 (3) of the EC Treaty, which provides for the establishment of a uniform procedure in all Member States for those elections; whereas it essentially seeks to abolish the nationality requirement which currently has to be satisfied in most Member States in order to exercise those rights;\nWhereas application of Article 8b (2) of the EC Treaty does not presuppose harmonization of Member States' electoral systems; whereas, moreover, to take account of the principle of proportionality set out in the third paragraph of Article 3b of the EC Treaty, the content of Community legislation in this sphere must not go beyond what is necessary to achieve the objective of Article 8b (2) of the EC Treaty;\nWhereas the purpose of Article 8b (2) of the EC Treaty is to ensure that all citizens of the Union, whether or not they are nationals of the Member State in which they reside, can exercise in that State their right to vote and to stand as a candidate in elections to the European Parliament under the same conditions; whereas the conditions applying to non-nationals, including those relating to period and proof of residence, should therefore be identical to those, if any, applying to nationals of the Member State concerned;\nWhereas Article 8b (2) of the EC Treaty provides for the right to vote and to stand as a candidate in elections to the European Parliament in the Member State of residence, without, nevertheless, substituting it for the right to vote and to stand as a candidate in the Member State of which the citizen is a national; whereas the freedom of citizens of the Union to choose the Member State in which to take part in European elections must be respected, while taking care to ensure that this freedom is not abused by people voting or standing as a candidate in more than one country;\nWhereas any derogation from the general rules of this Directive must be warranted, pursuant to Article 8b (2) of the EC Treaty, by problems specific to a Member State; whereas any derogation must, by its very nature, be subject to review;\nWhereas such specific problems may arise in a Member State in which the proportion of citizens of the Union of voting age, who reside in it but are not nationals of it, is very significantly above average; whereas derogations are warranted where such citizens form more than 20 % of the total electorate; whereas such derogations must be based on the criterion of period of residence;\nWhereas citizenship of the Union is intended to enable citizens of the Union to integrate better in their host country and that in this context, it is in accordance with the intentions of the authors of the Treaty to avoid any polarization between lists of national and non-national candidates;\nWhereas this risk of polarization concerns in particular a Member State in which the proportion of non-national citizens of the Union of voting age exceeds 20 % of the total number of citizens of the Union of voting age who reside there and that, therefore, it is important that this Member State may lay down, in compliance with Article 8b of the Treaty, specific provisions concerning the composition of lists of candidates;\nWhereas account must be taken of the fact that in certain Member States residents who are nationals of other Member States have the right to vote in elections to the national parliament and certain provisions of this Directive may consequently be dispensed with in those Member States,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:\nCHAPTER I\nGENERAL PROVISIONS\nArticle 1\n1.   This Directive lays down the detailed arrangements whereby citizens of the Union residing in a Member State of which they are not nationals may exercise the right to vote and to stand as a candidate there in elections to the European Parliament.\n2.

This provision shall apply without prejudice to any specific conditions as to length of residence in a given constituency or locality.\nArticle 6\n1.   Any citizen of the Union who resides in a Member State of which he is not a national and who, through an individual criminal law or civil law decision, has been deprived of his right to stand as a candidate under either the law of the Member State of residence or the law of his home Member State, shall be precluded from exercising that right in the Member State of residence in elections to the European Parliament.\n2.   An application from any citizen of the Union to stand as a candidate in elections to the European Parliament in the Member State of residence shall be declared inadmissible where that citizen is unable to provide the attestation referred to in Article 10 (2).\nArticle 7\n1.   The Member State of residence may check whether the citizens of the Union who have expressed a desire to exercise their right to vote there have not been deprived of that right in the home Member State through an individual civil law or criminal law decision.\n2.   For the purposes of paragraph 1 of this Article, the Member State of residence may notify the home Member State of the declaration referred to in Article 9 (2). To that end, the relevant and normally available information from the home Member State shall be provided in good time and in an appropriate manner; such information may only include details which are strictly necessary for the implementation of this Article and may only be used for that purpose. If the information provided invalidates the content of the declaration, the Member State of residence shall take the appropriate steps to prevent the person concerned from voting.\n3.   The home Member State may, in good time and in an appropriate manner, submit to the Member State of residence any information necessary for the implementation of this Article.\nArticle 8\n1.   A Community voter exercises his right to vote in the Member State of residence if he has expressed the wish to do so.\n2.   If voting is compulsory in the Member State of residence, Community voters who have expressed the wish to do so shall be obliged to vote.\nCHAPTER II\nEXERCISE OF THE RIGHT TO VOTE AND THE RIGHT TO STAND AS A CANDIDATE\nArticle 9\n1.   Member States shall take the necessary measures to enable a Community voter who has expressed the wish for such to be entered on the electoral roll sufficiently in advance of polling day.\n2.   In order to have his name entered on the electoral roll, a Community voter shall produce the same documents as a voter who is a national. He shall also produce a formal declaration stating:\n(a)\nhis nationality and his address in the electoral territory of the Member State of residence;\n(b)\nwhere applicable, the locality or constituency in his home Member State on the electoral roll of which his name was last entered, and\n(c)\nthat he will exercise his right to vote in the Member State of residence only.\n3.   The Member State of residence may also require a Community voter to:\n(a)\nstate in his declaration under paragraph 2 that he has not been deprived of the right to vote in his home Member State;\n(b)\nproduce a valid identity document, and\n(c)\nindicate the date from which he has been resident in that State or in another Member State.\n4.   Community voters who have been entered on the electoral roll shall remain thereon, under the same conditions as voters who are nationals, until such time as they request to be removed or until such time as they are removed automatically because they no longer satisfy the requirements for exercising the right to vote.\nArticle 10\n1.   When he submits his application to stand as a candidate, a Community national shall produce the same supporting documents as a candidate who is a national. He shall also produce a formal declaration stating:\n(a)\nhis nationality and his address in the electroal territory of the Member State of residence;\n(b)\nthat he is not standing as a candidate for election to the European Parliament in any other Member State, and\n(c)\nwhere applicable, the locality or constituency in his home Member State on the electoral roll of which his name was last entered.\n2.   When he submits his application to stand as a candidate a Community national must also produce an attestation from the competent administrative authorities of his home Member State certifying that he has not been deprived of the right to stand as a candidate in that Member State or that no such disqualification is known to those authorities.\n3.   The Member State of residence may also require a Community national entitled to stand as a candidate to produce a valid identity document. It may also require him to indicate the date from which he has been a national of a Member State.\nArticle 11\n1.   The Member State of residence shall inform the person concerned of the action taken on his application for entry on the electoral roll or of the decision concerning the admissibility of his application to stand as a candidate.\n2.   Should a person be refused entry on the electoral roll or his application to stand as a candidate be rejected, the person concerned shall be entitled to legal remedies on the same terms as the legislation of the Member State of residence prescribes for voters and persons entitled to stand as candidates who are its nationals.\nArticle 12\nThe Member State of residence shall inform Community voters and Community nationals entitled to stand as candidates in good time and in an appropriate manner of the conditions and detailed arrangements for the exercise of the right to vote and to stand as a candidate in elections in that State.\nArticle 13\nMember States shall exchange the information required for the implementation of Article 4. To that end, the Member State of residence shall, on the basis of the formal declaration referred to in Articles 9 and 10, supply the home Member State, sufficiently in advance of polling day, with information on the latter State's nationals entered on electroal rolls or standing as candidates. The home Member State shall, in accordance with its national legislation, take appropriate measures to ensure that its nationals do not vote more than once or stand as candidates in more than one Member State.\nCHAPTER III\nDEROGATIONS AND TRANSITIONAL PROVISIONS\nArticle 14\n1.   If on 1 January 1993, in a given Member State, the proportion of citizens of the Union of voting age who reside in it but are not nationals of it exceeds 20 % of the total number of citizens of the Union residing there who are of voting age, that Member State may, by way of derogation from Articles 3, 9 and 10:\n(a)\nrestrict the right to vote to Community voters who have resided in that Member State for a minimum period, which may not exceed five years;\n(b)\nrestrict the right to stand as a candidate to Community nationals entitled to stand as candidates who have resided in that Member State for a minimum period, which may not exceed 10 years.\nThese provisions are without prejudice to appropriate measures which this Member State may take with regard to the composition of lists of candidates and which are intended in particular to encourage the integration of non-national citizens of the Union.\nHowever, Community voters and Community nationals entitled to stand as candidates who, owing to the fact that they have taken up residence outside their home Member State or by reason of the duration of such residence, do not have the right to vote or to stand as candidates in that home State shall not be subject to the conditions as to length of residence set out above.\n2.   Where, on 1 February 1994, the laws of a Member State prescribe that the nationals of another Member State who reside there have the right to vote for the national parliament of that State and, for that purpose, may be entered on the electoral roll of that State under exactly the same conditions as national voters, the first Member State may, by way of derogation from this Directive, refrain from applying Articles 6 to 13 in respect of such nationals.\n3.   By 31 December 1997 and thereafter 18 months prior to each election to the European Parliament, the Commission shall submit to the European Parliament and to the Council a report in which it shall check whether the grant to the Member States concerned of a derogation pursuant to Article 8b (2) of the EC Treaty is still warranted and shall propose that any necessary adjustments be made.\nMember States which invoke derogations under paragraph 1 shall furnish the Commission with all the necessary background information.\nArticle 15\nFor the fourth direct elections to the European Parliament, the following special provisions shall apply:\n(a)\ncitizens of the Union who, on 15 February 1994, already have the right to vote in the Member State of residence and whose names appear on the electoral roll in the Member State of residence shall not be subject to the formalities laid down in Article 9;\n(b)\nMember States in which the electoral rolls have been finalized before 15 February 1994 shall take the steps necessary to enable Community voters who wish to exercise their right to vote there to enter names on the electoral roll sufficiently in advance of polling day;\n(c)\nMember States which do not draw up specific electoral rolls but indicate eligibility to vote in the population register and where voting is not compulsory may also apply this system to Community voters who appear on that register and who, having been informed individually of their rights, have not expressed a wish to exercise their right to vote in their home Member State. They shall forward to the home Member State the document showing the intention expressed by those voters to vote in the Member State of residence;\n(d)\nMember States in which the internal procedure for the nomination of candidates for political parties and groups is governed by law may provide that any such procedures which, in accordance with that law, were opened before 1 February 1994 and the decisions taken within that framework shall remain valid.\nCHAPTER IV\nFINAL PROVISIONS\nArticle 16\nThe Commission shall submit a report to the European Parliament and the Council by 31 December 1995 on the application of this Directive to the June 1994 elections to the European Parliament. On the basis of the said report the Council, acting unanimously on a proposal from the Commission and after consulting the European Parliament, may adopt provisions amending this Directive.\nArticle 17\nMember States shall adopt the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive no later than 1 February 1994. They shall forthwith inform the Commission thereof.\nWhen Member States adopt these measures, they shall contain a reference to this Directive or shall be accompanied by such reference on the occasion of their official publication. The methods of making such reference shall be laid down by Member States.\nArticle 18\nThis Directive shall enter into force on the day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.\nArticle 19\nThis Directive is addressed to the Member States.\nDone at Brussels, 6 December 1993.\nFor the Council\nThe President\nW.

The person must:\nbe an EU citizen;\nbe resident in the EU country in which s/he proposes to vote or to stand as a candidate;\nsatisfy the same conditions as a national of that EU country who wishes to vote or to stand as a candidate (the principle of equality between national and non-national voters).\nSimpler procedures for submitting applications to stand as candidateThe directive was amended in 2013 to simplify the procedures for submitting candidates’ applications where they reside in an EU country of which they are not nationals. Previously, EU citizens in this situation had to provide a certificate from their country of citizenship that they were not disqualified from standing in EP elections in that country. Since 2014, when EU citizens submit their application to stand for election, they can provide a declaration instead of the certificate. The authorities of their EU country of residence must liaise with the country of nationality to verify the validity of the declaration. To ensure efficient communication, EU countries must each designate one contact point to be responsible for the notification of information concerning such candidates.\nExercise of the right to vote and to stand as a candidate\nEU citizens may exercise their right to vote and to stand as a candidate either in the EU country of residence or in their home country. No one may vote more than once or stand as a candidate in more than one EU country at the same election.\nRegistration on electoral rollVoters are to be entered on the electoral roll of their country of residence only if they so request in advance. In EU countries where nationals are legally obliged to vote, non-national voters who ask to be entered on the electoral roll are subject to the same obligation.In order to have their names entered on the electoral roll, non-national voters must produce the same documents as national voters. In addition, they must provide further information in the form of a formal declaration.\nLegal remediesThe legal remedies available to nationals must also be available to non-nationals who are refused entry on the electoral roll or whose application to stand as a candidate is rejected.\nNational rules regarding nationals living outside their territory\nNothing in Directive 93/109/EC can affect each EU country’s rules concerning the right to vote or to stand as a candidate of its nationals who reside outside its electoral territory.\nFROM WHEN DOES THE DIRECTIVE APPLY?\n              \nThe directive has applied since 30 December 1993. It had to become law in the EU countries by 1 February 1994.\nBACKGROUND\n              \nFor more information, see:\nEuropean Parliament elections (Your Europe).\nMAIN DOCUMENT\n            \nCouncil Directive 93/109/EC of 6 December 1993 laying down detailed arrangements for the exercise of the right to vote and stand as a candidate in elections to the European Parliament for citizens of the Union residing in a Member State of which they are not nationals (OJ L 329, 30.12.1993, pp. 34-38)\nSuccessive amendments to Directive 93/109/EC have been incorporated into the original document.
