{"celex_id": "32004L0037", "reference": "30.4.2004\nEN\nOfficial Journal of the European Communities\nL 158/50\nDIRECTIVE 2004/37/EC OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL\nof 29 April 2004\non the protection of workers from the risks related to exposure to carcinogens or mutagens at work (Sixth individual Directive within the meaning of Article 16(1) of Council Directive 89/391/EEC)\n(codified version)\n(Text with EEA relevance)\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 137(2) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the Commission,\nHaving regard to the Opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee (1),\nHaving consulted the Committee of the Regions,\nActing in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty (2),\nWhereas:\n(1)\nCouncil Directive 90/394/EEC of 28 June 1990 on the protection of workers from the risks related to exposure to carcinogens at work (Sixth individual Directive within the meaning of Article 16(1) of Directive 89/391/EEC) (3) has been substantially amended several times (4). In the interests of clarity and rationality, the said Directive should therefore be codified.\n(2)\nCompliance with the minimum requirements designed to guarantee a better standard of health and safety as regards the protection of workers from the risks related to exposure to carcinogens or mutagens at work is essential to ensure the health and safety of workers and is also intended to provide a level of minimum protection for all workers in the Community.\n(3)\nThis Directive is an individual Directive within the meaning of Article 16(1) of Council Directive 89/391/EEC of 12 June 1989 on the introduction of measures to encourage improvements in the safety and health of workers at work (5). Therefore the provisions of that Directive are fully applicable to the exposure of workers to carcinogens or mutagens, without prejudice to more stringent and/or specific provisions contained in this Directive.\n(4)\nA consistent level of protection from the risks related to carcinogens or mutagens has to be established for the Community as a whole and that level of protection has to be set not by detailed prescriptive requirements but by a framework of general principles to enable Member States to apply the minimum requirements consistently.\n(5)\nGerm cell mutagens are substances that can cause a permanent change in the amount or structure of the genetic material of a cell resulting in a change in the phenotypic characteristics of that cell, which may be transferred to descendent daughter cells.\n(6)\nBecause of their mechanism of action, germ cell mutagens are likely to have carcinogenic effects.\n(7)\nAnnex VI to Council Directive 67/548/EEC of 27 June 1967 on the approximation of laws, regulations and administrative provisions relating to the classification, packaging and labelling of dangerous substances (6) contains the classification criteria and labelling procedures in respect of each substance.\n(8)\nDirective 1999/45/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 31 May 1999 on the approximation of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States relating to the classification, packaging and labelling of dangerous preparations (7) contains particulars on the classification criteria and labelling procedures in respect of such preparations.\n(9)\nIn all work situations workers must be protected in respect of preparations containing one or more carcinogens or mutagens and from carcinogenic or mutagenic compounds arising at work.\n(10)\nFor some agents it is necessary to consider all absorption pathways, including the possibility of penetration through the skin, in order to ensure the best possible level of protection.\n(11)\nAlthough current scientific knowledge is not such that a level can be established below which risks to health cease to exist, a reduction in exposure to carcinogens or mutagens will nonetheless reduce those risks.\n(12)\nIn order to contribute to a reduction in these risks, limit values and other directly related provisions should be established for all those carcinogens or mutagens for which the available information, including scientific and technical data, make this possible.\n(13)\nOccupational exposure limit values must be regarded as an important component of the general arrangements for the protection of workers. Such limit values must be revised whenever this becomes necessary in the light of more recent scientific data.\n(14)\nThe precautionary principle should be applied in the protection of workers' health.\n(15)\nPreventive measures must be taken for the protection of the health and safety of workers exposed to carcinogens or mutagens.\n(16)\nThis Directive constitutes a practical aspect of the realisation of the social dimension of the internal market.\n(17)\nPursuant to Council Decision 74/325/EEC (8), the Commission consulted the Advisory Committee on Safety and Health at Work with a view to drawing up proposals for the Directives taken over in this Directive.\n(18)\nThis Directive is without prejudice to the obligations of the Member States concerning the time limits for transposition set out in Part B of Annex IV,\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:\nCHAPTER I\nGENERAL PROVISIONS\nArticle 1\nObjective\n1.   This Directive has as its aim the protection of workers against risks to their health and safety, including the prevention of such risks, arising or likely to arise from exposure to carcinogens or mutagens at work.\nIt lays down particular minimum requirements in this area, including limit values.\n2.   This Directive shall not apply to workers exposed only to radiation covered by the Treaty establishing the European Atomic Energy Community.\n3.   Directive 89/391/EEC shall apply fully to the whole area referred to in paragraph 1, without prejudice to more stringent and/or specific provisions contained in this Directive.\n4.   As regards asbestos, which is dealt with by Directive 83/477/EEC (9), the provisions of this Directive shall apply whenever they are more favourable to health and safety at work.\nArticle 2\nDefinitions\nFor the purposes of this Directive,\na)\n\"carcinogen\" means:\ni)\na substance which meets the criteria for classification as a category 1 or 2 carcinogen set out in Annex VI to Directive 67/548/EEC;\nii)\na preparation composed of one or more substances referred to in point (i) where the concentration of one or more of the individual substances meets the requirements for concentration limits for the classification of a preparation as a category 1 or 2 carcinogen set out either:\nin Annex I to Directive 67/548/EEC; or\nin Part B of Annex II to Directive 1999/45/EC where the substance or substances do not appear in Annex I to Directive 67/548/EEC or appear in it without concentration limits;\niii)\na substance, preparation or process referred to in Annex I to this Directive as well as a substance or preparation released by a process referred to in that Annex;\nb)\n\"mutagen\" means:\ni)\na substance which meets the criteria for classification as a category 1 or 2 mutagen set out in Annex VI to Directive 67/548/EEC;\nii)\na preparation composed of one or more substances referred to in point (i) where the concentration of one or more of the individual substances meets the requirements for concentration limits for the classification of a preparation as a category 1 or 2 mutagen set out in either:\nAnnex I to Directive 67/548/EEC; or\nPart B of Annex II to Directive 1999/45/EC where the substance or substances do not appear in Annex I to Directive 67/548/EEC or appear in it without concentration limits;\nc)\n\"limit value\" means, unless otherwise specified, the limit of the time-weighted average of the concentration for a \"carcinogen or mutagen\" in the air within the breathing zone of a worker in relation to a specified reference period as set out in Annex III to this Directive.\nArticle 3\nScope — determination and assessment of risks\n1.   This Directive shall apply to activities in which workers are or are likely to be exposed to carcinogens or mutagens as a result of their work.\n2.   In the case of any activity likely to involve a risk of exposure to carcinogens or mutagens, the nature, degree and duration of workers' exposure shall be determined in order to make it possible to assess any risk to the workers' health or safety and to lay down the measures to be taken.\nThe assessment shall be renewed regularly and in any event when any change occurs in the conditions which may affect workers' exposure to carcinogens or mutagens.\nThe employer shall supply the authorities responsible at their request with the information used for making the assessment.\n3.   When assessing the risk, account shall be taken of all other routes of exposure, such as absorption into and/or through the skin.\n4.   When the risk assessment is carried out, employers shall give particular attention to any effects concerning the health or safety of workers at particular risk and shall, inter alia, take account of the desirability of not employing such workers in areas where they may come into contact with carcinogens or mutagens.\nCHAPTER II\nEMPLOYERS' OBLIGATIONS\nArticle 4\nReduction and replacement\n1.   The employer shall reduce the use of a carcinogen or mutagen at the place of work, in particular by replacing it, in so far as is technically possible, by a substance, preparation or process which, under its conditions of use, is not dangerous or is less dangerous to workers' health or safety, as the case may be.\n2.   The employer shall, upon request, submit the findings of his investigations to the relevant authorities.\nArticle 5\nPrevention and reduction of exposure\n1.   Where the results of the assessment referred to in Article 3(2) reveal a risk to workers' health or safety, workers' exposure must be prevented.\n2.   Where it is not technically possible to replace the carcinogen or mutagen by a substance, preparation or process which, under its conditions of use, is not dangerous or is less dangerous to health or safety, the employer shall ensure that the carcinogen or mutagen is, in so far as is technically possible, manufactured and used in a closed system.\n3.   Where a closed system is not technically possible, the employer shall ensure that the level of exposure of workers is reduced to as low a level as is technically possible.\n4.   Exposure shall not exceed the limit value of a carcinogen as set out in Annex III.\n5.   Wherever a carcinogen or mutagen is used, the employer shall apply all the following measures:\na)\nlimitation of the quantities of a carcinogen or mutagen at the place of work;\nb)\nkeeping as low as possible the number of workers exposed or likely to be exposed;\nc)\ndesign of work processes and engineering control measures so as to avoid or minimise the release of carcinogens or mutagens into the place of work;\nd)\nevacuation of carcinogens or mutagens at source, local extraction system or general ventilation, all such methods to be appropriate and compatible with the need to protect public health and the environment;\ne)\nuse of existing appropriate procedures for the measurement of carcinogens or mutagens, in particular for the early detection of abnormal exposures resulting from an unforeseeable event or an accident;\nf)\napplication of suitable working procedures and methods;\ng)\ncollective protection measures and/or, where exposure cannot be avoided by other means, individual protection measures;\nh)\nhygiene measures, in particular regular cleaning of floors, walls and other surfaces;\ni)\ninformation for workers;\nj)\ndemarcation of risk areas and use of adequate warning and safety signs including \"no smoking\" signs in areas where workers are exposed or likely to be exposed to carcinogens or mutagens;\nk)\ndrawing up plans to deal with emergencies likely to result in abnormally high exposure;\nl)\nmeans for safe storage, handling and transportation, in particular by using sealed and clearly and visibly labelled containers;\nm)\nmeans for safe collection, storage and disposal of waste by workers, including the use of sealed and clearly and visibly labelled containers.\nArticle 6\nInformation for the competent authority\nWhere the results of the assessment referred to in Article 3(2) reveal a risk to workers' health or safety, employers shall, when requested, make available to the competent authority appropriate information on:\na)\nthe activities and/or industrial processes carried out, including the reasons for which carcinogens or mutagens are used;\nb)\nthe quantities of substances or preparations manufactured or used which contain carcinogens or mutagens;\nc)\nthe number of workers exposed;\nd)\nthe preventive measures taken;\ne)\nthe type of protective equipment used;\nf)\nthe nature and degree of exposure;\ng)\nthe cases of replacement.\nArticle 7\nUnforeseen exposure\n1.

To reduce the risks associated with such exposure to workers’ health and safety, it lays down preventive and protective measures, as well as exposure limits.\nKEY POINTS\nScope\nThe directive applies to a substance or mixture which meets the criteria for classification as a category 1A or 1B carcinogen or category 1A or 1B germ cell mutagen set out in Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008 (Classification, packaging and labelling of chemicals and their mixtures). In addition, it applies to a carcinogenic substance, mixture or process referred to in Annex I to the directive, as well as a substance or mixture released by a process referred to in that annex. Following the amendment of the directive in 2017, this annex contains 6 entries:\n1.\nManufacture of auramine.\n2.\nWork involving exposure to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons present in coal soot, coal tar or coal pitch.\n3.\nWork involving exposure to dusts, fumes and sprays produced during the roasting and electro-refining of cupro-nickel mattes.\n4.\nStrong acid process in the manufacture of isopropyl alcohol.\n5.\nWork involving exposure to hardwood dusts.\n6.\nWork which generates respirable crystalline silica dust.\nThe directive does not apply to workers exposed only to radiation covered by the Treaty establishing the European Atomic Energy Community.\nIt applies to workers exposed to asbestos when its rules are more favourable to health and safety at work than those of Directive 2009/148/EC (Workers' protection from exposure to asbestos).Directive 89/391/EEC (Health and safety at work — general rules) applies in full, without prejudice to more binding and/or more specific rules contained in this directive.\nDetermining exposure and assessing risks\nIn the case of any activity likely to involve a risk of exposure to carcinogens or mutagens, the nature, degree and duration of workers’ exposure must be determined on a regular basis in order to assess any risk to workers’ health or safety and decide the steps to be taken. All routes of exposure must be taken into account, including absorption into and/or through the skin. Particular attention must be paid to workers who are especially at risk.\nDirective 2014/27/EU aligns Directive 2004/37/EC to Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008 which established a new system for the classification, labelling and packaging of substances and mixtures in the EU, based on the Globally Harmonised System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals at international level.\nDirective (EU) 2017/2398 updates Directive 2004/37/EC by:\namending Articles 6 (Information for the competent authority) and 14 (Health surveillance);\nintroducing a new Article 18a (Evaluation);\nrevising Annex I and Annex III, in order to bring respirable crystalline silica dust within the scope of the directive and to introduce new, or update the existing, occupational exposure limit values (OELs) for 13 carcinogens.\nEMPLOYERS’ OBLIGATIONS\nReduction and replacement\nEmployers must reduce the use of a carcinogen or mutagen, particularly by replacing it, in so far as is technically possible, by a substance, mixture or process that is not dangerous or is less dangerous.\nPrevention and reduction of exposure\nWhen it is not possible to replace the carcinogen or mutagen, the employer must ensure that the carcinogen or mutagen is manufactured and used in a closed system. If this is not technically possible, employers must ensure that the level of exposure is as low as is technically possible.\nExposure must not exceed the limits set out in Annex III.\nSeveral measures must be applied by the employer whenever a carcinogen or mutagen is used.\nInformation for the competent authority\nEmployers must provide the competent authority, on request, with information relating to such matters as, for instance, the reasons for using carcinogens or mutagens, the preventive measures taken or the number of workers exposed.\nUnforeseeable exposure\nIn the event of unforeseeable incidents or accidents likely to lead to workers being abnormally exposed, employers must inform their workers. Protective clothing and respiratory personal protective equipment must be worn, and exposure must be kept to the strict minimum necessary and only workers who are essential for the work shall be permitted to work in the concerned area.\nForeseeable exposure\nWhere there is a foreseeable risk of increased exposure, for example, during maintenance work, and after all other preventive measures have been taken, employers must decide the measures necessary to reduce the duration of workers’ exposure to the minimum possible and to ensure that they are protected during these activities. Protective clothing and individual respiratory personal protective equipment must be worn, and exposure must be kept to the strict minimum necessary. Moreover, the areas used for such activities must be clearly demarcated and indicated.\nAccess to risk areas\nEmployers must restrict access to risk areas to those workers who, by virtue of their work or duties, are required to enter such areas.\nMeasures regarding hygiene and personal protection\nEmployers are required to take the following measures regarding hygiene and personal protection for all activities that carry a risk of contamination:\nensure that workers do no eat, drink or smoke in work areas where there is a risk of contamination;\nsupply workers with the appropriate clothes and provide separate storage places for work clothes and street clothes;\nprovide washing and toilet facilities;\nproperly store, check and clean protective equipment before and after every use.\nWorkers must not bear the cost of these measures.\nInforming, training and consulting workers\nEmployers must take appropriate steps to ensure that workers and/or their representatives receive sufficient and suitable training about:\npotential and additional health risks (smoking);\nprecautions for preventing exposure;\nhygiene requirements;\nprotective equipment and clothing;\nmeasures to be taken in the event of an incident.\nEmployers must ensure that containers, packages and installations containing carcinogens or mutagens are clearly and legibly labelled, and that warning signs are clearly displayed.\nAppropriate measures must be taken to ensure that workers are able to check whether the directive is being applied correctly. They must be informed as quickly as possible in the event of abnormal exposure.\nEmployers must have an updated list of workers undertaking activities that carry a risk to their health and safety in terms of exposure to carcinogens and mutagens.\nWorkers and/or their representatives must be consulted about and involved in all matters related to exposure to carcinogens and mutagens.\nMISCELLANEOUS MEASURES\nHealth monitoring\nEU countries must establish arrangements for monitoring workers’ health so that, if appropriate, their health is adequately monitored prior to exposure and at regular intervals afterwards. These arrangements must be such that it is possible to apply individual and work-related health measures. When a worker’s health is monitored, an individual medical file is to be created.\nFollowing the amendment of Directive 2004/37/EC by Directive (EU) 2017/2398, health monitoring can, at the advice of a doctor or authority responsible for the health monitoring of workers, continue after the end of exposure for as long as considered to be necessary to safeguard the health of the worker concerned.\nPractical recommendations relating to the monitoring of workers’ health can be found in Annex II.\nAll cases of cancer identified as resulting from exposure at work must be notified to the competent authority. EU countries must take this information into account in their reports submitted to the European Commission under Directive 89/391/EEC.\nEvaluation\nDirective (EU) 2017/2398 requires the Commission to evaluate, as part of the next evaluation of the implementation of Directive 2004/37/EC, the need to modify the limit value for respirable crystalline silica dust.\nIn addition, by the first quarter of 2019, the Commission must, taking into account the latest developments in scientific knowledge, assess the option of amending the scope of this directive to include reprotoxic substances*.\nRecord-keeping\nThe up-to-date list of workers who have been exposed, which the employer is required to keep, and individual medical files are to be kept for at least 40 years after the end of exposure.\nLimit values\nFollowing the amendment of the Directive in 2017, Annex III contains the limit values for the following substances:\nHardwood dust\nChromium (VI) compounds which are carcinogens within the meaning of point (i) of Article 2(a) (as chromium)\nRefractory ceramic fibres which are carcinogens within the meaning of point (i) of Article 2(a)\nRespirable crystalline silica dust\nBenzene\nVinyl chloride monomer\nEthylene oxide\n1,2-Epoxypropane\nAcrylamide\n2-Nitropropane\no-Toluidine\n1,3-Butadiene\nHydrazine\nBromoethylene.\nFor vinyl chloride monomer and hardwood dusts, Directive (EU) 2017/2398 revises the limit values in the light of more recent scientific data. For 11 new carcinogens, occupational exposure limit values were introduced.\nFROM WHEN DOES THE DIRECTIVE APPLY?\n              \nIt has applied since 20 May 2004. Directive 2004/37/EC codifies and replaces Directive 90/394/EEC and its successive amendments, Directives 97/42/EC and 1999/38/EC. The deadlines for those directives to become national law (29 April 2003 at the latest) continued to apply.\nEU countries have to incorporate the measures introduced by Directive (EU) 2017/2398 into national law by 17 January 2020.\nBACKGROUND\n              \nFor more information, see:\nDirective 2004/37/EC — carcinogens or mutagens at work (European Agency for Safety and Health at Work).\nKEY TERMS\n              \nCarcinogens: substances with the potential to cause cancer in an organism.\nMutagens: substances that change the genetic material of an organism.\nReprotoxic substances: substances that interfere with reproduction.\nMAIN DOCUMENT\n            \nDirective 2004/37/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on the protection of workers from the risks related to exposure to carcinogens or mutagens at work (Sixth individual Directive within the meaning of Article 16(1) of Council Directive 89/391/EEC) (codified version) (OJ L 158, 30.4.2004, pp. 50-76).
