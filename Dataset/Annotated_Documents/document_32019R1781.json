The ecodesign working plan identifies the energy-related product groups to be considered as priorities for the undertaking of preparatory studies and eventual adoption of implementing measures, as well as the review of Commission Regulation (EC) No 640/2009 (3).\n(3)\nMeasures from the Working Plan have an estimated potential to deliver a total in excess of 260 TWh of annual final energy savings in 2030, which is equivalent to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by approximately 100 million tonnes per year in 2030. Electric motors is one of the product groups listed in the Working Plan, with an estimated 10 TWh of annual final energy savings in 2030.\n(4)\nThe Commission established ecodesign requirements for electric motors in Regulation (EC) No 640/2009 and pursuant to that Regulation, the Commission shall review that Regulation in the light of technological progress on both motors and drives.\n(5)\nPursuant to Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 640/2009, the Commission has reviewed Regulation (EC) No 640/2009 and analysed the technical, environmental and economic aspects of electric motors and drives. The review was carried out in close cooperation with stakeholders and interested parties from the Union and third countries. Its results were made public and presented to the Consultation Forum established pursuant to Article 18 of Directive 2009/125/EC.\n(6)\nThe review study shows that electric motor driven systems use about half the electricity produced in the Union. It is estimated that electric motors converted 1 425 TWh of electricity into mechanical energy and heat in 2015, corresponding to 560 Mt of CO2-equivalent emissions. This value is expected to rise to around 1 470 TWh by 2020 and to about 1 500 TWh by 2030.\n(7)\nThe review also shows that variable speed drives are placed on the Union’s market in large quantities, helping to control motor speed and increase energy efficiency of motor systems, with their use-phase energy consumption being the most significant environmental aspect of all life cycle phases. In 2015, variable speed drives converted about 265 TWh of electricity from the grid into electricity with a frequency suited for the driven application; this corresponds to 105 Mt of CO2 emissions. This value is expected to rise to around 380 TWh by 2020 and to about 570 TWh by 2030.\n(8)\nThe review indicates that Regulation (EC) No 640/2009 would save 57 TWh annually by 2020 and 102 TWh annually by 2030. As the provisions of that Regulation are being maintained, these savings will also continue to materialise.\n(9)\nThere is significant additional scope for improving these motor driven systems’ energy efficiency cost-effectively. One cost-effective way to do so is by making motors more energy-efficient, including motors not covered by Regulation (EC) No 640/2009, and using energy-efficient variable speed drives. This implies that ecodesign requirements for electric motors should be adjusted and ecodesign requirements set for variable speed drives, to realise their full potential for cost-effective energy efficiency.\n(10)\nEcodesign requirements should also include product information requirements that will help potential buyers make the most appropriate decision and make it easier for Member States to perform market surveillance.\n(11)\nMany motors are integrated in other products. To maximise cost-efficient energy saving, this Regulation should apply to such motors, provided that their efficiency can be tested separately.\n(12)\nThe environmental aspect of products in the scope of this Regulation that have been identified as significant for the purposes of this Regulation is energy consumption in the use phase.\n(13)\nElectric motors are used in many different types of products, such as pumps, fans or machine tools, and under many different operating conditions. The energy use of motor-driven systems can be reduced if motors in variable speed and load applications are equipped with variable speed drives, but also if these drives have their own minimum energy efficiency requirements. In fixed speed (constant load) applications, a variable speed drive induces additional costs and energy losses. The use of a variable speed drive should not, therefore, be mandatory under this Regulation.\n(14)\nImprovements in the electricity consumption of electric motors and variable speed drives should be achieved by applying existing, non-proprietary and cost-effective technologies that can reduce the total combined costs of purchasing and operating them.\n(15)\nEcodesign requirements should harmonise energy efficiency requirements for electric motors and variable speed drives throughout the Union, thus contributing to the smooth operation of the internal market and helping to improve these products’ environmental performance.\n(16)\nManufacturers should have enough time to redesign or adapt their products where needed. The timing should be such as to minimise negative impact on the functionalities of electric motors or variable speed drives. It should also take account of cost implications for manufacturers, including small and medium-sized enterprises, while ensuring that the objectives pursued by this Regulation are achieved in good time.\n(17)\nThe inclusion of motors not covered by Regulation (EC) No 640/2009, notably smaller and larger motors, in conjunction with updated minimum energy efficiency requirements that are in line with international standards and technological progress, and together with the inclusion of variable speed drives, should increase the market penetration of electric motors and variable speed drives with an improved life-cycle environmental impact. This should result in additional estimated net electricity savings of 10 TWh per year, and should reduce net greenhouse gas emissions by 3 Mt CO2 equivalent annually by 2030, compared with the situation that would prevail if no additional measures were taken.\n(18)\nAlthough the environmental impacts of medium voltage motors are relevant, for the time being no classification exists for the energy efficiency of electric motors with a rated voltage above 1 000 V. Once such a classification is developed, the possibility of setting minimum requirements for medium voltage motors should be reassessed.\n(19)\nAlthough the environmental impacts of submersible motors are relevant, there is, at the present time, no test standard that defines energy efficiency classes for these motors. Once such a test standard and classification is developed, the possibility of setting minimum requirements for submersible motors should be reassessed.\n(20)\nThe Commission communication on the circular economy (4) and the Communication on the ecodesign working plan (5) underline the importance of using the ecodesign framework to support the move towards a more resource efficient and circular economy. This Regulation should therefore, in order to cut the costs of repairing products containing motors that were placed on the market before the entry into force of the Regulation, or to avoid scrapping them early if they cannot be repaired, provide that motors supplied as spare parts be exempted for a given period. This is meant to avoid the problem that arises if it is impossible to replace a non-compliant motor by a compliant one without disproportionate costs to the end-user. If such motors are intended for the repair of products for which specific availability of spare parts provisions covering motors have been set in other ecodesign regulations, such specific provisions have precedence over the spare parts provisions in this Regulation.\n(21)\nIn particular situations, for instance, where safety, functionality or disproportionate costs are at stake, certain motors or variable speed drives (VSDs) should be exempted from efficiency requirements. However, this Regulation should nonetheless cover such products as regards product information requirements, such as information concerning disassembly, recycling or disposal at end-of-life, or other information useful for market surveillance purposes.\n(22)\nThe relevant product parameters should be determined using reliable, accurate and reproducible methods. These methods should take into account the recognised state-of-the-art methods including, where available, harmonised standards adopted by the European standardisation organisations, as listed in Annex I to Regulation (EU) No 1025/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council (6).\n(23)\nAn appropriate standard to determine the specific duty types S1, S3 or S6 is IEC 60034-1:2017. Appropriate standards to determine Ex eb increased safety motors and other explosion-protected motors are IEC/EN 60079-7:2015, IEC/EN 60079-31:2014 or IEC/EN 60079-1:2014.\n(24)\nIn accordance with Article 8(2) of Directive 2009/125/EC, this Regulation should specify the applicable conformity assessment procedures.\n(25)\nCompliance of products should be demonstrated either when the product is placed on the market or when it is put into service, not both.\n(26)\nTo facilitate compliance checks, manufacturers, importers or authorised representatives should provide the information in the technical documentation referred to in Annexes IV and V to Directive 2009/125/EC, insofar as that information relates to the requirements laid down in this Regulation.\n(27)\nTo improve the effectiveness of this Regulation and to protect consumers, products that automatically alter their performance in test conditions to improve the declared parameters should be prohibited from being placed on the market or put into service.\n(28)\nTo facilitate verification testing, market surveillance authorities should be allowed to test, or witness the testing of, larger motors at premises such as those of the manufacturer.\n(29)\nIn addition to the legally binding requirements laid down in this Regulation, benchmarks for best available technologies should be identified to make information on product’s environmental performance over their life-cycle subject to this Regulation widely available and easily accessible in accordance with Directive 2009/125/EC, Annex I, part 3, point (2).\n(30)\nA review of this Regulation should assess the appropriateness and effectiveness of its provisions in achieving its goals. The timing of the review should be sufficient for all provisions to be implemented and show an effect on the market.\n(31)\nRegulation (EC) No 640/2009 should therefore be repealed.\n(32)\nEcodesign requirements on circulators integrated in boilers are set out in Commission Regulation (EC) No 641/2009 (7). To ensure that installed boilers with a defective circulator can be repaired within their technical lifetime, the exemption in that regulation for circulators provided as a spare part for existing boilers should be extended.\n(33)\nThe measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee established by Article 19(1) of Directive 2009/125/EC,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nArticle 1\nSubject matter\nThis Regulation establishes ecodesign requirements for the placing on the market or the putting into service of electric motors and variable speed drives, including where they are integrated in other products.\nArticle 2\nScope\n(1)\nThis Regulation applies to the following products:\n(a)\ninduction electric motors without brushes, commutators, slip rings or electrical connections to the rotor, rated for operation on a 50 Hz, 60 Hz or 50/60 Hz sinusoidal voltage, that:\n(i)\nhave two, four, six or eight poles;\n(ii)\nhave a rated voltage U\nN above 50 V and up to and including 1 000 V;\n(iii)\nhave a rated power output P\nN from 0,12 kW up to and including 1 000 kW;\n(iv)\nare rated on the basis of continuous duty operation; and\n(v)\nare rated for direct on-line operation;\n(b)\nvariable speed drives with 3 phases input that:\n(i)\nare rated for operating with one motor refered to in point (a), within the 0,12 kW-1 000 kW motor rated output range;\n(ii)\nhave a rated voltage above 100 V and up to and including 1 000 V AC;\n(iii)\nhave only one AC voltage output.\n(2)\nThe requirements in section 1, and points (1), (2), (5) to (11), and (13) of section 2 of Annex I shall not apply to the following motors:\n(a)\nmotors completely integrated into a product (for example into a gear, pump, fan or compressor) and whose energy performance cannot be tested independently from the product, even with the provision of a temporary end-shield and drive-end bearing; the motor must share common components (apart from connectors such as bolts) with the driven unit (for example, a shaft or housing) and shall not be designed in such a way that the motor can be separated in its entirety from the driven unit and operate independently.

Calculations have to be performed with respect to component manufacturer’s data with typical values of power semiconductors at the actual VSD operating temperature or at the maximum operating temperature specified in the datasheet. When no component manufacturer data is available, losses shall be determined by measurement. Combination of calculated and measured losses are allowed. The different individual losses are calculated or measured separately and the total losses are determined as the sum of all individual losses.\nANNEX III\nVERIFICATION PROCEDURE FOR MARKET SURVEILLANCE PURPOSES\nThe verification tolerances defined in this Annex relate only to the verification of the measured parameters by Member State authorities and shall not be used by the manufacturer, importer or authorised representative as an allowed tolerance to establish the values in the technical documentation or in interpreting these values with a view to achieving compliance or to communicate better performance by any means.\nWhere a model has been designed to be able to detect it is being tested (e.g. by recognising the test conditions or test cycle), and to react specifically by automatically altering its performance during the test with the objective of reaching a more favourable level for any of the parameters specified in this Regulation or included in the technical documentation or included in any of the documentation provided, the model and all equivalent models shall be considered not compliant.\nWhen verifying that a product model complies with the requirements laid down in this Regulation pursuant to Article 3(2) of Directive 2009/125/EC the authorities of the Member States shall apply the following procedure for the requirements referred to in Annex I.\n(1)\nThe Member State authorities shall verify one single unit of the model.\n(2)\nThe model shall be considered to comply with the applicable requirements if:\n(a)\nthe values given in the technical documentation pursuant to point 2 of Annex IV to Directive 2009/125/EC (declared values) and where applicable the values used to calculate these values are not more favourable for the manufacturer, importer or authorised representative than the results of the corresponding measurements carried out pursuant to point (g) thereof; and\n(b)\nthe declared values meet any requirements laid down in this Regulation and any required product information published by the manufacturer, importer or authorised representative does not contain values that are more favourable for the manufacturer, importer or authorised representative than the declared values; and\n(c)\nwhen the Member State authorities test the unit of the model, the determined values (the values of the relevant parameters as measured in testing and the values calculated from these measurements) comply with the respective verification tolerances as set out in Table 7.\n(3)\nIf the results referred to in points (2)(a) or (2)(b) are not achieved the model and all equivalent models shall be considered not to comply with this Regulation.\n(4)\nIf the result referred to in point (2)(c) is not achieved;\n(a)\nfor models that are produced in quantities of less than five per year including equivalent models, the model and all equivalent models shall be considered not to comply with this Regulation;\n(b)\nfor models that are produced in quantities of five or more per year including equivalent models, the Member State authorities shall select three additional units of the same model for testing. As an alternative, the three additional units selected may be one or more of equivalent models.\n(5)\nThe model shall be considered to comply with the applicable requirements if for these three units the arithmetical mean of the determined values complies with the respective verification tolerances given in Table 7.\n(6)\nIf the result referred to in point (5) is not achieved the model and all equivalent models shall be considered not to comply with this Regulation.\n(7)\nThe Member State authorities shall provide all relevant information to the authorities of the other Member States and to the Commission without delay after a decision is taken on the non-compliance of the model according to points (3) or (6).\nThe Member State authorities shall use the measurement and calculation methods set out in Annex II.\nGiven the weight and size limitations for the transportation of motors with a rated power output of 375 to 1 000 kW Member States authorities may decide to undertake the verification procedure at the premises of manufacturers, authorised representatives or importers before the products are put into service. The Member State authority can do this verification using its own testing equipment.\nIf factory acceptance tests are planned for such motors, which will test parameters laid down in Annex I of this Regulation, the Member State authorities may decide to use witnessed testing during these factory acceptance tests to gather test results which can be used to verify compliance of the motor under investigation. The authorities may request a manufacturer, authorised representative or importer to disclose information on any planned factory acceptance tests relevant for witnessed testing.\nIn the cases mentioned in the two paragraphs above, the Member States authorities only need to verify one single unit of the model. If the result referred to in point 2(c) is not achieved, the model and all equivalent models shall be considered not to comply with this regulation.\nThe Member State authorities shall only apply the tolerances set out in Table 7 and shall only use the procedure described in points (1) to (7) for the requirements referred to in this Annex. For the parameters in Table 7, no other tolerances such as those set out in harmonised standards or in any other measurement method shall be applied.\nTable 7\nVerification tolerances\nParameters\nVerification tolerances\nTotal losses (1-η) for motors with a rated output equal to or above 0,12 kW and equal to or below 150 kW.\nThe determined value (*1) shall not exceed the value (1-η) calculated based on the declared η by more than 15 %.\nTotal losses (1-η) for motors with a rated output of above 150 kW and equal to or below 1 000  kW.\nThe determined value (*1) shall not exceed the value (1-η) calculated based on the declared η by more than 10 %.\nTotal losses for variable speed drives.\nThe determined value (*1) shall not exceed the declared value by more than 10 %.\n(*1)  In the case of three additional units tested as prescribed in point 4(b), the determined value means the arithmetical mean of the values determined for these three additional units.\nANNEX IV\nBENCHMARKS\nAt the time of adoption of this Regulation the best available technology on the market for the environmental aspects that were considered significant and are quantifiable is indicated below.\nFor motors the IE4 level was identified as the best available technology. Motors with losses that are 20 % lower exist but within limited availability and not in all power ranges covered by this Regulation and not in the form of induction motors.\nFor variable speed drives, the best available technology on the market corresponds to 20 % of the reference power losses referred to in Table 6. By utilising silicon carbide technologies (SiC MOFSET), semiconductor losses could be further reduced by about 50 % compared to a conventional solution.", "summary": "Ecodesign requirements — electric motors and variable speed drives\nEcodesign requirements — electric motors and variable speed drives\nSUMMARY OF:\nRegulation (EU) 2019/1781 laying down ecodesign requirements for electric motors and variable speed drives\nWHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?\n              \nThe regulation establishes ecodesign* requirements for the placing on the market or putting into service of electric motors* and variable speed drives (VSD)*, including where they are integrated in other products.\nKEY POINTS\n              \nThe regulation applies to:\ninduction electric motors without brushes, commutators, slip rings or electrical connections to the rotor, rated for operation on a 50 Hz, 60 Hz or 50/60 Hz sinusoidal voltage, that have 2, 4, 6 or 8 poleshave a rated voltage above 50 V and up to and including 1,000 Vhave a rated power output from 0.12 kW up to and including 1,000 kWare rated on the basis of continuous duty operation andare rated for direct online operation;\nVSDs with a 3-phase input that are rated for operating with a motor referred to above, within the 0.12 kW-1,000 kW motor rated output rangehave a rated voltage above 100 V and up to and including 1,000 V AC andhave only 1 AC voltage output.\nSome types of equipment designed to operate in certain conditions are exempt from some of the energy efficiency and product information requirements, such as:\nmotors or VSDs completely integrated into a product (e.g. into a gear, pump, fan or compressor) and whose energy performance cannot be tested independently;\nmotors specifically designed to operate exclusively at high altitudes or in extreme temperatures;\nmotors specifically designed and specified to operate wholly immersed in a liquid;\nmotors or VSDs specifically qualified for the safety of nuclear installations;\nexplosion-protected motors specifically designed and certified for mining;\nmotors in cordless or battery-operated equipment;\nmotors in handheld equipment whose weight is supported by hand during operation;\nmotors in hand-guided mobile equipment moved while in operation;\nmotors placed on the market before 1 July 2029 as substitutes for identical motors integrated in products placed on the market before 1 July 2021 for motors referred to in Annex I(1)(a), and before 1 July 2023 for motors referred to in Annex I(1)(b), and specifically marketed as such (see Amending Commission Regulation (EU) 2021/341);\nmotors designed specifically for the traction of electric vehicles.\nThe regulation:\nsets out a timetable in Annex I for the introduction of ecodesign requirements (initially 1 July 2021, with further requirements being introduced from 1 July 2022 and from 1 July 2023).
