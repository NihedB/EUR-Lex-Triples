A Community system is hereby established for the purpose of identifying and making known as rapidly as possible to all the competent authorities of the Member States and the Commission operators presenting, on the grounds of experience acquired with them as regards the proper execution of their previous obligations, a risk of non-reliability in connection with tendering procedures, export refunds and sales at reduced prices or intervention products, financed by the Guarantee Section of the EAGGF.\n2.   For the purposes of this Regulation, ‘operators presenting a risk of non-reliability’ means operators, whether natural or legal persons, who:\n(a)\naccording to a final decision of an administrative or judicial authority, have deliberately or through serious negligence committed an irregularity in respect of relevant Community provisions and have unjustly benefited from a financial advantage or attempted to benefit therefrom;\n(b)\nhave been the subject, in this respect, on the basis of established facts, of a preliminary administrative or judicial report by the competent authorities of the Member State.\n3.   Pending the entry into force of horizontal provisions defining irregularities, the conduct referred to in paragraph 2 (a) shall be defined in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 5.\nArticle 2\n1.   The identification procedures and rules relating to notification shall be implemented on the initiative of the Member State in which the risk of the operator's non-reliability is identified.\n2.   Where a Member State fails to fulfil its obligation under paragraph 1 the Commission shall, within the framework of the existing legal provisions, ensure that the identification and notification system is implemented by the Member State concerned.\nArticle 3\n1.   Member States shall take the following measures to deal with the operators referred to in Article 1 (2) (a):\n(a)\nreinforced checking of all operations performed by the operator, and/or\n(b)\nsuspension, going as far as an administrative determination of the existence of an irregularity or of the absence of an irregularity, of payment of amounts relating to current operations, to be determined, and, where appropriate, of release of the guarantee relating thereto, and/or\n(c)\ntheir exclusion for a period of time from operations to be determined.\nThe measures referred to under points (b) and (c) shall be determined by the competent authorities of the Member State in accordance with criteria laid down in accordance with the procedure provided for in Article 5, having due regard to the risk of further irregularities that may be committed by the operator. They shall be adopted after any formalities relating thereto laid down in the laws of the Member States have been completed.\n2.   As regards the operators referred to in Article 1 (2) (b), only the measures set out in paragraph 1 points (a) and (b) shall apply.\n3.   Where, under a tendering procedure, the Commission itself awards a contract, it shall, as appropriate, take or propose to the Member State, one or more of the measures set out in paragraph 1.\nArticle 4\n1.   The measures referred to in Article 3 shall comply with the following principles, in accordance with the national law of the Member State:\n(a)\na prior hearing and right of appeal by the operator concerned in respect of the measures referred to in Article 3 (1) (c) and, where appropriate, (b);\n(b)\nproportionality between the irregularity committed or suspected and one or other of the measures referred to in Article 3 (1), subject to the provisions to be established in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 5;\n(c)\nnon-discrimination between operators.\n2.
