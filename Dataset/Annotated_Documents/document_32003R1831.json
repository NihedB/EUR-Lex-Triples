{"celex_id": "32003R1831", "reference": "18.10.2003\nEN\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\nL 268/29\nREGULATION (EC) No 1831/2003 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL\nof 22 September 2003\non additives for use in animal nutrition\n(Text with EEA relevance)\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Articles 37 and 152(4)(b) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the Commission (1),\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee (2),\nFollowing consultation of the Committee of the Regions,\nActing in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty (3),\nWhereas:\n(1)\nLivestock production occupies a very important place in the agriculture of the Community. Satisfactory results depend to a large extent on the use of safe and good-quality feedingstuffs.\n(2)\nThe free movement of safe and wholesome food and feed is an essential aspect of the internal market and contributes significantly to the health and well-being of citizens, and to their social and economic interests.\n(3)\nA high level of protection of human life and health should be assured in the pursuit of Community policies.\n(4)\nIn order to protect human health, animal health and the environment, feed additives should undergo a safety assessment through a Community procedure before being placed on the market, used or processed within the Community. Since pet food is not part of the human food chain and has no environmental impact on arable land, specific provisions for additives in pet food are appropriate.\n(5)\nIt is a principle of the Community food law enshrined in Article 11 of Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 28 January 2002 laying down the general principles of food law, establishing the European Food Safety Authority and laying down procedures in matters of food safety (4) that food and feed imported for placing on the market within the Community must comply with the relevant requirements of Community legislation or with conditions recognised by the Community to be at least equivalent thereto. It is therefore necessary to subject imports from third countries of additives for use in animal nutrition to requirements equivalent to those applying to additives produced in the Community.\n(6)\nAction by the Community relating to human health, animal health and the environment should be based on the precautionary principle.\n(7)\nIn accordance with Article 153 of the Treaty, the Community is to contribute to promoting the right of consumers to information.\n(8)\nExperience with the application of Council Directive 70/524/EEC of 23 November 1970 concerning additives in feedingstuffs (5) has shown that it is necessary to review all the rules on additives in order to take into account the need to ensure a greater degree of protection of animal and human health and of the environment. It is also necessary to take into account the fact that technological progress and scientific developments have made available new types of additives, such as those to be used on silage or in water.\n(9)\nThis Regulation should also cover mixtures of additives sold to the end-user, and the marketing and use of those mixtures should comply with the conditions laid down in the authorisation of each single additive.\n(10)\nPremixtures should not be regarded as preparations covered by the definition of additives.\n(11)\nThe basic principle in this field should be that only those additives approved under the procedure provided for in this Regulation may be placed on the market, used and processed in animal feeding under conditions set out in the authorisation.\n(12)\nCategories of feed additives should be defined in order to facilitate the assessment procedure with a view to authorisation. Amino acids, their salts and analogues, and urea and its derivatives, which are currently covered by Council Directive 82/471/EEC of 30 June 1982 concerning certain products used in animal nutrition (6), should be included as a category of feed additives and therefore transferred from the scope of that Directive to this Regulation.\n(13)\nImplementing rules concerning applications for authorisation of feed additives should take into account different documentation requirements for food-producing and other animals.\n(14)\nIn order to ensure a harmonised scientific assessment of feed additives, such assessment should be carried out by the European Food Safety Authority, established by Regulation (EC) No 178/2002. Applications should be supplemented by residue studies in order to assess the establishment of Maximum Residues Limits (MRLs).\n(15)\nThe Commission should establish guidelines for the authorisation of feed additives in cooperation with the European Food Safety Authority. In establishing these guidelines, attention should be paid to the possibility of extrapolating the results of the studies carried out on major species to minor species.\n(16)\nIt is also necessary to provide for a simplified authorisation procedure for those additives which have successfully undergone the authorisation procedure for food use provided for in Council Directive 89/107/EEC of 21 December 1988 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States concerning food additives authorised for use in foodstuffs intended for human consumption (7).\n(17)\nIt is recognised that scientific risk assessment alone cannot, in some cases, provide all the information on which a risk management decision should be based, and that other factors relevant to the matter under consideration should legitimately be taken into account, including societal, economic or environmental factors, feasibility of controls and the benefit for the animal or for the consumer of animal products. Therefore, the authorisation of an additive should be granted by the Commission.\n(18)\nIn order to ensure the necessary level of protection for animal welfare and consumer safety, applicants should be encouraged to seek authorisation extensions for minor species by being granted one year's additional data protection in addition to the 10 years' data protection for all species for which the additive is authorised.\n(19)\nCompetence for authorising feed additives and establishing conditions for their use and for maintaining and publishing a register of authorised feed additives should be conferred on the Commission in accordance with a procedure by which close collaboration between Member States and the Commission is guaranteed in the framework of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health.\n(20)\nIt is necessary to introduce, where appropriate, an obligation for the holder of the authorisation to implement a post-market monitoring plan in order to trace and identify any direct or indirect, immediate, delayed, or unforeseen effect resulting from the use of feed additives on human or animal health or the environment using a product tracing framework similar to that which already exists in other sectors and in line with the traceability requirements laid down in food law.\n(21)\nIn order to allow technological progress and scientific development to be taken into account, it is necessary to revise the authorisations of feed additives regularly. Time-limited authorisations should allow this review.\n(22)\nA register of authorised feed additives should be established, including product-specific information and detection methods. Non-confidential data should be made available to the public.\n(23)\nIt is necessary to establish transitional rules to take into account additives which are already on the market and which were authorised under Directive 70/524/EEC, and amino acids, their salts and analogues, urea and its derivatives, currently authorised under Directive 82/471/EEC, and silage agents, as well as additives for which the authorisation procedure is in progress. In particular, it is appropriate to provide that such products can remain on the market only insofar as notification with a view to their evaluation has been submitted to the Commission within one year after the entry into force of this Regulation.\n(24)\nA number of silage additives are currently marketed and used in the Community without an authorisation granted pursuant to Directive 70/524/EEC. While it is indispensable to apply the provisions of this Regulation to such substances in view of their nature and use, it is appropriate to apply the same transitional arrangements. In this way it will be possible to obtain information on all the substances currently used and to establish a list of them, which would allow safeguard measures to be taken, where appropriate, for those substances that do not fulfil the authorisation criteria mentioned in Article 5 of this Regulation.\n(25)\nThe Scientific Steering Committee stated in its opinion of 28 May 1999 that: ‘regarding the use of antimicrobials as growth promoting agents, the use of agents from classes which are or may be used in human or veterinary medicine (i.e. where there is a risk of selecting for cross-resistance to drugs used to treat bacterial infections) should be phased out as soon as possible and ultimately abolished’. The second opinion of the Scientific Steering Committee on antimicrobial resistance adopted on 10 and 11 May 2001 confirmed the need to provide a sufficient time to replace those antimicrobials by alternative products: ‘Thus, the phase-out process must be planned and coordinated since precipitous actions could have repercussions for animal health’.\n(26)\nTherefore, it is necessary to set a date after which the use of the antibiotics still authorised for use as growth promoting agents will be forbidden, while allowing sufficient time for the development of alternative products to replace those antibiotics. Provision should also be made to forbid the authorisation of any further antibiotics for use as feed additives. Within the framework of the phasing out of antibiotics used as growth promoters and in order to ensure a high level of protection of animal health, the European Food Safety Authority will be asked to review the progress achieved in the development of alternative substances and alternative methods of management, feeding, hygiene, etc., before 2005.\n(27)\nCertain substances with coccidiostatic and histomonostatic effects should be considered as feed additives for the purposes of this Regulation.\n(28)\nDetailed labelling of the product should be required since it enables the end-user to make a choice with full knowledge of the facts, creates fewer obstacles to trade and facilitates fairness of transactions. In this respect, it is generally appropriate for requirements applying to feed additives to mirror the ones applying to food additives. It is therefore appropriate to provide for simplified labelling requirements for flavouring compounds similar to the ones applied to food flavourings; this should however be without prejudice to the possibility to provide for specific labelling requirements in the authorisation of individual additives.\n(29)\nRegulation (EC) No 1829/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 September 2003 on genetically modified food and feed (8) provides for an authorisation procedure for the placing on the market of genetically modified food and feed, including feed additives consisting of, containing or produced from genetically modified organisms. Since the objectives of the said Regulation are different from those of this Regulation, feed additives should undergo an authorisation procedure in addition to the authorisation procedure provided for by that Regulation before they are placed on the market.\n(30)\nArticles 53 and 54 of Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 establish procedures for taking emergency measures in relation to feed of Community origin or imported from a third country. They allow such measures to be adopted in situations where feed is likely to constitute a serious risk to human health, animal health or the environment and where such risk cannot be contained satisfactorily by measures taken by the Member State(s) concerned.\n(31)\nThe measures necessary for the implementation of this Regulation should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission (9).\n(32)\nMember States should lay down rules on penalties applicable to infringements of this Regulation and ensure that they are implemented. Those penalties must be effective, proportionate and dissuasive.\n(33)\nDirective 70/524/EEC should be repealed. However labelling provisions applicable to compound feedingstuffs incorporating additives should be maintained until a revision of Council Directive 79/373/EEC of 2 April 1979 on the marketing of compound feedingstuffs (10) is completed.\n(34)\nGuidelines addressed to the Member States for the presentation of an application dossier are contained in Council Directive 87/153/EEC of 16 February 1987 fixing guidelines for the assessment of additives in animal nutrition (11). Verification of the conformity of dossiers is entrusted to the European Food Safety Authority. It is therefore necessary to repeal Directive 87/153/EEC. However, the Annex should remain in force until implementing rules are adopted.\n(35)\nA transitional period is needed to avoid disruptions in the use of feed additives. Therefore, until the rules of this Regulation are applicable, the substances already authorised should be permitted to remain on the market and be used under the conditions of the current legislation,\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nCHAPTER I\nSCOPE AND DEFINITIONS\nArticle 1\nScope\n1.   The purpose of this Regulation is to establish a Community procedure for authorising the placing on the market and use of feed additives and to lay down rules for the supervision and labelling of feed additives and premixtures in order to provide the basis for the assurance of a high level of protection of human health, animal health and welfare, environment and users' and consumers' interests in relation to feed additives, whilst ensuring the effective functioning of the internal market.\n2.

The following definitions shall also apply:\n(a)\n‘feed additives’ means substances, micro-organisms or preparations, other than feed material and premixtures, which are intentionally added to feed or water in order to perform, in particular, one or more of the functions mentioned in Article 5(3);\n(b)\n‘feed materials’ means products as defined in Article 2(a) of Council Directive 96/25/EC of 29 April 1996 on the circulation of feed materials (13);\n(c)\n‘compound feedingstuffs’ means products as defined in Article 2(b) of Directive 79/373/EEC;\n(d)\n‘complementary feedingstuffs’ means products as defined in Article 2(e) of Directive 79/373/EEC;\n(e)\n‘premixtures’ means mixtures of feed additives or mixtures of one or more feed additives with feed materials or water used as carriers, not intended for direct feeding to animals;\n(f)\n‘daily ration’ means the average total quantity of feedingstuffs, calculated on a moisture content of 12 %, required daily by an animal of a given species, age category and yield, to satisfy all its needs;\n(g)\n‘complete feedingstuffs’ means products as defined in Article 2(c) of Council Directive 1999/29/EC of 22 April 1999 on the undesirable substances and products in animal nutrition (14);\n(h)\n‘processing aids’ means any substance not consumed as a feedingstuff by itself, intentionally used in the processing of feedingstuffs or feed materials to fulfil a technological purpose during treatment or processing which may result in the unintentional but technologically unavoidable presence of residues of the substance or its derivatives in the final product, provided that these residues do not have an adverse effect on animal health, human health or the environment and do not have any technological effects on the finished feed;\n(i)\n‘antimicrobials’ means substances produced either synthetically or naturally, used to kill or inhibit the growth of micro-organisms, including bacteria, viruses or fungi, or of parasites, in particular protozoa;\n(j)\n‘antibiotic’ means antimicrobials produced by, or derived from, a micro-organism, which destroys or inhibits the growth of other micro-organisms;\n(k)\n‘coccidiostats’ and ‘histomonostats’ means substances intended to kill or inhibit protozoa;\n(l)\n‘maximum residue limit’ means the maximum concentration of residue resulting from the use of an additive in animal nutrition which may be accepted by the Community as being legally permitted or recognised as acceptable in or on a food;\n(m)\n‘micro-organism’ means: colony-forming micro-organisms.\n(n)\n‘first placing on the market’ means the initial placing on the market of an additive after its manufacture, the import of an additive, or, where an additive has been incorporated into feed without being placed on the market, the first placing on the market of that feed.\n3.   Where necessary, it may be determined, in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 22(2), whether a substance, micro-organism or preparation is a feed additive within the scope of this Regulation.\nCHAPTER II\nAUTHORISATION, USE, MONITORING AND TRANSITIONAL MEASURES APPLICABLE FOR FEED ADDITIVES\nArticle 3\nPlacing on the market, processing and use\n1.   No person shall place on the market, process or use a feed additive unless:\n(a)\nit is covered by an authorisation granted in accordance with this Regulation;\n(b)\nthe conditions for use set out in this Regulation, including the general conditions set out in Annex IV, unless otherwise provided for in the authorisation, and in the authorisation of the substance are met; and\n(c)\nthe conditions on labelling set out in this Regulation are met.\n2.   For experiments for scientific purposes, Member States may authorise the use, as additives, of substances which are not authorised at Community level, with the exception of antibiotics, provided that the experiments are carried out in accordance with the principles and conditions laid down in Directive 87/153/EEC, Directive 83/228/EEC (15) or the guidelines set out in Article 7(4) of this Regulation and provided that there is adequate official supervision. The animals concerned may be used for food production only if the authorities establish that this will have no adverse effect on animal health, human health or the environment.\n3.   In the case of additives belonging to categories (d) and (e) of Article 6(1) and of those additives falling within the scope of Community legislation relating to the marketing of products consisting of, containing or produced from genetically modified organisms (GMOs), no person other than the holder of the authorisation named in the authorisation Regulation referred to in Article 9, his legal successor or successors, or a person acting under his written authority, shall first place the product on the market.\n4.   Unless otherwise specified, the mixing of additives to be sold directly to the end-user shall be allowed, subject to compliance with the conditions for use laid down in the authorisation for each single additive. Consequently, the mixing of authorised additives shall not be subject to specific authorisations other than the requirements laid down in Directive 95/69/EC (16).\n5.   Where necessary as a result of technological progress or scientific development, the general conditions set out in Annex IV may be adapted in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 22(2).\nArticle 4\nAuthorisation\n1.   Any person seeking an authorisation for a feed additive or for a new use of a feed additive shall submit an application in accordance with Article 7.\n2.   An authorisation shall not be granted, refused, renewed, modified, suspended or revoked except on the grounds and under the procedures set out in this Regulation, or in accordance with Articles 53 and 54 of Regulation (EC) No 178/2002.\n3.   The applicant for an authorisation or his representative shall be established in the Community.\nArticle 5\nConditions for authorisation\n1.   No feed additive shall be authorised unless the applicant for such authorisation has adequately and sufficiently demonstrated in accordance with the implementing measures referred to in Article 7 that, when used in accordance with conditions to be set out in the Regulation authorising the use of the additive, it satisfies the requirements of paragraph 2, and has at least one of the characteristics set out in paragraph 3.\n2.   The feed additive shall not:\n(a)\nhave an adverse effect on animal health, human health or the environment,\n(b)\nbe presented in a manner which may mislead the user,\n(c)\nharm the consumer by impairing the distinctive features of animal products or mislead the consumer with regard to the distinctive features of animal products.\n3.   The feed additive shall:\n(a)\nfavourably affect the characteristics of feed,\n(b)\nfavourably affect the characteristics of animal products,\n(c)\nfavourably affect the colour of ornamental fish and birds,\n(d)\nsatisfy the nutritional needs of animals,\n(e)\nfavourably affect the environmental consequences of animal production,\n(f)\nfavourably affect animal production, performance or welfare, particularly by affecting the gastro-intestinal flora or digestibility of feedingstuffs, or\n(g)\nhave a coccidiostatic or histomonostatic effect.\n4.   Antibiotics, other than coccidiostats or histomonostats, shall not be authorised as feed additives.\nArticle 6\nCategories of feed additives\n1.   A feed additive shall be allocated to one or more of the following categories, depending on its functions and properties, in accordance with the procedure set out at Articles 7, 8 and 9:\n(a)\ntechnological additives: any substance added to feed for a technological purpose;\n(b)\nsensory additives: any substance, the addition of which to feed improves or changes the organoleptic properties of the feed, or the visual characteristics of the food derived from animals;\n(c)\nnutritional additives;\n(d)\nzootechnical additives: any additive used to affect favourably the performance of animals in good health or used to affect favourably the environment;\n(e)\ncoccidiostats and histomonostats.\n2.   Within the categories referred to in paragraph 1, feed additives shall further be allocated within one or more of the functional groups mentioned in Annex I, according to their principal function or functions, in accordance with the procedure specified in Articles 7, 8 and 9.\n3.   Where necessary as a result of technological progress or scientific development, additional feed additive categories and functional groups may be established in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 22(2).\nArticle 7\nApplication for authorisation\n1.   An application for an authorisation as provided for in Article 4 shall be sent to the Commission. The Commission shall without delay inform the Member States and forward the application to the European Food Safety Authority (hereinafter referred to as the Authority).\n2.   The Authority shall:\n(a)\nacknowledge receipt of the application, including the particulars and documents referred to in paragraph 3, in writing, to the applicant within 15 days of its receipt, stating the date of receipt;\n(b)\nmake any information supplied by the applicant available to the Member States and the Commission;\n(c)\nmake the summary of the dossier mentioned in paragraph 3(h) available to the public, subject to the confidentiality requirements laid down in Article 18(2).\n3.   At the time of application, the applicant shall send the following particulars and documents directly to the Authority:\n(a)\nhis name and address;\n(b)\nthe identification of the feed additive, a proposal for its classification by category and functional group under Article 6, and its specifications, including, where applicable, purity criteria;\n(c)\na description of the method of production, manufacturing and intended uses of the feed additive, of the method of analysis of the additive in feed according to its intended use and, where appropriate, of the method of analysis for the determination of the level of residues of the feed additive, or its metabolites, in food;\n(d)\na copy of the studies which have been carried out and any other material which is available to demonstrate that the feed additive satisfies the criteria laid down in Article 5(2) and (3);\n(e)\nproposed conditions for placing the feed additive on the market, including labelling requirements and, where appropriate, specific conditions for use and handling (including known incompatibilities), use levels in complementary feedingstuffs and animal species and categories for which the feed additive is intended;\n(f)\na written statement that three samples of the feed additive have been sent by the applicant directly to the Community reference laboratory referred to in Article 21, in accordance with the requirements set out in Annex II;\n(g)\nfor additives which, according to the proposal under point (b), do not belong to either category (a) or category (b) referred to in Article 6(1), and for additives falling within the scope of Community legislation relating to the marketing of products consisting of, containing or produced from GMOs, a proposal for post-market monitoring;\n(h)\na summary containing the information provided under points (a) to (g);\n(i)\nfor additives falling within the scope of Community legislation relating to the marketing of products consisting of, containing or produced from GMOs, details of any authorisation granted in accordance with the applicable legislation.\n4.   The Commission, having first consulted the Authority, shall establish, in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 22(2), implementing rules for the application of this Article, including rules concerning the preparation and the presentation of the application.\nUntil such implementing rules are adopted, the application shall be made in accordance with the Annex to Directive 87/153/EEC.\n5.   After the Authority has been consulted, specific guidelines for the authorisation of additives shall be established, where necessary for each category of additive referred to in Article 6(1) in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 22(2). These guidelines shall take account of the possibility of extrapolating the results of the studies carried out on major species to minor species.\nAfter the Authority has been consulted, further rules for the implementation of this Article may be established in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 22(2). These rules should, where appropriate, differentiate between requirements for feed additives in respect of food-producing animals and requirements in respect of other animals, in particular pets. The implementing rules shall include provisions which allow for simplified procedures for the authorisation of additives which have been authorised for use in food.\n6.   The Authority shall publish detailed guidance to assist the applicant in the preparation and the presentation of its application.\nArticle 8\nOpinion of the Authority\n1.   The Authority shall give an opinion within six months of receipt of a valid application. This time limit shall be extended whenever the Authority seeks supplementary information from the applicant under paragraph 2.\n2.   The Authority may, where appropriate, request the applicant to supplement the particulars accompanying the application within a time limit specified by the Authority after consultation with the applicant.\n3.   In order to prepare its opinion, the Authority:\n(a)\nshall verify that the particulars and documents submitted by the applicant are in accordance with Article 7 and undertake an assessment in order to determine whether the feed additive complies with the conditions laid down in Article 5;\n(b)\nshall verify the report of the Community Reference Laboratory.\n4.   In the event of an opinion in favour of authorising the feed additive, the opinion shall also include the following elements:\n(a)\nthe name and address of the applicant;\n(b)\nthe designation of the feed additive including its categorisation and allocation within functional groups provided for in Article 6, its specification, including, where applicable, purity criteria and method of analysis;\n(c)\ndepending on the outcome of the assessment, specific conditions or restrictions in relation to handling, post-market monitoring requirements and use, including animal species and categories of animal species for which the additive is to be used;\n(d)\nspecific additional requirements for the labelling of the feed additive necessary as a result of conditions and restrictions imposed under (c);\n(e)\na proposal for the establishment of Maximum Residues Limits (MRLs) in the relevant foodstuffs of animal origin, unless the opinion of the Authority concludes that the establishment of MRLs is not necessary for the protection of consumers or MRLs have already been established in Annex I or III to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90 of 26 June 1990 laying down a Community procedure for the establishment of maximum residue limits of veterinary medicinal products in foodstuffs of animal origin (17).\n5.   The Authority shall without delay forward its opinion to the Commission, the Member States and the applicant, including a report describing its assessment of the feed additive and stating the reasons for its conclusion.\n6.   The Authority shall make its opinion public, after deletion of any information identified as confidential in accordance with Article 18(2).\nArticle 9\nAuthorisation by the Community\n1.   Within three months of receipt of the opinion of the Authority, the Commission shall prepare a draft Regulation to grant authorisation or to deny authorisation. This draft shall take into account the requirements of Article 5(2) and (3), Community law and other legitimate factors relevant to the matter under consideration and in particular benefits for animal health and welfare and for the consumer of animal products.\nWhere the draft is not in accordance with the opinion of the Authority, it shall provide an explanation of the reasons for the differences.\nIn exceptionally complex cases, the three-month deadline may be extended.\n2.   The draft shall be adopted in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 22(2).\n3.   Rules for the implementation of this Article and in particular concerning an identification number for authorised additives may be established in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 22(2).\n4.   The Commission shall without delay inform the applicant of the Regulation adopted in accordance with paragraph 2.\n5.   A Regulation granting the authorisation shall include the elements mentioned in Article 8(4)(b), (c), (d) and (e) and an identification number.\n6.   A Regulation granting authorisation for additives belonging to categories (d) and (e) referred to in Article 6(1) and also for additives consisting of, containing or produced from GMOs, shall include the name of the holder of the authorisation, and, where appropriate, the unique identifier attributed to the GMO as referred to in Regulation (EC) No 1830/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 September 2003 concerning traceability and labelling of genetically modified organisms and traceability of food and feed products produced from genetically modified organisms and amending Directive 2001/18/EC (18).\n7.   Where the levels of residues of an additive in food from animals fed with that additive might have a detrimental effect on human health, the Regulation shall include MRLs for the active substance or for its metabolites in the relevant foodstuffs of animal origin. In this case the active substance shall be considered for the purposes of Council Directive 96/23/EC (19) as falling under Annex I to that Directive. Where an MRL for the substance concerned has already been established in Community rules, that MRL shall also apply to residues of the active substance or its metabolites originating from the use of the substance as a feed additive.\n8.   The authorisation granted in accordance with the procedure laid down in this Regulation shall be valid throughout the Community for 10 years and shall be renewable in accordance with Article 14. The authorised feed additive shall be entered in the Register referred to in Article 17 (hereinafter referred to as the Register). Each entry in the Register shall state the date of authorisation and shall include the particulars referred to in paragraphs 5, 6 and 7.\n9.   The granting of authorisation shall be without prejudice to the general civil and criminal liability of any feed operator in respect of the feed additive concerned.\nArticle 10\nStatus of existing products\n1.   By way of derogation from Article 3, a feed additive which has been placed on the market pursuant to Directive 70/524/EEC and urea and derivatives, an amino acid, salt of an amino acid or analogous substance, which was listed in points 2.1, 3 and 4 of the Annex to Directive 82/471/EEC, may be placed on the market and used in accordance with the conditions specified in Directives 70/524/EEC or 82/471/EEC and their implementing measures, including in particular specific labelling provisions concerning compound feed and feed materials, provided that the following conditions are met:\n(a)\nwithin one year of the entry into force of this Regulation, persons first placing the feed additive on the market or any other interested parties shall notify this fact to the Commission. At the same time, the particulars mentioned in Article 7(3)(a), (b) and (c) shall be directly sent to the Authority;\n(b)\nwithin one year of the notification mentioned under (a), the Authority shall, after verification that all the information required has been submitted, notify the Commission that it has received the information required under this Article. The products concerned shall be entered in the Register. Each entry in the Register shall mention the date on which the product concerned was first entered in the Register and, where applicable, the expiry date of the existing authorisation.\n2.   An application shall be submitted in accordance with Article 7, at the latest one year before the expiry date of the authorisation given pursuant to Directive 70/524/EEC for additives with a limited authorisation period, and within a maximum of seven years after the entry into force of this Regulation for additives authorised without a time limit or pursuant to Directive 82/471/EEC. A detailed calendar listing in order of priority the different classes of additives to be re-evaluated may be adopted in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 22(2). The Authority shall be consulted in drawing up the list.\n3.   Products entered in the Register shall be subject to the provisions of this Regulation, in particular Articles 8, 9, 12, 13, 14 and 16, which without prejudice to specific conditions concerning the labelling, placing on the market and use of each substance pursuant to paragraph 1, shall apply to such products as if they had been authorised pursuant to Article 9.\n4.   In the case of authorisations not issued to a specific holder, any person who imports or manufactures the products referred to in this Article or any other interested party may submit the information as referred to in paragraph 1 or the application as referred to in paragraph 2 to the Commission.\n5.   Where the notification and accompanying particulars referred to in paragraph 1(a) are not supplied within the period specified or are found to be incorrect, or where an application is not submitted as required by paragraph 2 within the period specified, a Regulation shall be adopted, in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 22(2), requiring the additives concerned to be withdrawn from the market. Such a measure may provide for a limited period of time within which existing stocks of the product may be used up.\n6.   Where, for reasons beyond the control of the applicant, no decision is taken on the renewal of an authorisation before its expiry date, the period of authorisation of the product shall automatically be extended until the Commission takes a decision. The Commission shall inform the applicant of this extension of the authorisation.\n7.   By way of derogation from Article 3, substances, micro-organisms and preparations used in the Community as silage additives at the date referred to in Article 26(2), may be placed on the market and used provided that points (a) and (b) of paragraph 1 and paragraph 2 are complied with. Paragraphs 3 and 4 shall apply accordingly.

animal nutrition\nWHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?\n              \nIt sets out a standardised procedure for authorising feed additives* and lays down rules for their labelling, placing on the market and use.\nKEY POINTS\nScope\nThe regulation applies to all feed additives and premixtures*. It does not apply to:\nprocessing aids*; and\nveterinary medicinal products as defined by Directive 2001/82/EC.\nGeneral aspects\nOnly authorised additives may be placed on the market and used. Authorisations are granted for use in feed intended for specific animal species or categories and for specific conditions of use.\nAdditives may be classified as follows:\ntechnological (e.g. preservatives, antioxidants, emulsifiers, stabilising agents, acidity regulators, silage (grass or other green fodder compacted and stored in airtight conditions, typically in a silo) additives);\nsensory (e.g. flavourings, colourants);\nnutritional (e.g. vitamins, minerals, aminoacids, trace elements);\nzootechnical (e.g. digestibility enhancers, gut flora stabilisers);\ncoccidiostats and histomonostats.\nThese categories are themselves divided into functional groups according to the additives’ main functions.\nAntibiotics, other than coccidiostats or histomonostats, are not feed additives.\nAuthorisation types\nThere are 2 types of authorisations:\nAuthorisations issued to a holder of authorisation for additives in the ‘zootechnical additives’ and ‘coccidiostats and histomonostats’ categories, as well as additives consisting of, containing or produced from genetically modified organisms.\nAuthorisations issued to a holder of authorisation for substances belonging to the categories of additives ‘technological additives’, ‘sensory additives’ and ‘nutritional additives’.\nAuthorisations are valid for 10 years throughout the European Economic Area (EEA). They are renewable for 10-year period. An application for renewal must be sent to the European Commission at least 1 year before the authorisation expires. The procedure for renewal is set out in the regulation.\nThe regulation also lays down a procedure for modifying, suspending and revoking the authorisation.\nAuthorisation procedure\nApplications for authorisation are submitted to the Commission. The applications are notified to EU countries before they are forwarded to the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA).\nThe applicant must send to EFSA a copy of the application and the complete dossier: applicant’s name and address,a description of the method of production,manufacturing and intended uses of the additive,proposed conditions for placing the additive on the market,the safety and efficacy studies, etc..\nEFSA is responsible for conducting the risk assessment based on the dossier submitted by the applicant.\nThe applicant must also send samples of the additive to the Community Reference Laboratory for analysis.\nEFSA may ask the applicant for further information during the assessment procedure.\nAdditives intended for use in animal nutrition must receive a favourable opinion before their use and placing on the market is authorised. Within 6 months of receipt of an application, EFSA gives an opinion based on the information provided by the applicant. The evaluation report prepared by the reference laboratory is included in the opinion. If the opinion is favourable, it must include information on the specific conditions or restrictions relating to handling, monitoring requirements following placing on the market and use of the additive, including the animal species and categories of animals for which the additive is to be used. This includes information on specific additional requirements for labelling of the additive and, where appropriate, a proposal for the establishment of maximum residue limits in the relevant foodstuffs of animal origin.\nBased on the EFSA opinion, the Commission decides whether authorise or reject the authorisation of the additive. The Commission prepares a draft implementing regulation to grant or deny the authorisation. The Commission is assisted in the procedure by the Standing Committee on Plants, Animals, Food and Feed — Animal Nutrition section.\nFeed business operators are responsible for placing on the market and use of feed additives and for ensuring compliance with any conditions or restrictions imposed by the legislation.\nEU register\nThe Commission has established the European Union Register of Feed Additives, which is regularly updated, and it links to the relevant authorisation regulations. Those regulations include the specific requirements for placing the additives on the market.\nIt is composed of 2 parts:\nFirst part: Annex I — contains the list of modifications to the register and the current authorisations.\nSecond part: Annex II — contains a list of additives that will be withdrawn in the short term. This list also includes those for which a date is indicated in the column ‘Expiry date of authorisation’. Those additives are no longer allowed to be placed on the market if that date has expired.\nThe register is for information purposes and does not replace EU legal acts.\nLabelling\nAdditives must be labelled in a conspicuous, clearly, legible and indelible manner. The label must include the following information:\nthe specific name given to the additives upon authorisation, the functional group and their identification number;\nthe name and address or registered place of the person responsible for these particulars;\nthe net weight or net volume of the additives;\nwhere appropriate the approval number of the establishment manufacturing or placing the additive on the market;\ndirections for use and any safety recommendations regarding use and, where applicable;\nthe specific requirements mentioned in the authorisation;\nthe batch reference number and date of manufacture.\nThe regulation also sets requirements for the labelling of premixtures of feed additives.\nFrom when does the regulation apply?\nIt has applied since 18 October 2004.\nBACKGROUND\n              \nFor more information, see:\nFeed additives (European Commission).\nKEY TERMS\n              \nFeed additives: substances, micro-organisms or preparations, other than feed material and premixtures, which are intentionally added to feed or water in order to perform, in particular, one or more of the following functions:satisfy the nutritional needs of animals,favourably affect: the characteristics of feed or animal products;the colour of ornamental fish and birds;the environmental consequences of animal production;animal production;performance or welfare;or have a coccidiostatic or histomonostatic effect.\nPremixtures: mixtures of feed additives or mixtures of one or more feed additives with feed materials or water used as carriers, not intended for direct feeding to animals.\nProcessing aids: any substance which is not consumed as a feedingstuff by itself, intentionally used in the processing of feedingstuffs or feed materials to fulfil a technological purpose during treatment or processing.
