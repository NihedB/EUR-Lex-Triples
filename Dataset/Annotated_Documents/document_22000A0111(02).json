This Annex does not otherwise alter or prejudice the allocation of rights, interests and royalties between a Party and its nationals or participants, which will be determined by the laws and practices applicable to each Party.3. The Parties will also be guided by, and contractual arrangements should provide for, the following principles:(a) effective protection of intellectual property. The Parties shall ensure that they and/or their participants notify one another within a reasonable time of the creation of any intellectual property arising under the Agreement, of implementation arrangements and seek protection for such intellectual property in a timely fashion;(b) effective exploitation of results, taking into account the contributions of the Parties and their participants;(c) non-discriminatory treatment of participants from the other Party as compared with the treatment given to its own participants;(d) protection of business-confidential information.4.

The TMP will be approved by the responsible funding agency, or department of the Party involved in financing the research before the conclusion of the specific research and development cooperation contracts to which they are attached. The TMP shall be developed within the rules and regulations in force at each Party taking into account the aims of the joint research, the relative financial or other contributions of the Parties and participants, the advantages and disadvantages of licensing by territory or for fields of use, the transfer of export-controlled data, goods or services, requirements imposed by the applicable laws and other factors deemed appropriate by the participants. The rights and obligations concerning the research generated by visiting researchers (i.e. researchers not coming from a Party or a participant) in respect of intellectual property will also be addressed in the joint TMP.The TMP is a specific agreement to be concluded between the participants about the implementation of joint research and the respective rights and obligations of the participants.With respect to intellectual property, the TMP will normally address, among other things, ownership, protection, user rights for research and development purposes, exploitation and dissemination, including arrangements for joint publication, the rights and obligations of visiting researchers and dispute settlement procedures. The TMP may also address foreground and background information, licensing and deliverables.5. Information or intellectual property created in the course of joint research and not addressed in the TMP will be allocated, with the approval of the Parties, according to the principles set out in the TMP. In case of disagreement, such information or intellectual property will be owned jointly by all the participants involved in the joint research from which the information or intellectual property results. Each participant to whom this provision applies will have the right to use such information or intellectual property for his own commercial exploitation with no geographical limitation.6. Each Party will ensure that the other Party and its participants may have the rights to intellectual property allocated to them in accordance with these principles.7. While maintaining the condition of competition in areas affected by the Agreement, each Party will endeavour to ensure that rights acquired pursuant to the Agreement and arrangements made under it are exercised in such a way as to encourage, in particular (i) the dissemination and use of information created, disclosed or otherwise made available, under the Agreement, and (ii) the adoption and implementation of international standards.8.

Copyright protection will extend to expressions and not to ideas, procedures, methods of operation or mathematical concepts as such. Limitations or exceptions to exclusive rights will be confined to certain special cases which do not conflict with a normal exploitation of the work and do not reasonably prejudice the legitimate interests of the right holder.Without prejudice to Section II, and unless otherwise agreed in the TMP, publication of results of research shall be made jointly by the Parties or participants to that joint research. Subject to the foregoing general rule, the following procedures shall apply1. In the case of publication by a Party, or public bodies of that Party of scientific and technical journals, articles, reports, books, including video and software arising from joint research pursuant to the Agreement, the other Party will be entitled to a worldwide, non-exclusive, irrevocable, royalty-free licence to translate, reproduce, adapt, transmit and publicly distribute such works.2.

Undisclosed informationA. Documentary undisclosed information1. Each Party, its agencies or its participants, as appropriate, will identify at the earliest possible moment and preferably in the TMP the information that they wish to remain undisclosed in relation to the Agreement, taking into account inter alia the following criteria:(a) secrecy of the information in the sense that it is not, as a body or in the precise configuration or assembly of its components, generally known among or readily accessible by lawful means to experts in the fields;(b) the actual or potential commercial value of the information by virtue of its secrecy;(c) previous protection of the information in the sense that it has been subject to steps that were reasonable under the circumstances by the person lawfully in control, to maintain its secrecy.The Parties and their participants may in certain cases agree that, unless otherwise indicated, parts or all of the information provided, exchanged or created in the course of joint research pursuant to the Agreement may not be disclosed.2. Each Party shall ensure that it and its participants clearly identify undisclosed information, for example by means of an appropriate marking or restrictive legend. This also applies to any reproduction of the said information, in whole or in part.A Party receiving undisclosed information pursuant to the Agreement will respect the privileged nature thereof. These limitations will automatically terminate when this information is disclosed by the owner into the public domain.3. Undisclosed information communicated under the Agreement may be disseminated by the receiving Party to persons within or employed by the receiving Party and other concerned departments or agencies in the receiving Party authorised for the specific purposes of the joint research under way, provided that any undisclosed information so disseminated shall be pursuant to an agreement of confidentiality and shall be readily recognisable as such, as set out above.4. With the prior written consent of the Party providing undisclosed information, the receiving Party may disseminate such undisclosed information more widely than otherwise permitted in point 3. The Parties shall cooperate in developing procedures for requesting and obtaining prior written consent for such wider dissemination, and each Party will grant such approval to the extent permitted by its domestic policies, regulations and laws.B. Non-documentary undisclosed informationNon-documentary undisclosed or other confidential information provided in seminars and other meetings arranged under the Agreement, or information arising from the attachment of staff, use of facilities, or joint projects, shall be treated by the Parties or their participants according to the principles specified for documentary information in the Agreement; provided, however, that the recipient of such undisclosed or other confidential or privileged information has been made aware of the confidential character of the information communicated at the time such communication is made.C. ControlEach Party shall endeavour to ensure that undisclosed information received by it under the Agreement will be controlled as provided herein. If one of the Parties becomes aware that it will be, or may be reasonably expected to become, unable to meet the non-dissemination provisions of Sections A and B, it shall immediately inform the other Party. The Parties will thereafter consult to define an appropriate course of action.", "summary": "Scientific and technological cooperation between the EU and China\nScientific and technological cooperation between the EU and China\nSUMMARY OF:\nAgreement for scientific and technological cooperation between the European Community and the Government of the People’s Republic of China\nDecision 2000/16/EC – Conclusion of the Agreement for scientific and technological cooperation between the European Community and the Government of the People’s Republic of China\nWHAT IS THE AIM OF THE AGREEMENT AND THE DECISION?\n              \nThe agreement establishes a formal framework for cooperation between the European Community, now the European Union (EU), and China, aiming at encouraging, developing and facilitating cooperative research and development activities in fields of science and technology of common interest.\nBy its decision, the Council of the European Union approved the conclusion of the agreement on behalf of the European Community.\nKEY POINTS\n              \nActivities carried out under the agreement are based on a number of principles:\nmutual benefit;\nreciprocal access to activities;\ntimely exchange of information;\nappropriate protection of intellectual property rights.\nFields of cooperation\nThe agreement covers all areas of research, technological development and demonstration.\nActivities\nCooperative activities may include the following:\nthe participation of Chinese research entities in research, technological development and demonstration projects under the EU framework programme for research and innovation, and the reciprocal participation of EU-based research entities in Chinese projects in similar sectors;\nthe pooling of research, technological development and demonstration projects;\nvisits and exchanges of scientists and technical experts;\nthe joint organisation of scientific seminars, conferences, symposia and workshops, and the participation of experts in those activities;\nconcerted actions;\nthe exchange and sharing of equipment and materials;\nthe exchange of information on practices, laws, regulations and programmes relevant to cooperation under this agreement.\nDATE OF ENTRY INTO FORCE\n              \nThe agreement was signed on 22 December 1998 and entered into force on 14 December 1999 for an initial period of 5 years.
