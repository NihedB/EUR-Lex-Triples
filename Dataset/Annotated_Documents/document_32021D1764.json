{"celex_id": "32021D1764", "reference": "7.10.2021\nEN\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\nL 355/6\nCOUNCIL DECISION (EU) 2021/1764\nof 5 October 2021\non the association of the Overseas Countries and Territories with the European Union including relations between the European Union on the one hand, and Greenland and the Kingdom of Denmark on the other (Decision on the Overseas Association, including Greenland)\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 203 thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative act to the national Parliaments,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European Parliament (1),\nActing in accordance with a special legislative procedure,\nWhereas:\n(1)\nThis Decision establishes the rules and the procedure for the association of the Union with the Overseas Countries and Territories (OCTs), including Greenland, and replaces Council Decision 2013/755/EU (‘Overseas Association Decision’) (2) and Council Decision 2014/137/EU (3). Decision 2013/755/EU should therefore be repealed.\n(2)\nFollowing the withdrawal of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (UK) from the European Union and the European Atomic Energy Community (Euratom) in accordance with Article 50 of the Treaty on the European Union (TEU), this association applies to the OCTs listed in Annex II to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), excluding the 12 UK OCTs listed in that Annex.\n(3)\nPursuant to Article 204 TFEU, the provisions of Articles 198 to 203 TFEU apply to Greenland, subject to the specific provisions set out in Protocol No 34 to the TFEU on special arrangements for Greenland. In accordance with the Treaty amending, with regard to Greenland, the Treaties establishing the European Communities (4), the relations between the Union on the one hand, and Greenland and the Kingdom of Denmark on the other are governed by Decision 2014/137/EU that highlights the close historical, political, economic and cultural connections between the Union and Greenland and defines a specific partnership and cooperation. Decision 2014/137/EU expired on 31 December 2020.\n(4)\nFrom 1 January 2021, the Union assistance to OCTs previously financed by the European Development Fund (EDF) should be financed from the general budget of the Union.\n(5)\nIn order to reduce the number of External Financing Instruments and to streamline their performance, the relations with all OCTs, including Greenland, should be regrouped by replacing Decision 2013/755/EU and Decision 2014/137/EU by a single Decision.\n(6)\nThe partnership established by this Decision should allow for the continuation of strong relations between the Union on the one hand, and the OCTs on the other.\n(7)\nIn 2003, the Council agreed that the future relationship of the Union with Greenland after 2006 would be based on a comprehensive partnership for sustainable development which would include a specific fisheries agreement, negotiated according to the general rules and principles for such agreements.\n(8)\nThe Joint Declaration by the European Union, on the one hand, and the Government of Greenland and the Government of Denmark on the other, on relations between the European Union and Greenland, signed in Brussels on 19 March 2015, recalled the close historical, political, economic and cultural connections between the Union and Greenland and committed to further strengthening relations and cooperation based on broadly shared interests and to endow their mutual relations with a long-term perspective.\n(9)\nThis Decision should highlight the specificities of the partnership between the Union on the one hand and Greenland and Denmark on the other, such as the objective to preserve the close and lasting links between the Union, Greenland and Denmark, the acknowledgement of the geostrategic position of Greenland, the importance of policy dialogue between Greenland, Denmark and the Union, the existence of a Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the Union and Greenland and the potential cooperation on Arctic issues. It should respond to the global challenges, allowing for the development of a proactive agenda and the pursuit of mutual interests, in particular, the increasing impact of climate change on human activity and the environment, maritime transport, natural resources, including raw materials and fish stocks, as well as research and innovation.\n(10)\nThe TFEU and the secondary legislation adopted on the basis of it do not automatically apply to the OCTs, with the exception of a number of provisions which explicitly provide for their application. Although not third countries, the OCTs do not form part of the single market and must nevertheless comply with the obligations imposed on third countries in respect of trade, particularly rules of origin, health and plant health standards and safeguard measures.\n(11)\nThe special relationship between the Union and the OCTs is moving from a development cooperation approach to a reciprocal partnership to support the OCTs’ sustainable development. The progress achieved so far should be consolidated and reinforced. Moreover, the solidarity between the Union and the OCTs should be based on their unique relationship and their belonging to the same European family.\n(12)\nThe contribution of civil society to OCTs’ development can be enhanced by strengthening civil society organisations in all spheres of cooperation.\n(13)\nThe 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (‘2030 Agenda’), adopted by the United Nations in September 2015, is the international community’s response to global challenges and trends in relation to sustainable development. With the United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goals (‘SDGs’), the Paris Agreement (5) adopted on 12 December 2015 under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) (Paris Agreement) and the Addis Ababa Action Agenda – at its core, the 2030 Agenda is a transformative framework to eradicate poverty and achieve sustainable development globally. It is universal in scope, providing a comprehensive shared framework for action that applies both to the Union and to its partners. It balances the economic, social and environmental dimensions of sustainable development, recognising the essential interlinkages between its goals and targets. The 2030 Agenda aims to leave no one behind. Its implementation will be closely coordinated with other international commitments. Actions implemented under this Decision will pay particular attention to interlinkages between SDGs and to integrated actions that can create co-benefits and meet multiple objectives in a coherent way. Gender equality and women’s empowerment are vital for achieving the SDGs and are cross-cutting issues for the entire 2030 Agenda.\n(14)\nThe association between the Union and the OCTs should continue to be based on three key pillars, namely enhancing competitiveness, strengthening resilience and reducing vulnerability, and promoting cooperation and integration between the OCTs and other partners and neighbouring regions.\n(15)\nUnion financial assistance allocated through the partnership should bring a European perspective to the development of OCTs and should contribute to the strengthening of the close and long lasting ties between the Union and the OCTs, while strengthening the position of OCTs as advanced outposts of the Union, based on the common values and history which link the partners.\n(16)\nGiven the OCTs’ geographical position and despite the different status vis-à-vis Union law of each actor in a given geographical area, cooperation between the OCTs and their neighbours should be pursued in the interests of all sides, with a particular focus on areas of common interest and the promotion of the Union’s values and standards.\n(17)\nThe development of intraregional cooperation is a priority of mutual interest. Intraregional operations should strive for a balance, where appropriate, between the Pacific, the Indian Ocean, the Caribbean, the Atlantic and the Arctic regions.\n(18)\nOCTs face particular constraints due to their geographical position. In particular, the constraints imposed by their remoteness or extreme remoteness should be taken into account when implementing this Decision.\n(19)\nWhen implementing this Decision, the social and economic situation of OCTs should be taken into account, in particular for OCTs eligible to receive official development assistance (‘ODA’), on the basis of the list of recipients of that assistance, drawn up by the Development Assistance Committee of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (‘OECD’).\n(20)\nMany OCTs are neighbours to outermost regions, referred to in Article 349 TFEU, to African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) States and to other third countries or territories (6) and share common needs with their neighbours from mitigation of and adaptation to climate change and the preservation of biodiversity to oceans-related issues, economic diversification and disaster risk reduction.\n(21)\nThe Commission Communication of 24 October 2017‘A stronger and renewed strategic partnership with the Union’s outermost regions’, the Conclusions of the 15th and 16th OCT-EU Forums and the Commission recommendations for the negotiations on a Partnership Agreement between the European Union and ACP countries call for the reinforcement of regional cooperation programmes involving OCTs and their neighbours.\n(22)\nThe OCTs are host to wide terrestrial and marine biodiversity. Climate change is impacting on OCTs’ natural environment and constitutes a threat undermining their sustainable development. Actions in the fields of conservation of biodiversity and ecosystem services, disaster risk reduction, sustainable management of natural resources and the promotion of sustainable energy and environmental security contribute to adaptation to and mitigation of climate change in the OCTs. The association should aim to ensure the conservation, restoration and sustainable use of biological diversity and ecosystem services as a key element for the achievement of sustainable development.\n(23)\nThe Union and the OCTs reaffirm their right to regulate the impact of waste on environmental and public health grounds, in compliance with their international commitments.\n(24)\nReflecting the importance of tackling climate change in line with the Union’s commitments to implement the Paris Agreement and to achieve the SDGs, the Programme established by this Decision (‘this Programme’) should contribute to mainstream climate action in the Union policies and to the achievement of an overall target of 30 % of the Union budget expenditure supporting climate objectives. Actions under this Programme are expected to contribute 25 % of its overall financial envelope to climate objectives. Relevant actions will be identified during the Programme’s implementation and the overall contribution from this Programme should be part of relevant monitoring, evaluations and review processes. In view of contributing to halting and reversing the decline of biodiversity, this Programme should contribute to the ambition of providing 7,5 % of annual spending under the multiannual financial framework to biodiversity objectives in the year 2024 and 10 % of annual spending under the multiannual financial framework to biodiversity objectives in 2026 and 2027, while considering the existing overlaps between climate and biodiversity goals.\n(25)\nThe significant role which OCTs could play in contributing to the Union’s commitments under Multilateral Environmental Agreements should be recognised in the relations between the Union and the OCTs.\n(26)\nThe Union and the OCTs recognise the special importance of education and vocational training as a lever for OCTs’ sustainable development.\n(27)\nThe association between the Union and the OCTs should take into account and contribute to the preservation of the cultural diversity and identity of OCTs.\n(28)\nTrade and trade-related cooperation between the Union and the OCTs should contribute to the objective of sustainable economic development, social development and environmental protection.\n(29)\nThis Decision will continue to provide for flexible rules of origin, including as regards cumulation of origin. Cumulation should be possible not only with OCTs and countries that have concluded an Economic Partnership Agreement with the Union, but under certain conditions also for products originating in countries with which the Union is applying a free trade agreement as well as for products entering the Union duty-free and quota-free under the Union’s General System of Preferences, also subject to conditions. Those conditions are necessary to prevent trade circumvention and ensure the proper functioning of the cumulation arrangements.\n(30)\nThe procedures for certification of OCT origin should be updated, in the interests of the operators and administrations concerned in the OCTs. Provisions on administrative cooperation between the Union and the OCTs should also be updated accordingly.\n(31)\nIn addition, detailed safeguard and surveillance provisions will be maintained to allow OCTs’ and Union competent authorities as well as economic operators to rely on clear and transparent rules and procedures. Finally, it is a matter of common interest to ensure the proper application of the procedures and arrangements that allow the OCTs to export goods to the Union duty-free and quota-free.\n(32)\nTaking into account the aims of integration and the developments of global trade in the area of services and establishment, it is necessary to support the development of services markets and investment possibilities by improving the market access of OCTs’ services and investment to the Union market. In this regard the Union should offer to OCTs the best possible treatment offered to any other trading partner through comprehensive most favoured nation clauses, while ensuring more flexible possibilities for trade relations for OCTs by limiting the treatment offered by OCTs to the Union to what has been offered to other major trading economies.\n(33)\nCooperation in the area of financial services between the Union and OCTs should contribute to building a safer, sounder, more transparent financial system that is essential to enhance global financial stability and to underpin sustainable growth. Efforts in that area should focus on convergence with internationally agreed standards and approximation of OCTs’ legislation with Union acquis on financial services. Adequate attention should be paid to strengthening administrative capacity of OCTs’ authorities, including in the area of supervision.\n(34)\nUnion financial assistance should focus on areas where it has the most impact, having regard to its capacity to act on a global scale and to respond to global challenges such as poverty eradication, sustainable and inclusive development or the worldwide promotion of democracy, good governance, human rights and the rule of law, its long-term and predictable engagement in development assistance and its role in coordinating with its Member States.\n(35)\nIn the interest of efficiency, simplification and recognition of the management capacities of the OCTs’ authorities, the financial resources granted to the OCTs should be managed on the basis of a reciprocal partnership. Moreover, the authorities of the OCTs should assume the responsibility for the formulation and implementation of those policies agreed upon between the parties as cooperation strategies. The limited administrative and human resources of the OCTs should be taken into account in the programming and implementation rules and process.\n(36)\nThis Decision lays down a financial envelope for the association of the OCTs with the Union, which is to constitute the financial reference amount, within the meaning of point 19 of the Interinstitutional Agreement between the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission on budgetary discipline, on cooperation in budgetary matters and on sound financial management, as well as on new own resources, including a roadmap towards the introduction of new own resources (7) for the European Parliament and the Council during the annual budgetary procedure. This amount should be taken as illustrating the will of the legislator and should not affect the budgetary powers of the European Parliament and of the Council as set out in the TFEU.\n(37)\nHorizontal financial rules adopted by the European Parliament and the Council on the basis of Article 322 TFEU apply to this Decision. Those rules are laid down in Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2018/1046 of the European Parliament and of the Council (8) (the ‘Financial Regulation’) and determine in particular the procedure for establishing and implementing the budget through grants, prizes, procurement, indirect management, financial instruments, budgetary guarantees, financial assistance and the reimbursement of external experts, and provide for checks on the responsibility of financial actors. Rules adopted on the basis of Article 322 TFEU also include a general regime of conditionality for the protection of the Union budget.\n(38)\nThe types of financing and the methods of implementation under this Decision should be chosen on the basis of their ability to achieve the specific objectives of the actions and to deliver results, taking into account, in particular, the costs of controls, the administrative burden and the expected risk of non-compliance. When making that choice, the use of lump sums, unit costs and flat rates, as well as financing not linked to costs as referred to in Article 125(1) of the Financial Regulation, should be considered.\n(39)\nThe Union should seek the most efficient use of available resources in order to optimise the impact of its external action. That should be achieved through coherence and complementarity between the Union’s external financing instruments, as well as the creation of synergies with other Union policies and programmes. In order to maximise the impact of combined interventions to achieve a common objective, this Decision should allow for the combination of funding with other Union programmes, as long as the contributions do not cover the same costs. Taking into account that OCTs’ access to Union programmes remains a challenge, the Commission should, where appropriate, encourage OCTs’ better access to Union programmes, for example through capacity building and training activities. The level of OCTs’ participation should be evaluated regularly. Furthermore, the Union should ensure that natural persons from OCTs can participate in initiatives of the Union on the same basis as other nationals of Member States.\n(40)\nThis Decision should make reference, where required, to Regulation (EU) 2021/947 of the European Parliament and of the Council (9) for the purpose of the implementation of the cooperation and thus ensuring coherence in the management across instruments.\n(41)\nIn order to take into account developments and changes in customs and trade legislation, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 TFEU should be delegated to the Commission in respect of the procedural rules of origin and related definitions in Annex II and the Appendices of Annex II to enable the Commission to translate into the Decision these changes. The Commission should also be empowered to adopt delegated acts in order to amend Article 3 of Annex I to review or complement the indicators where considered necessary and to supplement that Annex with provisions on the establishment of a monitoring and evaluation framework.\n(42)\nPursuant to paragraphs 22 and 23 of the Interinstitutional Agreement of 13 April 2016 for Better Law-Making (10), this Programme should be evaluated on the basis of information collected in accordance with specific monitoring requirements, while avoiding overregulation and administrative burdens, in particular on Member States. These requirements, where appropriate, should include measurable indicators as a basis for evaluating the effects of the Programme on the ground. It is of particular importance that the Commission carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level, and that those consultations be conducted in accordance with the principles laid down in the Interinstitutional Agreement of 13 April 2016 on Better Law-Making.\n(43)\nThe references to the external assistance instruments in Article 9 of Council Decision 2010/427/EU (11) should be read as reference also to this Decision. The Commission should ensure that this Decision is implemented in accordance with the role of the EEAS as provided in that Decision.\n(44)\nIn order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of Article 10(6) and 16(8) of Annex II, Article 2 of Annex III, Article 5 and 6 of Annex IV of this Decision, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission. Those powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council (12).\n(45)\nIn accordance with the Financial Regulation, Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 883/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council (13), Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 2988/95 (14), Council Regulation (Euratom, EC) No 2185/96 (15) and Council Regulation (EU) 2017/1939 (16), the financial interests of the Union are to be protected by means of proportionate measures, including measures relating to the prevention, detection, correction and investigation of irregularities, including fraud, the recovery of funds lost, wrongly paid or incorrectly used and, where appropriate, the imposition of administrative penalties. In particular, in accordance with Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 883/2013 and Regulation (Euratom, EC) No 2185/96, the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) has the power to carry out administrative investigations, including on-the-spot checks and inspections, with a view to establishing whether there has been fraud, corruption or any other illegal activity affecting the financial interests of the Union.\nThe European Public Prosecutor’s Office (EPPO) is empowered, in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2017/1939, to investigate and prosecute criminal offences affecting the financial interests of the Union as provided for in Directive (EU) 2017/1371 of the European Parliament and of the Council (17). In accordance with the Financial Regulation, any person or entity receiving Union funds is to fully cooperate in the protection of the Union’s financial interests, grant the necessary rights and access to the Commission, OLAF, the Court of Auditors and, in respect of those Member States participating in enhanced cooperation pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2017/1939, the EPPO, and ensure that any third parties involved in the implementation of Union funds grant equivalent rights. For that reason, agreements with third countries and territories and with international organisations, and any contract or agreement resulting from the implementation of this Decision should contain provisions expressly empowering the Commission, the Court of Auditors and OLAF to conduct such audits, on-the-spot checks and inspections, in accordance with their respective competences and ensuring that any third parties involved in the implementation of Union funding grant equivalent rights.\n(46)\nIn order to increase the cooperation between OCTs, the REX system, the system for registering exporters authorised to certify the origin of goods set up pursuant to Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2015/2447 (18), could be used by OCTs to grant preferential tariff treatment to products originating in another OCT in cases where there is no cumulation.\n(47)\nBy virtue of this Decision, the Union should be able to give an innovative response to all the factors mentioned above, which is both consistent and tailored to the variety of situations.\n(48)\nIn order to ensure continuity in providing support to the relevant policy area and to allow implementation to start from the beginning of the Multiannual Financial Framework 2021-2027, this Decision should enter into force as a matter of urgency and should apply, with retroactive effect, from 1 January 2021,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\nPART I\nGENERAL PROVISIONS OF THE ASSOCIATION OF THE OVERSEAS COUNTRIES AND TERRITORIES WITH THE UNION\nCHAPTER 1\nGeneral provisions\nArticle 1\nSubject matter\nThis Decision establishes an association of the OCTs with the Union (the ‘association’), which constitutes a partnership to support the OCTs’ sustainable development as well as to promote the values and standards of the Union in the wider world. The partners to the association are the Union, the OCTs and the Member States to which they are linked. In addition, this Decision lays down rules concerning the relations between the Union on the one hand, and Greenland and Denmark on the other.\nThis Decision establishes the funding programme for the association (the ‘Programme’) for the period from 1 January 2021 to 31 December 2027. It lays down the objectives of the Programme, the budget for the period from 2021 to 2027, the forms of Union funding and the rules for providing such funding as set out in Annex I.\nArticle 2\nTerritorial application\nThe association applies to the OCTs listed in Annex II to the TFEU, excluding the 12 UK OCTs listed in that Annex.\nArticle 3\nObjectives, principles and values\n1.   The association between the Union and the OCTs shall be based on objectives, principles and values shared by the OCTs, the Member States to which they are linked and the Union.\n2.   The partners recognise each other’s rights to determine their sustainable development policies and priorities, to establish their own levels of domestic environmental and labour protection, and to adopt or amend accordingly the relevant laws and modify the relevant policies, consistently with commitment to the internationally recognised standards and agreements. In doing so, they shall strive to ensure high levels of environmental and labour protection.\n3.   In implementing this Decision, the partners shall be guided by the principles of transparency, subsidiarity and the need for efficiency and shall equally address the three pillars of OCTs’ sustainable development, implementing the 2030 Agenda across all its internal and external policies in a comprehensive and strategic approach: economic development, cultural and social development and nature and environmental protection. Gender equality and the rights of girls and women should be mainstreamed into all actions as a key contribution to the successful achievement of the SDGs.\n4.   The general objective of this Decision is to promote the economic and social development of the OCTs and to establish close economic relations between them and the Union as a whole. The association shall pursue this general objective by enhancing the OCTs’ competitiveness, strengthening the OCTs’ resilience, reducing their economic and environmental vulnerability and by promoting cooperation between them and other partners. Furthermore, the aim of this Decision is to preserve the existing ties between the Union on the one hand, and Greenland and Denmark on the other, acknowledging the geostrategic position of Greenland in the Arctic, and to preserve existing ties between the Union and the other OCTs, acknowledging their geostrategic positions in the Caribbean, the Indian Ocean, the Atlantic and the Pacific.\n5.   In accordance with Articles 3(5) and 21 of the TEU, the specific objectives of this Decision are the following:\n(a)\nto foster and support cooperation with OCTs, including in addressing their major challenges and reaching the SDGs,\n(b)\nto support and to cooperate with Greenland in addressing its major challenges such as the raising of education level and to contribute to the capacity of the administration of Greenland to formulate and implement national policies.\n6.   In pursuing the general objectives referred to in paragraph 4 and the specific objectives referred to in paragraph 5, the association shall respect the fundamental principles of liberty, democracy, human rights and fundamental freedoms, the rule of law, good governance and sustainable development, all of which are common to the OCTs and the Member States to which they are linked.\nArticle 4\nManagement of the association\nManagement of the association shall be conducted by the Commission and the OCTs’ authorities and, where necessary, by the Member State to which the OCT is linked, in accordance with their respective institutional, legal and financial competences.\nArticle 5\nMutual interests, complementarity and priorities\n1.   The association shall be the framework for policy dialogue and cooperation on issues of mutual interest.\n2.   Priority shall be given to cooperation in areas of mutual interest, such as:\n(a)\nthe sustainable diversification of OCTs’ economies, including their further integration in world and regional economies; in the specific case of Greenland, the need to increase the skills of its labour force;\n(b)\nfostering exchange, cooperation and partnerships for accelerating the achievement of the SDGs;\n(c)\neducation and training, public health, tourism and culture;\n(d)\nthe promotion of a green and blue economy;\n(e)\nthe sustainable management of natural resources, including the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity and ecosystem services;\n(f)\nmitigation of climate change and adaptation to the impacts of climate change;\n(g)\nthe promotion of disaster risk reduction;\n(h)\nthe promotion of research, innovation and scientific cooperation activities;\n(i)\ndigital accessibility;\n(j)\nthe promotion of social, cultural and economic exchanges between the OCTs, their neighbours and other partners;\n(k)\nthe social sector, mobility of the workforce, social protection systems, food safety and food security issues;\n(l)\nArctic issues;\n(m)\nthe development of regional cooperation in the Caribbean, the Indian Ocean, the Atlantic and the Pacific;\n(n)\nthe development of intraregional cooperation in the Arctic, the Caribbean, the Indian Ocean, the Atlantic and the Pacific.\n3.   Cooperation in the areas of mutual interest shall aim to promote OCTs’ self-reliance and of the development of OCTs’ capacities to formulate, implement and monitor strategies and policies set out in paragraph 2.\nArticle 6\nPromotion of the association\n1.   With an aim to strengthen their mutual relations, the Union and the OCTs shall endeavour to make the association known among their citizens, in particular by promoting the development of the links and cooperation between the authorities, academic community, civil society and businesses of OCTs on the one hand and their interlocutors within the Union on the other.\n2.   OCTs shall make efforts to strengthen and promote their relations with the Union as a whole. The Member States shall support these efforts.\nArticle 7\nRegional cooperation, regional integration and cooperation with other partners\n1.   Subject to Article 3, the association shall support the OCTs in their efforts to take part in relevant international, regional and sub-regional cooperation initiatives as well as regional and sub-regional integration processes, in line with their own aspirations and in accordance with objectives and priorities defined by the competent OCTs’ authorities.\n2.   To this end, the Union and the OCTs may exchange information and best practices or establish any other form of close cooperation and coordination with other partners in the context of the OCTs’ participation in regional and international organisations, where appropriate by means of international agreements.\n3.   The association aims to support cooperation between the OCTs and other partners in the areas of cooperation set out in Parts II and III of this Decision. In that respect, the objective of the association is to promote the cooperation between the OCTs and the outermost regions, referred to in Article 349 TFEU, their neighbouring ACP and non-ACP states and territories (19). In order to achieve that objective, the Union shall improve coordination and synergies between the relevant Union programmes or instruments. The Union shall also endeavour to associate OCTs in its instances of dialogue with their neighbouring countries, whether they are ACP or non-ACP States or territories, and with the outermost regions, where appropriate.\n4.   The support to OCTs’ participation in relevant regional integration organisations shall focus in particular on:\n(a)\ncapacity building of relevant regional organisations and institutions of which OCTs are members;\n(b)\nregional or sub-regional initiatives such as the implementation of sectoral reform policies relating to the areas of cooperation identified in Parts II and III;\n(c)\nthe awareness and knowledge of the OCTs on the impacts of regional integration processes in different areas;\n(d)\nOCTs’ participation in the development of regional markets within the framework of regional integration organisations;\n(e)\ncross-border investment between OCTs and their neighbours.\nArticle 8\nParticipation in European Groupings of Territorial Cooperation\nIn the application of Article 7(1), (2) and (3) of this Decision, the cooperation initiatives or other forms of cooperation shall also mean that governmental authorities, regional and sub-regional organisations, local authorities and, where appropriate, other public and private bodies or institutions, including public service providers, from an OCT may participate in a European Grouping of Territorial Cooperation (EGTC) subject to the rules and objectives of the cooperation activities of this Decision and those of Regulation (EC) No 1082/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council (20) and in accordance with the arrangements applicable to the Member State to which the OCT is linked.\nArticle 9\nSpecific treatment\n1.   The association shall take into account the diversity of the OCTs in terms of economic development and their capacity to benefit fully from regional cooperation and regional integration referred to in Article 7.\n2.   A specific treatment shall be established for isolated OCTs.\n3.   In order to enable isolated OCTs to overcome structural and other obstacles to their development, specific treatment shall take account of their specific difficulties, inter alia, when determining the volume of financial assistance and the conditions attached thereto.\n4.   St Pierre et Miquelon shall be considered to be an isolated OCT.\nCHAPTER 2\nCooperation\nArticle 10\nGeneral approach\n1.   The association shall be based on a broad dialogue and consultations on issues of mutual interest between the OCTs, the Member States to which they are linked and the Commission, and, if appropriate, the European Investment Bank (EIB), as well as other Union institutions and bodies.\n2.   The OCTs shall organise, where appropriate, a dialogue and consultations with authorities and bodies such as:\n(a)\nthe competent local and other public authorities;\n(b)\nthe economic and social partners;\n(c)\nany other appropriate body representing civil society, such as environmental partners, non-governmental organisations and bodies responsible for promoting equality between men and women.\nArticle 11\nActors of cooperation\n1.   Actors of cooperation in the OCTs shall include:\n(a)\nthe government authorities of the OCTs;\n(b)\nthe local authorities within the OCTs;\n(c)\npublic service providers and civil society organisations, such as social, business, employers’ and trade union associations, and local, national or international non-governmental organisations;\n(d)\nregional and sub-regional organisations.\n2.   The Member States to which the OCTs are linked shall notify to the Commission the names of the governmental and local authorities referred to in points (a) and (b) of paragraph 1.\nArticle 12\nResponsibilities of the non-governmental actors\n1.   Non-governmental actors may play a role in the exchange of information and consultations concerning the cooperation, and in particular for the preparation and implementation of cooperation assistance, projects or programmes. They may receive a delegation of financial management powers for implementing such projects or programmes for the purpose of supporting local development initiatives.\n2.   Non-governmental actors eligible for decentralised management of projects or programmes shall be identified by agreement between the OCT authorities, the Commission and the Member State to which the OCT is linked, taking into account the subject concerned, their expertise and field of activity. The process of identification shall be conducted in each OCT as part of the broad dialogue and consultations referred to in Article 10.\n3.   The association aims to contribute to the efforts of the OCTs to strengthen civil society organisations, in particular to facilitate their creation and development, and the development of the arrangements necessary for opening their involvement in the design, implementation and evaluation of development strategies and programmes.\nCHAPTER 3\nInstitutional framework of the association\nArticle 13\nGuiding principles for dialogue\n1.   The Union, the OCTs and the Member States to which they are linked shall regularly engage in a comprehensive and political dialogue.\n2.   The dialogue shall be conducted in full compliance with the respective institutional, legal and financial powers of the Union, of the OCTs and of the Member States to which they are linked. The dialogue shall be conducted in a flexible manner. It may be formal or informal, at an appropriate level or format and shall be conducted within the framework referred to in Article 14.\n3.   The dialogue shall enable the OCTs to take part fully in the implementation of the association.\n4.   The dialogue shall focus, inter alia, on specific political issues of mutual concern or of general significance for the attainment of the objectives of the association.\n5.   The dialogue with OCTs, including Greenland, shall, in particular, provide the basis for broad cooperation and dialogue in areas concerning, inter alia, education, energy, climate change, nature, environment, the blue economy, natural resources, including raw materials and fish stocks, maritime transport, research and innovation, as well as the Arctic dimension of those issues, where relevant.\nArticle 14\nInstances of dialogue of the association\n1.   The association shall establish the following instances of dialogue:\n(a)\nan OCTs-EU forum for dialogue (the ‘OCTs-EU Forum’), which shall meet annually to bring together OCTs’ authorities, representatives of the Member States and the Commission.

For the purposes of this Decision, for the seven-year period from 1 January 2021 to 31 December 2027, the overall amount of the Union financial assistance of EUR 500 000 000 in current prices shall be allocated as follows:\n(a)\nEUR 164 000 000 in the form of grants for bilateral programmable support for the long-term development of OCTs other than Greenland, in particular to finance the initiatives referred to in the programming document. Where appropriate, the programming document shall pay particular attention to actions aimed at strengthening governance and the institutional capacities of the beneficiary OCTs and, where relevant, the likely timetable of the envisaged actions. This amount shall be allocated on the basis of the specificities, needs, development level and performance of the OCTs in accordance with a limited set of specific and transparent criteria, taking into account the population, Gross Domestic Product (GDP), poverty and inequality, the level of previous allocations, the OCTs’ absorption capacities and constraints due to the geographical isolation of OCTs as mentioned in Article 9;\n(b)\nEUR 225 000 000 in the form of grants for bilateral programmable support for the long term development of Greenland, in particular to finance the initiative referred to in the programming document;\n(c)\nEUR 76 000 000 shall be allocated to support OCT regional programmes of which EUR 15 000 000 could support intra-regional operations, Greenland being eligible only for the intra-regional operations. This cooperation shall be implemented in coordination with Article 7, in particular regarding the areas of mutual interest referred to in Article 5 and through consultation via the instances of the EU-OCTs partnership referred to in Article 14. Coordination shall be sought with other relevant Union financial programmes and instruments and in particular the outermost regions referred to in Article 349 TFEU;\n(d)\nEUR 22 000 000 for studies or technical assistance measures for all the OCTs including Greenland, in accordance with Article 80 (1);\n(e)\nEUR 13 000 000 to a non-allocated fund for all the OCTs including Greenland to inter alia:\n(i)\nensure an appropriate response of the Union in the event of unforeseen circumstances;\n(ii)\naddress new needs or emerging challenges, such as migratory pressure at the Union’s or its neighbours’ borders; and\n(iii)\npromote new international initiatives and priorities.\nThe amount of the non-allocated fund referred to in point (e) of the first subparagraph shall be increased by the cumulative net reflows stemming from the OCT Investment Facility set out in Article 3(3) of Annex IV of Decision 2013/755/EU. These reflows shall be added as annual top-ups, from the moment they become available, and shall be designated as external assigned revenues.\n2.   The Commission, following a mid-term review of the implementation of this Decision, may decide on the allocation of any non-allocated funds mentioned in this Article, including to the territorial allocations.\n3.   The funds shall not be committed after 31 December 2027, unless the Council unanimously decides otherwise, on a proposal from the Commission.\nArticle 2\nAdministration of resources\nAll financial resources under this Decision shall be administered by the Commission.\nArticle 3\nIndicators\nThe achievement of the objectives set out in Article 3(5) of this Decision shall be measured by:\n1.\nFor OCTs, except Greenland, exports of goods and services as % of GDP and total Government revenue as % of GDP.\n2.\nFor Greenland, exports of goods and services as % of GDP and percentage of the fisheries sector in total exports.\n(1)  Out of this amount, EUR 9 725 000 are reserved for the Commission to cover technical and/or administrative assistance and expenditure in support of the implementation of the Union programmes and/or actions, indirect research, direct research.\nANNEX II\nCONCERNING THE DEFINITION OF THE CONCEPT OF ‘ORIGINATING PRODUCTS’ AND METHODS OF ADMINISTRATIVE COOPERATION\nTITLE I\nGENERAL PROVISIONS\nArticle 1\nDefinitions\nFor the purposes of this Annex the following definitions apply:\n(a)\n‘EPA countries’ means regions or states which are part of the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) Group of States and which have concluded agreements establishing, or leading to the establishment of an Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA), where such an EPA is either provisionally applied, or enters into force, whichever is the earlier;\n(b)\n‘manufacture’ means any kind of working or processing including assembly;\n(c)\n‘material’ means any ingredient, raw material, component or part, etc., used in the manufacture of the product;\n(d)\n‘product’ means the product being manufactured, even if it is intended for later use in another manufacturing operation;\n(e)\n‘goods’ means both materials and products;\n(f)\n‘fungible materials’ means materials that are of the same kind and commercial quality, with the same technical and physical characteristics, and which cannot be distinguished from one another once they are incorporated into the finished product;\n(g)\n‘customs value’ means the value as determined in accordance with the Agreement on Implementation of Article VII of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1994 (WTO Agreement on Customs Valuation);\n(h)\n‘value of materials’ in the list in Appendix I means the customs value at the time of importation of the non-originating materials used, or, if this is not known and cannot be ascertained, the first ascertainable price paid for the materials in the OCT. Where the value of the originating materials used needs to be established, this point shall be applied mutatis mutandis;\n(i)\n‘ex-works price’ means the price paid for the product ex-works to the manufacturer in whose undertaking the last working or processing is carried out, provided that the price includes the value of all the materials used and all other costs related to its production, minus any internal taxes which are, or may be, repaid when the product obtained is exported.\nWhere the actual price paid does not reflect all costs related to the manufacturing of the product which are actually incurred in the OCT, the ex-works price means the sum of all those costs, minus any internal taxes which are, or may be, repaid when the product obtained is exported.\nFor the purposes of this definition, where the last working or processing has been subcontracted to a manufacturer, the term ‘manufacturer’ referred to in the first subparagraph of this point may refer to the enterprise that has employed the subcontractor;\n(j)\n‘maximum content of non-originating materials’ means the maximum content of non-originating materials which is permitted in order to consider a manufacture to be working or processing sufficient to confer originating status on the product. It may be expressed as a percentage of the ex-works price of the product or as a percentage of the net weight of these materials used falling under a specified group of chapters, chapter, heading or subheading;\n(k)\n‘net weight’ means the weight of the goods themselves without packing materials and packing containers of any kind;\n(l)\n‘chapters’, ‘headings’ and ‘subheadings’ mean the chapters, the headings and subheadings (four- or six-digit codes) used in the nomenclature which makes up the Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System (‘Harmonized System’) with the changes pursuant to the Recommendation of 26 June 2004 of the Customs Cooperation Council;\n(m)\n‘classified’ refers to the classification of a product or material under a particular heading or subheading;\n(n)\n‘consignment’ means products which are either:\n(i)\nsent simultaneously from one exporter to one consignee; or\n(ii)\ncovered by a single transport document covering their shipment from the exporter to the consignee or, in the absence of such document, by a single invoice;\n(o)\n‘exporter’ means a person exporting the goods to the Union or to an OCT who is able to prove the origin of the goods, whether or not the person is the manufacturer and whether or not they themselves carry out the export formalities;\n(p)\n‘registered exporter’ means an exporter who is registered with the competent authorities of the OCT concerned for the purpose of making out statements on origin for the purpose of exporting under this Decision;\n(q)\n‘statement on origin’ means a statement made out by the exporter indicating that the products covered by it comply with the rules of origin of this Annex, for the purpose of allowing either the person declaring the goods for release for free circulation in the Union to claim the benefit of preferential tariff treatment or the economic operator in an OCT importing materials for further processing in the context of cumulation rules to prove the originating status of such goods;\n(r)\n‘GSP country’ means a GSP beneficiary country as defined in point (d) of Article 2 of Regulation (EU) No 978/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council (1);\n(s)\n‘REX system’ means the system for registering exporters authorised to certify the origin of goods set up under Article 80(1) of Implementing Regulation (EU) 2015/2447.\nTITLE II\nDEFINITION OF THE CONCEPT OF ORIGINATING PRODUCTS\nArticle 2\nGeneral requirements\n1.   The following products shall be considered as originating in an OCT:\n(a)\nproducts wholly obtained in an OCT within the meaning of Article 3 of this Annex;\n(b)\nproducts obtained in an OCT incorporating materials which have not been wholly obtained there, provided that such materials have undergone sufficient working or processing within the meaning of Article 4 of this Annex.\n2.   Originating products made up of materials wholly obtained or sufficiently worked or processed in two or more OCTs shall be considered to be products originating in the OCT where the last working or processing took place.\nArticle 3\nWholly obtained products\n1.   The following shall be considered to have been wholly obtained in an OCT:\n(a)\nmineral products extracted from its soil or from its seabed;\n(b)\nplants and vegetable products grown or harvested there;\n(c)\nlive animals born and raised there;\n(d)\nproducts from live animals raised there;\n(e)\nproducts from slaughtered animals born and raised there;\n(f)\nproducts obtained by hunting or fishing conducted there;\n(g)\nproducts of aquaculture where the fish, crustaceans and molluscs are born and raised there;\n(h)\nproducts of sea fishing and other products taken from the sea outside any territorial sea by its vessels;\n(i)\nproducts made on board its factory ships exclusively from the products referred to in point (h);\n(j)\nused articles collected there fit only for the recovery of raw materials;\n(k)\nwaste and scrap resulting from manufacturing operations conducted there;\n(l)\nproducts extracted from the seabed or below the seabed which is situated outside any territorial sea but where it has exclusive exploitation rights;\n(m)\ngoods produced there exclusively from products specified in points (a) to (l).\n2.   The terms ‘its vessels’ and ‘its factory ships’ in points (h) and (i) of paragraph 1 shall apply only to vessels and factory ships which meet each of the following requirements:\n(a)\nthey are registered in an OCT or in a Member State;\n(b)\nthey sail under the flag of an OCT or of a Member State;\n(c)\nthey meet one of the following conditions:\n(i)\nthey are at least 50 % owned by nationals of the OCTs or of Member States; or\n(ii)\nthey are owned by companies:\n—\nwhich have their head office and their main place of business in the OCTs or in Member States, and\n—\nwhich are at least 50 % owned by OCTs, public entities of that country, nationals of that country or of Member States.\n3.   The conditions of paragraph 2 may each be fulfilled in Member States or in different OCTs. In that case, the products shall be deemed to have the origin of the OCT where the vessel or factory ship is registered in accordance with point (a) of paragraph 2.\nArticle 4\nSufficiently worked or processed products\n1.   Without prejudice to Articles 5 and 6 of this Annex, products which are not wholly obtained in an OCT within the meaning of Article 3 of this Annex shall be considered to originate there, provided that the conditions laid down in the list in Appendix I for the goods concerned are fulfilled.\n2.   If a product which has acquired originating status in an OCT in accordance with paragraph 1 is further processed in that OCT and used as a material in the manufacture of another product, no account shall be taken of the non-originating materials which may have been used in its manufacture.\n3.   The determination of whether the requirements of paragraph 1 are met shall be carried out for each product.\nHowever, where the relevant rule is based on compliance with a maximum content of non-originating materials, in order to take into account fluctuations in costs and currency rates, the value of the non-originating materials may be calculated on an average basis as set out in paragraph 4.\n4.   Where the second subparagraph of paragraph 3 applies, an average ex-works price of the product and average value of non-originating materials used shall be calculated respectively on the basis of the sum of the ex-works prices charged for all sales of the product carried out during the preceding fiscal year and the sum of the value of all the non-originating materials used in the manufacture of the product over the preceding fiscal year as defined in the country of export, or, where figures for a complete fiscal year are not available, a shorter period which should not be less than three months.\n5.   Exporters having opted for calculations on an average basis shall consistently apply such a method during the year following the fiscal year of reference, or, where appropriate, during the year following the shorter period used as a reference. They may cease to apply such a method where during a given fiscal year, or a shorter representative period of no less than three months, they record that the fluctuations in costs or currency rates which justified the use of such a method have ceased.\n6.   The averages referred to in paragraph 4 shall be used as the ex-works price and the value of non-originating materials respectively, for the purpose of establishing compliance with the maximum content of non-originating materials.\nArticle 5\nInsufficient working or processing operations\n1.   Without prejudice to paragraph 3 of this Article, the following operations shall be considered to be insufficient working or processing to confer the status of originating products, whether or not the requirements of Article 4 of this Annex are satisfied:\n(a)\npreserving operations to ensure that the products remain in good condition during transport and storage;\n(b)\nbreaking-up and assembly of packages;\n(c)\nwashing, cleaning; removal of dust, oxide, oil, paint or other coverings;\n(d)\nironing or pressing of textiles and textile articles;\n(e)\nsimple painting and polishing operations;\n(f)\nhusking and partial or total milling of rice; polishing and glazing of cereals and rice;\n(g)\noperations to colour or flavour sugar or form sugar lumps; partial or total milling of crystal sugar;\n(h)\npeeling, stoning and shelling, of fruits, nuts and vegetables;\n(i)\nsharpening, simple grinding or simple cutting;\n(j)\nsifting, screening, sorting, classifying, grading, matching (including the making-up of sets of articles);\n(k)\nsimple placing in bottles, cans, flasks, bags, cases, boxes, fixing on cards or boards and all other simple packaging operations;\n(l)\naffixing or printing marks, labels, logos and other like distinguishing signs on products or their packaging;\n(m)\nsimple mixing of products, whether or not of different kinds; mixing of sugar with any material;\n(n)\nsimple addition of water or dilution or dehydration or denaturation of products;\n(o)\nsimple assembly of parts of articles to constitute a complete article or disassembly of products into parts;\n(p)\na combination of two or more of the operations specified in points (a) to (o);\n(q)\nslaughter of animals.\n2.   For the purposes of paragraph 1, operations shall be considered simple when neither special skills nor machines, apparatus or tools especially produced or installed for those operations are required for their performance.\n3.   All the operations carried out in an OCT on a given product shall be taken into account when determining whether the working or processing undergone by that product is to be regarded as insufficient within the meaning of paragraph 1.\nArticle 6\nTolerances\n1.   By way of derogation from Article 4 of this Annex and subject to paragraphs 2 and 3 of this Article, non-originating materials which, according to the conditions set out in the list in Appendix I are not to be used in the manufacture of a given product may nevertheless be used, provided that their total value or net weight assessed for the product does not exceed:\n(a)\n15 % of the weight of the product for products falling within Chapters 2 and 4 to 24, other than processed fishery products of Chapter 16;\n(b)\n15 % of the ex-works price of the product for other products, except for products falling within Chapters 50 to 63, for which the tolerances mentioned in Notes 6 and 7 of Appendix I shall apply.\n2.   Paragraph 1 of this Article shall not allow that any of the percentages for the maximum content of non-originating materials as specified in the rules laid down in the list in Appendix I are exceeded.\n3.   Paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Article shall not apply to products wholly obtained in an OCT within the meaning of Article 3 of this Annex. However, without prejudice to Article 5 and Article 11(2) of this Annex, the tolerance provided for in paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Article shall nevertheless apply to the sum of all the materials which are used in the manufacture of a product and for which the rule laid down in the list in Appendix I for that product requires that such materials be wholly obtained.\nArticle 7\nBilateral cumulation\n1.   Without prejudice to Article 2 of this Annex, materials originating in the Union shall be considered to be materials originating in an OCT when incorporated into a product obtained there, provided that they have undergone working or processing which goes beyond the operations referred to in Article 5(1) of this Annex.\n2.   Without prejudice to Article 2 of this Annex, working or processing carried out in the Union shall be considered to have been carried out in an OCT when the materials undergo subsequent working or processing there.\n3.   For the purposes of cumulation as provided for in this Article, the origin of the materials shall be established in accordance with this Annex.\nArticle 8\nCumulation with EPA countries\n1.   Without prejudice to Article 2 of this Annex, materials originating in the EPA countries shall be considered to be materials originating in an OCT when incorporated into a product obtained there, provided that they have undergone working or processing which goes beyond the operations referred to in Article 5(1) of this Annex.\n2.   Without prejudice to Article 2 of this Annex, working or processing carried out in the EPA countries shall be considered to have been carried out in an OCT when the materials undergo subsequent working or processing there.\n3.   For the purposes of paragraph 1, the origin of the materials originating in an EPA country shall be determined in accordance with the rules of origin applicable to the EPA concerned and relevant provisions on proofs of origin and administrative cooperation.\nThe cumulation provided for in this Article shall not apply to materials originating in the Republic of South Africa which cannot be imported directly in the Union duty-free-quota-free in the framework of the EPA between the Union and the Southern African Development Community (SADC).\n4.   The cumulation provided for in this Article may only be applied provided that:\n(a)\nthe EPA country supplying the materials and the OCT manufacturing the final product have undertaken to:\n(i)\ncomply or ensure compliance with this Annex; and\n(ii)\nprovide the administrative cooperation necessary to ensure the correct implementation of this Annex both with regard to the Union and between themselves;\n(b)\nthe undertakings referred to in point (a) have been notified to the Commission by the OCT involved.\n5.   Where EPA countries have already complied with paragraph 4 before 1 January 2014, a new undertaking shall not be required.\nArticle 9\nCumulation with other countries benefitting from duty-free quota-free access to the market of the Union under the Generalised System of Preferences\n1.   Without prejudice to Article 2 of this Annex, materials originating in countries and territories set out in paragraph 2 of this Article shall be considered to be materials originating in an OCT when incorporated into a product obtained there, provided they have undergone working or processing which goes beyond the operations referred to in Article 5(1) of this Annex.\n2.   For the purposes of paragraph 1 of this Article, materials shall originate from a country or territory:\n(a)\nbenefitting from the special arrangement for the least-developed countries of the Generalised System of Preferences (‘GSP’), referred to in point (c) of Article 1(2) of Regulation (EU) No 978/2012; or\n(b)\nbenefitting from duty-free quota-free access to the market of the Union at Harmonized System 6-digit level under the general arrangement of the GSP, referred to in point (a) of Article 1(2) of Regulation (EU) No 978/2012.\n3.   The origin of the materials of the countries or territories concerned shall be determined according to the rules of origin laid down, pursuant to Article 33 of Regulation (EU) No 978/2012, in Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/2446 (2).\n4.   The cumulation provided for in paragraph 1 of this Article shall not apply to the following:\n(a)\nmaterials which at importation to the Union are subject to antidumping or countervailing duties when originating from the country which is subject to these antidumping or countervailing duties;\n(b)\ntuna products classified under Chapters 3 and 16 which are covered by Article 7 of Regulation (EU) No 978/2012, and subsequent amending and corresponding legal acts;\n(c)\nmaterials which are covered by Articles 8 and 22 to 30 of Regulation (EU) No 978/2012, and subsequent amending and corresponding legal acts.\nThe competent authorities of the OCTs shall notify the Commission on an annual basis of the materials, if any, to which cumulation under paragraph 1 of this Article has been applied.\n5.   The cumulation provided for in paragraph 1 of this Article may only be applied provided that:\n(a)\nthe countries or territories involved in the cumulation have undertaken to comply or ensure compliance with this Annex and to provide the administrative cooperation necessary to ensure the correct implementation of this Annex, both with regard to the Union and between themselves;\n(b)\nthe undertaking referred to in point (a) of this paragraph has been notified to the Commission by the OCT concerned.\n6.

The Commission may grant, at the request of an OCT, cumulation of origin between an OCT and a country with which the Union has a free-trade agreement in accordance with Article XXIV of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) in force, provided that the following conditions are met:\n(a)\nthe countries or territories involved in the cumulation have undertaken to:\n(i)\ncomply or ensure compliance with this Annex;\n(ii)\nprovide the administrative cooperation necessary to ensure the correct implementation of this Annex, both with regard to the Union and between themselves; and\n(iii)\nprovide the OCTs with their support in matters of administrative cooperation in the same way as they would provide such support to the customs authorities of the Member States in accordance with the relevant provisions of the free trade agreement concerned;\n(b)\nthe undertaking referred to in point (a) has been notified to the Commission by the OCT concerned.\nThe Commission, taking into account the risk of trade circumvention and specific sensitivities of materials to be used in cumulation, may establish additional conditions for granting the cumulation requested.\n2.   The request referred to in the first subparagraph of paragraph 1 shall:\n(a)\nbe addressed to the Commission in writing;\n(b)\nindicate the third country or countries concerned;\n(c)\ncontain a list of the materials subject to cumulation; and\n(d)\nbe supported by evidence that the conditions laid down in points (a) and (b) of paragraph 1 are met.\n3.   The origin of the materials used and the documentary proof of origin shall be determined in accordance with the rules laid down in the relevant free-trade agreement. The origin of the products to be exported to the Union shall be determined in accordance with the rules of origin laid down in this Annex.\n4.   In order for the obtained product to acquire originating status, it shall not be necessary that the materials originating in the third country and used in the OCT in the manufacture of the product to be exported to the Union have undergone sufficient working or processing, provided that the working or processing carried out in the OCT concerned goes beyond the operations described in Article 5(1) of this Annex.\n5.   The Commission shall publish in the Official Journal of the European Union (C series) the date on which the extended cumulation takes effect, the Union’s free trade agreement partner involved in that cumulation, the applicable conditions and the list of materials in relation to which the cumulation applies.\n6.   The Commission shall adopt a measure granting the cumulation referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article by means of implementing acts. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 47(2) of this Annex.\nArticle 11\nUnit of qualification\n1.   The unit of qualification for the application of this Annex shall be the particular product which is considered to be the basic unit when determining classification using the Harmonized System.\n2.   When a consignment consists of a number of identical products classified under the same heading, each individual item shall be taken into account when applying this Annex.\n3.   Where, under general rule 5 of the Harmonized System, packaging is included with the product for classification purposes, it shall be included for the purpose of determining origin.\nArticle 12\nAccessories, spare parts and tools\nAccessories, spare parts and tools dispatched with a piece of equipment, machine, apparatus or vehicle which are part of the normal equipment and included in the ex-works price thereof, shall be regarded as one with the piece of equipment, machine, apparatus or vehicle in question.\nArticle 13\nSets\nSets, as defined in General Rule 3 for the interpretation of the Harmonized System, shall be regarded as originating when all the component products are originating products.\nWhen a set is composed of originating and non-originating products, the set as a whole shall however be regarded as originating, provided that the value of the non-originating products does not exceed 15 % of the ex-works price of the set.\nArticle 14\nNeutral elements\nIn order to determine whether a product is an originating product, no account shall be taken of the origin of the following which might be used in its manufacture:\n(a)\nenergy and fuel;\n(b)\nplant and equipment;\n(c)\nmachines and tools;\n(d)\nany other goods which do not enter, and which are not intended to enter, into the final composition of the product.\nArticle 15\nAccounting segregation\n1.   If originating and non-originating fungible materials are used in the working or processing of a product, the customs authorities of the Member States may, at the written request of economic operators, authorise the management of materials in the Union using the accounting segregation method for the purposes of subsequent export to an OCT within the framework of bilateral cumulation, without keeping the materials on separate stocks.\n2.   The customs authorities of the Member States may make the granting of authorisation referred to in paragraph 1 subject to any conditions they deem appropriate.\nThe authorisation shall be granted only if by use of the method referred to in paragraph 3 it can be ensured that, at any time, the number of products obtained which could be considered as originating in the Union is the same as the number that would have been obtained by using a method of physical segregation of the stocks.\nIf authorised, the method shall be applied and the application thereof shall be recorded on the basis of the general accounting principles applicable in the Union.\n3.   The beneficiary of the method referred to in paragraph 2 shall make out or, until the application of the REX system, apply for proofs of origin for the quantity of products which may be considered as originating in the Union. At the request of the customs authorities of the Member States, the beneficiary shall provide a statement of how the quantities have been managed.\n4.   The customs authorities of the Member States shall monitor the use made of the authorisation referred to in paragraph 1.\nThey may withdraw the authorisation in the following cases:\n(a)\nthe beneficiary makes improper use of the authorisation in any manner whatsoever; or\n(b)\nthe beneficiary fails to fulfil any of the other conditions laid down in this Annex.\nArticle 16\nDerogations\n1.   Upon the Commission’s initiative or in response to a request from a Member State or an OCT, an OCT may be granted a temporary derogation from this Annex in any of the following cases:\n(a)\ninternal or external factors temporarily deprive it of the ability to comply with the rules for the acquisition of origin provided for in Article 2 of this Annex where it could do so previously;\n(b)\nit requires time to prepare itself to comply with the rules for the acquisition of origin provided for in Article 2 of this Annex;\n(c)\nthe development of existing industries or the creation of new industries justifies it.\n2.   The request referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article shall be addressed to the Commission in writing, by means of the form set out in Appendix II. It shall state the reasons for the request and shall contain appropriate supporting documents.\n3.   The examination of requests shall in particular take into account:\n(a)\nthe level of development or the geographical situation of the OCT concerned, having particular regard to the economic and social impact of the decision to be taken especially in respect of employment;\n(b)\ncases where the application of the existing rules of origin would significantly affect the ability of an existing industry in the OCT concerned to continue its exports to the Union, with particular reference to cases where this could lead to cessation of its activities;\n(c)\nspecific cases where it can be clearly demonstrated that significant investment in an industry could be deterred by the rules of origin and where a derogation favouring the realisation of the investment programme would enable those rules to be satisfied in stages.\n4.   The Commission shall respond positively to all the requests which are duly justified in conformity with this Article and which cannot cause serious injury to an established Union industry.\n5.   The Commission shall take the steps necessary to ensure that a decision is reached as quickly as possible and shall endeavour to adopt its position within 75 working days of its receipt of the request.\n6.   The temporary derogation shall be limited to the duration of the effects of the internal or external factors giving rise to it or to the length of time needed for the OCT to achieve compliance with the rules or to fulfil the targets which have been set by the derogation, taking into account the particular situation of the OCT concerned and its difficulties.\n7.   When a derogation is granted, it is subject to compliance with any requirements laid down as to information to be provided to the Commission concerning the use of the derogation and the management of the quantities for which the derogation was granted.\n8.   The Commission shall adopt a measure granting a temporary derogation referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article by means of implementing acts. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 47(2) of this Annex.\nTITLE III\nTERRITORIAL REQUIREMENTS\nArticle 17\nPrinciple of territoriality\n1.   Except as provided for in Articles 7 to 10 of this Annex, the conditions set out in this Annex for acquiring originating status shall be fulfilled without interruption in the OCT.\n2.   If originating products exported from the OCT to another country are returned, they shall be considered to be non-originating unless it can be demonstrated to the satisfaction of the competent authorities of the OCT that:\n(a)\nthe products returned are the same as those which were exported; and\n(b)\nthey have not undergone any operations beyond those necessary to preserve them in good condition while in that country or while being exported.\nArticle 18\nNon-manipulation clause\n1.   The products declared for release for free circulation in the Union shall be the same products as exported from the OCT in which they are considered to originate. They shall not have been altered, transformed in any way or subjected to operations other than operations to preserve them in good condition, prior to being declared for release for free circulation. Storage of products or consignments and splitting of consignments may take place where carried out under the responsibility of the exporter or of a subsequent holder of the goods and the products remain under customs supervision in the country or countries of transit.\n2.   The customs authorities shall consider the declarant to have complied with paragraph 1 unless they have reason to believe the contrary. In such cases, the customs authorities may request the declarant to provide evidence of compliance, which may be given by any means, including contractual transport documents such as bills of lading or factual or concrete evidence based on marking or numbering of packages or any evidence related to the goods themselves.\n3.   Paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Article shall apply mutatis mutandis when cumulation under Articles 7 to 10 of this Annex applies.\nArticle 19\nExhibitions\n1.   Originating products sent from an OCT for exhibition in a country other than an OCT, an EPA country or a Member State and sold after the exhibition for importation in the Union shall benefit on importation from this Decision, provided it is shown to the satisfaction of the customs authorities that:\n(a)\nan exporter has consigned these products from an OCT to the country in which the exhibition is held and has exhibited them there;\n(b)\nthe products have been sold or otherwise disposed of by that exporter to a person in the Union;\n(c)\nthe products have been consigned during the exhibition or immediately thereafter in the state in which they were sent for exhibition;\n(d)\nthe products have not, since they were consigned for exhibition, been used for any purpose other than demonstration at the exhibition.\n2.   A proof of origin shall be issued or made out in accordance with Title IV of this Annex and submitted to the customs authorities of the importing country in the normal manner. The name and address of the exhibition shall be indicated thereon. Where necessary, additional documentary evidence of the conditions under which they have been exhibited may be required.\n3.   Paragraph 1 shall apply to any trade, industrial, agricultural or crafts exhibition, fair or similar public show or display which is not organised for private purposes in shops or business premises with a view to the sale of foreign products, and during which the products remain under customs control.\nTITLE IV\nPROOFS OF ORIGIN\nSection 1\nGeneral requirements\nArticle 20\nAmounts expressed in euros\n1.   For the application of Articles 29 and 30 of this Annex in cases where products are invoiced in a currency other than the euro, amounts in the national currencies of the Member States equivalent to the amounts expressed in euros shall be fixed annually by each of the countries concerned.\n2.   A consignment shall benefit from Articles 29 and 30 of this Annex by reference to the currency in which the invoice is drawn up.\n3.   The amounts to be used in any given national currency shall be the equivalent in that currency of the amounts expressed in euros as at the first working day of October of each year. The amounts shall be communicated to the Commission by 15 October and shall apply from 1 January the following year. The Commission shall notify all countries concerned of the relevant amounts.\n4.   A Member State may round up or down the amount resulting from the conversion into its national currency of an amount expressed in euros. The rounded-off amount may not differ from the amount resulting from the conversion by more than 5 per cent. A Member State may retain unchanged its national currency equivalent of an amount expressed in euros if, at the time of the annual adjustment provided for in paragraph 3, the conversion of that amount, prior to any rounding-off, results in an increase of less than 15 per cent in the national currency equivalent. The national currency equivalent may be retained unchanged if the conversion would result in a decrease in that equivalent value.\n5.   The amounts expressed in euros and their equivalents in national currencies of some Member States shall be reviewed by the Commission on its own initiative or at the request of a Member State or an OCT. When carrying out this review, the Commission shall consider the desirability of preserving the effects of the limits concerned in real terms. For this purpose, it may decide to modify the amounts expressed in euros.\nSection 2\nProcedures at export in the OCT\nArticle 21\nGeneral requirements\nBenefits from this Decision shall apply in the following cases:\n(a)\nin cases of goods satisfying the requirements of this Annex exported by a registered exporter within the meaning of Article 22 of this Annex;\n(b)\nin cases of any consignment of one or more packages containing originating products exported by any exporter, where the total value of the originating products consigned does not exceed EUR 10 000.\nArticle 22\nRequest for registration\n1.   To be registered, exporters shall lodge an application with the competent authorities of the OCT referred to in Article 39(1) of this Annex, using the form a model of which is set out in Appendix V.\n2.   The application shall be accepted by the competent authorities of the OCT only if it is complete.\n3.   The registration shall be valid as of the date on which the competent authorities of the OCTs receive a complete application for registration, in accordance with paragraphs 1 and 2.\n4.   An exporter established in an OCT and already registered in the REX system for the purposes of the GSP scheme of Norway or Switzerland shall not be required to lodge an application with the competent authorities of the OCT to be registered for the purposes of this Decision.\nArticle 23\nRegistration\n1.   The competent authorities of the OCTs shall upon receipt of the complete application form referred to in Appendix III assign without delay the number of registered exporter to the exporter and enter into the REX system the number of registered exporter, the registration data and the date from which the registration is valid in accordance with Article 22(3) of this Annex.\nThe competent authorities of the OCTs shall inform the exporter of the number of registered exporter assigned to that exporter and of the date from which the registration is valid.\nThe competent authorities of the OCTs shall keep the data registered by them up to date. They shall modify those data immediately after having been informed by the registered exporter in accordance with Article 24(1) of this Annex.\n2.   The registration shall contain the following information:\n(a)\nname of the registered exporter, as specified in box 1 of the form set out in Appendix III;\n(b)\naddress of the place where the registered exporter is established, as specified in box 1 of the form set out in Appendix III, including the identifier of the country or territory (ISO alpha 2 country code);\n(c)\ncontact details as specified in boxes 1 and 2 of the form set out in Appendix III;\n(d)\nindicative description of the goods which qualify for preferential treatment, including indicative list of headings or chapters, as specified in box 4 of the form set out in Appendix III;\n(e)\ntrader identification number (TIN) of the registered exporter as specified in box 1 of the form set out in Appendix III;\n(f)\nwhether the exporter is a trader or a producer as specified in box 3 of the form set out in Appendix III;\n(g)\nthe date of registration of the registered exporter;\n(h)\nthe date from which the registration is valid;\n(i)\nthe date of the revocation of the registration where applicable.\nArticle 24\nRevocation of the registration\n1.   Registered exporters who no longer meet the conditions for exporting any goods benefitting from this Decision, or no longer intend to export such goods, shall inform the competent authorities of the OCTs which shall immediately remove them from the record of registered exporters kept in that OCT.\n2.   Without prejudice to the system of penalties and sanctions applicable in the OCTs, where registered exporters intentionally or negligently draw up, or cause to be drawn up, a statement on origin or any supporting document which contains incorrect information which leads to irregularly or fraudulently obtaining the benefit of preferential tariff treatment, the competent authorities of the OCT shall revoke the exporter from the record of registered exporters kept by the OCT concerned.\n3.   Without prejudice to the possible impact of irregularities found on pending verifications, revocation from the record of registered exporters shall take effect for the future, i.e. in respect of statements made out after the date of revocation.\n4.   Exporters who have been revoked from the record of registered exporters by the competent authorities of an OCT in accordance with paragraph 2 may only be re-introduced into the record of registered exporters once they have proved to the competent authorities of that OCT that they have remedied the situation which led to their revocation.\n5.   If an exporter has been revoked from the record of registered exporters by the competent authorities of the OCT in accordance with the GSP legislation of Norway or Switzerland, the revocation shall also apply for the purposes of this Decision.\nArticle 25\nSupporting documents\n1.   Exporters, registered or not, shall comply with the following obligations:\n(a)\nthey shall maintain appropriate commercial accounting records for production and supply of goods qualifying for preferential treatment;\n(b)\nthey shall keep available all evidence relating to the material used in the manufacture;\n(c)\nthey shall keep all customs documentation relating to the material used in the manufacture;\n(d)\nthey shall keep for at least three years from the end of the year in which the statement on origin was made out, or more if required by national law, records of:\n(i)\nthe statements on origin they made out; and\n(ii)\ntheir originating and non-originating materials, production and stock accounts.\n2.   The records referred to in point (d) of paragraph 1 may be electronic but shall allow the materials used in the manufacture of the exported products to be traced and their originating status to be confirmed.\n3.   The obligations provided for in paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Article shall also apply to suppliers who provide exporters with the supplier’s declaration referred to in Article 27 of this Annex.\nArticle 26\nStatement on origin and information for cumulation purpose\n1.   A statement on origin shall be made out by the exporter when the products to which it relates are exported, if the goods concerned can be considered as originating in the OCT.\n2.   By derogation from paragraph 1, a statement on origin may exceptionally be made out after exportation (‘retrospective statement’) on condition that it is presented in the Member State of declaration for release for free circulation no longer than two years after the export.\n3.   The statement on origin shall be provided by the exporter to his customer in the Union and shall contain the particulars specified in Appendix IV. A statement on origin shall be made out in either English or French.\nIt may be made out on any commercial document allowing to identify the exporter concerned and the goods involved.\n4.   For the purposes of Article 2(2) of this Annex or of bilateral cumulation under Article 7 of this Annex:\n(a)\nthe evidence of originating status of the materials coming from another OCT or from the Union shall be given by means of a statement on origin made out in accordance with this Annex and provided to the exporter by the supplier in the OCT or in the Union, from which the materials came;\n(b)\nthe evidence of working or processing carried out in another OCT or in the Union shall be given by means of a supplier’s declaration, made out in accordance with Article 27 of this Annex and provided to the exporter by the supplier in the OCT or in the Union, from which the materials came.\nIn cases where the first subparagraph applies, the statement on origin made out by the exporter shall, as the case may be, contain the indication ‘EU cumulation’, ‘OCT cumulation’ or ‘cumul UE’, ‘cumul PTOM’.\n5.   For the purposes of cumulation with an EPA country under Article 8 of this Annex:\n(a)\nthe evidence of originating status of the materials coming from an EPA country shall be given by means of a proof of origin issued or made out in accordance with the EPA between the Union and the EPA country concerned, and provided to the exporter by the supplier in the EPA country from which the materials came;\n(b)\nthe evidence of working or processing carried out in the EPA country shall be given by means of a supplier’s declaration, made out in accordance with Article 27 of this Annex and provided to the exporter by the supplier in the EPA country from which the materials came.\nIn cases where the first subparagraph applies, the statement on origin made out by the exporter shall contain the indication ‘cumulation with EPA country [name of the country]’ or ‘cumul avec le pays APE [nom du pays]’.\n6.   For the purposes of cumulation with other countries benefitting from duty-free quota-free access to the market of the Union under GSP under Article 9 of this Annex, the evidence of originating status shall be given by the proofs of origin provided for in Implementing Regulation (EU) 2015/2447, provided to the exporter by the supplier in the GSP country from which the materials came.\nIn this case, the statement on origin made out by the exporter shall contain the indication ‘cumulation with GSP country [name of the country]’ or ‘cumul avec le pays SPG [nom du pays]’.\n7.   For the purposes of extended cumulation under Article 10 of this Annex, the evidence of originating status of the materials coming from a country with which the Union has a free-trade agreement shall be given by means of a proof of origin issued or made out in accordance with that free-trade agreement, provided to the exporter by the supplier in the country from which the materials came.\nIn cases where the first subparagraph applies, the statement on origin made out by the exporter shall contain the indication ‘extended cumulation with country [name of the country]’ or ‘cumul étendu avec le pays [nom du pays]’.\nArticle 27\nSupplier’s declaration\n1.   For the purposes of point (b) of the first subparagraph of Article 26(4) and point (b) of the first subparagraph of Article 26(5) of this Annex, a supplier’s declaration shall be made out by the supplier for each consignment of materials on the commercial invoice related to that shipment or in an annex to that invoice, or on a delivery note or other commercial document related to that shipment which describes the materials concerned in sufficient detail to enable them to be identified. A specimen of the supplier’s declaration is set out in Appendix V.\n2.   When a supplier regularly supplies a particular customer with goods whose status in respect of the rules of preferential origin is expected to remain constant for considerable periods of time, he may provide a single declaration (‘a long-term supplier’s declaration’), provided that facts or circumstances on which it is granted remain unchanged, to cover subsequent shipments of those goods.\nA long-term supplier’s declaration may be issued for a period of up to one year from the date of issue of the declaration. A long-term supplier’s declaration may be issued with retroactive effect. In such cases, its validity may not exceed a period of one year from the date on which it came into effect. The period of validity shall be indicated in the long-term supplier’s declaration.\nThe customs authority may revoke a long-term supplier’s declaration, should the circumstances change, or when inaccurate or false information has been provided.\nThe supplier shall inform the client immediately when the long-term supplier’s declaration is no longer valid in relation to the goods supplied.\n3.   A supplier’s declaration may be made out on a pre-printed form.\n4.   The suppliers’ declarations shall be signed in manuscript. However, where the invoice and the supplier’s declaration are established using electronic data-processing methods, the supplier’s declaration need not be signed in manuscript, provided that the responsible officer in the supplying company is identified to the satisfaction of the customs authorities in the country or territory where the suppliers’ declarations were established. Such customs authorities may lay down conditions for the implementation of this paragraph.\nArticle 28\nProof of origin\n1.   A statement on origin shall be made out for each consignment.\n2.   A statement on origin shall be valid for 12 months from the date of its making out by the exporter.\n3.   A single statement on origin may cover several consignments if the goods meet the following conditions:\n(a)\nthey are dismantled or non-assembled products within the meaning of General Rule 2(a) for the interpretation of the Harmonized system;\n(b)\nthey fall within Section XVI or XVII or heading 7308 or 9406 of the Harmonized System; and\n(c)\nthey are intended to be imported by instalments.\nSection 3\nProcedures at release for free circulation in the Union\nArticle 29\nSubmission of proof of origin\n1.   The customs declaration for release for free circulation shall make reference to the statement on origin. The statement on origin shall be kept at the disposal of the customs authorities, which may request its submission for the verification of the declaration. Those authorities may also require a translation of the statement into the official language, or one of the official languages, of the Member State concerned.\n2.   Where the application of the benefits from this Decision is requested by the declarant, without a statement on origin being in his possession at the time of the acceptance of the customs declaration for release for free circulation, that declaration shall be considered to be a simplified declaration within the meaning of Article 166 of Regulation (EU) No 952/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council (3) and treated accordingly.\n3.   Before declaring goods for release for free circulation, the declarant shall take due care that the goods comply with this Annex by, in particular, checking:\n(a)\non the public website referred to in Article 40(3) and (4) of this Annex that the exporter is registered to make statements on origin, except where the total value of the originating products consigned does not exceed EUR 10 000; and\n(b)\nthat the statement on origin is made out in accordance with Appendix IV.\nArticle 30\nExemption from proof of origin\n1.   The following products shall be exempted from the obligation to make out and produce a statement on origin:\n(a)\nproducts sent as small packages from private persons to private persons, the total value of which does not exceed EUR 500;\n(b)\nproducts forming part of travellers’ personal luggage, the total value of which does not exceed EUR 1 200.\n2.   The products referred to in paragraph 1 shall meet the following conditions:\n(a)\nthey are not imported by way of trade;\n(b)\nthey have been declared as meeting the conditions for benefitting from this Decision; and\n(c)\nthere is no doubt as to the veracity of the declaration referred to in point (b).\n3.   For the purposes of point (a) of paragraph 2, imports shall not be considered to be imports by way of trade if all the following conditions are met:\n(a)\nthe imports are occasional;\n(b)\nthe imports consist solely of products for the personal use of the recipients or travellers or their families;\n(c)\nit is evident from the nature and quantity of the products that no commercial purpose is in view.\nArticle 31\nDiscrepancies and formal errors\n1.   The discovery of slight discrepancies between the particulars included in a statement on origin and those mentioned in the documents submitted to the customs authorities for the purpose of carrying out the formalities for importing the products shall not ipso facto render the statement on origin invalid if it is duly established that that document does correspond to the products concerned.\n2.   Obvious formal errors such as typing errors on a statement on origin shall not cause this document to be rejected if these errors are not such as to create doubts concerning the correctness of the statements made in that document.\nArticle 32\nValidity of statements on origin\nStatements on origin which are submitted to the customs authorities of the importing country after the period of validity mentioned in Article 28(2) of this Annex may be accepted for the purpose of applying the tariff preferences, where failure to submit these documents by the final date set is due to exceptional circumstances. In other cases of belated presentation, the customs authorities of the importing country may accept the statements on origin where the products have been presented to customs before that final date.\nArticle 33\nProcedure for importation by instalments\n1.   The procedure referred to in Article 28(3) of this Annex shall apply for a period determined by the customs authorities of the Member States.\n2.   The customs authorities of the Member States of importation supervising the successive releases for free circulation shall verify that the successive consignments are part of the dismantled or non-assembled products for which the statement on origin has been made out.\nArticle 34\nVerification of statements on origin\n1.   The customs authorities may, where they have doubts with regard to the originating status of the products, request the declarant to produce, within a reasonable time period which they shall specify, any available evidence for the purpose of verifying the accuracy of the indication of origin on the statement or the compliance with the conditions set out in Article 18 of this Annex.\n2.   The customs authorities may suspend the application of the preferential tariff measure for the duration of the verification procedure laid down in Article 43 of this Annex where:\n(a)\nthe information provided by the declarant is not sufficient to confirm the originating status of the products or the compliance with the conditions laid down in Article 17(2) or Article 18 of this Annex;\n(b)\nthe declarant does not reply within the time period allowed for provision of the information referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article.\n3.   While awaiting either the information requested from the declarant, referred to in paragraph 1, or the results of the verification procedure, referred to in paragraph 2, the customs authorities shall offer release of the products to the importer subject to any precautionary measures deemed necessary.\nArticle 35\nDenial of preferences\n1.   The customs authorities of the Member State of importation shall refuse entitlement to the benefits of this Decision, without being obliged to request any additional evidence or send a request for verification to the OCT where:\n(a)\nthe goods are not the same as those mentioned in the statement on origin;\n(b)\nthe declarant fails to submit a statement on origin for the products concerned, where such a statement is required;\n(c)\nwithout prejudice to point (b) of Article 21 and to Article 30(1) of this Annex, the statement on origin in possession of the declarant has not been made out by an exporter registered in the OCT;\n(d)\nthe statement on origin is not made out in accordance with Appendix IV; or\n(e)\nthe conditions of Article 18 of this Annex are not met.\n2.   The customs authorities of the Member State of importation shall refuse entitlement to the benefits of this Decision, following a request for verification within the meaning of Article 43 of this Annex addressed to the competent authorities of the OCTs, where the customs authorities of the Member State of importation:\n(a)\nhave received a reply according to which the exporter was not entitled to make out the statement on origin;\n(b)\nhave received a reply according to which the products concerned are not originating in the OCT concerned or the conditions of Article 17(2) of this Annex were not met; or\n(c)\nhad reasonable doubt as to the validity of the statement on origin or the accuracy of the information provided by the declarant regarding the true origin of the products in question when they made the request for verification; and\n(i)\nhave received no reply within the time period permitted in accordance with Article 43 of this Annex; or\n(ii)\nhave received a reply not providing adequate answers to the questions raised in the request.\nTITLE V\nARRANGEMENTS FOR ADMINISTRATIVE COOPERATION\nSection 1\nGeneral requirements\nArticle 36\nGeneral principles\n1.   In order to ensure the proper application of the preferences, OCTs shall:\n(a)\nput in place and maintain the necessary administrative structures and systems required for the implementation and management in that OCT of the rules and procedures laid down in this Annex, including where appropriate the arrangements necessary for the application of cumulation;\n(b)\ncooperate, through their competent authorities with the Commission and the customs authorities of the Member States.\n2.

The Commission and the customs authorities of the Member States may participate in the enquiries.\n3.   OCTs shall submit to the Commission a formal undertaking to comply with the requirements of paragraph 1.\nArticle 37\nPublication requirements and compliance\n1.   The Commission shall publish in the Official Journal of the European Union (C Series) the list of OCTs and the date on which they are considered to have met the conditions referred to in Article 39 of this Annex. The Commission shall update that list when a new OCT fulfils the same conditions.\n2.   Products originating in an OCT shall benefit, on release for free circulation in the Union, from the tariff preferences only on condition that they were exported on or after the date specified in the list referred to in paragraph 1.\n3.   An OCT shall be considered to comply with Articles 36 and 39 of this Annex on the date on which it has:\n(a)\nmade the notification referred to in Article 39(1) of this Annex, and\n(b)\nsubmitted the undertaking referred to in Article 36(3) of this Annex.\nArticle 38\nPenalties\nPenalties shall be imposed on any person who draws up, or causes to be drawn up, a document which contains incorrect information for the purpose of obtaining a preferential treatment for products.\nSection 2\nMethods of administrative cooperation applicable for the REX system\nArticle 39\nCommunication of names and addresses of competent authorities of the OCTs\n1.

The data registered by the competent authorities of the OCTs in the REX system shall be processed solely for the purposes of this Annex.\n2.   Registered exporters shall be provided with the information laid down in Articles 14 to 16 of Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 of the European Parliament and of the Council (4) or Articles 12 to 14 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council (5), as applicable.\nRegistered exporters shall be provided with the information referred to in the first subparagraph via a notice attached to the application to become a registered exporter as set out in Appendix III to this Annex.\n3.   Each competent authority of an OCT that has introduced data into the REX system shall be considered to be a controller with respect to the processing of those data.\nThe Commission shall be considered to be a joint controller with respect to the processing of all data to guarantee that the registered exporter will obtain his rights.\n4.   The rights of registered exporters with regard to the processing of data listed in Appendix III to this Annex which are stored in the REX system and processed in national systems shall be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2016/679.\n5.   Member States who replicate in their national systems the data of the REX system to which they have access shall keep those replicated data up to date.\n6.   The rights of registered exporters with regard to the processing of their registration data by the Commission shall be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2018/1725.\n7.   Any request by a registered exporter to exercise the right of access, rectification, erasure or blocking of data in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 shall be submitted to and processed by the controller of data.\nWhere a registered exporter has submitted such a request to the Commission without having tried to obtain his rights from the controller of data, the Commission shall forward that request to the controller of data of the registered exporter.\nIf the registered exporter fails to obtain his rights from the controller of data, the registered exporter shall submit such request to the Commission acting as controller. The Commission shall have the right to rectify, erase or block the data.\n8.   The national supervisory data protection authorities and the European Data Protection Supervisor, each acting within the scope of its respective competence, shall, as necessary:\n(a)\ncooperate and ensure coordinated supervision of the registration data;\n(b)\nexchange relevant information;\n(c)\nassist each other in carrying out audits and inspections;\n(d)\nexamine difficulties of interpretation or application of this Annex;\n(e)\nstudy problems with the exercise of independent supervision or in the exercise of the rights of data subjects;\n(f)\ndraw up harmonised proposals for joint solutions to any problems; and\n(g)\npromote awareness of data protection rights.\nArticle 42\nControl of origin\n1.   For the purpose of ensuring compliance with the rules concerning the originating status of products, the competent authorities of the OCT shall carry out:\n(a)\nverifications of the originating status of products at the request of the customs authorities of the Member States;\n(b)\nregular controls on exporters on their own initiative.\n2.   The controls referred to in point (b) of paragraph 1 shall ensure the continued compliance of exporters with their obligations. They shall be carried out at intervals determined on the basis of appropriate risk analysis criteria. For that purpose, the competent authorities of the OCTs shall require exporters to provide copies or a list of the statements on origin they have made out.\n3.   The competent authorities of the OCTs shall have the right to call for any evidence and to carry out any inspection of the exporter’s accounts and, where appropriate, those of producers supplying the exporter, including at the premises, or any other check considered appropriate.\nArticle 43\nRequest for verification of statements on origin\n1.   Subsequent verifications of statements on origin shall be carried out at random or whenever the customs authorities of the Member States have reasonable doubts as to their authenticity, the originating status of the products concerned or the fulfilment of other requirements of this Annex.\nWhere the customs authorities of a Member State request the cooperation of the competent authorities of an OCT to carry out a verification of the validity of statements on origin, the originating status of products, or of both, it shall, where appropriate, indicate on its request the reasons why it has reasonable doubts on the validity of the statement on origin or the originating status of the products.\nA copy of the statement on origin and any additional information or documents suggesting that the information given on that statement is incorrect may be forwarded in support of the request for verification.\nThe requesting Member State shall set a six-month initial deadline to communicate the results of the verification, starting from the date of the verification request.\n2.   If in cases of reasonable doubt there is no reply within the period specified in paragraph 1 or if the reply does not contain sufficient information to determine the real origin of the products, a second communication shall be sent to the competent authorities of the OCT concerned. This communication shall set a further deadline of not more than six months.\nArticle 44\nVerification of suppliers’ declarations\n1.   Verification of suppliers’ declaration referred to in Article 27 of this Annex may be carried out at random or whenever the customs authorities of the importing country have reasonable doubts as to the authenticity of the document or the accuracy or completeness of the information concerning the true origin of the materials in question.\n2.   The customs authorities to which a supplier’s declaration is submitted may request the customs authorities of the country where the declaration was made to issue an information certificate, a specimen of which is set out in Appendix VI. Alternatively, the customs authorities to which a supplier’s declaration is submitted may request the exporter to produce an information certificate issued by the customs authorities of the country where the supplier’s declaration was made out.\nA copy of the information certificate shall be preserved by the office which has issued it for at least three years.\n3.   The requesting customs authorities shall be informed of the results of the verification as soon as possible. The results must be such as to indicate positively whether the declaration concerning the status of the materials is correct.\n4.   For the purposes of verification, suppliers shall keep for at least three years a copy of the document containing the declaration together with all necessary evidence showing the true status of the materials.\n5.   The customs authorities in the country where the supplier’s declaration is made out shall have the right to call for any evidence or to carry out any check which they consider appropriate in order to verify the correctness of any supplier’s declaration.\n6.   Any statement on origin made out on the basis of an incorrect supplier’s declaration shall be considered invalid.\nArticle 45\nOther provisions\n1.   This Section and Section 2 of Title IV shall apply mutatis mutandis to:\n(a)\nexports from the Union to an OCT for the purposes of bilateral cumulation as provided for in Article 7 of this Annex;\n(b)\nexports from one OCT to another for the purposes of OCT cumulation as provided for in Article 2(2) of this Annex;\n(c)\nexports from the Union to an OCT when this OCT grants unilaterally a preferential tariff treatment to a product originating in the Union, in accordance with this Annex.\n2.   An OCT may also provide for the REX system, referred to in Articles 22, 23, 24, 39, 40 and 41 of this Annex, to be used in order for that OCT to grant preferential tariff treatment to products originating in another OCT on the basis of statements on origin made out by exporters registered in that other OCT.\n3.   In the cases referred to in points (a) and (c) of paragraph 1 of this Article, exporters shall be registered in the Union in accordance with Article 68 of Implementing Regulation (EU) 2015/2447.\nTITLE VI\nCEUTA AND MELILLA\nArticle 46\nCeuta and Melilla\n1.   The provisions of this Annex concerning the issue, use and subsequent verification of proofs of origin shall apply mutatis mutandis to products exported from an OCT to Ceuta and Melilla and to products exported from Ceuta and Melilla to an OCT for the purposes of bilateral cumulation.\n2.   Ceuta and Melilla shall be considered to be a single territory.\n3.   The Spanish customs authorities shall be responsible for the application of this Annex in Ceuta and Melilla.\nTITLE VII\nFINAL PROVISIONS\nArticle 47\nCommittee procedure\n1.   The Commission shall be assisted by the Customs Code Committee established by Article 285 of Regulation (EU) No 952/2013. That committee shall be a committee within the meaning of Regulation (EU) No 182/2011.\n2.   Where reference is made to this paragraph, Article 5 of Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 shall apply.\n3.   Where the opinion of the committee is to be obtained by written procedure and reference is made to this paragraph, that procedure shall be terminated without result when, within the time-limit for delivery of the opinion, the chair of the committee so decides.\nAppendix I\nIntroductory notes and list of working or processing operations which confer originating status\nIntroductory notes\nNote 1 – General introduction\nThis Appendix lays down the conditions pursuant to Article 4 of this Annex under which products shall be considered to originate in the OCT concerned. There are four different types of rules, which vary according to the product:\n(a)\nthrough working or processing, a maximum content of non-originating materials is not exceeded;\n(b)\nthrough working or processing, the 4-digit heading or 6-digit subheading of the manufactured products becomes different from the 4-digit heading or 6-digit subheading respectively of the materials used;\n(c)\na specific working and processing operation is carried out;\n(d)\nworking or processing is carried out on certain wholly obtained materials.\nNote 2 – The structure of the list\n2.1.\nColumns 1 and 2 describe the product obtained. Column 1 gives the chapter number, 4-digit heading or 6-digit subheading number, as appropriate. Column 2 gives the description of goods used in the Harmonized System for that heading or chapter. For each entry in columns 1 and 2, subject to Note 2.4, one or more rules (‘qualifying operations’) are set out in column 3. These qualifying operations concern only non-originating materials. Where, in some cases, the entry in column 1 is preceded by ‘ex’, this signifies that the rule in column 3 applies only to the part of that heading as described in column 2.\n2.2.\nWhere several headings or subheadings are grouped together in column 1 or a chapter number is given and the description of products in column 2 is therefore given in general terms, the adjacent rule in column 3 applies to all products which, under the Harmonized System, are classified in headings of the chapter or in any of the headings or subheadings grouped together in column 1.\n2.3.\nWhere there are different rules in the list applying to different products within a heading, each indent contains the description of that part of the heading covered by the adjacent rule in column 3.\n2.4.\nWhere two alternative rules are set out in column 3, separated by ‘or’, it is at the choice of the exporter which one to use.\nNote 3 – Examples of how to apply the rules\n3.1.\nArticle 4(2) of this Annex, concerning products having acquired originating status which are used in the manufacture of other products, shall apply, regardless of whether this status has been acquired inside the factory where these products are used or in another factory in the OCT or in the Union.\n3.2.\nPursuant to Article 5 of this Annex, the working or processing carried out must go beyond the list of operations referred to in that Article. If it does not, the goods shall not qualify for the granting of the benefit of preferential tariff treatment, even if the conditions set out in the list below are met.\nSubject to Article 5 of this Annex, the rules in the list represent the minimum amount of working or processing required, and the carrying-out of more working or processing also confers originating status; conversely, the carrying-out of less working or processing cannot confer originating status. Thus, if a rule provides that non-originating material, at a certain level of manufacture, may be used, the use of such material at an earlier stage of manufacture is allowed, and the use of such material at a later stage is not.\n3.3.\nWithout prejudice to Note 3.2, where a rule uses the expression ‘Manufacture from materials of any heading’, then materials of any heading(s) (even materials of the same description and heading as the product) may be used, subject, however, to any specific limitations which may also be contained in the rule.\nHowever, the expression ‘Manufacture from materials of any heading, including other materials of heading …’ or ‘Manufacture from materials of any heading, including other materials of the same heading as the product’ means that materials of any heading(s) may be used, except those of the same description as the product as given in column 2 of the list.\n3.4.\nWhen a rule in the list specifies that a product may be manufactured from more than one material, this means that one or more materials may be used. It does not require that all be used.\n3.5.\nWhere a rule in the list specifies that a product must be manufactured from a particular material, the rule does not prevent the use also of other materials which, because of their inherent nature, cannot satisfy this condition.\nNote 4 – General provisions concerning certain agricultural goods\n4.1.\nAgricultural goods falling within Chapters 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12 and heading 2401 which are grown or harvested in the territory of an OCT shall be treated as originating in the territory of that OCT, even if grown from seeds, bulbs, rootstock, cuttings, grafts, shoots, buds, or other live parts of plants imported from another country.\n4.2.\nIn cases where the content of non-originating sugar in a given product is subject to limitations, the weight of sugars of headings 1701 (sucrose) and 1702 (e.g. fructose, glucose, lactose, maltose, isoglucose or invert sugar) used in the manufacture of the final product and used in the manufacture of the non-originating products incorporated in the final product is taken into account for the calculation of such limitations.\nNote 5 – Terminology used in respect of certain textile products\n5.1.\nThe term ‘natural fibres’ is used in the list to refer to fibres other than artificial or synthetic fibres. It is restricted to the stages before spinning takes place, including waste, and, unless otherwise specified, includes fibres which have been carded, combed or otherwise processed, but not spun.\n5.2.\nThe term ‘natural fibres’ includes horsehair of heading 0503, silk of headings 5002 and 5003, as well as wool-fibres and fine or coarse animal hair of headings 5101 to 5105, cotton fibres of headings 5201 to 5203, and other vegetable fibres of headings 5301 to 5305.\n5.3.\nThe terms ‘textile pulp’, ‘chemical materials’ and ‘paper-making materials’ are used in the list to describe the materials, not classified in Chapters 50 to 63, which can be used to manufacture artificial, synthetic or paper fibres or yarns.\n5.4.\nThe term ‘man-made staple fibres’ is used in the list to refer to synthetic or artificial filament tow, staple fibres or waste, of headings 5501 to 5507.\nNote 6 – Tolerances applicable to products made of a mixture of textile materials\n6.1.\nWhere, for a given product in the list, reference is made to this Note, the conditions set out in column 3 shall not be applied to any basic textile materials used in the manufacture of this product and which, taken together, represent 10 % or less of the total weight of all the basic textile materials used. (See also Notes 6.3 and 6.4)\n6.2.\nHowever, the tolerance mentioned in Note 6.1 may be applied only to mixed products which have been made from two or more basic textile materials.\nThe following are the basic textile materials:\n—\nsilk;\n—\nwool;\n—\ncoarse animal hair;\n—\nfine animal hair;\n—\nhorsehair;\n—\ncotton;\n—\npaper-making materials and paper;\n—\nflax;\n—\ntrue hemp;\n—\njute and other textile bast fibres;\n—\nsisal and other textile fibres of the genus Agave;\n—\ncoconut, abaca, ramie and other vegetable textile fibres;\n—\nsynthetic man-made filaments;\n—\nartificial man-made filaments;\n—\ncurrent-conducting filaments;\n—\nsynthetic man-made staple fibres of polypropylene;\n—\nsynthetic man-made staple fibres of polyester;\n—\nsynthetic man-made staple fibres of polyamide;\n—\nsynthetic man-made staple fibres of polyacrylonitrile;\n—\nsynthetic man-made staple fibres of polyimide;\n—\nsynthetic man-made staple fibres of polytetrafluoroethylene;\n—\nsynthetic man-made staple fibres of poly(phenylene sulphide);\n—\nsynthetic man-made staple fibres of poly(vinyl chloride);\n—\nother synthetic man-made staple fibres;\n—\nartificial man-made staple fibres of viscose;\n—\nother artificial man-made staple fibres;\n—\nyarn made of polyurethane segmented with flexible segments of polyether, whether or not gimped;\n—\nyarn made of polyurethane segmented with flexible segments of polyester, whether or not gimped;\n—\nproducts of heading 5605 (metallised yarn) incorporating strip consisting of a core of aluminium foil or of a core of plastic film whether or not coated with aluminium powder, of a width not exceeding 5 mm, sandwiched by means of a transparent or coloured adhesive between two layers of plastic film;\n—\nother products of heading 5605;\n—\nglass fibres;\n—\nmetal fibres.\nExample:\nA yarn, of heading 5205, made from cotton fibres of heading 5203 and synthetic staple fibres of heading 5506, is a mixed yarn. Therefore, non-originating synthetic staple fibres which do not satisfy the origin rules may be used, provided that their total weight does not exceed 10 % of the weight of the yarn.\nExample:\nA woollen fabric, of heading 5112, made from woollen yarn of heading 5107 and synthetic yarn of staple fibres of heading 5509, is a mixed fabric. Therefore, synthetic yarn which does not satisfy the origin rules, or woollen yarn which does not satisfy the origin rules, or a combination of the two, may be used, provided that their total weight does not exceed 10 % of the weight of the fabric.\nExample:\nTufted textile fabric, of heading 5802, made from cotton yarn of heading 5205 and cotton fabric of heading 5210, is only a mixed product if the cotton fabric is itself a mixed fabric made from yarns classified in two separate headings, or if the cotton yarns used are themselves mixtures.\nExample:\nIf the tufted textile fabric concerned had been made from cotton yarn of heading 5205 and synthetic fabric of heading 5407, then, obviously, the yarns used are two separate basic textile materials and the tufted textile fabric is, accordingly, a mixed product.\n6.3.\nIn the case of products incorporating ‘yarn made of polyurethane segmented with flexible segments of polyether, whether or not gimped’, the tolerance is 20 % in respect of this yarn.\n6.4.\nIn the case of products incorporating ‘strip consisting of a core of aluminium foil or of a core of plastic film whether or not coated with aluminium powder, of a width not exceeding 5 mm, sandwiched by means of a transparent or coloured adhesive between two layers of plastic film’, the tolerance is 30 % in respect of this strip.\nNote 7 – Other tolerances applicable to certain textile products\n7.1.\nWhere, in the list, reference is made to this Note, textile materials which do not satisfy the rule set out in the list in column 3 for the made-up product concerned, may be used, provided that they are classified in a heading other than that of the product and that their value does not exceed 8 % of the ex-works price of the product.\n7.2.\nWithout prejudice to Note 7.3, materials which are not classified within Chapters 50 to 63 may be used freely in the manufacture of textile products, whether or not they contain textiles.\nExample:\nIf a rule in the list provides that, for a particular textile item (such as trousers), yarn must be used, this does not prevent the use of metal items, such as buttons, because buttons are not classified within Chapters 50 to 63. For the same reason, it does not prevent the use of slide-fasteners, even though slide-fasteners normally contain textiles.\n7.3.\nWhere a percentage rule applies, the value of materials which are not classified within Chapters 50 to 63 must be taken into account when calculating the value of the non-originating materials incorporated.\nNote 8 – Definition of specific processes and simple operations carried out in respect of certain products of Chapter 27\n8.1.\nFor the purposes of headings ex 2707 and 2713, the ‘specific processes’ are the following:\n(a)\nvacuum-distillation;\n(b)\nredistillation by a very thorough fractionation-process(1);\n(c)\ncracking;\n(d)\nreforming;\n(e)\nextraction by means of selective solvents;\n(f)\nthe process comprising all of the following operations: processing with concentrated sulphuric acid, oleum or sulphuric anhydride; neutralisation with alkaline agents; decolourisation and purification with naturally-active earth, activated earth, activated charcoal or bauxite;\n(g)\npolymerisation;\n(h)\nalkylation;\n(i)\nisomerisation.\n8.2.\nFor the purposes of headings 2710, 2711 and 2712, the ‘specific processes’ are the following:\n(a)\nvacuum-distillation;\n(b)\nredistillation by a very thorough fractionation-process (6);\n(c)\ncracking;\n(d)\nreforming;\n(e)\nextraction by means of selective solvents;\n(f)\nthe process comprising all of the following operations: processing with concentrated sulphuric acid, oleum or sulphuric anhydride; neutralisation with alkaline agents; decolourisation and purification with naturally-active earth, activated earth, activated charcoal or bauxite;\n(g)\npolymerisation;\n(h)\nalkylation;\n(i)\nisomerisation;\n(j)\nin respect of heavy oils of heading ex 2710 only, desulphurisation with hydrogen, resulting in a reduction of at least 85 % of the sulphur-content of the products processed (ASTM D 1266-59 T method);\n(k)\nin respect of products of heading 2710 only, deparaffining by a process other than filtering;\n(l)\nin respect of heavy oils of heading ex 2710 only, treatment with hydrogen, at a pressure of more than 20 bar and a temperature of more than 250 °C, with the use of a catalyst, other than to effect desulphurisation, when the hydrogen constitutes an active element in a chemical reaction. The further treatment, with hydrogen, of lubricating oils of heading ex 2710 (e.g. hydrofinishing or decolourisation), in order, more especially, to improve colour or stability shall not, however, be deemed to be a specific process;\n(m)\nin respect of fuel oils of heading ex 2710 only, atmospheric distillation, on condition that less than 30 % of these products distils, by volume, including losses, at 300 °C, by the ASTM D 86 method;\n(n)\nin respect of heavy oils other than gas oils and fuel oils of heading ex 2710 only, treatment by means of a high-frequency electrical brush-discharge;\n(o)\nin respect of crude products (other than petroleum jelly, ozokerite, lignite wax or peat wax, paraffin wax containing by weight less than 0,75 % of oil) of heading ex 2712 only, de-oiling by fractional crystallisation.\n8.3.\nFor the purposes of headings ex 2707 and 2713, simple operations, such as cleaning, decanting, desalting, water-separation, filtering, colouring, marking, obtaining a sulphur-content as a result of mixing products with different sulphur-contents, or any combination of these operations or like operations, do not confer origin.\nList of products and working or processing operations which confer originating status\nHarmonized System heading\nDescription of product\nQualifying operation (Working or processing, carried out on non-originating materials, which confers originating status)\n(1)\n(2)\n(3)\nChapter 1\nLive animals\nAll the animals of Chapter 1 are wholly obtained\nChapter 2\nMeat and edible meat offal\nManufacture in which all the meat and edible meat offal in the products of this Chapter is wholly obtained\nex Chapter 3\nFish and crustaceans, molluscs and other aquatic invertebrates, except for:\nAll fish and crustaceans, molluscs and other aquatic invertebrates are wholly obtained\n0304\nFish fillets and other fish meat (whether or not minced), fresh, chilled of frozen\nManufacture in which all the materials of Chapter 3 used are wholly obtained\n0305\nFish, dried, salted or in brine;

The administrative cooperation referred to in paragraph 1 requires, inter alia, that an OCT:\n(a)\ncommunicate to the Commission and update the information necessary for the implementation of the rules of origin and the policing thereof;\n(b)\nassist the Union by carrying out, at the request of the customs authorities of the Member States, subsequent verification of the origin of the goods, and communicate its results in time;\n(c)\ncarriy out or arrange for appropriate inquiries to identify and prevent contravention of the rules of origin;\n(d)\nassist the Union by allowing the Commission, in coordination and close cooperation with the competent authorities of the Member States, to conduct Union inquiries on its territory, in order to verify the authenticity of documents or the accuracy of information relevant for granting the benefit of the arrangements referred to in Article 44 of this Decision;\n(e)\ncomply with or ensure compliance with the rules of origin in respect of cumulation, within the meaning of Articles 7 to 10 of Annex II;\n(f)\nassist the Union in the verification of conduct where there is the presumption of origin-related fraud; the existence of fraud may be presumed where imports of products under the preferential arrangements provided for in this Decision massively exceed the usual levels of the beneficiary OCT exports.\nArticle 2\nWithdrawal of preferential arrangements\n1.   The Commission may temporarily withdraw the preferential arrangements provided for in this Decision, in respect of all or of certain products originating in a beneficiary country, where it considers that there is sufficient evidence that a temporary withdrawal would be justified for the reasons referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 of Article 1 of this Annex, provided that it has first:\n(a)\nconsulted the Committee referred to in Article 90 of this Decision in accordance with the procedure referred to in its paragraph 4.\n(b)\ncalled on the Member States to take such precautionary measures as are necessary, in order to safeguard the Union’s financial interests and/or secure compliance by the beneficiary country with its obligations; and\n(c)\npublished a notice in the Official Journal of the European Union stating that there are grounds for reasonable doubt about the application of the preferential arrangements and/or compliance by the beneficiary country with its obligations, which may call into question its right to continue to enjoy the benefits granted by this Decision.\nThe Commission shall inform the OCT concerned of any decision taken in accordance with this paragraph, before it becomes effective. The Commission shall also notify the Committee referred to in Article 88 of this Decision.\n2.   The period of temporary withdrawal shall not exceed six months. On the expiry of that period, the Commission shall decide either to terminate the temporary withdrawal after informing the Committee referred to in Article 88 of this Decision or to extend the period of temporary withdrawal in accordance with the procedure referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article.\n3.   Member States shall communicate to the Commission all relevant information that may justify the withdrawal of preferences, its extension or its termination.\nANNEX IV\nSAFEGUARD AND SURVEILLANCE PROCEDURES\nArticle 1\nDefinitions relating to surveillance and safeguard measures\nFor the purpose of the Articles 2 to 10 of this Annex relating to surveillance and safeguard measures:\n(a)\n‘like product’ means a product which is identical, namely alike in all respects, to the product under consideration, or, in the absence of such a product, another product which, although not alike in all respects, has characteristics closely resembling those of the product under consideration;\n(b)\n‘interested parties’ means those parties involved in the production, distribution and/or sale of the imports mentioned in Article 2(1) of this Annex and of like or directly competing products;\n(c)\n‘serious difficulties’ shall be deemed to exist where Union producers suffer deterioration in their economic and/or financial situation.\nArticle 2\nPrinciples of safeguard measures\n1.   Where a product originating in an OCT referred to in Article 44 of this Decision is imported in volumes and/or at prices which cause, or threaten to cause, serious difficulties to Union producers of like or directly competing products, the necessary safeguard measures may be taken in accordance with the provisions below.\n2.   For the purpose of implementing paragraph 1, priority shall be given to such measures as would least disturb the functioning of the Association. Those measures shall not exceed the limits of what is strictly necessary to remedy the difficulties that have arisen. They shall not exceed the withdrawal of the preferential treatment granted by this Decision.\n3.   When safeguard measures are taken or modified, particular attention shall be paid to the interests of the OCT involved.\nArticle 3\nInitiation of proceedings\n1.   The Commission shall investigate whether safeguard measures should be taken if there is sufficient prima facie evidence that the conditions of Article 2 of this Annex are met.\n2.   An investigation shall be initiated upon request by a Member State, by any legal person or any association not having legal personality, acting on behalf of Union producers, or on the Commission’s own initiative if it is apparent to the Commission that there is sufficient prima facie evidence, as determined on the basis of factors referred to in Article 2 of this Annex, to justify the initiation of an investigation. The request to initiate an investigation shall contain evidence that the conditions for imposing the safeguard measure set out in Article 2 of this Annex are met. The request shall be submitted to the Commission. The Commission shall, as far as possible, examine the accuracy and adequacy of the evidence provided in the request to determine whether there is sufficient prima facie evidence to justify the initiation of an investigation.\n3.   Where it is apparent that there is sufficient prima facie evidence to justify the initiation of a proceeding, the Commission shall publish a notice in the Official Journal of the European Union. Initiation of the investigation shall take place within one month of the request received pursuant to paragraph 2. If an investigation is initiated, the notice shall provide all necessary details about the procedure and deadlines, including the possibility of recourse to the Hearing Officer of the Directorate-General for Trade of the Commission.\n4.   The rules and procedures concerning the conduct of the investigation are laid down in Article 4 of this Annex.\n5.   If the OCT’s authorities so require and without prejudice to the deadlines referred to in this Article, a trilateral consultation referred to in Article 14 of this Decision shall be organised. The outcome of the trilateral consultation shall be transmitted to the OCT committee.\nArticle 4\nInvestigations\n1.   Following the initiation of the proceeding, the Commission shall commence an investigation. The period as set out in paragraph 3 shall start on the day the decision to initiate the investigation is published in the Official Journal of the European Union.\n2.   The Commission may request Member States to supply information and Member States shall take whatever steps are necessary in order to give effect to any such request. If that information is of general interest and is not confidential within the meaning of Article 9 of this Annex, it shall be added to the non-confidential files as provided for in paragraph 6 of this Article.\n3.   The investigation shall be concluded within 12 months of its initiation.\n4.   The Commission shall seek all information it considers necessary to make a determination with regard to the conditions set out in Article 2 of this Annex, and, where it considers it appropriate, shall endeavour to verify that information.\n5.   In the investigation the Commission shall evaluate all relevant factors of an objective and quantifiable nature having a bearing on the situation of the Union industry, in particular, the market share, changes in the level of sales, production, productivity, capacity utilisation, profits and losses, and employment. This list is not exhaustive and other relevant factors may also be taken into consideration by the Commission.\n6.   Interested parties who have come forward within the period laid down in the notice published in the Official Journal of the European Union and representatives of the OCT concerned may, upon written request, inspect all information made available to the Commission in connection with the investigation other than internal documents prepared by the Union authorities or those of the Member States, provided that that information is relevant to the presentation of their case and not confidential within the meaning of Article 9 of this Annex and that it is used by the Commission in the investigation. Interested parties who have come forward may communicate their views on the information to the Commission. Those views shall be taken into consideration where they are backed by sufficient prima\nfacie evidence.\n7.   The Commission shall ensure that all data and statistics which are used for the investigation are available, comprehensible, transparent and verifiable.\n8.   The Commission shall hear the interested parties, in particular where they have made a written application within the period laid down in the notice published in the Official Journal of the European Union, showing that they are actually likely to be affected by the outcome of the investigation and that there are special reasons for them to be heard orally. The Commission shall hear such parties on further occasions if there are special reasons for them to be heard again.\n9.   If information is not supplied within the time limits set by the Commission, or the investigation is significantly impeded, findings may be made on the basis of the facts available. Where the Commission finds that any interested party or third party has supplied it with false or misleading information, it shall disregard that information and may make use of the facts available.\n10.   The Commission shall notify the OCT concerned in writing of the initiation of an investigation.\nArticle 5\nPrior surveillance measures\n1.   The products originating in the OCT referred to in Article 44 of this Decision may be subject to special surveillance.\n2.   Prior surveillance measures shall be adopted by the Commission in accordance with the advisory procedure referred to in Article 90(4) of this Decision.\n3.   Prior surveillance measures shall have a limited period of validity. Unless otherwise provided, they shall cease to be valid at the end of the second six-month period following the first six months after the measures were introduced.\n4.   The Commission and the competent OCT’s authorities shall ensure the effectiveness of the surveillance measures by introducing the methods of administrative cooperation set out in Annexes II and III.\nArticle 6\nImposition of provisional safeguard measures\n1.   On duly justified grounds of urgency relating to deterioration of the economic and/or financial situation of Union producers which would be difficult to remedy, provisional measures may be imposed. Provisional measures shall not apply for more than 200 days. Provisional measures shall be adopted by the Commission in accordance with the advisory procedure referred to in Article 90(4) of this Decision. In cases of imperative grounds of urgency, the Commission shall adopt immediately applicable provisional safeguard measures in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 90(6) of this Decision.\n2.   Should the provisional safeguard measures be repealed because the investigation shows that the conditions set out in Article 2 of this Annex are not met, any customs duty collected as a result of those provisional measures shall be refunded automatically.\nArticle 7\nImposition of definitive measures\n1.   Where the facts as finally established show that the conditions set out in Article 2 are not met, the Commission shall adopt a decision terminating the investigation and proceeding in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 4. The Commission shall make public, with due regard to the protection of confidential information within the meaning of Article 9, a report setting forth its findings and reasoned conclusions reached on all pertinent issues of fact and law.\n2.   Where the facts as finally established show that the conditions set out in Article 2 of this Annex are met, the Commission shall adopt a decision imposing definitive safeguard measures in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 4 of this Annex. The Commission shall make public, with due regard to the protection of confidential information within the meaning of Article 9 of this Annex, a report containing a summary of the material facts and considerations relevant to the determination. The Commission shall immediately notify the OCT’s authorities of the decision to take the necessary safeguard measures.\nArticle 8\nDuration and review of safeguard measures\n1.   A safeguard measure shall remain in force only for such period of time as may be necessary to prevent or remedy the serious injury and to facilitate adjustment. That period shall not exceed three years, unless it is extended under paragraph 2.\n2.   The initial period of duration of a safeguard measure may exceptionally be extended by up to two years provided it is determined that the safeguard measure continues to be necessary to prevent or remedy serious difficulties.\n3.   Any extension pursuant to paragraph 2 shall be preceded by an investigation upon a request by a Member State, by any legal person or any association not having legal personality, acting on behalf of the Union industry, or on the Commission’s own initiative if there is sufficient prima facie evidence that the safeguard measure continues to be necessary.\n4.   The initiation of an investigation shall be published in accordance with Article 4 and the safeguard measure shall remain in force pending the outcome of the investigation. The investigation and any decision regarding an extension pursuant to paragraph 2 of this Article shall be done in accordance with Articles 6 and 7.\nArticle 9\nConfidentiality\n1.   Information received pursuant to this Decision shall be used only for the purpose for which it was requested. Neither information of a confidential nature nor any information provided on a confidential basis received pursuant to this Decision shall be disclosed without specific permission from the supplier of such information.\n2.   Each request for confidentiality shall state the reasons why the information is confidential. However, if the supplier of the information wishes neither to make it public nor to authorise its disclosure in general terms or in the form of a summary, and if it appears that the request for confidentiality is unjustified, the information concerned may be disregarded.\n3.   Information shall, in any case, be considered to be confidential if its disclosure is likely to have a significantly adverse effect upon the supplier or the source of such information.\n4.   Paragraphs 1 to 4 shall not preclude reference by the Union authorities to general information and in particular to reasons on which decisions taken pursuant to this Decision are based. Those authorities shall, however, take into account the legitimate interest of natural and legal persons concerned that their business secrets should not be divulged.", "summary": "Association of the overseas countries and territories with the European Union\nAssociation of the overseas countries and territories with the European Union\nSUMMARY OF:\nDecision (EU) 2021/1764 on the association of the overseas countries and territories with the European Union including Greenland\nWHAT IS THE AIM OF THE DECISION?\nIt aims to renew and strengthen the strategic partnership between the European Union (EU) and its overseas countries and territories (OCTs).\nIt is built on three pillars: political, trade and cooperation. It has no end date and defines a financial envelope for 2021–2027.\nThe decision repeals the former Council Decision 2013/755/EU on OCTs and replaces Council Decision 2014/137/EU on cooperation with Greenland.\nKEY POINTS\nOverseas countries and territories\nThe EU has 13 OCTs (reduced from 25 by Brexit).\nThey are part of the territory of the three Member States (Denmark, France and the Netherlands) with which they maintain special constitutional links.\nThey are not part of the EU territory or the single market and are not bound by the acquis communautaire unlike the EU’s outermost regions.\nOCTs have wide-ranging autonomy, covering areas including economic affairs, public health, home affairs and customs, but defence and foreign affairs usually remain within the remit of the respective Member States.\nObjectives\nEnhance the OCTs’ competitiveness, strengthen their resilience, reduce their economic and environmental vulnerability and promote cooperation between them and other partners.\nPreserve the existing ties between the EU on the one hand, and Greenland and Denmark on the other, acknowledging the geostrategic position of Greenland in the Arctic, and maintain existing ties between the EU and the other OCTs, acknowledging their geostrategic positions in the Caribbean, the Indian Ocean, the Atlantic and the Pacific.\nPriorities\nThe association provides a basis for policy dialogue and cooperation on issues of mutual interest. The decision prioritises cooperation in a number of areas including:\nthe sustainable diversification of OCTs’ economies, including their further integration in world and regional economies, and the specific need to increase skills in Greenland’s labour force;\nthe fostering of exchange, cooperation and partnerships to more quickly achieve the sustainable development goals;\neducation and training, public health, tourism and culture;\nthe sustainable management of natural resources, including the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity and ecosystem services;\nthe mitigation of climate change and adaptation to the impacts of climate change;\ndigital accessibility;\nthe promotion of social, cultural and economic exchanges between the OCTs, their neighbours and other partners.\nBudget and funding\nThe decision sets up the funding programme for the association for 2021–2027: €500 million.\nEU assistance to OCTs is now to be financed from the EU’s general budget under the 2021–2027 multiannual financial framework.\nIt had previously been financed by the European Development Fund and partly by the budget (former Greenland decision).\nAnnex 1 to the decision sets out forms of EU funding and the rules for providing such funding.\nFROM WHEN DOES THE DECISION APPLY?\n              \nIt has applied since 1 January 2021.\nBACKGROUND\n              \nFor
