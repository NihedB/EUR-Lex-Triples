{"celex_id": "32012R0267", "reference": "24.3.2012\nEN\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\nL 88/1\nCOUNCIL REGULATION (EU) No 267/2012\nof 23 March 2012\nconcerning restrictive measures against Iran and repealing Regulation (EU) No 961/2010\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 215 thereof,\nHaving regard to Council Decision 2012/35/CFSP of 23 January 2012 amending Decision 2010/413/CFSP concerning restrictive measures against Iran (1),\nHaving regard to the joint proposal from the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy and the European Commission,\nWhereas:\n(1)\nOn 25 October 2010, the Council adopted Regulation (EU) No 961/2010 on restrictive measures against Iran and repealing Regulation (EC) No 423/2007 (2), in order to give effect to Council Decision 2010/413/CFSP (3).\n(2)\nOn 23 January 2012, the Council approved Decision 2012/35/CFSP providing for additional restrictive measures against the Islamic Republic of Iran (‧Iran‧) as requested by the European Council on 9 December 2011.\n(3)\nThose restrictive measures comprise, in particular, additional restrictions on trade in dual-use goods and technology, as well as on key equipment and technology which could be used in the petrochemical industry, a ban on the import of Iranian crude oil, petroleum products and petrochemical products, as well as a prohibition of investment in the petrochemical industry. Moreover, trade in gold, precious metals and diamonds with the Government of Iran, as well as the delivery of newly printed banknotes and coinage to or for the benefit of the Central Bank of Iran, should be prohibited.\n(4)\nCertain technical amendments to existing measures have also become necessary. In particular, the definition of \"brokering services\" should be clarified. In cases where the purchase, sale, supply, transfer or export of goods and technology or of financial and technical services may be authorised by a competent authority no separate authorisation of related brokering services will be required.\n(5)\nThe definition of \"transfers of funds\" should be broadened to non-electronic transfers so as to counter attempts at circumventing the restrictive measures.\n(6)\nThe revised restrictive measures concerning dual-use goods should cover all goods and technology set out in Annex I to Council Regulation (EC) No 428/2009 of 5 May 2009 setting up a Community regime for the control of exports, transfer, brokering and transit of dual-use items (4), with the exception of certain items in Part 2 of category 5 thereof in view of their use in public communication services in Iran. However, the prohibitions in Article 2 of this Regulation do not apply to the sale, supply, transfer or export of goods and technology newly listed in Annex I or II of this Regulation for which an authorisation has already been granted by the competent authorities of the Member States pursuant to Article 3 of Regulation (EU) No 961/2010 prior to the entry into force of this Regulation.\n(7)\nIn order to ensure the effective implementation of the prohibition on the sale, supply, transfer or export to Iran of certain key equipment or technology which could be used in the key sectors of the oil, natural gas and petrochemical industries, lists of such key equipment and technology should be provided.\n(8)\nFor the same reason, lists of items subject to trade restrictions on crude oil and petroleum products, petrochemical products, gold, precious metals and diamonds should also be provided.\n(9)\nIn addition, to be effective, restrictions on investment in the Iranian oil and gas sector should cover certain key activities, such as bulk gas transmission services for the purpose of transit or delivery to directly interconnected grids, and, for the same reason, should apply to joint ventures as well as other forms of associations and cooperation with Iran in the sector of the transmission of natural gas.\n(10)\nEffective restrictions on Iranian investment in the Union require that measures be taken to prohibit natural or legal persons, entities and bodies subject to the jurisdiction of the Member States from enabling or authorising such investment.\n(11)\nDecision 2012/35/CFSP also extends the freezing of assets to additional persons, entities or bodies providing support to the Government of Iran, including financial, logistical and material support, or associated with them. The Decision also extends the freezing measures to other members of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC).\n(12)\nDecision 2012/35/CFSP also provides for the freezing of the assets of the Central Bank of Iran. However, in consideration of possible involvement of the Central Bank of Iran in the financing of foreign trade, derogations are deemed necessary as this targeted financial measure should not prevent trade operations, including contracts relating to foodstuffs, healthcare, medical equipment or for humanitarian purposes in accordance with the provisions of this Regulation. The exemptions in Articles 12 and 14 of this Regulation concerning contracts for the import, purchase or transport of Iranian crude oil, petroleum products and petrochemical products concluded before 23 January 2012 also apply to ancillary contracts, including transport, insurance or inspections contracts necessary for the execution of such contracts. Furthermore, Iranian crude oil, petroleum products and petrochemical products which are legally imported into a Member State pursuant to the exemptions in Articles 12 and 14 of this Regulation are to be considered as being in free circulation within the Union..\n(13)\nIt is prohibited, pursuant to the obligation to freeze the assets of Islamic Republic of Iran Shipping Line (IRISL) and of entities owned or controlled by IRISL to load and unload cargoes on and from vessels owned or chartered by IRISL or by such entities in ports of Member States. Moreover, the transfer of ownership of vessels owned, controlled or chartered by IRISL companies to other entities is also prohibited pursuant to the freezing of IRISL's assets. However, the obligation to freeze the funds and economic resources of IRISL and of entities owned or controlled by IRISL does not require the impounding or detention of vessels owned by such entities or the cargoes carried by them insofar as such cargoes belong to third parties, nor does it require the detention of the crew contracted by them.\n(14)\nIn consideration of Iran's attempts at circumventing the sanctions, it should be clarified that all funds and economic resources belonging to, owned, held or controlled by persons, entities or bodies listed in Annexes I or II to Decision 2010/413/CFSP are to be frozen without delay, including those of successor entities established to circumvent the measures set out in this Regulation.\n(15)\nIt should also be clarified that submitting and forwarding the necessary documents to a bank for the purpose of their final transfer to a person, entity or body that is not listed, to trigger payments allowed under this Regulation, does not constitute making funds available within the meaning of this Regulation.\n(16)\nIt should be clarified that funds or economic resources should be able to be released for the official purposes of diplomatic or consular missions or international organisations enjoying immunities in accordance with international law, in conformity with the provisions of this Regulation.\n(17)\nThe application of targeted financial measures by providers of specialised financial messaging services should be further developed, in conformity with the provisions of this Regulation.\nIt should be clarified that the assets of non-designated persons, entities or bodies held at designated credit and financial institutions should not remain frozen in application of the targeted financial measures and should be able to be released under the conditions provided for in this Regulation.\nIn consideration of Iran's attempts at using its financial system for the purpose of circumventing the sanctions, it is necessary to require enhanced vigilance in relation to the activities of Iran's credit and financial institutions so as to prevent circumvention of this Regulation, including the freezing of the assets of the Central Bank of Iran. These enhanced vigilance requirements for credit and financial institutions should be complementary to existing obligations deriving from Regulation (EC) 1781/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 November 2006 on information on the payer accompanying transfers of funds (5) and from the implementation of Directive 2005/60/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 October 2005 on the prevention of the use of the financial system for the purpose of money laundering and terrorist financing (6).\n(18)\nCertain provisions regarding the controls of funds transfers should be reviewed in order to facilitate their application by competent authorities and operators and to prevent circumvention of the provisions of this Regulation, including the freezing of the assets of the Central Bank of Iran.\n(19)\nFurthermore, the restrictions on insurance should be adjusted, in particular with a view to clarifying that the insurance of diplomatic and consular missions within the Union is permitted, and to allow for the provision of third party liability insurance or environmental liability insurance.\n(20)\nMoreover, the requirement to submit pre-arrival and pre-departure information should be updated, since this obligation has become generally applicable to all goods entering or leaving the customs territory of the Union following the full implementation as from 1 January 2012 of the customs security measures laid down in the relevant provisions concerning entry and exit summary declarations in Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 (7) and in Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93 (8).\n(21)\nAdjustments should also be made concerning the provision of bunkering and ship supply services, the liability of operators and the prohibition of the circumvention of the relevant restrictive measures.\n(22)\nThe mechanisms for exchange of information between Member States and the Commission should be reviewed so as to ensure the effective implementation and uniform interpretation of this Regulation.\n(23)\nIn consideration of its objectives, the ban on internal repression equipment should be provided for under Regulation (EU) No 359/2011 concerning restrictive measures directed against certain persons, entities and bodies in view of the situation in Iran (9), rather than under this Regulation.\n(24)\nFor the sake of clarity, Regulation (EU) No 961/2010 should be repealed and replaced by this Regulation.\n(25)\nThe restrictive measures provided for in this Regulation fall within the scope of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union and legislation at the level of the Union is therefore necessary in order to implement them, in particular with a view to ensuring their uniform application by economic operators in all Member States.\n(26)\nThis Regulation respects the fundamental rights and observes the principles recognised in particular by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union and in particular the right to an effective remedy and to a fair trial, the right to property and the right to protection of personal data. This Regulation should be applied in accordance with those rights and principles.\n(27)\nThis Regulation also respects the obligations of Member States under the Charter of the United Nations and the legally binding nature of Resolutions of the United Nations Security Council.\n(28)\nThe procedure for the designation of persons subject to freezing measures under this Regulation should include providing designated natural or legal persons, entities or bodies with the grounds for listing, so as to give them an opportunity to submit observations. Where observations are submitted, or substantial new evidence is presented, the Council should review its decision in the light of those observations and inform the person, entity or body concerned accordingly.\n(29)\nFor the implementation of this Regulation, and to create maximum legal certainty within the Union, the names and other relevant data concerning natural and legal persons, entities and bodies whose funds and economic resources must be frozen in accordance with the Regulation, should be made public. Any processing of personal data of natural persons under this Regulation should be in conformity with Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 December 2000 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data by the Community institutions and bodies and on the free movement of such data (10) and Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data (11).\n(30)\nIn order to ensure that the measures provided for in this Regulation are effective, it should enter into force on the day of its publication,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nCHAPTER I\nDEFINITIONS\nArticle 1\nFor the purposes of this Regulation the following definitions shall apply:\n(a)\n‧branch‧ of a financial or credit institution means a place of business which forms a legally dependent part of a financial or credit institution and which carries out directly all or some of the transactions inherent in the business of financial or credit institutions;\n(b)\n‧brokering services‧ means:\n(i)\nthe negotiation or arrangement of transactions for the purchase, sale or supply of goods and technology or of financial and technical services, including from a third country to any other third country, or\n(ii)\nthe selling or buying of goods and technology or of financial and technical services, including where they are located in third countries for their transfer to another third country;\n(c)\n‧claim‧ means any claim, whether asserted by legal proceedings or not, made before or after the date of entry into force of this Regulation, under or in connection with a contract or transaction, and includes in particular:\n(i)\na claim for performance of any obligation arising under or in connection with a contract or transaction;\n(ii)\na claim for extension or payment of a bond, financial guarantee or indemnity of whatever form;\n(iii)\na claim for compensation in respect of a contract or transaction;\n(iv)\na counterclaim;\n(v)\na claim for the recognition or enforcement, including by the procedure of exequatur, of a judgment, an arbitration award or an equivalent decision, wherever made or given;\n(d)\n‧contract or transaction‧ means any transaction of whatever form and whatever the applicable law, whether comprising one or more contracts or similar obligations made between the same or different parties;
