The importance of having accurate information on the exposure of economic sectors and of banking groups to specific classes of securities at a very disaggregated level became evident during the financial crisis, as risks to financial stability due to contagion mechanisms at the level of individual financial institutions, generated by specific classes of securities, could not be properly identified from aggregated data. Timely information on holdings of securities at the level of individual securities will also allow the ECB to monitor the transmission of risks from the financial markets to the real economy.\n(4)\nIn addition, this statistical information will support the ECB in analysing financial market developments, and in monitoring the changes in the securities portfolios of economic sectors and the links between financial intermediaries and non-financial investors.\n(5)\nGiven the interconnection between monetary policy and the stability of the financial system, the collection of statistical information on a security-by-security basis concerning securities holdings positions and financial transactions, and for the derivation of transactions from positions, is also necessary to satisfy regular and ad hoc analytical needs to support the ECB in carrying out monetary and financial analysis, and for the contribution by the ESCB to the stability of the financial system. This statistical information will allow information on securities held by institutional sectors to be combined with information on the individual issuers across the world, thus providing an important tool to monitor the buildup and evolution of financial imbalances.\n(6)\nIt is also necessary to enable the ECB to provide analytical and statistical support to the European Systemic Risk Board in accordance with Council Regulation (EU) No 1096/2010 of 17 November 2010 conferring specific tasks upon the European Central Bank concerning the functioning of the European Systemic Risk Board (8).\n(7)\nFor this reason, the Governing Council of the ECB should identify reporting banking groups for the purpose of the data collection under this Regulation taking into account the size of each group’s consolidated balance sheet in comparison to the consolidated balance sheet assets of all European Union banking groups, the significance of the group’s activities in a particular segment of the banking business and the relevance of the group for the stability and functioning of the financial system in the euro area and/or individual Member States.\n(8)\nThe standards for the protection and use of confidential statistical information as laid down in Article 8 of Council Regulation (EC) No 2533/98 should apply.\n(9)\nThe reporting requirements under this Regulation, including derogations therefrom, are without prejudice to the reporting requirements set out in other ECB legal acts and instruments, which may, at least partly, also cover security-by-security reporting of statistical information on holdings of securities.\n(10)\nIt is necessary to set up a procedure to carry out technical amendments to the annexes to this Regulation in an effective manner, provided they neither change the underlying conceptual framework nor affect the reporting burden on reporting agents in Member States. This procedure needs to allow the views of the ESCB Statistics Committee to be taken into account,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nArticle 1\nDefinitions\nFor the purposes of this Regulation:\n1.\n‘security-by-security’ data collection means the collection of data broken down into individual securities;\n2.\n‘position’ means the stock amount of securities, the types of which are listed in paragraph 15, owned or held in custody by an actual reporting agent at the end of a reference period, as further defined in Part 4 of Annex II;\n3.\n‘parent credit institution’, ‘parent financial holding company’, ‘subsidiary’ and ‘branch’ have the same meaning as defined in Article 4 of Directive 2006/48/EC;\n4.\n‘banking group’ means (a) a parent credit institution and all its financial subsidiaries and branches, other than insurance undertakings which have received official authorisation in accordance with Article 6 of Directive 73/239/EEC (9) or Article 4 of Directive 2002/83/EC (10); or (b) a parent financial holding company and all its financial subsidiaries and branches, other than insurance undertakings which have received official authorisation in accordance with Article 6 of Directive 73/239/EEC or Article 4 of Directive 2002/83/EC, provided that in both cases the parent is head of the banking group.

NCBs shall check the fulfilment of the conditions set out in paragraphs 1 to 7, as applicable, for the purposes of granting, renewing or withdrawing, if necessary, any derogation with effect from the start of each calendar year.\n10.   The relevant NCB shall withdraw any derogations granted to custodians under paragraph 5(a) if data from other statistical or supervisory data sources that fulfil the minimum statistical standards specified in Annex III have not been made available in time to it for three consecutive reporting periods, irrespective of whether there is fault on the part of custodians. Custodians shall start reporting data, as set out in Article 3(2), not later than three months from the date on which the relevant NCB notifies them that the derogation has been withdrawn.\n11.

The actual reporting agents may choose not to make use of derogations granted by the NCBs and to fulfil full reporting requirements instead. An actual reporting agent not using the derogations granted by a relevant NCB shall obtain that NCB’s consent prior to subsequently using them.\nArticle 5\nAccounting rules\n1.   Unless otherwise provided for in this Regulation, the accounting rules followed by the actual reporting agents for the purposes of reporting under this Regulation shall be those laid down in the national transposition of Council Directive 86/635/EEC of 8 December 1986 on the annual accounts and consolidated accounts of banks and other financial institutions (12) or, if this is inapplicable, in any other national or international standards that apply to the actual reporting agents.\n2.

Holdings of securities lent out under securities lending operations, or sold under a repurchase agreement, shall remain recorded as holdings by the original owner (and not as holdings of the temporary acquirer) where there is a firm commitment to reverse the operation (and not simply an option to do so). Where the temporary acquirer sells the securities received, this sale shall be recorded as an outright transaction in securities and reported by the temporary acquirer as a negative position in the securities portfolio.\nArticle 6\nTimeliness\n1.   NCBs shall decide when they need to receive data from actual reporting agents to be able to perform the necessary quality control procedures and to meet the deadlines in paragraph 2.\n2.   NCBs shall transmit to the ECB for the actual reporting agents:\n(a)\nquarterly security-by-security data in accordance with Article 3(1), (2) and (5) by close of business on the 70th calendar day following the end of the quarter to which the data relate; or\n(b)\nmonthly security-by-security data in accordance with Article 3(5) and Part 1 of Annex I, according to one of the options below:\n(i)\non a quarterly basis for the three months of the reference quarter, by close of business on the 63rd calendar day following the end of the quarter to which the data relate; or\n(ii)\non a monthly basis for each month of the reference quarter, by close of business on the 63rd calendar day following the end of the month to which the data relate; and\n(c)\nquarterly security-by-security positions in accordance with Article 3(3) by close of business:\n(i)\nfrom 2013 to 2015: on the 70th calendar day following the end of the quarter to which the data relate; and\n(ii)\nfrom 2016: on the 55th calendar day following the end of the quarter to which the data relate.\n3.   Where a deadline referred to in paragraph 2 falls on a TARGET2 closing day, the deadline shall be extended to the following TARGET2 operating day, as announced on the ECB’s website.\nArticle 7\nMinimum standards and national reporting arrangements\n1.   The actual reporting agents shall comply with the reporting requirements to which they are subject in accordance with the minimum standards specified in Annex III.\n2.   The NCBs shall define and implement the reporting arrangements to be followed by the actual reporting agents in accordance with national characteristics. The NCBs shall decide whether to require custodians to report security-by-security data on an investor-by-investor basis. The NCBs shall ensure that these reporting arrangements provide the required statistical information and allow checking of whether the minimum standards for transmission, accuracy and revisions specified in Annex III are met.\nArticle 8\nVerification and compulsory collection\nThe NCBs shall exercise the rights to verify, according to the level of detail deemed necessary by the relevant NCB, or to collect, the information which the actual reporting agents are required to provide pursuant to this Regulation, without prejudice to the ECB’s right to exercise these rights itself. These rights shall in particular be exercised by the NCBs when actual reporting agents do not fulfil the minimum standards specified in Annex III.\nArticle 9\nSimplified amendment procedure\nTaking account of the views of the ESCB Statistics Committee, the Executive Board of the ECB may make technical amendments to the annexes to this Regulation, provided they neither change the underlying conceptual framework nor affect the reporting burden on the actual reporting agents. The Executive Board shall inform the Governing Council of any such amendment without undue delay.\nArticle 10\nFirst reporting\nThe first reporting pursuant to this Regulation shall start with data relating to the reference period December 2013. The first time NCBs report to the ECB, they shall only be required to submit data on positions.\nArticle 11\nFinal provision\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on the 20th day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nDone at Frankfurt am Main, 17 October 2012.\nThe President of the ECB\nMario DRAGHI\n(1)  OJ L 310, 30.11.1996, p. 1.\n(2)  OJ L 318, 27.11.1998, p. 8.\n(3)  OJ L 211, 11.8.2007, p. 8.\n(4)  OJ L 15, 20.1.2009, p. 1.\n(5)  OJ L 15, 20.1.2009, p. 14.\n(6)  OJ L 145, 30.4.2004, p. 1.\n(7)  OJ L 177, 30.6.2006, p. 1.\n(8)  OJ L 331, 15.12.2010, p. 162.\n(9)  First Council Directive 73/239/EEC of 24 July 1973 on the coordination of laws, regulations and administrative provisions relating to the taking-up and pursuit of the business of direct insurance other than life assurance (OJ L 228, 16.8.1973, p. 3).\n(10)  Directive 2002/83/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 5 November 2002 concerning life assurance (OJ L 345, 19.12.2002, p. 1).\n(11)  The numbering of categories throughout this Regulation reflects the numbering introduced in Commission proposal COM(2010) 774 final (the proposal for the ESA 2010 Regulation).

Debt securities display the following characteristics:\n(a)\nan issue date on which the debt security is issued;\n(b)\nan issue price at which investors buy the debt securities when first issued;\n(c)\na redemption date or maturity date, on which the final contractually scheduled repayment of the principal is due;\n(d)\na redemption price or face value, which is the amount to be paid by the issuer to the holder at maturity;\n(e)\nan original maturity, which is the period from the issue date until the final contractually scheduled payment;\n(f)\na remaining or residual maturity, which is the period from the reference date until the final contractually scheduled payment;\n(g)\na coupon rate that the issuer pays to holders of the debt securities; the coupon may be fixed throughout the life of the debt security or vary with inflation, interest rates, or asset prices. Bills and zero-coupon debt securities offer no coupon interest;\n(h)\ncoupon dates, on which the issuer pays the coupon to the securities’ holders;\n(i)\nthe issue price, redemption price, and coupon rate may be denominated (or settled) in either national currency or foreign currencies.\nThe credit rating of debt securities, which indicates the credit worthiness of individual debt securities issues, is assigned by recognised agencies on the basis of rating categories.\nWith regard to point (c), the maturity date may coincide with the conversion of a debt security into a share. In this context, convertibility means that the holder may exchange a debt security for the issuer’s common equity. Exchangeability means that the holder may exchange the debt security for shares of a corporation other than the issuer. Perpetual securities, which have no stated maturity date, are classified as debt securities.\n1a.\nShort-term debt securities (F.31)\nDebt securities whose original maturity is one year or less, and debt securities repayable on demand of the creditor.\n1b.\nLong-term debt securities (F.32)\nDebt securities whose original maturity is more than one year, or of no stated maturity.\n2.\nEquity (F.51)\nEquity is a financial asset that is a claim on the residual value of a corporation, after all other claims have been met. Ownership of equity in legal entities is usually evidenced by shares, stocks, depository receipts, participations, or similar documents. Shares and stocks have the same meaning.\nEquity is sub-categorised into the following: listed shares (F.511); unlisted shares (F.152); and other equity (F.519).\n2a.\nListed shares (F.511)\nListed shares are equity securities listed on an exchange. Such an exchange may be a recognised stock exchange or any other form of secondary market. Listed shares are also referred to as quoted shares. The existence of quoted prices of shares listed on an exchange means that current market prices are usually readily available.\n3.\nInvestment fund shares or units (F.52)\nInvestment fund shares are shares of an investment fund if the fund has a corporate structure. They are known as units if the fund is a trust. Investment funds are collective investment undertakings through which investors pool funds for investment in financial and/or non-financial assets.\nInvestment fund shares are subdivided into: money market fund (MMF) shares or units (F.521); and other investment fund shares or units other than MMF shares or units (F.529).\nPART 2\nDefinitions of sectors\nThis table provides a description of sector categories, which NCBs transpose into categories applicable at national level in accordance with this Regulation.\nSector\nDefinition\n1.\nNon-financial corporations (S.11)\nThe sector non-financial corporations (S.11) consists of institutional units which are independent legal entities and market producers, and whose principal activity is the production of goods and non-financial services. This sector also includes non-financial quasi-corporations.\n2.\nThe central bank (S.121)\nThe sub-sector the central bank (S.121) consists of all financial corporations and quasi-corporations whose principal function is to issue currency, to maintain the internal and external value of the currency and to hold all or part of the international reserves of the country.\n3.\nDeposit-taking corporations except the central bank (S.122)\nThe sub-sector deposit-taking corporations except the central bank (S.122) includes all financial corporations and quasi-corporations, except those classified in the central bank and in the MMF sub-sectors, which are principally engaged in financial intermediation and whose business is to receive deposits from institutional units and, for their own account, to grant loans and/or to make investments in securities.\n4.\nMoney market funds (MMFs) (S.123)\nThe sub-sector MMFs (S.123) as collective investment schemes consists of all financial corporations and quasi-corporations, except those classified in the central bank and in the credit institutions sub-sectors, which are principally engaged in financial intermediation. Their business is to receive investment fund shares or units as close substitutes for deposits from institutional units and, for their own account, to make investments primarily in MMF shares/units, short-term debt securities, and/or deposits.\n5.\nNon-MMF investment funds (S.124)\nThe sub-sector non-MMF investment funds (S.124) consists of all collective investment schemes, except those classified in the MMF sub-sector, which are principally engaged in financial intermediation. Their business is to receive, from institutional units, investment fund shares or units which are not close substitutes for deposits and, on their own account, to make investments primarily in financial assets other than short-term financial assets and in non-financial assets (usually real estate). Non-MMF investment funds cover investment trusts, unit trusts and other collective investment schemes whose investment fund shares or units are not seen as close substitutes for deposits.\n6.\nOther financial intermediaries, except insurance corporations and pension funds (S.125)\nThe sub-sector other financial intermediaries, except insurance corporations and pension funds (S.125) consists of all financial corporations and quasi-corporations which are principally engaged in financial intermediation by incurring liabilities in forms other than currency, deposits, or investment fund shares, or in relation to insurance, pension and standardised guarantee schemes from institutional units.\n7.\nFinancial vehicle corporations engaged in securitisation transactions (‘FVCs’)\nFVCs are undertakings carrying out securitisation transactions. FVCs that satisfy the criteria of an institutional unit are classified in S.125, otherwise they are treated as an integral part of the parent.\n8.\nFinancial auxiliaries (S.126)\nThe sub-sector financial auxiliaries (S.126) consists of all financial corporations and quasi-corporations which are principally engaged in activities closely related to financial intermediation but which are not financial intermediaries themselves.\n9.\nCaptive financial institutions and money lenders (S.127)\nThe sub-sector captive financial institutions and money lenders (S.127) consists of all financial corporations and quasi-corporations which are neither engaged in financial intermediation nor in providing financial auxiliary services, and where most of either their assets or their liabilities are not transacted on open markets.\n10.\nInsurance corporations (S.128)\nThe sub-sector insurance corporations (S.128) consists of all financial corporations and quasi-corporations which are principally engaged in financial intermediation as the consequence of the pooling of risks mainly in the form of direct insurance or reinsurance.\n11.\nPension funds (S.129)\nThe sub-sector pension funds (S.129) consists of all financial corporations and quasi-corporations which are principally engaged in financial intermediation as the consequence of the pooling of social risks and needs of the insured persons (social insurance). Pension funds as social insurance schemes provide income in retirement, and often benefits for death and disability.\n12.\nGeneral government (S.13)\nThe sector general government (S.13) consists of institutional units which are non-market producers whose output is intended for individual and collective consumption, and are financed by compulsory payments made by units belonging to other sectors, and institutional units principally engaged in the redistribution of national income and wealth.\nThe general government sector is divided into four sub-sectors: central government (S.1311); state government (S.1312); local government (S.1313); and social security funds (S.1314).\n13.\nHouseholds (S.14)\nThe sector households (S.14) consists of individuals or groups of individuals as consumers and as entrepreneurs producing market goods and non-financial and financial services (market producers) provided that the production of goods and services is not by separate entities treated as quasi-corporations. It also includes individuals or groups of individuals as producers of goods and non-financial services for exclusively own final use.\n14.\nNon-profit institutions serving households (S.15)\nThe sector non-profit institutions serving households (S.15) consists of non-profit institutions which are separate legal entities, which serve households and are private non-market producers. Their principal resources are voluntary contributions in cash or in kind from households in their capacity as consumers, from payments made by general governments and from property income.\nPART 3\nDefinition of financial transactions\n1.\nThe actual reporting agents report transactions data as set out in Article 3(5).\n2.\nFinancial transactions are defined as transactions in financial assets and liabilities between resident institutional units, and between them and non-resident institutional units. A financial transaction between institutional units is a simultaneous creation or liquidation of a financial asset and the counterpart liability, or a change in ownership of a financial asset, or an assumption of a liability. Accrued interest not yet paid is recorded as a financial transaction, showing that interest is reinvested in the relevant financial instrument.\nFinancial transactions are recorded at transaction values, that is, the values in national currency at which the financial assets and/or liabilities involved are created, liquidated, exchanged or assumed between institutional units.\nThe transaction value includes accrued interest and does not include service charges, fees, commissions, and similar payments for services provided in carrying out the transactions, nor taxes on the transactions. Valuation changes are not financial transactions.\n3.\nFinancial transactions are measured as the difference between securities positions (including accrued interest) at end-period reporting dates, from which the effect of changes due to influences from ‘revaluation adjustments’ (caused by price and exchange rates changes) and ‘other changes in volume’ is removed.\n4.\nPrice and exchange rate revaluations refer to fluctuations in the valuation of the securities that arise either from changes in the price of securities and/or in exchange rates that affect the values expressed in euro of securities denominated in a foreign currency. As these changes represent holdings gains or losses which are not due to financial transactions, these effects need to be removed from the transactions data.\n—\nPrice revaluations include changes that occur in the reference period in the value of end-period positions because of changes in the reference value at which they are recorded, i.e. holding gains or losses.\n—\nExchange rate revaluations refer to movements in exchange rates against the euro that occur between end-period reporting dates, which give rise to changes in the value of foreign currency securities expressed in euro.\n5.\nOther changes in volume refer to changes in the volume of assets which may arise on the investor side, due to (a) the alteration in the statistical coverage of the population (e.g. the reclassification and restructuring of institutional units (1)); (b) the reclassification of assets; (c) reporting errors that have been corrected in data reported only over a limited time range; (d) the writing-off or writing-down of bad debts, when these are in the form of securities, by creditors, and the unilateral cancellation of liabilities by debtors (known as debt repudiation); or (e) changes of residence of the investor.\nPART 4\nDefinitions of security-by-security attributes\nField\nDescription\nSecurity identification number\nA code that uniquely identifies a security. It is the ISIN code if this has been assigned to the security, or another security identification number.\nPositions at nominal value (in nominal currency or euro or positions in number of shares or units)\nNumber of units of a security, or aggregated nominal amount if the security is traded in amounts rather than in units, excluding the accrued interest.\nPositions at market value\nAmount held of a security at the price quoted in the market in euro. NCBs must in principle require accrued interest to be reported either under this position or separately.
