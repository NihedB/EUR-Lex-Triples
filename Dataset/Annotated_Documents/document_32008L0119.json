In the interests of clarity and rationality the said Directive should be codified.\n(2)\nMost Member States have ratified the European Convention for the protection of animals kept for farming purposes. The Community has also approved this Convention, by Council Decision 78/923/EEC (5).\n(3)\nCalves, being live animals, are included in the list of products set out in Annex I to the Treaty.\n(4)\nThe keeping of calves is an integral part of agriculture. It constitutes a source of revenue for part of the agricultural population.\n(5)\nDifferences which may distort conditions of competition interfere with the smooth running of the organisation of the common market in calves and calf products.\n(6)\nThere is therefore a need to establish common minimum standards for the protection of rearing calves or calves for fattening in order to ensure rational development of production.\n(7)\nIt is recognised scientifically that calves should benefit from an environment corresponding to their needs as a herd-living species. For that reason, they should be reared in groups. Calves, both group-housed and individually penned, should have sufficient space for exercise, for contact with other cattle and for normal movements when standing up or lying down.\n(8)\nIt is necessary for official services, producers, consumers and others to be kept informed of developments in this field. The Commission should therefore, on the basis of an opinion from the European Food Safety Authority, pursue actively scientific research into the most efficient stock-farming system(s) from the point of view of the well-being of calves. Provision should accordingly be made for an interim period to enable the Commission to complete this task successfully.\n(9)\nThe measures necessary for the implementation of this Directive should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission (6).\n(10)\nThis Directive should be without prejudice to the obligations of the Member States relating to the time limits for transposition into national law of the Directives set out in Annex II, Part B,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:\nArticle 1\nThis Directive lays down the minimum standards for the protection of calves confined for rearing and fattening.\nArticle 2\nFor the purposes of this Directive, the following definitions shall apply:\n1.\n‘calf’ means a bovine animal up to six months old;\n2.\n‘competent authority’ means the competent authority as defined in Article 2(6) of Council Directive 90/425/EEC of 26 June 1990 concerning veterinary and zootechnical checks applicable in intra-Community trade in certain live animals and products with a view to the completion of the internal market (7).\nArticle 3\n1.   From 1 January 1998, the following provisions shall apply on all newly built or rebuilt holdings and on all those brought into use after that date:\n(a)\nno calf shall be confined in an individual pen after the age of eight weeks, unless a veterinarian certifies that its health or behaviour requires it to be isolated in order to receive treatment. The width of any individual pen for a calf shall be at least equal to the height of the calf at the withers, measured in the standing position, and the length shall be at least equal to the body length of the calf, measured from the tip of the nose to the caudal edge of the tuber ischii (pin bone), multiplied by 1,1.\nIndividual pens for calves (except those for isolating sick animals) must not have solid walls, but perforated walls which allow the calves to have direct visual and tactile contact;\n(b)\nfor calves kept in groups, the unobstructed space allowance available to each calf shall be at least equal to 1,5 m2 for each calf of a live weight of less than 150 kilograms, at least equal to 1,7 m2 for each calf of a live weight of 150 kilograms or more but less than 220 kilograms, and at least equal to 1,8 m2 for each calf of a live weight of 220 kilograms or more.\nHowever, the provisions of the first subparagraph shall not apply to:\n(a)\nholdings with fewer than six calves;\n(b)\ncalves kept with their mothers for suckling.\n2.   From 31 December 2006, the provisions provided for in paragraph 1 shall apply to all holdings.\nArticle 4\nMember States shall ensure that the conditions for rearing calves comply with the general provisions laid down in Annex I.\nArticle 5\nThe general provisions in Annex I may be amended in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 10(2) in order to take account of scientific progress.\nArticle 6\nBy 1 January 2006, the Commission shall submit to the Council a report, drawn up on the basis of an opinion from the European Food Safety Authority, on the intensive farming system(s) which comply with the requirements of the well-being of calves from the pathological, zootechnical, physiological and behavioural point of view, as well as the socioeconomic implications of different systems, together with proposals relevant to the report’s conclusions.\nArticle 7\n1.   Member States shall ensure that inspections are carried out under the responsibility of the competent authority in order to check that the provisions of this Directive are complied with.\nThese inspections, which may be carried out on the occasion of checks made for other purposes, shall each year cover a statistically representative sample of the different farming systems used in each Member State.\n2.   The Commission shall, in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 10(2), draw up a code of rules to be applied in carrying out the inspections provided for in paragraph 1 of this Article.\n3.   Every two years, by the last working day in April and for the first time by 30 April 1996, Member States shall inform the Commission of the results of the inspections carried out during the previous two years in accordance with this Article, including the number of inspections carried out in relation to the number of holdings in their territory.\nArticle 8\nIn order to be imported into the Community, animals coming from a third country must be accompanied by a certificate issued by the competent authority of that country, certifying that they have received treatment at least equivalent to that granted to animals of Community origin as provided for by this Directive.\nArticle 9\nVeterinary experts from the Commission may, where necessary for the uniform application of this Directive, carry out on-the-spot checks in cooperation with the competent authorities. The persons carrying out these checks shall implement the special personal hygiene measures necessary to exclude any risk of transmission of disease.\nThe Member State in the territory of which a check is being carried out shall give all necessary assistance to the experts in carrying out their duties. The Commission shall inform the competent authority of the Member State concerned of the results of the checks.\nThe competent authority of the Member State concerned shall take any measures which may prove necessary to take account of the results of the checks.\nWith regard to relations with third countries, the provisions of Chapter III of Council Directive 91/496/EEC of 15 July 1991 laying down the principles governing the organization of veterinary checks on animals entering the Community from third countries (8) shall apply.\nGeneral rules for the application of this Article shall be adopted in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 10(2) of this Directive.\nArticle 10\n1.   The Commission shall be assisted by the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health set up pursuant to Article 58 of Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 28 January 2002 laying down the general principles and requirements of food law, establishing the European Food Safety Authority and laying down procedures in matters of food safety (9).\n2.   Where reference is made to this paragraph, Articles 5 and 7 of Decision 1999/468/EC shall apply.\nThe period laid down in Article 5(6) of Decision 1999/468/EC shall be set at three months.\nArticle 11\nMember States may, in compliance with the general rules of the Treaty, maintain or apply within their territories stricter provisions for the protection of calves than those laid down in this Directive. They shall inform the Commission of any such measures.\nArticle 12\nDirective 91/629/EEC, as amended by the Acts listed in Annex II, Part A, is repealed, without prejudice to the obligations of the Member States relating to the time limits for transposition into national law of the Directives set out in Annex II, Part B.\nReferences to the repealed Directive shall be construed as references to this Directive and shall be read in accordance with the correlation table in Annex III.\nArticle 13\nThis Directive shall enter into force on the 20th day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nArticle 14\nThis Directive is addressed to the Member States.\nDone at Brussels, 18 December 2008.\nFor the Council\nThe President\nM.

Where defects are discovered, they must be rectified immediately or, if this is impossible, appropriate steps must be taken to safeguard the health and well-being of the calves until the defect has been rectified, notably by using alternative methods of feeding and maintaining a satisfactory environment.\nWhere an artificial ventilation system is used, provision must be made for an appropriate back-up system to guarantee sufficient air renewal to preserve the health and well-being of the calves in the event of failure of the system, and an alarm system must be provided to warn the stock-keeper of the breakdown. The alarm system must be tested regularly.\n5.\nCalves must not be kept permanently in darkness. To meet their behavioural and physiological needs, provision must be made, allowing for the different climatic conditions in the Member States, for appropriate natural or artificial lighting; if the latter, it must function for a period at least equivalent to the period of natural light normally available between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. In addition, suitable lighting (fixed or portable) strong enough to allow the calves to be inspected at any time must be available.\n6.\nAll housed calves must be inspected by the owner or the person responsible for the animals at least twice daily and calves kept outside must be inspected at least once daily. Any calf which appears to be ill or injured must be treated appropriately without delay and veterinary advice must be obtained as soon as possible for any calf which is not responding to the stock-keeper’s care. Where necessary, sick or injured calves must be isolated in adequate accommodation with dry, comfortable bedding.\n7.\nThe accommodation for calves must be constructed in such a way as to allow each calf to lie down, rest, stand up and groom itself without difficulty.\n8.\nCalves must not be tethered, with the exception of group-housed calves which may be tethered for periods of not more than one hour at the time of feeding milk or milk substitute. Where tethers are used, they must not cause injury to the calves and must be inspected regularly and adjusted as necessary to ensure a comfortable fit. Each tether must be designed to avoid the risk of strangulation or injury and to allow the calf to move in accordance with point 7.\n9.\nHousing, pens, equipment and utensils used for calves must be properly cleaned and disinfected to prevent cross-infection and the build-up of disease-carrying organisms. Faeces, urine and uneaten or spilt food must be removed as often as necessary to minimise smell and avoid attracting flies or rodents.\n10.\nFloors must be smooth but not slippery, so as to prevent injury to the calves, and so designed as not to cause injury or suffering to calves standing or lying on them. They must be suitable for the size and weight of the calves and form a rigid, even and stable surface. The lying area must be comfortable, clean, and adequately drained and must not adversely affect the calves. Appropriate bedding must be provided for all calves less than two weeks old.\n11.\nAll calves must be provided with an appropriate diet adapted to their age, weight and behavioural and physiological needs, to promote good health and welfare. To this end, their food must contain sufficient iron to ensure an average blood haemoglobin level of at least 4,5 mmol/litre, and a minimum daily ration of fibrous food must be provided for each calf over two weeks old, the quantity being raised from 50 g to 250 g per day for calves from eight to 20 weeks old. Calves shall not be muzzled.\n12.\nAll calves must be fed at least twice a day. Where calves are housed in groups and not fed ad libitum or by an automatic feeding system, each calf must have access to the food at the same time as the others in the group.\n13.\nAll calves over two weeks of age must have access to a sufficient quantity of fresh water or be able to satisfy their fluid intake needs by drinking other liquids. However, in hot weather conditions or for calves which are ill, fresh drinking water must be available at all times.\n14.\nFeeding and watering equipment must be designed, constructed, placed and maintained so that contamination of the calves’ feed and water is minimised.\n15.\nEach calf must receive bovine colostrum as soon as possible after it is born and in any case within the first six hours of life.\nANNEX II\nPART A\nRepealed Directive with its successive amendments\n(referred to in Article 12)\nCouncil Directive 91/629/EEC\n(OJ L 340, 11.12.1991, p. 28)\nCouncil Directive 97/2/EC\n(OJ L 25, 28.1.1997, p. 24)\nCommission Decision 97/182/EC\n(OJ L 76, 18.3.1997, p. 30)\nCouncil Regulation (EC) No 806/2003\n(OJ L 122, 16.5.2003, p. 1)\nonly Annex III, point 25\nPART B\nList of time limits for transposition into national law\n(referred to in Article 12)\nDirectives\nTime limit for transposition\n91/629/EEC\n1 January 1994\n97/2/EC\n31 December 1997\nANNEX III\nCORRELATION TABLE\nDirective 91/629/EEC\nThis Directive\nArticles 1 and 2\nArticles 1 and 2\nArticle 3(1)\n—\nArticle 3(2)\n—\nArticle 3(3), first subparagraph\nArticle 3(1), first subparagraph\nArticle 3(3), second subparagraph, introductory words\nArticle 3(1), second subparagraph, introductory words\nArticle 3(3), second subparagraph, first indent\nArticle 3(1), second subparagraph, point (a)\nArticle 3(3), second subparagraph, second indent\nArticle 3(1), second subparagraph, point (b)\nArticle 3(3), third subparagraph\nArticle 3(2)\nArticle 3(4)\n—\nArticle 4(1)\nArticle 4\nArticles 5 to 10\nArticles 5 to 10\nArticle 11(1)\n—\nArticle 11(2)\nArticle 11\n—\nArticle 12\n—\nArticle 13\nArticle 12\nArticle 14\nAnnex\nAnnex I\n—\nAnnex II\n—\nAnnex III", "summary": "Protection of calves intended for slaughter\nProtection of calves intended for slaughter\nSUMMARY OF:\nDirective 2008/119/EC — minimum standards for the protection of calves\nWHAT IS THE AIM OF THE DIRECTIVE?\n              \nIt lays down minimum standards for the protection of confined calves intended for human consumption.\nKEY POINTS\nThis directive lays down minimum standards for the protection of calves (i.e. bovine animals of up to 6 months old) placed in units in which they are raised for slaughter. These standards, which have been compulsory since 1 January 2007, do not apply to calves kept with the cow for suckling, or to holdings with fewer than 6 calves.\nThe directive does not cover the transport of calves, which is governed by Regulation (EC) No 1/2005.\nGroup or individual pens\nPens must be constructed in such a way as to allow each calf to lie down, rest, stand up and groom itself without difficulty.\nFrom the age of 8 weeks, individual pens are prohibited except in the case of illness. This measure is justified by the gregarious nature of bovine animals.\nBefore the age of 8 weeks, individual pens are permitted. They are to be composed of perforated walls which allow the calves to have visual and tactile contact. Solid walls may be used only to isolate sick animals from the rest of the herd.\nGroup pens must comply with the following standards relating to space (see table below).\nWeight of animal in kg\nArea in m2\n‹ 150\n1.5\n‹ 220\n1.7\n› 220\n1.8\nCalves must not be tethered (except possibly during the feeding of milk for a period of not more than one hour) or muzzled.\nHousing, pens, equipment and utensils must be cleaned and disinfected.\nFloors must be smooth but not slippery, so as to prevent injury to the calves. The lying area must be comfortable, clean and adequately drained. Bedding is compulsory for calves less than 2 weeks old.\nHealth\nEach calf must receive bovine colostrum as soon as possible after it is born (within the first 6 hours of life).\nAny calf which is ill or injured must be treated without delay. Veterinary advice must be obtained as soon as possible for any calf which is not responding to the stock-keeper’s care.\nDiet\nCalves are to be fed at least twice a day. Each calf must have access to food at the same time as the others in the group.\nTheir food must contain sufficient iron to ensure an average blood haemoglobin level of at least 4.5 mmol/litre, and a minimum daily ration of fibrous food must be provided for each calf over 2 weeks old.\nDiet must be adapted to the age and weight of the animal. It must also be adapted to its behaviour and physiological needs.\nCalves over 2 weeks of age should have access to fresh water.\nMonitoring of animals\nHoused calves must be inspected at least twice daily and mechanical equipment at least once daily. Where an artificial ventilation system is used, an alarm system (tested regularly) and a ventilation back-up system must be installed.\nLight levels\nCalves should be kept in conditions with natural or artificial lighting (equivalent to the period of natural light between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m.).\nInspections\nEU countries must carry out inspections every year on a statistically representative sample.\nThe European Commission may send veterinary experts to carry out on-the-spot checks with the assistance of the national inspectors.\nImports\nTo import animals from non-EU countries, a certificate is required stating that they have received treatment equivalent to that granted to animals of EU origin.\nSpecific rules\nEU countries may, within their territories, apply stricter rules than those laid down in this directive. In this case, they must inform the Commission in advance of these measures.\nOfficial controls regulation\nRegulation (EU) 2017/625, the EU’s new legislation on the official controls of human food and animal feed, amends certain minor technical details of the directive. These changes will apply from 14 December 2019.\nFROM WHEN DOES THE DIRECTIVE APPLY?\n              \nIt has applied since 4 February 2009. The directive codifies and repeals previous legislation (Directive 91/629/EEC) which had to be incorporated into national law by 1 January 1994.\nBACKGROUND\n              \nFor more information, see:\nCalves (European Commission).\nMAIN DOCUMENT\n            \nCouncil Directive 2008/119/EC of 18 December 2008 laying down minimum standards for the protection of calves (Codified version) (OJ L 10, 15.1.2009, pp. 7–13)\nRELATED DOCUMENTS\n            \nRegulation (EU) 2017/625 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 March 2017 on official controls and other official activities performed to ensure the application of food and feed law, rules on animal health and welfare, plant health and plant protection products, amending Regulations (EC) No 999/2001, (EC) No 396/2005, (EC) No 1069/2009, (EC) No 1107/2009, (EU) No 1151/2012, (EU) No 652/2014, (EU) 2016/429 and (EU) 2016/2031 of the European Parliament and of the Council, Council Regulations (EC) No 1/2005 and (EC) No 1099/2009 and Council Directives 98/58/EC, 1999/74/EC, 2007/43/EC, 2008/119/EC and 2008/120/EC, and repealing Regulations (EC) No 854/2004 and (EC) No 882/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council, Council Directives 89/608/EEC, 89/662/EEC, 90/425/EEC, 91/496/EEC, 96/23/EC, 96/93/EC and 97/78/EC and Council Decision 92/438/EEC (Official Controls Regulation) (OJ L 95, 7.4.2017, pp. 1–142)\nSee consolidated version.\nCouncil Regulation (EC) No 1/2005 of 22 December 2004 on the protection of animals during transport and related operations and amending Directives 64/432/EEC and 93/119/EC and Regulation (EC) No 1255/97 (OJ L 3, 5.1.2005, pp. 1–44)\nlast update 27.09.2017", "tags": ["veterinary legislation", "calf", "animal welfare", "intensive livestock farming", "agricultural holding"], "subjects": ["Veterinary legislation"], "split": "train", "reference_annotations": {}, "summary_annotations": {"32008L0119_p2": {"text": "Council regulation 1/2005 of 22 December 2004 on the protection of animals during transport and related operations and amending directive 64/432/eec directive 93/119/ec and regulation 1255/97 (OJ L 3, 5.1.2005, pp. 1–44)---last update 27.09.2017", "triples": [" regulation 1/2005,  amending,  directive 64/432/eec", " regulation 1/2005,  amending,  directive 93/119/ec", " regulation 1/2005,  amending,  regulation 1255/97"]}, "32008L0119_p1": {"text": "regulation 2017/625 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 March 2017 on official controls and other official activities performed to ensure the application of food and feed law, rules on animal health and welfare, plant health and plant protection products, amending regulation 999/2001 regulation 396/2005 regulation 1069/2009 regulation 1107/2009 regulation 1151/2012 regulation 652/2014 regulation 2016/429 regulation 2016/2031 of the European Parliament and of the Council, Council regulation 1/2005 regulation 1099/2009 and Council directive 98/58/ec directive 1999/74/ec directive 2007/43/ec directive 2008/119/ec directive 2008/120/ec, and repealing regulation 854/2004 regulation 882/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council, Council directive 89/608/eec directive 89/662/eec directive 90/425/eec directive 91/496/eec directive 96/23/ec directive 96/93/ec directive 97/78/ec and Council decision 92/438/eec (Official Controls Regulation) (OJ L 95, 7.4.2017, pp. 1–142)", "triples": [" regulation 2017/625,  amending,  regulation 999/2001", " regulation 2017/625,  amending,  regulation 396/2005"]}}}
