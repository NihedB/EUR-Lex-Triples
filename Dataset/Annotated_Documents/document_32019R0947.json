{"celex_id": "32019R0947", "reference": "11.6.2019\nEN\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\nL 152/45\nCOMMISSION IMPLEMENTING REGULATION (EU) 2019/947\nof 24 May 2019\non the rules and procedures for the operation of unmanned aircraft\n(Text with EEA relevance)\nTHE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,\nHaving regard to Regulation (EU) 2018/1139 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 4 July 2018 on common rules in the field of civil aviation and establishing a European Union Aviation Safety Agency, and amending Regulations (EC) No 2111/2005, (EC) No 1008/2008, (EU) No 996/2010, (EU) No 376/2014 and Directives 2014/30/EU and 2014/53/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council, and repealing Regulations (EC) No 216/2008 and (EC) No 552/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council and Council Regulation (EEC) No 3922/91 (1), and in particular Article 57 thereof,\nWhereas:\n(1)\nUnmanned aircraft, irrespective of their mass, can operate within the same Single European Sky airspace, alongside manned aircraft, whether airplanes or helicopters.\n(2)\nAs for manned aviation, a uniform implementation of and compliance with rules and procedures should apply to operators, including remote pilots, of unmanned aircraft and unmanned aircraft system (‘UAS’), as well as for the operations of such unmanned aircraft and unmanned aircraft system.\n(3)\nConsidering the specific characteristics of UAS operations, they should be as safe as those in manned aviation.\n(4)\nTechnologies for unmanned aircraft allow a wide range of possible operations. Requirements related to the airworthiness, the organisations, the persons involved in the operation of UAS and unmanned aircraft operations should be set out in order to ensure safety for people on the ground and other airspace users during the operations of unmanned aircraft.\n(5)\nThe rules and procedures applicable to UAS operations should be proportionate to the nature and risk of the operation or activity and adapted to the operational characteristics of the unmanned aircraft concerned and the characteristics of the area of operations, such as the population density, surface characteristics, and the presence of buildings.\n(6)\nThe risk level criteria as well as other criteria should be used to establish three categories of operations: the ‘open’, ‘specific’ and ‘certified’ categories.\n(7)\nProportionate risks mitigation requirements should be applicable to UAS operations according to the level of risk involved, the operational characteristics of the unmanned aircraft concerned and the characteristics of the area of operation.\n(8)\nOperations in the ‘open’ category, which should cover operations that present the lowest risks, should not require UAS that are subject to standard aeronautical compliance procedures, but should be conducted using the UAS classes that are defined in Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2019/945 (2).\n(9)\nOperations in the ‘specific’ category should cover other types of operations presenting a higher risk and for which a thorough risk assessment should be conducted to indicate which requirements are necessary to keep the operation safe.\n(10)\nA system of declaration by an operator should facilitate the enforcement of this Regulation in case of low risk operations conducted in the ‘specific’ category for which a standard scenario has been defined with detailed mitigation measures.\n(11)\nOperations in the ‘certified’ category should, as a principle, be subject to rules on certification of the operator, and the licensing of remote pilots, in addition to the certification of the aircraft pursuant to Delegated Regulation (EU) 2019/945.\n(12)\nWhilst mandatory for the ‘certified category’, for the ‘specific’ category a certificate delivered by the competent authorities for the operation of an unmanned aircraft, as well as for the personnel, including remote pilots and organisations involved in those activities, or for the aircraft pursuant to Delegated Regulation (EU) 2019/945 could also be required.\n(13)\nRules and procedures should be established for the marking and identification of unmanned aircraft and for the registration of operators of unmanned aircraft or certified unmanned aircraft.\n(14)\nOperators of unmanned aircraft should be registered where they operate an unmanned aircraft which, in case of impact, can transfer, to a human, a kinetic energy above 80 Joules or the operation of which presents risks to privacy, protection of personal data, security or the environment.\n(15)\nStudies have demonstrated that unmanned aircraft with a take-off mass of 250 g or more would present risks to security and therefore UAS operators of such unmanned aircraft should be required to register themselves when operating such aircraft in the ‘open’ category.\n(16)\nConsidering the risks to privacy and protection of personal data, operators of unmanned aircraft should be registered if they operate an unmanned aircraft which is equipped with a sensor able to capture personal data. However, this should not be the case when the unmanned aircraft is considered to be a toy within the meaning of Directive 2009/48/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on the safety of toys (3).\n(17)\nThe information about registration of certified unmanned aircraft and of operators of unmanned aircraft that are subject to a registration requirement should be stored in digital, harmonised, interoperable national registration systems, allowing competent authorities to access and exchange that information. The mechanisms to ensure the interoperability of the national registers in this Regulation should be without prejudice to the rules applicable to the future repository referred to in Article 74 of Regulation (EU) 2018/1139.\n(18)\nIn accordance with paragraph 8 of Article 56 of Regulation (EU) 2018/1139, this Regulation is without prejudice to the possibility for Member States to lay down national rules to make subject to certain conditions the operations of unmanned aircraft for reasons falling outside the scope of Regulation (EU) 2018/1139, including public security or protection of privacy and personal data in accordance with the Union law.\n(19)\nNational registration systems should comply with the applicable Union and national law on privacy and processing of personal data and the information stored in those registrations systems should be easily accessible (4).\n(20)\nUAS operators and remote pilots should ensure that they are adequately informed about applicable Union and national rules relating to the intended operations, in particular with regard to safety, privacy, data protection, liability, insurance, security and environmental protection.\n(21)\nSome areas, such as hospitals, gatherings of people, installations and facilities like penal institutions or industrial plants, top-level and higher-level government authorities, nature conservation areas or certain items of transport infrastructure, can be particularly sensitive to some or all types of UAS operations. This should be without prejudice to the possibility for Member States to lay down national rules to make subject to certain conditions the operations of unmanned aircraft for reasons falling outside the scope of this Regulation, including environmental protection, public security or protection of privacy and personal data in accordance with the Union law.\n(22)\nUnmanned aircraft noise and emissions should be minimised as far as possible taking into account the operating conditions and various specific characteristics of individual Member States, such as the population density, where noise and emissions are of concern. In order to facilitate the societal acceptance of UAS operations, Delegated Regulation (EU) 2019/945 includes maximum level of noise for unmanned aircraft operated close to people in the ‘open’ category. In the ‘specific’ category there is a requirement for the operator to develop guidelines for its remote pilots so that all operations are flown in a manner that minimises nuisances to people and animals.\n(23)\nCurrent national certificates should be adapted to certificates complying with the requirements of this Regulation.\n(24)\nIn order to ensure the proper implementation of this Regulation, appropriate transitional measures should be established. In particular, Member States and stakeholders should have sufficient time to adapt their procedures to the new regulatory framework before this Regulation applies.\n(25)\nThe new regulatory framework for UAS operations should be without prejudice to the applicable environmental and nature protection obligations otherwise stemming from national or Union law.\n(26)\nWhile the ‘U-space’ system including the infrastructure, services and procedures to guarantee safe UAS operations and supporting their integration into the aviation system is in development, this Regulation should already include requirements for the implementation of three foundations of the U-space system, namely registration, geo-awareness and remote identification, which will need to be further completed.\n(27)\nSince model aircraft are considered as UAS and given the good safety level demonstrated by model aircraft operations in clubs and associations, there should be a seamless transition from the different national systems to the new Union regulatory framework, so that model aircraft clubs and associations can continue to operate as they do today, as well as taking into account existing best practices in the Member States.\n(28)\nIn addition, considering the good level of safety achieved by aircraft of class C4 as provided in Annex to this Regulation, low risk operations of such aircraft should be allowed to be conducted in the ‘open’ category. Such aircraft, often used by model aircraft operators, are comparatively simpler than other classes of unmanned aircraft and should therefore not be subject to disproportionate technical requirements.\n(29)\nThe measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the committee established in accordance with Article 127 of Regulation (EU) 2018/1139,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nArticle 1\nSubject matter\nThis Regulation lays down detailed provisions for the operation of unmanned aircraft systems as well as for personnel, including remote pilots and organisations involved in those operations.\nArticle 2\nDefinitions\nFor the purposes of this Regulation, the definitions in Regulation (EU) 2018/1139 apply.\nThe following definitions also apply:\n(1)\n‘unmanned aircraft system’ (‘UAS’) means an unmanned aircraft and the equipment to control it remotely;\n(2)\n‘unmanned aircraft system operator’ (‘UAS operator’) means any legal or natural person operating or intending to operate one or more UAS;\n(3)\n‘assemblies of people’ means gatherings where persons are unable to move away due to the density of the people present;\n(4)\n‘UAS geographical zone’ means a portion of airspace established by the competent authority that facilitates, restricts or excludes UAS operations in order to address risks pertaining to safety, privacy, protection of personal data, security or the environment, arising from UAS operations;\n(5)\n‘robustness’ means the property of mitigation measures resulting from combining the safety gain provided by the mitigation measures and the level of assurance and integrity that the safety gain has been achieved;\n(6)\n‘standard scenario’ means a type of UAS operation in the ‘specific’ category, as defined in Appendix 1 of the Annex, for which a precise list of mitigating measures has been identified in such a way that the competent authority can be satisfied with declarations in which operators declare that they will apply the mitigating measures when executing this type of operation;\n(7)\n‘visual line of sight operation’ (‘VLOS’) means a type of UAS operation in which, the remote pilot is able to maintain continuous unaided visual contact with the unmanned aircraft, allowing the remote pilot to control the flight path of the unmanned aircraft in relation to other aircraft, people and obstacles for the purpose of avoiding collisions;\n(8)\n‘beyond visual line of sight operation’ (‘BVLOS’) means a type of UAS operation which is not conducted in VLOS;\n(9)\n‘light UAS operator certificate’ (‘LUC’) means a certificate issued to a UAS operator by a competent authority as set out in part C of the Annex;\n(10)\n‘model aircraft club or association’ means an organisation legally established in a Member State for the purpose of conducting leisure flights, air displays, sporting activities or competition activities using UAS;\n(11)\n‘dangerous goods’ means articles or substances, which are capable of posing a hazard to health, safety, property or the environment in the case of an incident or accident, that the unmanned aircraft is carrying as its payload, including in particular:\n(a)\nexplosives (mass explosion hazard, blast projection hazard, minor blast hazard, major fire hazard, blasting agents, extremely insensitive explosives);\n(b)\ngases (flammable gas, non-flammable gas, poisonous gas, oxygen, inhalation hazard);\n(c)\nflammable liquids (flammable liquids;

Operations shall be classified as UAS operations in the ‘open’ category only where the following requirements are met:\n(a)\nthe UAS belongs to one of the classes set out in Delegated Regulation (EU) 2019/945 or is privately built or meets the conditions defined in Article 20;\n(b)\nthe unmanned aircraft has a maximum take-off mass of less than 25 kg;\n(c)\nthe remote pilot ensures that the unmanned aircraft is kept at a safe distance from people and that it is not flown over assemblies of people;\n(d)\nthe remote pilot keeps the unmanned aircraft in VLOS at all times except when flying in follow-me mode or when using an unmanned aircraft observer as specified in Part A of the Annex;\n(e)\nduring flight, the unmanned aircraft is maintained within 120 metres from the closest point of the surface of the earth, except when overflying an obstacle, as specified in Part A of the Annex\n(f)\nduring flight, the unmanned aircraft does not carry dangerous goods and does not drop any material;\n2.   UAS operations in the ‘open’ category shall be divided in three sub-categories in accordance with the requirements set out in Part A of the Annex.\nArticle 5\n‘Specific’ category of UAS operations\n1.   Where one of the requirements laid down in Article 4 or in Part A of the Annex is not met, a UAS operator shall be required to obtain an operational authorisation pursuant to Article 12 from the competent authority in the Member State where it is registered.\n2.   When applying to a competent authority for an operational authorisation pursuant Article 12, the operator shall perform a risk assessment in accordance with Article 11 and submit it together with the application, including adequate mitigating measures.\n3.   In accordance with point UAS.SPEC.040 laid down in Part B of the Annex, the competent authority shall issue an operational authorisation, if it considers that the operational risks are adequately mitigated in accordance with Article 12.\n4.   The competent authority shall specify whether the operational authorisation concerns:\n(a)\nthe approval of a single operation or a number of operations specified in time or location(s) or both. The operational authorisation shall include the associated precise list of mitigating measures;\n(b)\nthe approval of an LUC, in accordance with part C of the Annex.\n5.

The description of the UAS operation shall include at least the following:\n(a)\nthe nature of the activities performed;\n(b)\nthe operational environment and geographical area for the intended operation, in particular overflown population, orography, types of airspace, airspace volume where the operation will take place and which airspace volume is kept as necessary risk buffers, including the operational requirements for geographical zones;\n(c)\nthe complexity of the operation, in particular which planning and execution, personnel competencies, experience and composition, required technical means are planned to conduct the operation;\n(d)\nthe technical features of the UAS, including its performance in view of the conditions of the planned operation and, where applicable, its registration number;\n(e)\nthe competence of the personnel for conducting the operation including their composition, role, responsibilities, training and recent experience.\n3.   The assessment shall propose a target level of safety, which shall be equivalent to the safety level in manned aviation, in view of the specific characteristics of UAS operation.\n4.   The identification of the risks shall include the determination of all of the below:\n(a)\nthe unmitigated ground risk of the operation taking into account the type of operation and the conditions under which the operation takes place, including at least the following criteria:\ni.\nVLOS or BVLOS;\nii.\npopulation density of the overflown areas;\niii.\nflying over an assembly of people;\niv.\nthe dimension characteristics of the unmanned aircraft;\n(b)\nthe unmitigated air risk of the operation taking into account all of the below:\ni.\nthe exact airspace volume where the operation will take place, extended by a volume of airspace necessary for contingency procedures;\nii.\nthe class of the airspace;\niii.\nthe impact on other air traffic and air traffic management (ATM) and in particular:\n—\nthe altitude of the operation;\n—\ncontrolled versus uncontrolled airspace;\n—\naerodrome versus non-aerodrome environment;\n—\nairspace over urban versus rural environment;\n—\nseparation from other traffic.\n5.   The identification of the possible mitigation measures necessary to meet the proposed target level of safety shall consider the following possibilities:\n(a)\ncontainment measures for people on the ground;\n(b)\nstrategic operational limitations to the UAS operation, in particular:\ni.\nrestricting the geographical volumes where the operation takes place;\nii.\nrestricting the duration or schedule of the time slot in which the operation takes place;\n(c)\nstrategic mitigation by common flight rules or common airspace structure and services;\n(d)\ncapability to cope with possible adverse operating conditions;\n(e)\norganisation factors such as operational and maintenance procedures elaborated by the UAS operator and maintenance procedures compliant with the manufacturer's user manual;\n(f)\nthe level of competency and expertise of the personnel involved in the safety of the flight;\n(g)\nthe risk of human error in the application of the operational procedures;\n(h)\nthe design features and performance of the UAS in particular:\ni.\nthe availability of means to mitigate risks of collision;\nii.\nthe availability of systems limiting the energy at impact or the frangibility of the unmanned aircraft;\niii.\nthe design of the UAS to recognised standards and the fail-safe design.\n6.   The robustness of the proposed mitigating measures shall be assessed in order to determine whether they are commensurate with the safety objectives and risks of the intended operation, particularly to make sure that every stage of the operation is safe.\nArticle 12\nAuthorising operations in the ‘specific’ category\n1.   The competent authority shall evaluate the risk assessment and the robustness of the mitigating measures that the UAS operator proposes to keep the UAS operation safe in all phases of flight.\n2.   The competent authority shall grant an operational authorisation when the evaluation concludes that:\n(a)\nthe operational safety objectives take account of the risks of the operation;\n(b)\nthe combination of mitigation measures concerning the operational conditions to perform the operations, the competence of the personnel involved and the technical features of the unmanned aircraft, are adequate and sufficiently robust to keep the operation safe in view of the identified ground and air risks;\n(c)\nthe UAS operator has provided a statement confirming that the intended operation complies with any applicable Union and national rules relating to it, in particular, with regard to privacy, data protection, liability, insurance, security and environmental protection.\n3.
