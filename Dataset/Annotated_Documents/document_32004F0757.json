The exclusion of certain types of behaviour as regards personal consumption from the scope of this Framework Decision does not constitute a Council guideline on how Member States should deal with these other cases in their national legislation.\n(5)\nPenalties provided for by the Member States should be effective, proportionate and dissuasive, and include custodial sentences. To determine the level of penalties, factual elements such as the quantities and the type of drugs trafficked, and whether the offence was committed within the framework of a criminal organisation, should be taken into account.\n(6)\nMember States should be allowed to make provision for reducing the penalties when the offender has supplied the competent authorities with valuable information.\n(7)\nIt is necessary to take measures to enable the confiscation of the proceeds of the offences referred to in this Framework Decision.\n(8)\nMeasures should be taken to ensure that legal persons can be held liable for the criminal offences referred to by this Framework Decision which are committed for their benefit.\n(9)\nThe effectiveness of the efforts made to tackle illicit drug trafficking depends essentially on the harmonisation of the national measures implementing this Framework Decision,\nHAS DECIDED AS FOLLOWS:\nArticle 1\nDefinitions\nFor the purposes of this Framework Decision:\n1.\n‘drugs’: shall mean any of the substances covered by the following United Nations Conventions:\n(a)\nthe 1961 Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs (as amended by the 1972 Protocol);\n(b)\nthe 1971 Vienna Convention on Psychotropic Substances.

Apart from the cases provided for in paragraph 1, each Member State shall take the necessary measures to ensure that legal persons can be held liable where the lack of supervision or control by a person referred to in paragraph 1 has made possible the commission of any of the offences referred to in Articles 2 and 3 for the benefit of that legal person by a person under its authority.\n3.

Each Member State shall take the necessary measures to ensure that a legal person held liable pursuant to Article 6(2) is punishable by effective, proportionate and dissuasive sanctions or measures.\nArticle 8\nJurisdiction and prosecution\n1.   Each Member State shall take the necessary measures to establish its jurisdiction over the offences referred to in Articles 2 and 3 where:\n(a)\nthe offence is committed in whole or in part within its territory;\n(b)\nthe offender is one of its nationals; or\n(c)\nthe offence is committed for the benefit of a legal person established in the territory of that Member State.\n2.

The amendment becomes fully effective as of 23 November 2018.\nKEY POINTS\nOffences\nThe framework decision requires each EU country to take the necessary measures to penalise all intentional acts relating to the trafficking in drugs and precursors*.\nThe decision defines a ‘drug’ as a substance covered by the 1961 United Nations (UN) Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs, as amended by the 1972 Protocol, or by the 1971 UN Convention on Psychotropic Substances. Once the amendment of the Framework Decision becomes effective in November 2018, the definition of drugs will also include any of the substances listed in the annex of the amended decision.\nActs linked to drug trafficking include production, manufacture, extraction, sale, transport, importation and exportation. Possession and purchase with a view to engaging in activities linked with drug trafficking are also taken into account, as are the manufacture, transport and distribution of precursors. Incitement to drug trafficking, aiding and abetting such activity, and attempting to traffic in drugs are also regarded as offences.\nHowever, this framework decision does not cover activities relating to the trafficking in drugs for personal consumption.\nInclusion of new psychoactive substances in the definition of ‘drug’ (applicable as of 23 November 2018).\nDirective (EU) 2017/2103 introduces a procedure for including new psychoactive substances in the definition of ‘drug’. The European Commission is given the power to adopt delegated acts to add new psychoactive substances to the list in the annex. This will replace the current practice of scheduling new psychoactive substances through Council Implementing Decision (EU) 2017/2170 under Council Decision 2005/387/JHA.\nWhen considering whether to add a new substance to the list, the Commission must take into account whether:\nthe extent or patterns of its use and its availability and potential for diffusion within the EU are significant; and\nthe harm to health its consumption may cause is life-threatening due to its acute or chronic toxicity andliability to be abused or potential to cause dependence.\nIn addition, the Commission must assess whether the social harm caused by the new psychoactive substance to individuals and to society is severe and whether criminal activities, including organised crime, associated with the new psychoactive substance are systematic, involve significant illicit profits or entail significant economic costs.\nTo support the Commission’s decision-making, the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA) will prepare a risk assessment report which will address all these elements.\nIn parallel with the adoption of Directive (EU) 2017/2103, the EU adopted Regulation (EU) 2017/2101 which amends Regulation (EC) No 1920/2006 on sharing information and an early warning system and risk assessment procedures for new psychoactive substances. The regulation will becomes fully effective on 23 November 2018.\nLiability of legal persons\nEU countries must take measures to ensure that legal persons (for example, businesses) can be held to account for offences linked with trafficking in drugs and precursors, as well as for aiding and abetting, inciting or attempting such activity. The concept of legal persons as used here does not include states and public bodies in the exercise of their powers or public international organisations.\nAn organisation is liable if the offence is committed by an individual who has a leading position within that organisation. It is also held responsible for shortcomings in supervision or control. However, the liability of legal persons does not exclude criminal proceedings against individuals (natural persons).\nSanctions\nEU countries must take the necessary measures to ensure that offences are subject to effective, proportionate and dissuasive penalties.\nIf an offence is committed in whole or in part within an EU country’s territory, that country must take measures, provided that the offender is one of its nationals or that the offence was committed for the benefit of a legal person established within its territory.\nThe maximum penalties for drug trafficking offences must be at least between 1 and 3 years’ imprisonment.\nHowever, maximum penalties must be increased to at least 5 to 10 years’ imprisonment in cases where the offence:\ninvolves large quantities of drugs;\ninvolves those drugs that are most harmful to health;\nis committed within a criminal organisation.\nEU countries must also take the necessary measures to confiscate substances which are the object of offences.\nHowever, penalties may be reduced if the offender renounces his illegal activities and provides information to the administrative or legal authorities that will help identify other offenders.\nSanctions for legal persons must include fines for criminal or non-criminal offences. Other sanctions may also be imposed, including placing the establishment under judicial supervision or closing it temporarily or permanently.\nFROM WHEN DOES THE DECISION APPLY?\n              \nThe decision has applied since 12 November 2004.\nBACKGROUND\n              \nFor more information, see:\nEU’s response to drugs (European Commission).\nKEY TERMS\n              \nNew psychoactive substance: a substance in pure form or in a preparation that is not covered by the 1961 United Nations Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs, as amended by the 1972 Protocol, or by the 1971 United Nations Convention on Psychotropic Substances but may pose health or social risks similar to those posed by the substances covered by those Conventions.\nPrecursor: any substance listed in EU legislation giving effect to the obligations deriving from Article 12 of the United Nations Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances of 20 December 1988.\nMAIN DOCUMENT\n            \nCouncil Framework Decision 2004/757/JHA of 25 October 2004 laying down minimum provisions on the constituent elements of criminal acts and penalties in the field of illicit drug trafficking (OJ L 335, 11.11.2004, pp. 8-11)\nSuccessive amendments to Framework Decision 2004/757/JHA have been incorporated in the original text.
