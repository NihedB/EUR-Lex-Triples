{"celex_id": "32002R1606", "reference": "EUR-Lex - 32002R1606 - EN\nAvis juridique important\n|\n32002R1606\nRegulation (EC) No 1606/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 19 July 2002 on the application of international accounting standards\nOfficial Journal L 243 , 11/09/2002 P. 0001 - 0004\nRegulation (EC) No 1606/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Councilof 19 July 2002on the application of international accounting standardsTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 95(1) thereof,Having regard to the proposal from the Commission(1),Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee(2),Acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty(3),Whereas:(1) The Lisbon European Council of 23 and 24 March 2000 emphasised the need to accelerate completion of the internal market for financial services, set the deadline of 2005 to implement the Commission's Financial Services Action Plan and urged that steps be taken to enhance the comparability of financial statements prepared by publicly traded companies.(2) In order to contribute to a better functioning of the internal market, publicly traded companies must be required to apply a single set of high quality international accounting standards for the preparation of their consolidated financial statements. Furthermore, it is important that the financial reporting standards applied by Community companies participating in financial markets are accepted internationally and are truly global standards. This implies an increasing convergence of accounting standards currently used internationally with the ultimate objective of achieving a single set of global accounting standards.(3) Council Directive 78/660/EEC of 25 July 1978 on the annual accounts of certain types of companies(4), Council Directive 83/349/EEC of 13 June 1983 on consolidated accounts(5), Council Directive 86/635/EEC of 8 December 1986 on the annual accounts and consolidated accounts of banks and other financial institutions(6) and Council Directive 91/674/EEC of 19 December 1991 on the annual accounts and consolidated accounts of insurance companies(7) are also addressed to publicly traded Community companies. The reporting requirements set out in these Directives cannot ensure the high level of transparency and comparability of financial reporting from all publicly traded Community companies which is a necessary condition for building an integrated capital market which operates effectively, smoothly and efficiently. It is therefore necessary to supplement the legal framework applicable to publicly traded companies.(4) This Regulation aims at contributing to the efficient and cost-effective functioning of the capital market. The protection of investors and the maintenance of confidence in the financial markets is also an important aspect of the completion of the internal market in this area. This Regulation reinforces the freedom of movement of capital in the internal market and helps to enable Community companies to compete on an equal footing for financial resources available in the Community capital markets, as well as in world capital markets.(5) It is important for the competitiveness of Community capital markets to achieve convergence of the standards used in Europe for preparing financial statements, with international accounting standards that can be used globally, for cross-border transactions or listing anywhere in the world.(6) On 13 June 2000, the Commission published its Communication on \"EU Financial Reporting Strategy: the way forward\" in which it was proposed that all publicly traded Community companies prepare their consolidated financial statements in accordance with one single set of accounting standards, namely International Accounting Standards (IAS), at the latest by 2005.(7) International Accounting Standards (IASs) are developed by the International Accounting Standards Committee (IASC), whose purpose is to develop a single set of global accounting standards. Further to the restructuring of the IASC, the new Board on 1 April 2001, as one of its first decisions, renamed the IASC as the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and, as far as future international accounting standards are concerned, renamed IAS as International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). These standards should, wherever possible and provided that they ensure a high degree of transparency and comparability for financial reporting in the Community, be made obligatory for use by all publicly traded Community companies.(8) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Regulation should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission(8) and with due regard to the declaration made by the Commission in the European Parliament on 5 February 2002 concerning the implementation of financial services legislation.(9) To adopt an international accounting standard for application in the Community, it is necessary firstly that it meets the basic requirement of the aforementioned Council Directives, that is to say that its application results in a true and fair view of the financial position and performance of an enterprise - this principle being considered in the light of the said Council Directives without implying a strict conformity with each and every provision of those Directives; secondly that, in accordance with the conclusions of the Council of 17 July 2000, it is conducive to the European public good and lastly that it meets basic criteria as to the quality of information required for financial statements to be useful to users.(10) An accounting technical committee should provide support and expertise to the Commission in the assessment of international accounting standards.(11) The endorsement mechanism should act expeditiously on proposed international accounting standards and also be a means to deliberate, reflect and exchange information on international accounting standards among the main parties concerned, in particular national accounting standard setters, supervisors in the fields of securities, banking and insurance, central banks including the ECB, the accounting profession and users and preparers of accounts. The mechanism should be a means to foster common understanding of adopted international accounting standards in the Community.(12) In accordance with the principle of proportionality, the measures provided for in this Regulation, in requiring that a single set of international accounting standards be applied to publicly traded companies, are necessary to achieve the objective of contributing to the efficient and cost-effective functioning of Community capital markets and thereby to the completion of the internal market.(13) In accordance with the same principle, it is necessary, as regards annual accounts, to leave to Member States the option to permit or require publicly traded companies to prepare them in conformity with international accounting standards adopted in accordance with the procedure laid down in this Regulation. Member States may decide as well to extend this permission or this requirement to other companies as regards the preparation of their consolidated accounts and/or their annual accounts.(14) In order to facilitate an exchange of views and to allow Member States to coordinate their positions, the Commission should periodically inform the accounting regulatory committee about active projects, discussion papers, point outlines and exposure drafts issued by the IASB and about the consequential technical work of the accounting technical committee. It is also important that the accounting regulatory committee is informed at an early stage if the Commission intends not to propose to adopt an international accounting standard.(15) In its deliberations on and in elaborating positions to be taken on documents and papers issued by the IASB in the process of developing international accounting standards (IFRS and SIC-IFRIC), the Commission should take into account the importance of avoiding competitive disadvantages for European companies operating in the global marketplace, and, to the maximum possible extent, the views expressed by the delegations in the Accounting Regulatory Committee. The Commission will be represented in constituent bodies of the IASB.(16) A proper and rigorous enforcement regime is key to underpinning investors' confidence in financial markets. Member States, by virtue of Article 10 of the Treaty, are required to take appropriate measures to ensure compliance with international accounting standards. The Commission intends to liaise with Member States, notably through the Committee of European Securities Regulators (CESR), to develop a common approach to enforcement.(17) Further, it is necessary to allow Member States to defer the application of certain provisions until 2007 for those companies publicly traded both in the Community and on a regulated third-country market which are already applying another set of internationally accepted standards as the primary basis for their consolidated accounts as well as for companies which have only publicly traded debt securities. It is nonetheless crucial that by 2007 at the latest a single set of global international accounting standards, the IAS, apply to all Community companies publicly traded on a Community regulated market.(18) In order to allow Member States and companies to carry out the necessary adaptations to make the application of international accounting standards possible, it is necessary to apply certain provisions only in 2005. Appropriate provisions should be put in place for the first-time application of IAS by companies as a result of the entry into force of the present regulation. Such provisions should be drawn up at international level in order to ensure international recognition of the solutions adopted,HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:Article 1AimThis Regulation has as its objective the adoption and use of international accounting standards in the Community with a view to harmonising the financial information presented by the companies referred to in Article 4 in order to ensure a high degree of transparency and comparability of financial statements and hence an efficient functioning of the Community capital market and of the Internal Market.Article 2DefinitionsFor the purpose of this Regulation, \"international accounting standards\" shall mean International Accounting Standards (IAS), International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and related Interpretations (SIC-IFRIC interpretations), subsequent amendments to those standards and related interpretations, future standards and related interpretations issued or adopted by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB).Article 3Adoption and use of international accounting standards1.

EU companies that have issued securities on an EU regulated market) including banks and insurance companies, to prepare their consolidated accounts in accordance with financial reporting standards (IFRSs)* from 2005 onwards.\nUsing common accounting standards improves the transparency and comparability of company accounts, thus increasing market efficiency and reducing the cost of raising capital for companies.\nKEY POINTS\n                \n              \nEU countries have the option to permit or require publicly-traded companies to prepare also their annual accounts in conformity with the IFRSs adopted according to the procedures laid down in the regulation. They may also decide to extend this permission or requirement to non-publicly traded companies when preparing their consolidated accounts or their annual accounts.\nTo ensure appropriate political oversight, the regulation introduces a new EU mechanism to assess the IFRSs adopted by the London-based International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) in order to give them enforceability within the EU.\nTwo bodies assist in this process:\nthe Accounting Regulatory Committee (ARC), chaired by the European Commission and composed of EU countries' representatives, decides whether to endorse IFRSs on the basis of Commission proposals;\nthe European Financial Reporting Advisory Group (EFRAG) provides support and expertise to the Commission in the assessment of IFRSs. It is composed of accounting experts from the private sector in several EU countries.\nThe endorsement mechanism involves a two-tier process:\na regulatory process where ARC decides, on the basis of a Commission proposal, whether the IFRSs are to be adopted;\na technical process with EFRAG providing support and expertise as needed to assess IFRSs and to advise the Commission on whether or not to adopt the IFRSs under consideration.\nCommission Regulation (EC) No 1126/2008 sets out the endorsed IFRSs and related interpretations. This regulation has been amended several times to include all the standards presented by the IASB since 2008, including certain amendments from 2012 on consolidated financial statements, partnerships and information to be provided on interests held in other entities.\nA page on the Commission's website listing all the amendments to Commission Regulation (EC) No 1126/2008 is published and updated regularly.\nIn June 2015, the European Commission adopted a report evaluating the regulation's operation. It concludes overall that IFRSs have been successful in improving the efficiency of EU capital markets by enhancing the transparency and comparability of financial statements. Some areas for improvement were however identified, such as better collaboration between the parties involved in the endorsement process.\nFROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?\n              \nIt has applied since 14 September 2002.\nBACKGROUND\n              \nFor more information, see:\nFinancial reporting (European Commission).\nKEY TERMS\n              \nInternational financial reporting standards: previously known as international accounting standards (IASs), international financial reporting standards (IFRSs) and related interpretations (SIC-IFRIC* interpretations), subsequent amendments to those standards and related interpretations, future standards and related interpretations issued or adopted by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB).\nSIC-IFRIC: the Standing Interpretations Committee (SIC) was the predecessor to the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (IFRIC).\nMAIN DOCUMENT\n            \nRegulation (EC) No 1606/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 19 July 2002 on the application of international accounting standards (OJ L 243, 11.9.2002, pp. 1-4)\nSuccessive amendments to Regulation (EC) No 1606/2002 have been incorporated in the original text.
