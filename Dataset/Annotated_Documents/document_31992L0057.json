whereas, therefore, the provisions of the said Directive are fully applicable to temporary or mobile construction sites, without prejudice to more stringent and/or specific provisions contained in this Directive;\nWhereas this Directive constitutes a practical step towards the achievement of the social dimension of the internal market with special reference to the subject matter of Council Directive 89/106/EEC of 21 December 1988 on the approximation of laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States relating to construction products (9) and the subject matter covered by Council Directive 89/440/EEC of 18 July 1989 amending Directive 71/305/EEC concerning coordination of procedures for the award of public work contracts (10);\nWhereas, pursuant to Council Decision 74/325/EEC (11), the Advisory Committee on Safety, Hygiene and Health Protection at Work is consulted by the Commission with a view to drawing up proposals in this field,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:\nArticle 1\nSubject\n1.

This coordinator ensures that a safety and health plan is drawn up before setting up a site;\ncommunicate a prior notice (drawn up in accordance with the directive’s Annex III) for sites on which work is scheduled to last longer than 30 working days and on which more than 20 workers are occupied simultaneously, or on which the volume of work is scheduled to exceed 500 person-days.\nPreparation of the project\nThe client or project supervisor must apply the general prevention principles of Directive 89/391/EEC and the safety plan in the course of:\nthe work site project preparation stage;\narchitectural and organisational choices taken;\nthe various phases of work.\nCoordinators must:\nensure that the general prevention principles are implemented;\ndraw up a safety and health plan;\nprepare a file containing relevant safety and health information to be taken into account during any subsequent works.\nProject implementation\nDuring implementation, coordinators must:\nensure that employers and self-employed persons* apply the relevant principles of prevention and follow the safety and health plan where this is required;\norganise cooperation between employers with respect to safety and health matters;\ncheck that the working procedures are being implemented correctly;\ntake the necessary steps to ensure that only authorised persons are allowed on the construction site.\nResponsibilities of clients, project supervisors and employers\nEven where a coordinator has been appointed, the client or project supervisor still has responsibilities with respect to safety and health matters:\nemployers must comply with the minimum safety and health requirements applicable to sites, as set out in Annex IV (aspects such as energy distribution installations, emergency routes and exits, ventilation, temperature, traffic routes, sanitary equipment, etc.). They must also take into account directions from the coordinator for safety and health matters;\nself-employed persons must comply with the safety requirements, specifically concerning the use of work equipment and personal protection.\nWorker information, consultation and participation\nIn accordance with Directive 89/391/EEC, workers and/or their representatives must be:\ninformed in a comprehensible manner of all the measures taken for their safety and health on the site;\nconsulted on matters covered by this directive whenever necessary.\nAmending directive\nDirective 2007/30/EC simplified the requirements on reporting to the European Commission concerning the implementation of Directive 89/391/EEC and its various individual directives. EU countries now have to prepare a single report every 5 years covering the implementation of all of these directives.\nA study of the implementation of the directive was published in 2017.\nFROM WHEN DOES THE DIRECTIVE APPLY?\n              \nIt has applied since 17 July 1992 and had to become law in EU countries by 31 December 1993.\nBACKGROUND\n              \nFor more information, see:\nDirective 92/57/EEC — temporary or mobile construction sites (European Agency for Safety and Health at Work).\nKEY TERMS\n              \nTemporary or mobile construction sites: any construction site at which building or civil engineering works are carried out (a non-exhaustive list is given in the directive’s Annex I).\nClient: any individual or legal entity for whom a project is carried out.\nProject supervisor: any individual or legal entity responsible for designing and/or implementing and/or supervising the implementation of a project, acting on behalf of the client.\nSelf-employed person: any person other than the employee or employer, whose professional activity contributes to the completion of a project.\nMAIN DOCUMENT\n            \nCouncil Directive 92/57/EEC of 24 June 1992 on the implementation of minimum safety and health requirements at temporary or mobile construction sites (eighth individual Directive within the meaning of Article 16 (1) of Directive 89/391/EEC) (OJ L 245, 26.8.1992, pp. 6-22)\nSuccessive amendments to Directive 92/57/EEC have been incorporated in the original text.
