In that event, either Party may seek consultations, which may include representatives of the relevant competent authorities, and/or additional information relevant to this concern, and such requests are to be met as soon as practicable. If the matter remains unresolved, either Party may bring the matter to the Joint Committee set up under Article 22 (Joint Committee) of this Agreement.\n(b)\nThis Article does not cover recognition of determinations in relation to:\n—\nSafety certificates or licences;\n—\nSecurity arrangements; or\n—\nInsurance coverage.\nArticle 5\nRefusal, Revocation, Suspension, Limitation of Authorisation\n1.

Unless immediate action is essential to prevent further non-compliance with points (c) or (d) of paragraph 1 of this Article, the rights established by this Article shall be exercised only after consultation with the competent authorities of the other Party.\n3.   Neither Party shall use its rights established by this Article to refuse, revoke, suspend or limit authorisations or permissions of any air carriers of a Party on the grounds that majority ownership and/or effective control of that air carrier is vested in one or more Parties to the ECAA Agreement or their nationals, provided that such Party or Parties to the ECAA Agreement offer reciprocal treatment and provided that such Party or Parties apply the terms and conditions of the ECAA Agreement.\nArticle 6\nInvestment\n1.   Notwithstanding Articles 3 (Authorisation) and 5 (Refusal, Revocation, Suspension, Limitation of Authorisation) of this Agreement, the majority ownership or the effective control of an air carrier of the Republic of Moldova by Member States and/or their nationals shall be permitted.\n2.   Notwithstanding Articles 3 (Authorisation) and 5 (Refusal, Revocation, Suspension, Limitation of Authorisation) of this Agreement, the majority ownership or the effective control of an air carrier of the European Union by the Republic of Moldova and/or its nationals, shall be permitted by virtue of a prior decision of the Joint Committee established by this Agreement in accordance with Article 22 (2) (Joint Committee) of this Agreement. This decision shall specify the conditions associated with the operation of the agreed services under this Agreement and with the services between third countries and the Parties. The provisions of Article 22 (8) (Joint Committee) of this Agreement shall not apply to this type of decision.\nArticle 7\nCompliance with laws and regulations\n1.   While entering, within, or leaving the territory of one Party, the laws and regulations applicable within that territory relating to the admission to or departure from its territory of aircraft engaged in air transport, or to the operation and navigation of aircraft shall be complied with by the other Party's air carriers.\n2.   While entering, within, or leaving the territory of one Party, the laws and regulations applicable within that territory relating to the admission to or departure from its territory of passengers, crew or cargo on aircraft (including regulations relating to entry, clearance, immigration, passports, customs and quarantine or, in the case of mail, postal regulations) shall be complied with by, or on behalf of, such passengers, crew or cargo of the other Party's air carriers.\nArticle 8\nCompetitive environment\n1.   The Parties acknowledge that it is their joint objective to have a fair and competitive environment for the operation of air services. The Parties recognise that fair competitive practices by air carriers are most likely to occur where these air carriers operate on a fully commercial basis and are not subsidised.\n2.   Within the scope of this Agreement, and without prejudice to any special provisions contained therein, any discrimination on grounds of nationality shall be prohibited.\n3.   State aid which distorts or threatens to distort competition by favouring certain undertakings or certain aviation products or services is incompatible with the proper functioning of this Agreement, insofar as it may affect trade between the Parties in the aviation sector.\n4.   Any practices contrary to this Article shall be assessed on the basis of criteria arising from the application of the competition rules applicable in the European Union, in particular from Article 107 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union and interpretative instruments adopted by the European Union institutions.\n5.   If one Party finds that conditions exist in the territory of the other Party, in particular due to a subsidy, which would adversely affect the fair and equal opportunity of its air carriers to compete, it may submit observations to the other Party. Furthermore, it may request a meeting of the Joint Committee, as provided for in Article 22 (Joint Committee) of this Agreement. From the receipt of such a request consultations shall start within 30 days. Failure to reach a satisfactory agreement within 30 days from the start of consultations shall constitute grounds for the Party that requested the consultations to take action to refuse, withhold, revoke, suspend or impose appropriate conditions on the authorisations of the air carrier(s) concerned, consistent with Article 5 (Refusal, Revocation, Suspension or Limitation of Authorisation) of this Agreement.\n6.   The actions, referred to in paragraph 5 of this Article, shall be appropriate, proportionate and restricted with regard to scope and duration to what is strictly necessary. They shall be exclusively directed towards the air carrier or air carriers benefiting from a subsidy or the conditions referred to in this Article, and shall be without prejudice to the right of either Party to take action under Article 24 (Safeguard measures) of this Agreement.\n7.   Each Party, upon notification to the other Party, may approach responsible government entities in the territory of the other Party including entities at the state, provincial or local level to discuss matters relating to this Article.\n8.   The provisions of this Article shall apply without prejudice to the Parties' laws and regulations regarding public service obligations in the territories of the Parties.\nArticle 9\nCommercial opportunities\n1.   The Parties agree that obstacles to doing business of commercial operators would hamper the benefits to be achieved by this Agreement. The Parties therefore agree to engage in an effective and reciprocal process of removal of obstacles to doing business of commercial operators of both Parties where such obstacles may hamper commercial operations, create distortions to competition or hamper the development of a level playing field.\n2.   The Joint Committee set up in accordance with Article 22 (Joint Committee) of this Agreement shall develop a process of cooperation in relation to doing business and commercial opportunities; shall monitor progress in effectively addressing obstacles to doing business of commercial operators and shall regularly review developments, including, if necessary, towards legislative and regulatory changes. In accordance with Article 22 (Joint Committee) of this Agreement a Party may request a meeting of the Joint Committee to discuss any question related to the application of this article.\n3.   The air carriers of each Party shall have the right to establish offices in the territory of the other Party for the promotion and sale of air transport and related activities, including the right to sell and to issue any ticket and/or airwaybill, both its own tickets and/or airwaybills of any other carrier.\n4.   The air carriers of each Party shall be entitled, in accordance with the laws and regulations of the other Party relating to entry, residence, and employment, to bring in and maintain in the territory of the other Party managerial, sales, technical, operational, and other specialist staff who are required to support the provision of air transport. These staff requirements may, at the option of the air carriers, be satisfied by its own personnel or by using the services of any other organisation, company or air carrier operating in the territory of the other Party, authorised to perform such services in the territory of that Party. Both Parties shall facilitate and expedite the granting of employment authorisations, where required, for personnel employed in the offices according to this paragraph, including those performing certain temporary duties not exceeding ninety (90) days, subject to the relevant laws and regulations in force.\n5.\n(a)\nWithout prejudice to point (b) below, each air carrier shall have in relation to groundhandling in the territory of the other Party:\n(i)\nthe right to perform its own groundhandling (‘self-handling’) or, at its option\n(ii)\nthe right to select among competing suppliers that provide groundhandling services in whole or in part where such suppliers are allowed market access on the basis of the laws and regulations of each Party, and where such suppliers are present in the market.\n(b)\nFor the following categories of groundhandling services, i.e. baggage handling, ramp handling, fuel and oil handling, freight and mail handling as regards the physical handling of freight and mail between the air terminal and the aircraft, the rights under point (a) (i) and (ii) may be subject to constraints according to the laws and regulations applicable in the territory of the other Party. Where such constraints preclude self-handling and where there is no effective competition between suppliers that provide groundhandling services, all such services shall be available on both an equal and non-discriminatory basis to all air carriers.\n6.   Each groundhandling company, whether an air carrier or not, shall have in relation to groundhandling in the territory of the other Party the right to provide groundhandling services for airlines operating at the same airport, where authorised and consistent with applicable laws and regulations.\n7.   Any air carrier of each Party may engage in the sale of air transportation and related services in the territory of the other Party directly and/or, at the air carrier's discretion, through its sales agents, other intermediaries appointed by the air carrier, through another air carrier or through the internet. Each air carrier shall have the right to sell such transportation, and any person shall be free to purchase such transportation, in the currency of that territory or in freely convertible currencies in accordance with the local currency legislation.\n8.   Each air carrier shall have the right to convert into freely convertible currencies and remit from the territory of the other Party to its home territory and, except where inconsistent with generally applicable law or regulation, to the country or countries of its choice, on demand, local revenues. Conversion and remittance shall be permitted promptly without restrictions or taxation in respect thereof at the rate of exchange applicable to current transactions and remittance on the date the carrier makes the initial application for remittance.\n9.   The air carriers of each Party shall be permitted to pay for local expenses, including purchases of fuel, in the territory of the other Party in local currency. At their discretion, the air carriers of each Party may pay for such expenses in the territory of the other Party in freely convertible currencies in accordance with local currency legislation.\n10.   In operating or holding out services under this Agreement, any air carrier of a Party may enter into cooperative marketing arrangements, such as blocked-space agreements or code-sharing arrangements, with:\n(a)\nany air carrier or carriers of the Parties; and\n(b)\nany air carrier or carriers of a third country; and\n(c)\nany surface (land or maritime) transport provider;\nprovided that:\n(i)\nthe operating carrier holds the appropriate traffic rights,\n(ii)\nthe marketing carriers hold the appropriate underlying route authority, and\n(iii)\nthe arrangements meet the requirements relating to safety and competition normally applied to such arrangements. In respect of passenger transport sold involving code-shares, the purchaser shall be informed at the point of sale, or in any case before boarding, which transport providers will operate each sector of the service.\n11.\n(a)\nIn relation to the transport of passengers, surface transport providers shall not be subject to laws and regulations governing air transport on the sole basis that such surface transport is held out by an air carrier under its own name. Surface transport providers have the discretion to decide whether to enter into cooperative arrangements. In deciding on any particular arrangement, surface transport providers may consider, among other things, consumer interests and technical, economic, space, and capacity constraints.\n(b)\nMoreover, and notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, air carriers and indirect providers of cargo transport of the Parties shall be permitted, without restriction, to employ in connection with air transport any surface transport for cargo to or from any points in the territories of the Republic of Moldova and the European Union, or in third countries, including transport to and from all airports with customs facilities, and including, where applicable, the right to transport cargo in bond under applicable laws and regulations. Such cargo, whether moving by surface or by air, shall have access to airport customs processing and facilities. Air carriers may elect to perform their own surface transport or to provide it through arrangements with other surface carriers, including surface transport operated by other air carriers and indirect providers of cargo air transport. Such intermodal cargo services may be offered at a single, through price for the air and surface transport combined, provided that shippers are not misled as to the facts concerning such transport.\n12.

The assurance of safety for civil aircraft, their passengers and crew being a fundamental precondition for the operation of international air services, the Parties reaffirm their obligations to each other to provide for the security of civil aviation against acts of unlawful interference, and in particular their obligations under the Convention, the Convention on Offences and Certain Other Acts Committed on Board Aircraft, signed at Tokyo on 14 September 1963, the Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Seizure of Aircraft, signed at The Hague on 16 December 1970, the Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts against the Safety of Civil Aviation, signed at Montreal on 23 September 1971, the Protocol for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts of Violence at Airports Serving International Civil Aviation, signed at Montreal on 24 February 1988 and the Convention on the marking of plastic explosives for purpose of detection signed at Montreal on 1 March 1991, insofar as both Parties are parties to these conventions, as well as all other conventions and protocols relating to civil aviation security of which both Parties are parties.\n4.   The Parties shall provide upon request all necessary assistance to each other to prevent acts of unlawful seizure of civil aircraft and other unlawful acts against the safety of such aircraft, their passengers and crew, airports and air navigation facilities, and any other threat to the security of civil aviation.\n5.   The Parties shall, in their mutual relations, act in conformity with the aviation security Standards and, so far as they are applied by them, the Recommended Practices established by the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) and designated as Annexes to the Convention, to the extent that such security provisions are applicable to the Parties. Both Parties shall require that operators of aircraft of their registry, operators who have their principal place of business or permanent residence in their territory, and the operators of airports in their territory, act in conformity with such aviation security provisions.\n6.

Each Party agrees that their air carriers may be required to observe the aviation security provisions referred to in paragraph 5 of this Article required by the other Party, for entrance into, departure from, or while within, the territory of that other Party.\n7.   Each Party shall also give positive consideration to any request from the other Party for reasonable special security measures to meet a particular threat. Except where not reasonably possible in case of emergency, each Party will inform the other Party in advance of any special security measures it intends to introduce which could have a significant financial or operational impact on the air transport services provided under this Agreement. Either Party may request a meeting of the Joint Committee to discuss such security measures, as provided for in Article 22 (Joint Committee) of this Agreement.\n8.   When an incident or threat of an incident of unlawful seizure of civil aircraft or other unlawful acts against the safety of such aircraft, their passengers and crew, airports or air navigation facilities occurs, the Parties shall assist each other by facilitating communications and other appropriate measures intended to terminate rapidly and safely such incident or threat.\n9.   Each Party shall take all measures it finds practicable to ensure that an aircraft subjected to an act of unlawful seizure or other acts of unlawful interference which is on the ground in its territory is detained on the ground unless its departure is necessitated by the overriding duty to protect human life. Wherever practicable, such measures shall be taken on the basis of mutual consultations.\n10.   When a Party has reasonable grounds to believe that the other Party has departed from the aviation security provisions of this Article, that Party shall request immediate consultations with the other Party.\n11.   Without prejudice to Article 5 (Refusal, Revocation, Suspension, Limitation of Authorisations) of this Agreement, failure to reach a satisfactory agreement within fifteen (15) days from the date of such request shall constitute grounds to withhold, revoke, limit or impose conditions on the operating authorisation of one or more air carriers of such other Party.\n12.   When required by an immediate and extraordinary threat, a Party may take interim action prior to the expiry of fifteen (15) days.\n13.
