This information should, as a minimum, meet the following requirements:1. be easy to read and no less prominent than the main part of the information provided in the promotional literature;2. be easy to understand even on superficial contact;3. officiel fuel consumption data should be provided for all different car models to which the promotional material covers. If more than one model is specified then either the official fuel consumption data for all the models specified is included or the range between the worst and best fuel consumption is stated. Fuel consumption is expressed in either litres per 100 kilometers (l/100 km), kilometers per litre (km/l) or an appropriate combination of these. All numerical data are quoted to one decimal place.Such values may be expressed in different units (gallons and miles) to the extent compatible with the provisions of Directive 80/181/EEC.If the promotional literature only contains referance to the make, and not to any particular model, then fuel consumption data need not be provided.", "summary": "Information on the fuel consumption and CO2 emissions of new cars\nInformation on the fuel consumption and CO2 emissions of new cars\nSUMMARY OF:\nDirective 1999/94/EC — availability of consumer information on fuel economy and CO2 emissions in respect of the marketing of new passenger cars\nWHAT IS THE AIM OF THE DIRECTIVE?\n              \nTo help consumers choose vehicles with low fuel consumption, the directive requires dealers in new passenger cars to provide potential buyers with useful information on these vehicles’ fuel consumption and their CO2 emissions. This information must be displayed on the car’s label, on posters and other promotional material, and in specific guides.\nKEY POINTS\n              \nThe purpose of the directive is to ensure that information relating to the fuel economy and CO2 emissions of new passenger cars offered for sale or lease in the EU is made available to consumers. This consumer information is communicated via 4 different methods:\nattaching a fuel consumption and CO2 emissions label to the vehicle;\nproducing a fuel consumption and CO2 emissions guide;\ndisplaying posters in car showrooms;\nincluding fuel consumption and CO2 emissions data in promotional material.\nFuel economy label\nA fuel economy label must be attached to the windscreen of all new passenger cars at the point of sale. This label must be clearly visible and must meet certain requirements set out in Annex I. In particular, it must contain an estimate of fuel consumption, expressed in litres per 100 kilometres or in kilometres per litre (or in miles per gallon), and of CO2 emissions.\nFuel economy guide\nA fuel economy guide must be produced at national level at least once a year. It must set out all the information specified in Annex II, including a list of the 10 most fuel-efficient new car versions in terms of their CO2 emissions by fuel type. This guide must be compact, portable and free of charge. Consumers must be able to obtain it both at the point of sale of the dealer and from a designated body within each EU country.\nFuel consumption data\nFor each make on sale, the dealer must display on posters or in any other form (including electronic displays) a list of the fuel consumption data of all the models. These data should be broken down by type of fuel and ranked in order of fuel efficiency as indicated by CO2 emission levels.\nPromotional material (advertisements in newspapers, posters and brochures) used in marketing new cars must contain fuel consumption and CO2 emissions data.\nAny marking relating to fuel consumption which does not comply with the above rules and which might cause confusion is prohibited.\nFollow-up and monitoring\nEU countries must notify the European Commission of the competent body or bodies responsible for the implementation and functioning of the consumer information scheme.\nCommission recommendation and new regulatory test procedure\nIn May 2017, the Commission adopted a recommendation on the use of fuel consumption and CO2 emissions values type-approved and measured in accordance with the new world harmonised light vehicles test procedure (WLTP). This must be done when making information available to consumers in order to ensure that they have access to more representative WLTP-based values as soon as possible, to avoid market distortion and to support smooth and harmonised implementation in the EU. The Commission makes a number of recommendations to EU countries, including that they ensure the following:\nThe new European driving cycle (NEDC) values recorded in the certificates of conformity of new registered cars are used to communicate the official fuel consumption and specific emissions of CO2 to consumers until 31 December 2018. After this date all new vehicles placed on the EU market will be tested and type-approved in accordance with the WLTP, providing for stricter test conditions and more realistic fuel consumption and CO2 emissions values.\nOnly WLTP fuel consumption and CO2 emissions values should be used for consumer information purposes from 1 January 2019.\nPromotional material that is distributed by electronic means and allows consumers to configure a specific vehicle, such as online car configurators, must clearly demonstrate how different specific equipment and optional extras affect the fuel consumption and CO2 emission values that are type-approved and measured in accordance with the WLTP.\nBefore taking a decision on the purchase of a car, consumers must be informed about the changes in fuel consumption and CO2 emissions values resulting from the introduction of the WLTP as well as about the implications that those changes may have at the time of registration (e.g. on car taxation).\nThe official fuel consumption and specific CO2 emissions values must include at least the ‘combined’ values* measured in accordance with the relevant test procedure.\nAppropriate information campaigns are launched to explain to consumers the introduction of the WLTP and its implications for fuel consumption and CO2 emission values, in particular the increase in those values compared to those that are derived under the NEDC, and the meaning of values resulting from different test phases.\nFROM WHEN DOES THE DIRECTIVE APPLY?\n              \nIt has applied since 18 January 2000 and had to become law in the EU countries by 18 January 2001.\nBACKGROUND\n              \nFor more information, see:\nCar labelling\nNew and improved car emissions tests become mandatory on 1 September — press release (European Commission).\nKEY TERMS\n              \nCombined values: a value derived from a combination of the official fuel consumption value and the official specific CO2 emission value.\nMAIN DOCUMENT\n            \nDirective 1999/94/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 December 1999 relating to the availability of consumer information on fuel economy and CO2 emissions in respect of the marketing of new passenger cars (OJ L 12, 18.1.2000, pp. 16-23)\nSuccessive amendments to Directive 1999/94/EC have been incorporated into the original document.
