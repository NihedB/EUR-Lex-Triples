whereas it also calls for appropriate cooperation between these national authorities and the Commission, which is responsible for ensuring the application of the Treaty and the provisions adopted by virtue thereof; whereas effective cooperation in this field strengthens the protection of the financial interests of the Community;Whereas rules should therefore be drawn up whereby the Member States' administrative authorities assist each other and cooperate with the Commission in order to guarantee the proper application of customs and agricultural regulations and legal protection for the Community's financial interests, in particular by preventing and investigating breaches of those regulations and by investigating operations which are or appear contrary to those regulations;Whereas Council Regulation (EEC) No 1468/81 of 19 May 1981 on mutual assistance between the administrative authorities of the Member States and cooperation between the latter and the Commission to ensure the correct application of the law on customs or agricultural matters (5) established close cooperation between the said authorities and the Commission; whereas that system has proved effective;Whereas it is nevertheless necessary, in the light of the experience gained, to replace Regulation (EEC) No 1468/81 in its entirety with the aim of strengthening cooperation both among the administrative authorities of the Member States responsible for the application of the provisions adopted in the field of customs union and the common agricultural policy and between those authorities and the Commission; whereas, to that end, new rules should be laid down at Community level;Whereas the introduction of Community provisions on mutual assistance between Member States' administrations and their cooperation with the Commission in order to guarantee the proper application of customs or agricultural regulations is without prejudice to the application of the 1967 Convention for mutual assistance between customs administrations in fields which remain the sole province of the Member States; whereas these Community provisions are not such as to affect the application in the Member States of rules on judicial cooperation in criminal cases;Whereas, furthermore, the general Community rules establishing a system of mutual assistance and cooperation among the administrative authorities of the Member States and between them and the Commission do not apply where they overlap with those laid down by specific regulations, save where the general rules improve or reinforce administrative cooperation; whereas, in particular, the implementation of the customs information system does not in any way affect the Member States' obligations to provide information to the Commission, laid down inter alia under Regulations (EEC, Euratom) No 1552/89 (6) and (EEC) No 595/91 (7), or the established use of fraud information sheets to circulate information of Community interest;Whereas greater cooperation between the Member States requires the coordination of enquiries and other activities carried out by the bodies concerned; whereas it is therefore essential that the Commission should be given more detailed information concerning such activities by the Member States;Whereas the Commission must ensure that economic operators are treated equally and that the application by the Member States of the mutual administrative assistance system does not lead to discrimination between economic operators in different Member States;Whereas it is appropriate to define the Member States' obligations under the mutual administrative assistance system in respect of cases in which representatives of the Member States' national administrations conduct enquiries concerning the application of customs or agricultural legislation with a mandate from, or under the authority of, the legal authorities;Whereas the powers of national representatives conducting enquiries in other Member States should be defined; whereas provision should also be made for Commission representatives to be present, where justified, at national enquiries concerning mutual administrative assistance, and for their powers to be defined;Whereas it is necessary for the successful functioning of administrative cooperation that the Commission be informed of information exchanged between Member States and third countries in cases of particular interest for the Community;Whereas, with a view to securing the rapid and systematic exchange of information forwarded to the Commission, there is a need to set up a computerized customs information system at Community level; whereas in that context sensitive data concerning frauds and irregularities in the customs and agricultural domains should be stored in a central database accessible to the Member States, while ensuring that the confidential nature of the information exchanged, in particular data of a personal nature, is respected; whereas, given the justifiable sensitivity of the issue, there should be clear and transparent rules to protect the freedom of the individual;Whereas customs authorities have daily to apply both Community and non-Community provisions; whereas it is therefore desirable to have available a single infrastructure for applying these provisions;Whereas the information exchanged may concern physical persons and this Regulation must therefore implement, in its scope, the principles of protection of persons with regard to processing, by automatic means or otherwise, of personal data; whereas these principles, as set out in Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data (8) should themselves, in compliance with the terms and conditions of this Directive, be specified and supplemented in this Regulation; whereas pending implementation of the national measures transposing that Directive certain Member States which have no protection rules for personal data exchanged by non-automatic means should be exempted from applying the provisions of this Regulation concerning the non-automatic exchange of data;Whereas, in order to take part in the Customs Information System, the Member States and the Commission must adopt legislation on the rights and freedoms of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data; whereas, pending implementation of the national measures transposing Directive 95/46/EC, it is important that the Member States and the Commission guarantee a level of protection based on the principles contained in that Directive;Whereas, in order to ensure that the rights of the persons concerned are sufficiently protected, there needs to be a guarantee of independent supervision of the processing of the personal data in the Customs Information System both a Member State level and in respect of the Commission;Whereas the Commission, in close cooperation with the Member States, should facilitate the installation and management of computer systems in the Member States;Whereas the Commission should be notified of legal and administrative proceedings brought for infringements of the law on customs or agricultural matters;Whereas, with the aim of implementing certain provisions of this Regulation, enabling the installation and functioning of the Customs Information System and examining possible problems in connection with the development of administrative cooperation as provided for in this Regulation, it is necessary to establish a Committee;Whereas the provisions of this Regulation refer both to the application of the rules of the common agricultural policy and to the application of customs legislation; whereas the system set up under this Regulation constitutes an integral Community entity; whereas, since the provisions of the Treaty specifically covering customs matters do not empower the Community to set up such a system, it is necessary to invoke Article 235,HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:Article 1 1.

Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2, the Council, acting on a proposal from the Commission, may decide to permit access to the CIS by international or regional organizations, provided that, where relevant, a protocol is at the same time concluded with those organizations in conformity with Article 7 (3) of the Convention between Member States of the Community on the use of information technology for customs purposes. In reaching the decision account shall be taken in particular of any existing bilateral or Community arrangements and of the adequacy of the level of data protection.Article 30 1. CIS partners may use data obtained from the CIS only in order to achieve the aim stated in Article 23 (2); however, they may use it for administrative or other purposes with the prior authorization of the CIS partner which introduced the data into the system subject to conditions imposed by it or, where applicable, the Commission, which included it in the System. Such other use shall be in accordance with the laws, regulations and procedures of the Member State which seeks to use it and, where appropriate, the corresponding provisions applicable to the Commission in this connection and should take into account the principles set out in the Annex.2. Without prejudice to paragraphs 1 and 4 of this Article and Article 29 (3), data obtained from the CIS shall be used only by national authorities or departments in each Member State and by departments designated by the Commission competent, in accordance with the laws, regulations and procedures applicable to them, to act in order to achieve the aim stated in Article 23 (2).3. Each Member State shall send the Commission a list of the authorities or departments referred to in paragraph 2.The Commission shall inform the other Member States accordingly. It shall also inform all the Member States of the corresponding details concerning the Commission departments authorized to have access to the CIS.The list of the authorities or departments thus designated shall be published for information by the Commission in the Official Journal of the European Communities.4.

Each Member State shall take special measures to ensure the security of such data when they are being transmitted or supplied to departments located outside its territory.The provisions referred to in the first subparagraph shall apply mutatis mutandis to the Commission where it has entered the data in the System.Article 31 1. The inclusion of data in the CIS shall be governed by the laws, regulations and procedures of the supplying Member State and, where appropriate, the corresponding provisions applicable to the Commission in this connection, unless this Regulation lays down more stringent provisions.2. The processing of data obtained from the CIS, including their use or performance of any action under Article 27 (1) suggested by the supplying CIS partner, shall be governed by the laws, regulations and procedures of the Member State processing or using such data and the corresponding provisions applicable to the Commission in this connection, unless this Regulation lays down more stringent provisions.Chapter 3 Amendment of data Article 32 1. Only the supplying CIS partner shall have the right to amend, supplement, correct or delete data which it has included in the CIS.2. Should a supplying CIS partner note, or have drawn to its attention, that the data it included are factually inaccurate or were included or are stored contrary to this Regulation, it shall amend, supplement, correct or delete the data, as appropriate, and shall advise the other CIS partners accordingly.3. If a CIS partner has evidence to suggest that an item of data is factually inaccurate, or was included or is stored in the CIS contrary to this Regulation, it shall advise the supplying CIS partner as soon as possible. The latter shall check the data concerned and, if necessary, correct or delete the item without delay. The supplying CIS partner shall advise the other partners of any correction or deletion affected.4. If, when including data in the CIS, a CIS partner notes that its report conflicts with a previous report with regard to content or suggested action, it shall immediately advise the partner which made the previous report. The two partners shall then attempt to resolve the matter. In the event of disagreement, the first report shall stand but those parts of the new report which do not conflict shall be included in the System.5. Subject to the other provisions of this Regulation, where in any Member State a court, or other authority designated for the purpose within that Member State, makes a final decision to amend, supplement, correct or delete data in the CIS, the CIS partners shall align their action thereon.In the event of conflict between such decisions of courts or other authorities designated for the purpose including those referred to in Article 36 concerning correction or deletion, the Member State which included the data in question shall delete them from the System.The provisions in the first subparagraph shall apply mutatis mutandis where a Commission decision on data contained in the CIS is declared void by the Court of Justice.Chapter 4 Retention of data Article 33 1. Data included in the CIS shall be kept only for the time necessary to achieve the purpose for which they were included. The need for their retention shall be reviewed at least annually by the supplying CIS partner.2. The supplying CIS partner may, within the review period, decide to retain data until the next review if their retention is necessary for the purposes for which they were included. Without prejudice to Article 36, if there is no decision to retain data they shall automatically be transferred to that part of the CIS to which access shall be limited in accordance with paragraph 4.3. The CIS shall automatically inform the supplying CIS partner of a scheduled transfer of data from the CIS under paragraph 2, giving one month's notice.4. Data transferred under paragraph 2 shall continue to be retained for one year within the CIS but, without prejudice to Article 36, shall be accessible only to a representative of the Committee referred to in Article 43 in connection with the application of the seventh, eighth and ninth indents of paragraph 4 thereof, and paragraph 5 thereof, or to the supervisory authorities referred to in Article 37. During that period the data may be consulted only for the purposes of checking their accuracy and lawfulness. They must thereafter be deleted.Chapter 5 Personal-data protection Article 34 1. Each CIS partner intending to receive personal data from, or include them in, the CIS shall, no later than the date of application of this Regulation, adopt national legislation, or internal rules applicable to the Commission, guaranteeing the protection of the rights and freedoms of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data.2. A CIS partner may receive personal data from, or include them in, the CIS only where the arrangements for the protection of such data provided for in paragraph 1 have entered into force. Each Member State shall also have previously designated a national supervisory authority or authorities as provided for in Article 37.3. In order to ensure the proper application of the personal-data protection provisions in this Regulation, each Member State and the Commission shall regard the CIS as a system for processing personal data subject to the provisions referred to in paragraph 1 and the more stringent provisions contained in this Regulation.The internal rules applicable to the Commission, as referred to in paragraph 1, shall be published in the Official Journal of the European Communities.Article 35 1. Subject to Article 30 (1), CIS partners shall be prohibited from using personal data from the CIS other than for the purpose stated in Article 23 (2).2. Data may be duplicated only for technical purposes, provided that such duplication is necessary for searching by the authorities referred to in Article 29. Subject to Article 30 (1), personal data included by other Member States or the Commission may not be copied from the CIS into other data files for which the Member States or the Commission have responsibility.Article 36 1. The rights of persons with regard to the personal data in the CIS, in particular their right of access, shall be put into effect:- in accordance with the laws, regulations and procedures of the Member State in which such rights are invoked,- in accordance with the internal rules applicable to the Commission referred to in Article 34 (1).If laid down in the laws, regulations and procedures of the Member State concerned, the national supervisory authority provided for in Article 37 shall decide whether information is to be communicated and the procedure for doing so.2. A CIS partner to which an application for access to personal data is made may refuse access if communication would be likely to prejudice the prevention, investigation and prosecution of operations which are in breach of customs or agricultural legislation. A Member State may also refuse access as provided for in its laws, regulations and procedures in relation to cases where such refusal constitutes a measure necessary to safeguard national security, defence, public safety and the rights and freedoms of others. The Commission may refuse access where such refusal constitutes a measure necessary to safeguard the rights and freedoms of others.Access shall be refused in any event during the period in which action is taken for the purposes of sighting and reporting or discreet surveillance.3. If the personal data for which an application for access has been made have been supplied by another CIS partner, access shall be permitted only if the supplying partner has been given the opportunity to state its position.4. Any person may, in accordance with the laws, regulations and procedures of each Member State or with the internal rules applicable to the Commission, have personal data relating to himself corrected or deleted by each CIS partner if those data are factually inaccurate, or were included or are stored in the CIS contrary to the aim stated in Article 23 (2) or if the principles of Article 26 have not been observed.5. In the territory of each Member State, any person may, in accordance with the laws, regulations and procedures of the Member State in question, bring an action or, if appropriate, a complaint before the courts or the authority designated for the purpose, in accordance with those laws, regulations and procedures, in connection with personal data relating to himself in the CIS, in order to:(a) correct or delete factually inaccurate personal data;(b) correct or delete personal data included or stored in the CIS contrary to this Regulation;(c) obtain access to personal data;(d) obtain compensation under Article 40 (2).With regard to data included by the Commission, an action may be brought before the Court of Justice in accordance with Article 173 of the Treaty.The Member States and the Commission undertake mutually to enforce the final decisions taken by a court, the Court of Justice or another authority designated to that end which concern points (a), (b) and (c) of the first subparagraph.6. The references in this Article and in Article 32 (5) to a 'final decision` do not imply any obligation on the part of any Member State or the Commission to appeal against a decision taken by a court or other authority designated for the purpose.Chapter 6 Personal-data protection supervision Article 37 1. Each Member State shall designate a national supervisory authority or authorities responsible for personal-data protection to carry out independent supervision of such data included in the CIS.The supervisory authorities, in conformity with their respective national legislations, shall carry out independent supervision and checks to ensure that the processing and use of data held in the CIS do not violate the rights of data subjects. For this purpose the supervisory authorities shall have access to the CIS.2. Any person may ask any national supervisory authority to check personal data relating to himself in the CIS and the use which has been or is being made of those data. The right shall be governed by the laws, regulations and procedures of the Member State in which the request is made. If the data have been included by another Member State or the Commission, the check shall be carried out in close coordination with that Member State's national supervisory authority or with the authority provided for in paragraph 4.3. The Commission shall take every step within its departments to ensure personal-data protection supervision which offers safeguards of a level equivalent to that resulting from paragraph 1.4. Pending the appointment of any authority or authorities set up for the Community institutions and bodies, the Commission's activities as regards the data-protection rules laid down in Article 34 (1), Article 36 (1) and Article 37 (3) shall be supervised by the Ombudsman provided for in Article 138e of the Treaty establishing the European Community in the context of the task allotted to him by that Treaty.Chapter 7 Security of the CIS Article 38 1. All appropriate technical and organizational measures necessary to maintain security shall be taken:(a) by the Member States and the Commission, each insofar as it concerns them, in respect of the terminals of the CIS located on their respective territories and in the Commission's offices;(b) by the Committee referred to in Article 43 in respect of the CIS and the terminals located on the same premises as the CIS and used for technical purposes and the checks required by paragraph 3.2. In particular, the Member States, the Commission and the Committee referred to in Article 43 shall take measures:(a) to prevent any unauthorized person from having access to installations used for the processing of data;(b) to prevent data and data media from being read, copied, modified or deleted by unauthorized persons;(c) to prevent the unauthorized entry of data and any unauthorized consultation, modification or deletion of data;(d) to prevent data in the CIS from being accessed by unauthorized persons by means of data-transmission equipment;(e) to guarantee that, with respect to the use of the CIS, authorized persons have right of access only to data for which they have competence;(f) to guarantee that it is possible to check and establish to which authorities data may be transmitted by data-transmission equipment;(g) to guarantee that it is possible to check and establish ex post facto what data have been introduced into the CIS, when and by whom, and to monitor interrogation;(h) to prevent the unauthorized reading, copying, modification or deletion of data during the transmission of data and the transport of data media.3. In accordance with Article 43, the Committee shall verify that the searches carried out were authorized and were carried out by authorized users. At least 1 % of all searches made shall be verified. A record of such searches and verifications shall be entered into the system and shall be used only for the said verifications. It shall be deleted after six months.Article 39 1. Each of the Member States shall designate a department which shall be responsible for the security measures set out in Article 38, in relation to the terminals located in its territory, the review functions set out in Article 33 (1) and (2), and, in general, for the proper implementation of this Regulation insofar as is necessary under its laws, regulations and procedures.2. The Commission, for its part, shall designate those of its departments which are to be responsible for the measures referred to in paragraph 1.Chapter 8 Responsibilities and publication Article 40 1. Each CIS partner that has included data in the System shall be responsible for the accuracy, currency and lawfulness of those data. Each Member State or, where applicable, the Commission shall also be responsible for complying with the provisions of Article 26 of this Regulation.2. Each CIS partner shall be liable, in accordance with national laws, regulations and procedures or the equivalent Community provisions, for injury caused to a person through the use of the CIS in the Member State concerned or at the Commission.This shall also be the case where the injury was caused by the supplying CIS partner entering inaccurate data or entering data contrary to this Regulation.3. If the CIS partner against which an action in respect of inaccurate data is brought did not supply them, the partners concerned shall seek agreement as to what proportion, if any, of the sums paid out in compensation shall be reimbursed by the supplying partner to the other partner. Any such sums agreed shall be reimbursed on request.Article 41 The Commission shall publish a communication in the Official Journal of the European Communities concerning the implementation of the CIS.TITLE VI PROTECTION OF DATA DURING THE NON-AUTOMATIC EXCHANGE OF DATA Article 42 The provisions applying to the automatic exchange and processing of data shall apply mutatis mutandis to non-automatic exchange and processing of data.TITLE VII FINAL PROVISIONS Article 43 1.

In such cases, the committee shall meet in an ad hoc formation comprising representatives nominated by each Member State from its national supervisory authority or authorities. The Ombudsman referred to in Article 37 (4) or his representative may also participate, on his own initiative, insofar as he considers it compatible with his duties, in the meetings of the committee in such ad hoc formation. The committee shall meet in its ad hoc formation at least once a year.6. For the purposes of this Article the committee shall have direct access to, and may make direct use of, data from the CIS.Article 44 Without prejudice to the provisions in Title V on the CIS, the documents provided for in this Regulation may be replaced by computerized information produced in any form for the same purpose.Article 45 1. Regardless of the form, any information transmitted pursuant to this Regulation shall be of a confidential nature, including the data stored in the CIS. It shall be covered by the obligation of professional secrecy and shall enjoy the protection extended to like information under both the national law of the Member States receiving it and the corresponding provisions applicable to Community authorities.In particular, the information referred to in the first subparagraph may not be sent to persons other than those in the Member States or within the Community institutions whose functions require them to know or use it. Nor may it be used for purposes other than those provided for in this Regulation, unless the Member State, or the Commission, which supplied it or entered it in the CIS has expressly agreed, subject to the conditions laid down by that Member State or by the Commission and insofar as such communication or use is not prohibited by the provisions in force in the Member State in which the recipient authority is based.2. Without prejudices to the provisions in Title V on the CIS, information concerning natural and legal persons shall be transmitted under this Regulation only where strictly necessary to prevent, investigate or take proceedings in respect of operations in breach of customs or agricultural legislation.3.

Where the Commission is notified by a Member State that further enquiries have exonerated from involvement in irregularities a natural or legal person whose name was transmitted under this Regulation, the Commission shall forthwith notify all parties to whom these personal data have been transmitted on the basis of this Regulation. The person concerned shall then cease to be regarded as being involved in the irregularity that gave rise to the initial notification.Where the personal data relating to the person concerned are in the CIS, they shall be removed from it.Article 46 For the purposes of applying this Regulation, Member States shall take all necessary steps to:(a) ensure effective internal coordination between the administrative authorities referred to in Article 1 (1);(b) establish in their mutual relations all necessary direct cooperation between the authorities empowered specifically for that purpose.Article 47 Member States may decide by common accord whether procedures are needed to ensure the smooth operation of the mutual-assistance arrangements provided for in this Regulation, in particular in order to avoid any interruption of surveillance of persons or goods where this might be prejudicial to the detection of operations in breach of customs and agricultural legislation.Article 48 1. This Regulation shall not bind Member States' administrative authorities to grant each other assistance where that would be likely to be injurious to public policy (ordre public) or other fundamental interests, in particular with regard to data protection, of the Member State in which they are based.2. Reasons shall be stated for any refusal to grant assistance.The Commission shall be informed as early as possible of any refusal to grant assistance and the reasons given for refusal.Article 49 Without prejudice to the Commission's right to be notified under other regulations in force, Member States shall transmit to the Commission administrative or legal decisions or the main elements thereof relating to the application of penalties for breaches of customs or agricultural legislation in cases which have been the subject of communications under Articles 17 or 18.Article 50 Without prejudice to the expenses associated with the implementation of the CIS or damages under Article 40, Member States and the Commission shall waive all claims for the reimbursement of expenses incurred under this Regulation save, where appropriate, in respect of fees paid to experts.Article 51 This Regulation shall not affect the application in the Member States of rules on criminal procedure and mutual assistance in criminal matters, including those on secrecy of judicial inquiries.Article 52 1. Regulation (EEC) No 1468/81 is hereby repealed.2. References made to the repealed Regulation shall be understood as referring to the present Regulation.Article 53 1. This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.It shall apply from 13 March 1998.2. However, Article 42 will not apply to Denmark, Ireland, Sweden or the United Kingdom until Community rules exist applicable to all the data covered by this Regulation.As from the date when the rules referred to in the first subparagraph apply in all the Member States, Article 42 will be repealed and the derogation provided for in the first subparagraph will cease to have effect.If after 5 years the rules in question have not yet become applicable, the Commission shall prepare a report, together with any proposals it deems necessary.For as long as the four Member States concerned do not apply the provisions of Article 42, the Member States and the Commission may subject the non-automatic processing of personal data which they may communicate to those four Member States to compliance with rules on data protection equivalent to those which they apply themselves to the non-automatic processing of such data.This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.Done at Brussels, 13 March 1997.For the CouncilThe PresidentM.

The data entered into the CIS must only relate to: commodities (goods);means of transport;businesses;persons;fraud trends;availability of expertise;goods detained, seized or confiscated;cash detained, seized or confiscated.\nInternational or regional organisations can access the CIS by a Council decision. Under certain conditions, data can be shared with other national authorities, non-EU countries and international or regional organisations, and/or EU agencies.\nData protection\nIt may happen that the information exchanged contains personal data*. Personal data exchanges occur only where necessary to achieve the system’s objectives, for instance, for the purposes of sighting, specific checks or operational analysis*.\nAll the data in the CIS are confidential and may only be reproduced for technical reasons such as in cases justified by the information search. On the authorisation of the authority that entered them, personal data can be transmitted to systems of risk management used for national customs controls or to operational analysis systems used at EU level.\nCustoms files identification database\nThe customs files identification database (FIDE) is a specific part of the CIS. It centralises files relating to persons and businesses that have been suspected of, or found guilty of, offences.\nImproved risk management and fraud detection and prevention\nRegulation (EU) 2015/1525, which has applied since 1 September 2016, amends Regulation (EC) No 515/97 with the aim of improving the detection, investigation and prevention of customs-related fraud, by streamlining the exchange of information and the available evidence, and improving the functioning of the established system. It addresses shortcomings in the systems for the detection of customs-related fraud as well as addressing delays in investigations carried out by the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF).\nRegulation (EU) 2015/1525: introduces a directory of reported container status messages (CSM directory). EU countries have the same level of access as the Commission to the CSM directory;establishes a centralised repository for import, export and transit data;clarifies the possibility of using information obtained via mutual assistance as evidence in judicial and administrative proceedings;sets out the procedure allowing the Commission to obtain supporting documents held by businesses. At the Commission’s request, EU countries must provide accompanying documents to the import and export declarations, and this request must be processed within 4 weeks;simplifies the procedure for data storage in the CIS by removing the obligation to review data annually and by setting a maximum storage period of 5 years which can be increased, subject to justification, by an additional period of 2 years;requires the Commission, by 9 October 2017, to carry out an assessment of the need to extend the scope of the export data contained in the directories concerned, as well as the feasibility of extending the scope of data contained in the transport directory, by including data on import, export and transit of goods by land and air.\nFROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?\n              \nIt has applied since 13 March 1998.\nBACKGROUND\nEuropean Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) (European Commission).\nKEY TERMS\n              \nPersonal data: any information regarding a physical person, identified or identifiable (this means that the person could be identified either directly or indirectly, in particular by an identification number or by elements specific to that person’s physical, physiological, psychological, economic, cultural or social identity).\nOperational analysis: the process of analysis of operations which constitute, or appear to constitute, breaches during many phases such as the collection of information, evaluation of the reliability of the information, the linking of information, as well as the formulation of recommendations aimed at identifying persons or businesses implicated and/or to detect other offences.\nMAIN DOCUMENT\n            \nCouncil Regulation (EC) No 515/97 of 13 March 1997 on mutual assistance between the administrative authorities of the Member States and cooperation between the latter and the Commission to ensure the correct application of the law on customs or agricultural matters (OJ L 82, 22.3.1997, pp. 1-16)\nSuccessive amendments to Regulation (EC) No 515/97 have been incorporated into the original text.

whereas it also calls for appropriate cooperation between these national authorities and the Commission, which is responsible for ensuring the application of the Treaty and the provisions adopted by virtue thereof; whereas effective cooperation in this field strengthens the protection of the financial interests of the Community;Whereas rules should therefore be drawn up whereby the Member States' administrative authorities assist each other and cooperate with the Commission in order to guarantee the proper application of customs and agricultural regulations and legal protection for the Community's financial interests, in particular by preventing and investigating breaches of those regulations and by investigating operations which are or appear contrary to those regulations;Whereas Council regulation 1468/81 of 19 May 1981 on mutual assistance between the administrative authorities of the Member States and cooperation between the latter and the Commission to ensure the correct application of the law on customs or agricultural matters (5) established close cooperation between the said authorities and the Commission; whereas that system has proved effective;Whereas it is nevertheless necessary, in the light of the experience gained, to replace regulation 1468/81 in its entirety with the aim of strengthening cooperation both among the administrative authorities of the Member States responsible for the application of the provisions adopted in the field of customs union and the common agricultural policy and between those authorities and the Commission; whereas, to that end, new rules should be laid down at Community level;Whereas the introduction of Community provisions on mutual assistance between Member States' administrations and their cooperation with the Commission in order to guarantee the proper application of customs or agricultural regulations is without prejudice to the application of the 1967 Convention for mutual assistance between customs administrations in fields which remain the sole province of the Member States; whereas these Community provisions are not such as to affect the application in the Member States of rules on judicial cooperation in criminal cases;Whereas, furthermore, the general Community rules establishing a system of mutual assistance and cooperation among the administrative authorities of the Member States and between them and the Commission do not apply where they overlap with those laid down by specific regulations, save where the general rules improve or reinforce administrative cooperation; whereas, in particular, the implementation of the customs information system does not in any way affect the Member States' obligations to provide information to the Commission, laid down inter alia under regulation 1552/89 (6) and (EEC) No 595/91 (7), or the established use of fraud information sheets to circulate information of Community interest;Whereas greater cooperation between the Member States requires the coordination of enquiries and other activities carried out by the bodies concerned; whereas it is therefore essential that the Commission should be given more detailed information concerning such activities by the Member States;Whereas the Commission must ensure that economic operators are treated equally and that the application by the Member States of the mutual administrative assistance system does not lead to discrimination between economic operators in different Member States;Whereas it is appropriate to define the Member States' obligations under the mutual administrative assistance system in respect of cases in which representatives of the Member States' national administrations conduct enquiries concerning the application of customs or agricultural legislation with a mandate from, or under the authority of, the legal authorities;Whereas the powers of national representatives conducting enquiries in other Member States should be defined; whereas provision should also be made for Commission representatives to be present, where justified, at national enquiries concerning mutual administrative assistance, and for their powers to be defined;Whereas it is necessary for the successful functioning of administrative cooperation that the Commission be informed of information exchanged between Member States and third countries in cases of particular interest for the Community;Whereas, with a view to securing the rapid and systematic exchange of information forwarded to the Commission, there is a need to set up a computerized customs information system at Community level; whereas in that context sensitive data concerning frauds and irregularities in the customs and agricultural domains should be stored in a central database accessible to the Member States, while ensuring that the confidential nature of the information exchanged, in particular data of a personal nature, is respected; whereas, given the justifiable sensitivity of the issue, there should be clear and transparent rules to protect the freedom of the individual;Whereas customs authorities have daily to apply both Community and non-Community provisions; whereas it is therefore desirable to have available a single infrastructure for applying these provisions;Whereas the information exchanged may concern physical persons and this Regulation must therefore implement, in its scope, the principles of protection of persons with regard to processing, by automatic means or otherwise, of personal data; whereas these principles, as set out in directive 95/46/ec of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data (8) should themselves, in compliance with the terms and conditions of this Directive, be specified and supplemented in this Regulation; whereas pending implementation of the national measures transposing that Directive certain Member States which have no protection rules for personal data exchanged by non-automatic means should be exempted from applying the provisions of this Regulation concerning the non-automatic exchange of data;Whereas, in order to take part in the Customs Information System, the Member States and the Commission must adopt legislation on the rights and freedoms of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data;

A CIS partner to which an application for access to personal data is made may refuse access if communication would be likely to prejudice the prevention, investigation and prosecution of operations which are in breach of customs or agricultural legislation. A Member State may also refuse access as provided for in its laws, regulations and procedures in relation to cases where such refusal constitutes a measure necessary to safeguard national security, defence, public safety and the rights and freedoms of others. The Commission may refuse access where such refusal constitutes a measure necessary to safeguard the rights and freedoms of others.Access shall be refused in any event during the period in which action is taken for the purposes of sighting and reporting or discreet surveillance.3.

Each Member State shall designate a national supervisory authority or authorities responsible for personal-data protection to carry out independent supervision of such data included in the CIS.The supervisory authorities, in conformity with their respective national legislations, shall carry out independent supervision and checks to ensure that the processing and use of data held in the CIS do not violate the rights of data subjects. For this purpose the supervisory authorities shall have access to the CIS.2. Any person may ask any national supervisory authority to check personal data relating to himself in the CIS and the use which has been or is being made of those data. The right shall be governed by the laws, regulations and procedures of the Member State in which the request is made. If the data have been included by another Member State or the Commission, the check shall be carried out in close coordination with that Member State's national supervisory authority or with the authority provided for in paragraph 4.3.
