Such cooperation represents considerable value added, in particular in terms of access to training, a wider range of training on offer and a reduction in unit costs.\n(2)\nThe principle of sound management dictates that a gradual approach should be adopted to setting up the European Administrative School, hereafter ‘the School’.\n(3)\nThe Decision setting up the School leaves scope for the Secretaries-General, the Registrar of the Court of Justice and the Representative of the Ombudsman to identify the fields of training to be assigned to it.\n(4)\nWhere one of the signatory institutions implements a staff policy requiring training in a special field which the School is called upon to provide, such a policy should be facilitated by ensuring a minimum number of places on the School’s courses for staff of that institution, especially if such training is obligatory or a precondition for exercising particular functions, particularly management functions.\n(5)\nThe School, like any other training body, should draw advantage from cooperation at European level by participating in relevant networks.\n(6)\nThe details of the attachment of the School to the European Communities Personnel Selection Office, as provided for in Article 4 of the Decision setting up the School, should be laid down,\nHAVE DECIDED AS FOLLOWS:\nArticle 1\nDuties of the European Administrative School\n1.

Management and induction courses as referred to in points (a) and (b) of paragraph 1 may be organised by each of the institutions to supplement those organised by the School in line with their own specific needs. The School shall have exclusive responsibility for organising the training referred to in point (c) of paragraph 1.\nArticle 2\nResponsibilities of the institutions\n1.   The appointing authority in each institution shall make a sufficient number of officials available to the School as trainers according to rules adopted by the Management Board as provided for in point (g) of Article 7.\n2.   At the request of the School and depending on availability, the institutions shall provide it with training rooms in accordance with rules to be set by the Management Board.\nArticle 3\nOther services\n1.   Under an agreement between the Principal of the School and any body, office or agency, the School may admit participants from them to the courses which it organises on behalf of the institutions to the extent that there are places free.\n2.   Specifically in the case of the training provided for in point (c) of Article 1(1), a number of places shall be reserved each year for the Community bodies, offices and agencies, taking account of declared needs, in order to guarantee equal treatment of staff assigned to them in connection with Article 45a of the Staff Regulations. The number of places and the contributions to costs shall be set each year by the Management Board.\n3.   By written agreement, the School may include courses in its training programmes which are requested by a Community body, office or agency provided this does not hinder the organising of courses for the institutions.
