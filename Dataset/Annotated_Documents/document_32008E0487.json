The EU’s support for the convention was based on the 2003 EU Security Strategy (replaced in the meantime by the EU's Global Strategy).\nThe decision supports the Maputo action plan for the implementation of the APMBC between 2014 and 2019 and sets out a number of objectives to help achieve this.\nKEY POINTS\nAnti-Personnel Mine Ban Convention\nOver 80% of UN Member States are States parties i.e. have ratified the convention. The US, Russia and China are not parties.\nAll EU countries are States parties.\nStates parties agree not to: use anti-personnel (AP) mines*;develop, produce, acquire, stockpile, retain or transfer AP mines;assist, encourage or induce in any way anyone to engage in an activity prohibited by the convention.\nStates parties must destroy all stockpiles of AP mines within 4 years and clear mined areas under their jurisdiction or control within 10 years.\nThe EU joint action set out 2 objectives:\npromote the convention to those countries that have not yet become parties (known as ‘universalisation’);\nsupport its full implementation by those countries that have become parties.\nTo achieve these objectives, the joint action foresees 2 types of action:\norganise seminars on a regional or sub-regional basis to encourage countries to become parties to the convention;\nprovide technical advice and assistance visits to countries to help with full implementation.\nMaputo action plan 2014-2019\nThe action plan aims to tackle 3 main issues concerning the implementation of the APMBC:\nthe universalisation of the convention;\nensuring the compliance of those states parties that have not cleared their stockpiles or cleared their existing mines;\nthe rights of mine victims and their integration into national policies and laws on disability rights.\nStates parties agreed to promote universalisation and to implement their remaining obligations.\nThe EU supports a number of projects to help to achieve these objectives, on the basis of the 2017 Council decision, including:\nmine clearance — including helping and strengthening planning in up to 5 countries with forthcoming clearance deadlines;\nvictim assistance — support the integration of victim assistance programmes in wider national policies;\nuniversalisation — support the presidency of the convention and a high-level task force to engage with non-signatory countries;\nstockpile destruction.\nFinancial support\nNearly all of the most severely affected countries benefit from financial support. These countries include Chad, Colombia, Croatia, Iraq, Lao PDR (People's Democratic Republic), Lebanon, Libya, Myanmar, Syria and Ukraine.\nBetween 2012 and 2016, the EU and EU countries provided over €600 million of support.\nDemining activities are supported through a number of EU external action instruments including:\nDevelopment Cooperation Instrument\nInstrument contributing to Stability and Peace\nEuropean Development Fund.\nFROM WHEN DO THE JOINT ACTION AND THE DECISION APPLY?\n              \nThe joint action has applied since 23 June 2008 and the decision since 4 August 2017.\nBACKGROUND\n              \nFor more information, see:\nConvention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-Personnel Mines and on their Destruction (AP Mine Ban Convention website)\nAnti-Personnel Landmines, Small Arms and Light Weapons (European Commission).\nKEY TERMS\n              \nAnti-personnel mines: a mine designed to be exploded by the presence, proximity or contact of a person and that will incapacitate, injure or kill one or more persons.\nMAIN DOCUMENTS\n            \nCouncil Joint Action 2008/487/CFSP of 23 June 2008 in support of the universalisation and implementation of the 1997 Convention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-Personnel Mines and on their Destruction, in the framework of the European Security Strategy (OJ L 165, 26.6.2008, pp. 41-44)\nCouncil Decision (CFSP) 2017/1428 of 4 August 2017 in support of the implementation of the Maputo Action Plan for the implementation of the 1997 Convention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-Personnel Mines and on their Destruction (OJ L 204, 5.8.2017, pp. 101-109)\nRELATED DOCUMENTS\n            \nCouncil Decision 2012/700/CFSP of 13 November 2012 in the framework of the European Security Strategy in support of the implementation of the Cartagena Action Plan 2010-2014, adopted by the States Parties to the 1997 Convention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-Personnel Mines and on Their Destruction (OJ L 314, 14.11.2012, pp. 40-46)\nlast update 18.07.2018", "tags": ["international convention", "cooperation policy", "non-proliferation of arms", "anti-personnel weapon", "weapons' destruction", "prohibited weapon"], "subjects": ["Common foreign and security policy"], "split": "train", "reference_annotations": {}, "summary_annotations": {}}
