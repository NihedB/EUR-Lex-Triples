In accordance with United Nations Security Council Resolution (UNSCR) 1970 (2011) and successor resolutions, Decision 2011/137/CFSP provided for an arms embargo, a ban on internal repression equipment, as well as restrictions on the admission and the freezing of funds and economic resources of certain persons and entities involved in serious human rights abuses against persons in Libya, including by being involved in attacks, in violation of international law, on civilian populations and facilities. Those natural or legal persons and entities are listed in the Annexes to Decision 2011/137/CFSP. Regulatory action was therefore required in order to provide the relevant necessary measures. The United Nations Security Council (‘the Security Council’) has since adopted a number of additional Resolutions on Libya that have extended or amended the UN's restrictive measures against Libya, including UNSCR 2174 (2014) amending the scope of the arms embargo and extending the application of the travel ban and asset freeze measures, and UNSCR 2213 (2015) in connection with the Security Council's commitment to the sovereignty, independence, territorial integrity and national unity of Libya.\n(2)\nOn 26 May 2015, the Council adopted Decision (CFSP) 2015/818 (3) amending Decision 2011/137/CFSP taking into consideration the threat that continues to be posed to the peace, stability or security of Libya and the successful completion of its political transition. Decision (CFSP) 2015/818 also took into account the threat posed by persons and entities owning or controlling Libyan state funds misappropriated during the former regime of Muammar Qadhafi in Libya which could be used to threaten the peace, stability or security of Libya, or obstruct or undermine the successful completion of its political transition. The Council carried out a complete review of the lists of persons and entities subject to the travel ban and asset freeze measures, as set out in Annexes II and III to Decision 2011/137/CFSP. On 31 July 2015, the Council adopted a consolidated Decision (CFSP) 2015/1333 and repealed Decision 2011/137/CFSP.\n(3)\nFor the sake of clarity, Council Regulation (EU) No 204/2011 (4) as amended and implemented by a number of subsequent Regulations, should be consolidated into a new Regulation.\n(4)\nThe power to amend the lists in Annexes II and III to this Regulation should be exercised by the Council, in view of the specific threat to international peace and security in the region posed by the situation in Libya and in order to ensure consistency with the process for amending and reviewing the Annexes to Decision (CFSP) 2015/1333.\n(5)\nFor the implementation of this Regulation, and in order to create maximum legal certainty within the Union, the names and other relevant data concerning natural and legal persons, entities and bodies whose funds and economic resources must be frozen in accordance with this Regulation, should be made public.
