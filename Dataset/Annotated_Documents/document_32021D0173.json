{"celex_id": "32021D0173", "reference": "15.2.2021\nEN\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\nL 50/9\nCOMMISSION IMPLEMENTING DECISION (EU) 2021/173\nof 12 February 2021\nestablishing the European Climate, Infrastructure and Environment Executive Agency, the European Health and Digital Executive Agency, the European Research Executive Agency, the European Innovation Council and SMEs Executive Agency, the European Research Council Executive Agency, and the European Education and Culture Executive Agency and repealing Implementing Decisions 2013/801/EU, 2013/771/EU, 2013/778/EU, 2013/779/EU, 2013/776/EU and 2013/770/EU\nTHE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,\nHaving regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 58/2003 of 19 December 2002 laying down the statute for executive agencies to be entrusted with certain tasks in the management of Community programmes (1), and in particular Article 3 thereof,\nWhereas:\n(1)\nPursuant to Article 6 of Regulation (EC) No 58/2003 the Commission can delegate powers to the executive agencies to implement all or part of a Union programme or project, on its behalf and under its responsibility and pursuant to Article 3 of that Regulation, the Commission can decide to create and, where appropriate, wind up an executive agency.\n(2)\nThe Communication to the Commission on the Governance in the European Commission (2) provides further details on the position of the executive agencies in the overall governance in the Commission and their relationship with it.\n(3)\nThe purpose of entrusting the executive agencies with programme implementation tasks is to enable the Commission to focus on its core activities and functions which cannot be outsourced, without relinquishing control over, and ultimate responsibility for, activities managed by those executive agencies.\n(4)\nThe delegation of tasks related to programme implementation to an executive agency requires a clear separation between the programming stage, which involves a large measure of discretion in making choices driven by policy considerations, and which is therefore carried out by the Commission, and programme implementation, which the Commission can entrust to an executive agency.\n(5)\nFor the period 2021-2027, the Commission has set a new landscape of Union programmes. Some of the new Union programmes are successors of existing Union programmes, albeit with a different architecture, others have been merged and some others are completely new. The new landscape requires the revision of the distribution of portfolios among executive agencies.\n(6)\nA cost-benefit analysis was carried out by Commission services in accordance with Article 3(1) of Regulation (EC) No 58/2003, taking into account, among other factors, possible savings within the general budgetary framework of the European Union. The results obtained show that both in cost-efficiency and qualitative terms, it is more effective to delegate the programmes to the executive agencies than carry out their implementation in-house. Executive agencies benefit from their specialisation in the implementation of programmes. When they reach sufficient size, they can achieve significant economies of scale. Moreover, thematic consistency in the portfolios can ensure synergies between programmes in similar areas and give visibility to the Union priorities.\n(7)\nTherefore, in establishing new mandates, portfolios should be, as far as possible, grouped by thematic policy area in order to give executive agencies a coherent identity.\n(8)\nIn addition, the distribution of portfolios should, to the extent possible, avoid unnecessary transfer between agencies of programmes which are already delegated, group different strands of the same programme in the same agency, group together the programmes of a delegating Directorate-General in a single agency and group programmes related to the same theme within the same agency. Such distribution of portfolios should ensure that each executive agency reaches critical size without increasing the number of executive agencies.\n(9)\nTherefore, the programmes related to climate and environment should be grouped in one agency, the programmes related to the digital policy area should be grouped in one agency, the programmes related to health should be grouped in one agency and the activities of the Consumers, Health, Agriculture and Food Executive Agency should be transferred to Brussels-based agencies with similar thematic or programme activities. As regards Horizon Europe, in order to avoid fragmented implementation and duplication, the portfolio distribution should ensure that each cluster is grouped in one single agency.\n(10)\nThe new agencies should replace and succeed the existing agencies established respectively by Commission Implementing Decisions 2013/801/EU (3), 2013/771/EU (4), 2013/778/EU (5), 2013/779/EU (6), 2013/776/EU (7) and 2013/770/EU (8). To achieve an ambitious and integrated approach to health and digital issues, a new European Health and Digital Executive Agency will group all the programmes dedicated to health and digital. Following the detailed examination of costs and benefits, and in light of the Commission communication of 29 April 2020 on the future allocation of programmes among executive agencies (9), the Luxembourg-based Consumers, Health, Agriculture and Food Executive Agency should be wound up and the programmes currently managed by it should be taken over by Brussels-based executive agencies in order to ensure the most efficient implementation of the Union programmes. That take over takes into account the important level of synergies and efficiencies that can be obtained by grouping similar programmes into the same agency, along with the proven importance of the proximity of the implementing body to the Commission services, which enables more coherent agency portfolios, an efficient size of all agencies, as well as the possibility to develop synergies across agencies, both in programme management and administrative functions. Specific measures for the staff affected by this winding up should be taken.\n(11)\nTo ensure a smooth transition of activities between executive agencies and a rapid start of implementation, the European Health and Digital Executive Agency, which will be a newly established agency, should be established in advance of the actual transfer of staff, programmes and assets to it. This should allow for the necessary preparatory work to set-up the European Health and Digital Executive Agency to be done in a timely manner before it takes over implementation activities.\n(12)\nThe European Climate, Infrastructure and Environment Executive Agency should be entrusted with a portfolio that gives it a clear focus as a climate and environment agency, that is to say the LIFE programme, the Innovation Fund, infrastructure activities under CEF Transport and CEF Energy, the Horizon Europe cluster 5 related to climate, energy and mobility, the public sector loan facility under the Just Transition Mechanism, and the European Maritime, Fisheries and Aquaculture Fund.\n(13)\nThe European Health and Digital Executive Agency should be dedicated to all health related activities, including the new EU4Health programme, the health research strand of Horizon Europe, and the health components of the Single Market Programme. The European Health and Digital Executive Agency should also group the digital programmes to ensure Europe’s introduction into the digital age, including the ones targeting industry and space.\n(14)\nThe European Research Executive Agency should group different parts of the Horizon Europe programme together to ensure thematic consistency within the new structure of that programme. The emphasis should remain on research activities, with the addition of the Agricultural Promotion Measures Programme.\n(15)\nThe European Innovation Council and SMEs Executive Agency should ensure a clear focus on innovation and the single market. The European Innovation Council and SMEs Executive Agency should create strong synergies to support the recovery of the European economy, by grouping in one agency all the activities of the European Innovation Council (EIC) and the programmes related to small and medium-sized enterprises. The EIC and Interregional Innovation Investments will ensure visibility for innovation, key to supporting the modernisation and sustainability of the EU economy.\n(16)\nAs a dedicated implementation structure of the European Research Council, the European Research Council Executive Agency should keep its focus on the implementation of European Research Council actions under Horizon Europe.\n(17)\nThe thematic focus of the European Education and Culture Executive Agency should remain on educational and creative activities as well as on projects close to the Union citizens.\n(18)\nIn order to create synergies and efficiencies, it should be possible for each agency to implement funding provided from other Union programmes, or parts thereof, together with funding already entrusted to the agency, where such provision of additional funding is envisaged in the respective basic acts of the Union programmes. Likewise, it should be possible for each agency to implement funding transferred from funds under shared management, where it is envisaged in the basic act. The implementation of such funds should be done on the basis of the relevant work programmes and subject to the conditions set out in the instruments of delegation.\n(19)\nMoreover, agencies should be allowed to implement pilot projects and preparatory actions within the meaning of Article 58(2) of Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2018/1046 of the European Parliament and of the Council (10), subject to the conditions set out in the instruments of delegation.\n(20)\nAgencies are encouraged to further facilitate synergies and efficiencies through pooling of resources, reinforced cooperation, extensive use of service-level agreements and to stabilise non-salary related expenditure by reducing costs through implementation of new ways of working, such as teleworking.\n(21)\nIt should be possible to pool specific programme implementation tasks for several programmes within specific agencies, who would act as administrative and logistical support services for the programmes concerned.\n(22)\nIn order to ensure continuity in each agency’s work until the actual completion of the programme(s) delegated to it, the lifetime of the agencies established by this Decision should exceed that of the multiannual financial framework by one year. Based on the evaluations mentioned in Article 25 of Regulation (EC) No 58/2003, including a cost-benefit analysis comparing the results of the ex-ante cost-benefit analysis carried out in accordance with Article 3(1) of Regulation (EC) No 58/2003 with actual implementation, the Commission may present a proposal to extend the lifetime of one or more agencies by up to three years to allow closing of the programmes delegated.\n(23)\nIn order to ensure a consistent implementation of this Decision and of the programmes concerned, it is necessary to ensure that the agencies carry out their tasks linked to the implementation of those programmes subject to and from the date on which those programmes enter into force.\n(24)\nAs far as the taking over of a programme from one agency to another is concerned, the agency established by this Decision should be subrogated in the rights and obligations of the agency handing over that programme, including as regards the contractual and budgetary implementation of the programme concerned. Staff in charge of the programme concerned should be moved to the agency established by this Decision without any impairment of their rights and obligations.\n(25)\nThe evaluation on the operation of each agency referred to in Article 25 of Regulation (EC) No 58/2003 should occur in a coordinated way. The evaluation period for the European Climate, Infrastructure and Environment Executive Agency, the European Health and Digital Executive Agency, the European Research Executive Agency, the European Innovation Council and SMEs Executive Agency, the European Research Council Executive Agency, and the European Education and Culture Executive Agency should start as of the date of application of this Decision. The Consumers, Health, Agriculture and Food Executive Agency, the Innovation and Networks Executive Agency, the Research Executive Agency, the former European Research Council Executive Agency, the Education, Audio-visual and Culture Executive Agency and the Executive Agency for Small and Medium-sized Enterprises should be evaluated in a coordinated way for the remaining period of the 2014-2020 mandates of the executive agencies which is not yet evaluated. The evaluations covering the 2021-2027 mandates should analyse, among other things, the achievement of the savings and productivity increase assumed by the cost-benefit analysis carried out in accordance with Article 3(1) of Regulation (EC) No 58/2003. These evaluations should be submitted to the Steering Committees of the executive agencies, to the European Parliament, to the Council and to the Court of Auditors.\n(26)\nFollowing the Court of Auditors’ recommendations in its Special Report 14/2014 (11), executive agencies should implement Regulation (EC) No 1221/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council (12) and apply for registration under the Union eco-management and audit scheme (EMAS). Under the Commission’s Green Deal policy (13), executive agencies are encouraged to join the Commission’s efforts to become climate neutral by 2030.\n(27)\nThe measures provided for by this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee for Executive Agencies set up by Article 24 of Regulation (EC) No 58/2003,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\nSECTION I\nGENERAL PROVISIONS\nArticle 1\nSubject matter\nThis Decision sets up the executive agencies implementing Union programmes in the 2021-2027 multiannual financial framework (‘MFF’), determines their tasks and portfolios and general operating rules and establishes the legal framework for the transition between the agencies and between the Commission and agencies.\nArticle 2\nDefinitions\nFor the purposes of this Decision, the following definitions apply:\n(a)\n‘general administrative and logistical support services’ means support services related to the implementation of several programmes, which are centralised in one or more executive agencies;\n(b)\n‘legacy’ means residual activities resulting from commitments from the implementation of Union programmes under the 2014-2020 MFF and earlier MFF periods.\nSECTION II\nESTABLISHMENT, TASKS AND PORTFOLIOS\nArticle 3\nEstablishment and term\n1.
