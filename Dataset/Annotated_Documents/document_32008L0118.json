{"celex_id": "32008L0118", "reference": "14.1.2009\nEN\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\nL 9/12\nCOUNCIL DIRECTIVE 2008/118/EC\nof 16 December 2008\nconcerning the general arrangements for excise duty and repealing Directive 92/12/EEC\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 93 thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the Commission,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European Parliament (1),\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee (2),\nWhereas:\n(1)\nCouncil Directive 92/12/EEC of 25 February 1992 on the general arrangements for products subject to excise duty and on the holding, movement and monitoring of such products (3) has been substantially amended several times. Since further amendments are to be made, it should be replaced in the interests of clarity.\n(2)\nConditions for charging excise duty on the goods covered by Directive 92/12/EEC, hereinafter ‘excise goods’, need to remain harmonised in order to ensure the proper functioning of the internal market.\n(3)\nIt is appropriate to specify the excise goods to which this Directive applies and to refer for that purpose to Council Directive 92/79/EEC of 19 October 1992 on the approximation of taxes on cigarettes (4), Council Directive 92/80/EEC of 19 October 1992 on the approximation of taxes on manufactured tobacco other than cigarettes (5), Council Directive 92/83/EEC of 19 October 1992 on the harmonisation of the structures of excise duties on alcohol and alcoholic beverages (6), Council Directive 92/84/EEC of 19 October 1992 on the approximation of the rates of excise duty on alcohol and alcoholic beverages (7), Council Directive 95/59/EC of 27 November 1995 on taxes other than turnover taxes which affect the consumption of manufactured tobacco (8) and Council Directive 2003/96/EC of 27 October 2003 restructuring the Community framework for the taxation of energy products and electricity (9).\n(4)\nExcise goods may be subject to other indirect taxes for specific purposes. In such cases, however, and in order not to jeopardise the useful effect of Community rules relating to indirect taxes, Member States should comply with certain essential elements of those rules.\n(5)\nIn order to ensure free movement, taxation of goods other than excise goods should not give rise to formalities connected with the crossing of frontiers.\n(6)\nIt is necessary to ensure the application of formalities when excise goods are moving from the territories which are defined as being part of the customs territory of the Community but which are excluded from the scope of this Directive to territories which are also so defined but to which this Directive does apply.\n(7)\nSince suspensive procedures under Council Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 of 12 October 1992 establishing the Community Customs Code (10) provide for adequate monitoring whilst excise goods are subject to the provisions of that Regulation, there is no need for the separate application of an excise monitoring system for the time that the excise goods are subject to a Community customs suspensive procedure or arrangement.\n(8)\nSince it remains necessary for the proper functioning of the internal market that the concept, and conditions for chargeability, of excise duty be the same in all Member States, it is necessary to make clear at Community level when excise goods are released for consumption and who the person liable to pay the excise duty is.\n(9)\nSince excise duty is a tax on the consumption of certain goods, duty should not be charged in respect of excise goods which, under certain circumstances, have been destroyed or irretrievably lost.\n(10)\nArrangements for the collection and reimbursement of duty have an impact on the proper functioning of the internal market and should therefore follow non-discriminatory criteria.\n(11)\nIn the event of an irregularity, excise duty should be due in the Member State on whose territory the irregularity has been committed which has led to the release for consumption or, if it is not possible to establish where the irregularity has been committed, it should be due in the Member State where it has been detected. Where excise goods do not arrive at their destination and no irregularity has been detected, the irregularity shall be deemed to have occurred in the Member State of dispatch.\n(12)\nIn addition to the cases of reimbursement provided for in this Directive, Member States should be able, where the purpose of this Directive so allows, to reimburse excise duty paid on excise goods released for consumption.\n(13)\nThe rules and conditions for the deliveries which are exempt from the payment of excise duty should remain harmonised. For the exempted deliveries to organisations situated in other Member States, use should be made of an exemption certificate.\n(14)\nThe situations in which tax-free sales to travellers leaving the territory of the Community are allowed should be clearly determined with a view to avoiding evasion and abuse. Since persons travelling over land can move more frequently and more freely as compared to persons travelling by boat or aircraft, the risk of non-respect of the duty and tax free import allowances by the traveller and consequently the control burden for the customs authorities is substantially higher in the case of travel over land. It is therefore appropriate to provide that excise duty-free sales at land borders should not be allowed, as is already the case in most Member States. A transitional period should however be provided for during which Member States are authorised to continue to exempt from excise duty goods supplied by existing tax-free shops situated at their land border with a third country.\n(15)\nSince checks need to be carried out in production and storage facilities in order to ensure that the tax debt is collected, it is necessary to retain a system of warehouses, subject to authorisation by the competent authorities, for the purpose of facilitating such checks.\n(16)\nIt is also necessary to lay down requirements to be complied with by authorised warehousekeepers and traders without authorised warehousekeeper status.\n(17)\nIt should be possible for excise goods, prior to their release for consumption, to move within the Community under suspension of excise duty. Such movement should be allowed from a tax warehouse to various destinations, in particular another tax warehouse but also to places equivalent for the purposes of this Directive.\n(18)\nThe movement of excise goods under suspension of duty should also be allowed from their place of importation to those destinations and accordingly provision should be made with regard to the status of the person allowed to dispatch, but not allowed to hold, the goods from that place of importation.\n(19)\nIn order to safeguard the payment of excise duty in a case of non-discharge of the excise movement, Member States should require a guarantee, which should be lodged by the authorised warehousekeeper of dispatch or the registered consignor or, if the Member State of dispatch so allows, by another person involved in the movement, under the conditions set by the Member States.\n(20)\nIt is necessary, in order to ensure the collection of taxes at the rates laid down by Member States, for the competent authorities to be in a position to follow the movements of excise goods and provision should therefore be made for a monitoring system for such goods.\n(21)\nFor that purpose, it is appropriate to use the computerised system established by Decision No 1152/2003/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 June 2003 on computerising the movement and surveillance of excisable products (11). Use of that system, as opposed to a paper-based system, accelerates the necessary formalities and facilitates the monitoring of movement of excise goods under suspension of excise duty.\n(22)\nIt is appropriate to lay down the procedure by which traders inform the tax authorities of the Member States of consignments of excise goods dispatched or received. Due regard should be had to the situation of certain consignees not connected to the computerised system but who may receive excise goods moving under suspension of duty.\n(23)\nIn order to ensure the proper functioning of the rules relating to movement under suspension of excise duty, the conditions for the start of the movement as well as the end, and the discharge of responsibilities, should be clarified.\n(24)\nIt is necessary to determine the procedures to be used in a case in which the computerised system is not available.\n(25)\nMember States should be allowed to provide a special arrangement for the movement of excise goods under suspension of duty which takes place entirely on their territory, or conclude bilateral agreements with other Member States to allow simplification.\n(26)\nIt is appropriate to clarify the taxation and procedural rules relating to the movement of goods on which excise duty has already been paid in a Member State without changing their general structure.\n(27)\nWhere excise goods are acquired by private individuals for their own use and transported from one Member State to another by them, excise duty should be paid in the Member State in which the goods are acquired, in accordance with the principle governing the internal market.\n(28)\nIn cases where, following their release for consumption in a Member State, excise goods are held for commercial purposes in another Member State, it is necessary to establish that excise duty is due in the second Member State. For these purposes, it is necessary, in particular, to define the concept of ‘commercial purposes’.\n(29)\nWhere excise goods are acquired by persons who are not authorised warehousekeepers or registered consignees and do not carry out an independent economic activity, and are dispatched or transported directly or indirectly by the vendor or on his behalf, excise duty should be paid in the Member State of destination and provision should be made for a procedure to be followed by the vendor.\n(30)\nIn order to avoid conflicts of interest between Member States and double taxation in cases in which excise goods already released for consumption in one Member State move within the Community, provision should be made for situations in which excise goods, following their release for consumption, are subject to irregularities.\n(31)\nMember States should be able to provide that goods released for consumption carry tax markings or national identification marks. The use of these markings or marks should not place any obstacle in the way of intra-Community trade.\nSince the use of these markings or marks should not give rise to a double taxation burden, it should be made clear that any amount paid or guaranteed to obtain such markings or marks is to be reimbursed, remitted or released by the Member State which issued the marks if excise duty has become chargeable and has been collected in another Member State.\nHowever, in order to prevent any abuse, Member States which issued such markings or marks should be able to make reimbursement, remittance or release conditional on the presentation of evidence that they have been removed or destroyed.\n(32)\nApplication of the normal requirements relating to the movement and monitoring of excise goods could put a disproportionate administrative burden on small wine producers. Therefore, Member States should be able to exempt those producers from certain requirements.\n(33)\nAccount should be taken of the fact that, with regard to excise goods used as stores for boats and aircraft, no suitable common approach has yet been found.\n(34)\nWith respect to excise goods used for the construction and maintenance of cross-border bridges between Member States, those Member States should be allowed to adopt measures derogating from the normal rules and procedures applying to excise goods moving from one Member State to another, in order to reduce the administrative burden.\n(35)\nMeasures for the implementation of this Directive should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission (12).\n(36)\nIn order to allow a period of adjustment to the electronic control system for the movement of goods under suspension of excise duty, Member States should be able to benefit from a transitional period during which such movement may continue to be carried out subject to the formalities laid down by Directive 92/12/EEC.\n(37)\nSince the objective of this Directive, namely ensuring common arrangements in relation to certain aspects of excise duty, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore, by reason of its scale and effects, be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Directive does not go beyond what is necessary to achieve that objective,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:\nCHAPTER I\nGENERAL PROVISIONS\nArticle 1\n1.   This Directive lays down general arrangements in relation to excise duty which is levied directly or indirectly on the consumption of the following goods (hereinafter ‘excise goods’):\n(a)\nenergy products and electricity covered by Directive 2003/96/EC;\n(b)\nalcohol and alcoholic beverages covered by Directives 92/83/EEC and 92/84/EEC;\n(c)\nmanufactured tobacco covered by Directives 95/59/EC, 92/79/EEC and 92/80/EEC.\n2.

Excise duty shall become chargeable at the time, and in the Member State, of release for consumption.\n2.   For the purposes of this Directive, ‘release for consumption’ shall mean any of the following:\n(a)\nthe departure of excise goods, including irregular departure, from a duty suspension arrangement;\n(b)\nthe holding of excise goods outside a duty suspension arrangement where excise duty has not been levied pursuant to the applicable provisions of Community law and national legislation;\n(c)\nthe production of excise goods, including irregular production, outside a duty suspension arrangement;\n(d)\nthe importation of excise goods, including irregular importation, unless the excise goods are placed, immediately upon importation, under a duty suspension arrangement.\n3.

Member States shall apply the same procedures to national goods and to those from other Member States.\nArticle 10\n1.   Where an irregularity has occurred during a movement of excise goods under a duty suspension arrangement, giving rise to their release for consumption in accordance with Article 7(2)(a), the release for consumption shall take place in the Member State where the irregularity occurred.\n2.   Where an irregularity has been detected during a movement of excise goods under a duty suspension arrangement, giving rise to their release for consumption in accordance with Article 7(2)(a), and it is not possible to determine where the irregularity occurred, it shall be deemed to have occurred in the Member State in which and at the time when the irregularity was detected.\n3.   In the situations referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2, the competent authorities of the Member States where the goods have been or are deemed to have been released for consumption shall inform the competent authorities of the Member State of dispatch.\n4.   Where excise goods moving under a duty suspension arrangement have not arrived at their destination and no irregularity giving rise to their release for consumption in accordance with Article 7(2)(a) has been detected during the movement, an irregularity shall be deemed to have occurred in the Member State of dispatch and at the time when the movement began, unless, within a period of four months from the start of the movement in accordance with Article 20(1), evidence is provided to the satisfaction of the competent authorities of the Member State of dispatch of the end of the movement in accordance with Article 20(2), or of the place where the irregularity occurred.\nWhere the person who guaranteed the payment in accordance with Article 18 has not been, or could not have been, informed that the goods have not arrived at their destination, a period of one month from the date of communication of this information by the competent authorities of the Member State of dispatch shall be granted to enable him to provide evidence of the end of the movement in accordance with Article 20(2), or of the place where the irregularity occurred.\n5.   However, in the situations referred to in paragraphs 2 and 4, if, before the expiry of a period of three years from the date on which the movement began, in accordance with Article 20(1), it is ascertained in which Member State the irregularity actually occurred, the provisions of paragraph 1 shall apply.\nIn these situations, the competent authorities of the Member State where the irregularity occurred shall inform the competent authorities of the Member State where the excise duty was levied, which shall reimburse or remit it as soon as evidence of the levying of the excise duty in the other Member State has been provided.\n6.   For the purposes of this Article, ‘irregularity’ shall mean a situation occurring during a movement of excise goods under a duty suspension arrangement, other than the one referred to in Article 7(4), due to which a movement, or a part of a movement of excise goods, has not ended in accordance with Article 20(2).\nSECTION 2\nReimbursement and remission\nArticle 11\nIn addition to the cases referred to in Article 33(6), Article 36(5), and Article 38(3), as well as those provided for by the Directives referred to in Article 1, excise duty on excise goods which have been released for consumption may, at the request of a person concerned, be reimbursed or remitted by the competent authorities of the Member State where those goods were released for consumption in the situations fixed by the Member States and in accordance with the conditions that Member States shall lay down for the purpose of preventing any possible evasion or abuse.\nSuch reimbursement or remission may not give rise to exemptions other than those provided for in Article 12 or by one of the Directives referred to in Article 1.\nSECTION 3\nExemptions\nArticle 12\n1.   Excise goods shall be exempted from payment of excise duty where they are intended to be used:\n(a)\nin the context of diplomatic or consular relations;\n(b)\nby international organisations recognised as such by the public authorities of the host Member State, and by members of such organisations, within the limits and under the conditions laid down by the international conventions establishing such organisations or by headquarters agreements;\n(c)\nby the armed forces of any State party to the North Atlantic Treaty other than the Member State within which the excise duty is chargeable, for the use of those forces, for the civilian staff accompanying them or for supplying their messes or canteens;\n(d)\nby the armed forces of the United Kingdom stationed in Cyprus pursuant to the Treaty of Establishment concerning the Republic of Cyprus dated 16 August 1960, for the use of those forces, for the civilian staff accompanying them or for supplying their messes or canteens;\n(e)\nfor consumption under an agreement concluded with third countries or international organisations provided that such an agreement is allowed or authorised with regard to exemption from value added tax.\n2.   Exemptions shall be subject to conditions and limitations laid down by the host Member State. Member States may grant the exemption by means of a refund of excise duty.\nArticle 13\n1.   Without prejudice to Article 21(1), excise goods moving under a duty suspension arrangement to a consignee referred to in Article 12(1) shall be accompanied by an exemption certificate.\n2.   The Commission shall, in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 43(2), lay down the form and content of the exemption certificate.\n3.   The procedure laid down in Articles 21 to 27 shall not apply to the movements of excise goods under a duty suspension arrangement to the armed forced referred to in Article 12(1)(c), if they are covered by a procedure which is directly based on the North Atlantic Treaty.\nHowever, Member States may provide that the procedure laid down in Articles 21 to 27 shall be used for such movements taking place entirely on their territory or, by agreement between the Member States concerned, between their territories.\nArticle 14\n1.   Member States may exempt from payment of excise duty excise goods supplied by tax-free shops which are carried away in the personal luggage of travellers to a third territory or to a third country taking a flight or sea-crossing.\n2.   Goods supplied on board an aircraft or ship during the flight or sea-crossing to a third territory or a third country shall be treated in the same way as goods supplied by tax-free shops.\n3.   Member States shall take the measures necessary to ensure that the exemptions provided for in paragraphs 1 and 2 are applied in such a way as to prevent any possible evasion, avoidance or abuse.\n4.   Member States which, at 1 July 2008, have tax-free shops situated elsewhere than within an airport or port may, until 1 January 2017, continue to exempt from excise duty excise goods supplied by such shops and carried away in the personal luggage of travellers to a third territory or to a third country.\n5.   For the purposes of this Article, the following definitions shall apply:\n(a)\n‘tax-free shop’ means any establishment situated within an airport or port which fulfils the conditions laid down by the competent authorities of the Member States, pursuant in particular to paragraph 3;\n(b)\n‘traveller to a third territory or to a third country’ means any passenger holding a transport document, for air or sea travel, stating that the final destination is an airport or port situated in a third territory or a third country.\nCHAPTER III\nPRODUCTION, PROCESSING AND HOLDING\nArticle 15\n1.   Each Member State shall determine its rules concerning the production, processing and holding of excise goods, subject to this Directive.\n2.   The production, processing and holding of excise goods, where the excise duty has not been paid, shall take place in a tax warehouse.\nArticle 16\n1.   The opening and operation of a tax warehouse by an authorised warehousekeeper shall be subject to authorisation by the competent authorities of the Member State where the tax warehouse is situated.\nSuch authorisation shall be subject to the conditions that the authorities are entitled to lay down for the purposes of preventing any possible evasion or abuse.\n2.   An authorised warehousekeeper shall be required to:\n(a)\nprovide, if necessary, a guarantee to cover the risk inherent in the production, processing and holding of excise goods;\n(b)\ncomply with the requirements laid down by the Member State within whose territory the tax warehouse is situated;\n(c)\nkeep, for each tax warehouse, accounts of stock and movements of excise goods;\n(d)\nenter into his tax warehouse and enter in his accounts at the end of their movement all excise goods moving under a duty suspension arrangement, except where Article 17(2) applies;\n(e)\nconsent to all monitoring and stock checks.\nThe conditions for the guarantee referred to in point (a) shall be set by the competent authorities of the Member State in which the tax warehouse is authorised.\nCHAPTER IV\nMOVEMENT OF EXCISE GOODS UNDER SUSPENSION OF EXCISE DUTY\nSECTION 1\nGeneral provisions\nArticle 17\n1.   Excise goods may be moved under a duty suspension arrangement within the territory of the Community, including where the goods are moved via a third country or a third territory:\n(a)\nfrom a tax warehouse to:\n(i)\nanother tax warehouse;\n(ii)\na registered consignee;\n(iii)\na place where the excise goods leave the territory of the Community, as referred to in Article 25(1);\n(iv)\na consignee referred to in Article 12(1), where the goods are dispatched from another Member State;\n(b)\nfrom the place of importation to any of the destinations referred to in point (a), where the goods are dispatched by a registered consignor.\nFor the purposes of this Article, ‘place of importation’ means the place where the goods are when they are released for free circulation in accordance with Article 79 of Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92.\n2.

Paragraphs 1 and 2 shall also apply to movements of excise goods at a zero rate which have not been released for consumption.\nArticle 18\n1.   The competent authorities of the Member State of dispatch, under the conditions fixed by them, shall require that the risks inherent in the movement under suspension of excise duty be covered by a guarantee provided by the authorised warehousekeeper of dispatch or the registered consignor.\n2.

In the cases referred to in Article 17(1)(a)(iii) and, where applicable, Article 17(1)(b) of this Directive, a report of export shall be completed by the competent authorities of the Member State of export on the basis of the endorsement drawn up by the customs office of exit as referred to in Article 793(2) of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93 of 2 July 1993 laying down provisions for the implementation of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 establishing the Community Customs Code (13) or by the office where the formalities referred to in Article 3(2) of this Directive are accomplished, certifying that the excise goods have left the territory of the Community.\n2.   The competent authorities of the Member State of export shall carry out an electronic verification of the data resulting from the endorsement referred to in paragraph 1. Once these data have been verified, and where the Member State of dispatch is different from the Member State of export, the competent authorities of the Member State of export shall send the report of export to the competent authorities of the Member State of dispatch.\n3.   The competent authorities of the Member State of dispatch shall forward the report of export to the consignor.\nArticle 26\n1.

A copy of the paper document referred to in paragraph 1(a) shall be kept by the consignor to back up his records.\n5.   Where the computerised system is unavailable in the Member State of dispatch, the consignor shall communicate the information referred to in Article 21(8) or Article 23 using alternative means of communication. To that end, he shall inform the competent authorities of the Member State of dispatch before the change of destination or splitting of the movement is initiated.

The person liable to pay the excise duty is generally the authorised warehouse keeper or the registered consignee.\nMember States:\nmay remit or refund excise duty on excise goods that have been released for consumption;\nare free to fix the relevant conditions, including their tax rates, as long as: the taxes are higher than the rates set by the EU,this does not create a new class of exemption (see next paragraph).\nExcise goods are exempted from payment of excise duty where they are intended to be used:\nin the context of diplomatic or consular relations;\nby international organisations;\nby the armed forces of any NATO country other than the Member State within which the excise duty is chargeable;\nby the British armed forces stationed in Cyprus;\nunder an agreement concluded with non-EU countries or international organisations.\nMember States may also exempt from payment of excise duty, excise goods supplied by tax-free shops that are carried in the personal luggage of travellers to a non-EU country by flight or sea crossing.\nProduction, processing and holding\nEach Member State sets rules concerning the production, processing and holding of excise goods defined by the directive. Where the excise duty has not yet been paid, the production, processing and holding of excise goods must take place in a tax warehouse.\nMovement of excise goods under suspension of excise duty\nWhen excise goods are under a ‘duty suspension arrangement’, the excise duty is being suspended from the production, processing, holding or movement of excise goods.\nExcise goods may be moved, under a duty suspension arrangement within the EU, from a tax warehouse or from a place of importation to:\nanother tax warehouse;\na registered consignee;\na place of exportation from the EU; or\na beneficiary of the exemption from excise duty referred to above (diplomatic or consular relations, international organisations, armed forces, etc.).\nA movement of excise goods must in principle take place under cover of an electronic administrative document as specified in Regulation (EC) No 684/2009, most recently amended by Implementing Regulation (EU) 2021/2265.\nThe competent authorities of the Member State of dispatch may ask the authorised warehouse keeper or registered consignor for a guarantee that covers the risks inherent to the movement under suspension of excise duty. In principle, the guarantee can be provided by another party.\nThe guarantee is valid throughout the EU while the detailed rules are laid down by the Member States.\nMovements and taxation of excise goods after release for consumption\nWhen excise goods are released for consumption, it means that the excise goods:\nhave left a duty suspension arrangement;\nare being held outside a duty suspension arrangement where excise duty has not been levied pursuant to the applicable provisions of EU law and national legislation;\nare being produced outside a duty suspension arrangement;\nare imported, unless they are placed, immediately upon importation, under a duty suspension arrangement.\nExcise duties on goods acquired by a private individual for their own personal use and transported from one Member State to another by them may be charged only in the Member State in which the goods were acquired. To determine whether the excise goods are intended for a private individual, Member States take account of:\nthe commercial status of the holder of the goods;\nthe place where the goods are located;\nany document relating to the goods;\nthe nature of the goods;\nthe quantity of the goods.\nWhere excise goods intended for consumption in a Member State are held for commercial purposes in another Member State, the goods are subject to the excise duties of the latter Member State. Excise duties paid in the first Member State may be reimbursed.\nIn the case of distance selling from one Member State to another, the vendor or his agent must pay excise duty in the Member State of destination.\nMember States may require that excise goods carry tax markings or national identification marks.\nRepeal\nDirective 2008/118/EC is repealed and replaced by Directive (EU) 2020/262 (see summary) from 13 February 2023.\nFROM WHEN DOES THE DIRECTIVE APPLY?\n              \nIt has applied since 15 January 2009 and had to become law in the Member States by 2010.\nBACKGROUND\n              \nFor further information, see:\nCommon excise duty provisions (European Commission).\nMAIN DOCUMENT\n            \nCouncil Directive 2008/118/EC of 16 December 2008 concerning the general arrangements for excise duty and repealing Directive 92/12/EEC (OJ L 9, 14.1.2009, pp. 12–30).\nSuccessive amendments and changes to Directive 2008/118/EC have been incorporated in the original text.
