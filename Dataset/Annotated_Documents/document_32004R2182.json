Euro coins, following their introduction in January 2002, circulate throughout the euro area as sole legal tender in metallic form.\n(3)\nCommission Recommendation 2002/664/EC of 19 August 2002 concerning medals and tokens similar to the euro coins (4) recommended that certain visual characteristics should be avoided in the sale and production, stocking, importation and distribution, for sale or for other commercial purposes, of medals and tokens whose size is close to that of euro coins.\n(4)\nThe Commission Communication of 23 July 1997 on the use of the euro symbol established the symbol ‘€’ and called upon all currency users to use the symbol for the description of monetary amounts denominated in euro.\n(5)\nThe Commission communication of 22 October 2001 on copyright protection of the common face design of the euro coins (5) defined the arrangements to be applied for the reproduction of the common face design of euro coins.\n(6)\nThe visual characteristics of the euro coins were published by the Commission on 28 December 2001 (6).\n(7)\nCitizens may be led to believe that medals and tokens bearing the terms ‘euro’ or ‘euro cent’, the euro symbol, or a design similar to that which appears on the common face or on any of the national sides of the euro coins, have legal-tender status in any of the Member States that have adopted the euro, or in a participating third country.\n(8)\nThere is an increasing risk that medals and tokens having a size and metal properties similar to euro coins may be unlawfully used in the place of euro coins.\n(9)\nIt is therefore appropriate that medals and tokens having visual characteristics, size or metal properties which are similar to euro coins should not be sold, produced, imported or distributed for the purpose of sale or for other commercial purposes.\n(10)\nIt is for each Member State to introduce applicable sanctions for infringements, with a view to achieving an equivalent protection of the euro against similar medals and tokens throughout the Community.\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nArticle 1\nDefinitions\nFor the purposes of this Regulation the following definitions shall apply:\n(a)\n‘euro’ means the legal currency of participating Member States as defined in Article 1 of Regulation (EC) No 974/98 and of those participating third countries which have concluded an agreement with the Community on the introduction of the euro (hereinafter referred to as participating third countries);\n(b)\n‘euro symbol’ means the symbol representing the euro ‘€’ as shown and described in Annex I;\n(c)\n‘medals and tokens’ means those metallic objects, other than blanks intended for striking coins, which have the appearance and/or technical properties of a coin but are not issued under national or participating third country legislative provisions or other foreign legislative provisions, and which therefore are neither a legal means of payment nor legal tender;\n(d)\n‘gold’, ‘silver’ and ‘platinum’ mean alloys containing gold, silver and platinum with a millesimal fineness in weight of at least 375, 500 and 850 respectively. This definition shall not concern hallmarking conventions applicable in Member States;\n(e)\n‘European Technical and Scientific Centre’ (hereinafter referred to as ETSC) means the entity established by the Commission Decision of 29 October 2004;\n(f)\n‘reference band’ shall have the meaning given to it in Section 1 of Annex II.\nArticle 2\nProtective provisions\nSubject to Articles 3 and 4, the production and sale of medals and tokens, and their importation and distribution for sale or for other commercial purposes, shall be prohibited in the following circumstances:\n(a)\nwhen the terms ‘euro’ or ‘euro cent’ or the euro symbol appear on their surface; or\n(b)\nwhen their size is inside the reference band; or\n(c)\nwhen any design appearing on the surface of medals and tokens is similar to any of the national obverse designs or to the common reverse face of euro coins, or is identical or similar to the edge design of the two-euro coin.\nArticle 3\nExemptions\n1.   Medals and tokens bearing the terms ‘euro’ or ‘euro cent’ or the euro symbol without an associated nominal value shall not be prohibited when their size is outside the reference band.\n2.   Medals and tokens whose size is inside the reference band shall not be prohibited when:\n(a)\nthey are pierced with a hole of over 6 millimetres in the centre, or when their shape is polygonal but not exceeding six edges, provided the condition under point (c)(ii) is respected; or\n(b)\nthey are made of gold or silver or platinum; or\n(c)\nwhen they fulfil the following conditions:\n(i)\nthe combinations of diameter and edge height of medals and tokens are consistently outside the ranges defined in each of the cases specified in Section 2 of Annex II; and\n(ii)\nthe combinations of diameter and metal properties of medals and tokens are consistently outside the ranges defined in each of the cases specified in Section 3 of Annex II.\nArticle 4\nDerogations by authorisation\n1.   The Commission may grant specific authorisations to use the terms ‘euro’ or ‘euro cent’ or the euro symbol under controlled conditions of utilisation in cases where no risk of confusion exists. In such cases, the economic operator concerned within a Member State shall be clearly identifiable on the surface of the medal or token and the indication ‘Not legal tender’ must be stamped on the obverse or the reverse of the medal or token.\n2.   The Commission shall be competent to declare whether a design is ‘similar’ within the meaning of Article 2(c).\nArticle 5\nExisting medals and tokens\nMedals and tokens issued before the entry into force of this Regulation which do not satisfy the conditions set out in Articles 2, 3 and 4 may continue to be used until the end of the year 2009, at the latest, unless they are capable of being used in place of euro coins. Those medals and tokens shall be recorded, if appropriate, according to the procedures applicable in the Member States and communicated to the ETSC.\nArticle 6\nSanctions\n1.   Member States shall lay down the rules on sanctions applicable to infringements of the provisions of this Regulation and shall take all measures necessary to ensure that they are implemented. The sanctions provided for must be effective, proportionate and dissuasive.\n2.   Member States shall adopt by 1 July 2005 the laws, regulations and administrative provisions for applying this Article. They shall forthwith inform the Commission thereof.\nArticle 7\nApplicability\nThis Regulation shall apply in the participating Member States as defined in Regulation (EC) No 974/98.\nArticle 8\nEntry into force\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on the day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in the Member States in accordance with the Treaty establishing the European Community.\nDone at Brussels, 6 December 2004.\nFor the Council\nThe President\nH.

Not only could such medals and tokens be mistaken for legal tender (accepted if offered in payment like coins or notes), they could also be used illegally instead of euro coins.\nFor the purposes of the regulation, medals and tokens are defined as metallic objects that have the appearance and/or technical properties of euro coins, but that are not issued under national or participating non-EU country legislative measures or other foreign legislative measures and that therefore are neither a legal means of payment nor legal tender.\nThe regulation prohibits the production, sale, importation and distribution (for sale or for other commercial purposes) of medals and tokens having visual characteristics or properties similar to the single currency.\nMedals and tokens must not bear\nthe term ‘euro’ or ‘euro cent’ or\nthe euro symbol on their surface.\nThey also may not include\nany design similar to designs depicted on euro coins,\nsymbols representing the sovereignty of European Union (EU) countries,\nthe edge shape or design of euro coins or the euro symbol.\nLastly, medals and tokens must not be of the same size as euro coins. The European Commission is to specify whether a metallic object is a medal or token and whether the prohibitions of this regulation apply.\nMedals and tokens bearing the term ‘euro’ or ‘euro cent’ or the euro symbol without an associated nominal value are allowed, provided that their size is sufficiently different from that of euro coins and that they do not include a design similar to the designs and symbols listed above. If, however, they are very similar in size, they must either have a hole in their centre or form a polygon of not more than six edges, or be made of gold, silver or platinum, or be consistently outside the ranges specified.\nThe Commission may grant specific authorisations to use the term ‘euro’ or ‘euro cent’ or the euro symbol where there is no risk of confusion. In such cases, the economic operator concerned within an EU country must be clearly identifiable on the surface of the medal or token.\nIf the medal or token also bears an associated nominal value, the indication ‘not legal tender’ must be stamped on its obverse or reverse side in addition.\nThe denominations and technical specifications of euro coins, the only coinage having legal tender in the euro area, are laid down in Council Regulation (EU) No 729/2014.\nMedals and tokens issued before the entry into force of the regulation could be used until the end of 2009, provided that they were not used instead of euro coins. Such medals and tokens must be recorded in accordance with the procedures applicable in EU countries and communicated to the European Technical and Scientific Centre.\nThis regulation is applicable in all EU countries that introduced the euro in 2002 (Austria, Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Portugal and Spain). Its scope is extended by Regulation (EC) No 2183/2004, as amended by Regulation (EC) No 47/2009, to EU countries that have not yet introduced the euro . EU countries had to lay down and implement rules on sanctions applicable to infringements of the regulation by 1 July 2005.\nFROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?\n              \nIt has applied since 21 December 2004.\nMAIN DOCUMENT\n            \nCouncil Regulation (EC) No 2182/2004 of 6 December 2004 concerning medals and tokens similar to euro coins (OJ L 373, 21.12.2004, pp. 1-6)\nSuccessive amendments to Regulation (EC) No 2182/2004 have been incorporated in to the original document.
