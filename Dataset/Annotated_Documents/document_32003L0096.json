{"celex_id": "32003L0096", "reference": "31.10.2003\nEN\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\nL 283/51\nCOUNCIL DIRECTIVE 2003/96/EC\nof 27 October 2003\nrestructuring the Community framework for the taxation of energy products and electricity\n(Text with EEA relevance)\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 93 thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the Commission,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European Parliament,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee,\nWhereas:\n(1)\nThe scope of Council Directive 92/81/EEC of 19 October 1992 on the harmonisation of the structures of excise duties on mineral oils (1) and of Council Directive 92/82/EEC of 19 October 1992 on the approximation of the rates of excise duties on mineral oils (2) is restricted to mineral oils.\n(2)\nThe absence of Community provisions imposing a minimum rate of taxation on electricity and energy products other than mineral oils may adversely affect the proper functioning of the internal market.\n(3)\nThe proper functioning of the internal market and the achievement of the objectives of other Community policies require minimum levels of taxation to be laid down at Community level for most energy products, including electricity, natural gas and coal.\n(4)\nAppreciable differences in the national levels of energy taxation applied by Member States could prove detrimental to the proper functioning of the internal market.\n(5)\nThe establishment of appropriate Community minimum levels of taxation may enable existing differences in the national levels of taxation to be reduced.\n(6)\nIn accordance with Article 6 of the Treaty, environmental protection requirements must be integrated into the definition and implementation of other Community policies.\n(7)\nAs a party to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, the Community has ratified the Kyoto Protocol. The taxation of energy products and, where appropriate, electricity is one of the instruments available for achieving the Kyoto Protocol objectives.\n(8)\nThe Council needs to examine the exemptions and reductions and the minimum levels of taxation periodically, taking into consideration the proper functioning of the internal market, the real value of the minimum levels of taxation, the competitiveness of Community businesses in the international framework and the wider objectives of the Treaty.\n(9)\nMember States should be given the flexibility necessary to define and implement policies appropriate to their national circumstances.\n(10)\nMember States wish to introduce or retain different types of taxation on energy products and electricity. To that end, Member States should be permitted to comply with the Community minimum taxation levels by taking into account the total charge levied in respect of all indirect taxes which they have chosen to apply (excluding VAT).\n(11)\nFiscal arrangements made in connection with the implementation of this Community framework for the taxation of energy products and electricity are a matter for each Member State to decide. In this regard, Member States might decide not to increase the overall tax burden if they consider that the implementation of such a principle of tax neutrality could contribute to the restructuring and the modernisation of their tax systems by encouraging behaviour conducive to greater protection of the environment and increased labour use.\n(12)\nEnergy prices are key elements of Community energy, transport and environment policies.\n(13)\nTaxation partly determines the price of energy products and electricity.\n(14)\nThe minimum levels of taxation should reflect the competitive position of the different energy products and electricity. It would be advisable in this connection to base the calculation of these minimum levels as far as possible on the energy content of the products. However, this method should not be applied to motor fuels.\n(15)\nThe possibility of applying differentiated national rates of taxation to the same product should be allowed in certain circumstances or permanent conditions, provided that Community minimum levels of taxation and internal market and competition rules are respected.\n(16)\nAs heat is only subject to very limited intra-Community trade, output taxation of heat should remain outside the scope of this Community framework.\n(17)\nIt is necessary to establish different Community minimum levels of taxation according to the use of the energy products and electricity.\n(18)\nEnergy products used as a motor fuel for certain industrial and commercial purposes and those used as heating fuel are normally taxed at lower levels than those applicable to energy products used as a propellant.\n(19)\nThe taxation of diesel motor fuel used by hauliers, notably those engaging in intra-Community activities, requires a possibility for a specific treatment, including measures to allow for the introduction of a system of road user charges, in order to limit the distortion of competition operators might be confronted with.\n(20)\nMember States may need to differentiate between commercial and non-commercial diesel. Member States may use this possibility to reduce the gap between the taxation of non-commercial gas oil used as propellant and petrol.\n(21)\nBusiness use and non-business use of energy products and electricity may be treated differently for tax purposes.\n(22)\nEnergy products should essentially be subject to a Community framework when used as heating fuel or motor fuel. To that extent, it is in the nature and the logic of the tax system to exclude from the scope of the framework dual uses and non-fuel uses of energy products as well as mineralogical processes. Electricity used in similar ways should be treated on an equal footing.\n(23)\nExisting international obligations and the maintaining of the competitive position of Community companies make it advisable to continue the exemptions of energy products supplied for air navigation and sea navigation, other than for private pleasure purposes, while it should be possible for Member States to limit these exemptions.\n(24)\nMember States should be permitted to apply certain other exemptions or reduced levels of taxation, where that will not be detrimental to the proper functioning of the internal market and will not result in distortions of competition.\n(25)\nIn particular, combined heat and power generation and, in order to promote the use of alternative energy sources, renewable forms of energy may qualify for preferential treatment.\n(26)\nIt is desirable to establish a Community framework to allow Member States to exempt or reduce excise duties so as to promote biofuels, thereby contributing to the better functioning of the internal market and affording Member States and economic operators a sufficient degree of legal certainty. Distortions of competition should be limited and the incentive of a reduction in the basic costs for producers and distributors of biofuels should be maintained through, inter alia, the adjustments by Member States taking into account changes in raw material prices.\n(27)\nThis Directive shall be without prejudice to the application of the relevant provisions of Council Directive 92/12/EEC of 25 February 1992 on the general arrangements for products subject to excise duty and on the holding, movement and monitoring of such products (3), and Council Directive 92/83/EEC of 19 October 1992 on the harmonization of the structures of excise duties on alcohol and alcoholic beverages (4), when the product intended for use, offered for sale or used as motor fuel or fuel additive is ethyl alcohol as defined in Directive 92/83/EEC.\n(28)\nCertain exemptions or reductions in the tax level may prove necessary; notably because of the lack of a stronger harmonisation at Community level, because of the risks of a loss of international competitiveness or because of social or environmental considerations.\n(29)\nBusinesses entering into agreements to significantly enhance environmental protection and energy efficiency deserve attention; among these businesses, energy intensive ones merit specific treatment.\n(30)\nTransitional periods and arrangements may be required in order to allow Member States to smoothly adapt to the new levels of taxation, thus limiting possible negative side effects.\n(31)\nIt is necessary to provide for a procedure authorising the introduction by Member States, for a set period, of other exemptions or reduced levels of taxation. Such exemptions or reductions should be under regular review.\n(32)\nProvision should be made for the Member States to notify the Commission of certain national measures. Such notification does not release Member States from the obligation, laid down in Article 88(3) of the Treaty, to notify certain national measures. This Directive does not prejudice the outcome of any future State aid procedure that may be undertaken in accordance with Articles 87 and 88 of the Treaty.\n(33)\nThe scope of Directive 92/12/EEC should, where appropriate, be extended to the products and indirect taxes covered by this Directive.\n(34)\nThe measures necessary for the implementation of this Directive should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission (5),\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:\nArticle 1\nMember States shall impose taxation on energy products and electricity in accordance with this Directive.\nArticle 2\n1.   For the purposes of this Directive, the term ‘energy products’ shall apply to products:\n(a)\nfalling within CN codes 1507 to 1518, if these are intended for use as heating fuel or motor fuel;\n(b)\nfalling within CN codes 2701, 2702 and 2704 to 2715;\n(c)\nfalling within CN codes 2901 and 2902;\n(d)\nfalling within CN code 2905 11 00, which are not of synthetic origin, if these are intended for use as heating fuel or motor fuel;\n(e)\nfalling within CN code 3403;\n(f)\nfalling within CN code 3811;\n(g)\nfalling within CN code 3817;\n(h)\nfalling within CN code 3824 90 99 if these are intended for use as heating fuel or motor fuel.\n2.   This Directive shall also apply to:\nElectricity falling within CN code 2716.\n3.   When intended for use, offered for sale or used as motor fuel or heating fuel, energy products other than those for which a level of taxation is specified in this Directive shall be taxed according to use, at the rate for the equivalent heating fuel or motor fuel.\nIn addition to the taxable products listed in paragraph 1, any product intended for use, offered for sale or used as motor fuel, or as an additive or extender in motor fuels, shall be taxed at the rate for the equivalent motor fuel.\nIn addition to the taxable products listed in paragraph 1, any other hydrocarbon, except for peat, intended for use, offered for sale or used for heating purposes shall be taxed at the rate for the equivalent energy product.\n4.   This Directive shall not apply to:\n(a)\noutput taxation of heat and the taxation of products falling within CN-codes 4401 and 4402;\n(b)\nthe following uses of energy products and electricity:\n—\nenergy products used for purposes other than as motor fuels or as heating fuels,\n—\ndual use of energy products\nAn energy product has a dual use when it is used both as heating fuel and for purposes other than as motor fuel and heating fuel. The use of energy products for chemical reduction and in electrolytic and metallurgical processes shall be regarded as dual use,\n—\nelectricity used principally for the purposes of chemical reduction and in electrolytic and metallurgical processes,\n—\nelectricity, when it accounts for more than 50 % of the cost of a product. ‘Cost of a product’ shall mean the addition of total purchases of goods and services plus personnel costs plus the consumption of fixed capital, at the level of the business, as defined in Article 11. This cost is calculated per unit on average. ‘Cost of electricity’ shall mean the actual purchase value of electricity or the cost of production of electricity if it is generated in the business,\n—\nmineralogical processes\n‘Mineralogical processes’ shall mean the processes classified in the NACE nomenclature under code DI 26 ‘manufacture of other non-metallic mineral products’ in Council Regulation (EEC) No 3037/90 of 9 October 1990 on the statistical classification of economic activities in the European Community (6).\nHowever, Article 20 shall apply to these energy products.\n5.   References in this Directive to codes of the combined nomenclature shall be to those of Commission Regulation (EC) No 2031/2001 of 6 August 2001, amending Annex I to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2658/87 on the tariff and statistical nomenclature and on the Common Customs Tariff (7).\nA Decision to update the codes of the combined nomenclature for the products referred to in this Directive shall be taken once every year in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 27. The Decision must not result in any changes in the minimum tax rates applied in this Directive or to the addition or removal of any energy products and electricity.\nArticle 3\nReferences in Directive 92/12/EEC to ‘mineral oils’ and ‘excise duty’, insofar as it applies to mineral oils, shall be interpreted as covering all energy products, electricity and national indirect taxes referred to respectively in Articles 2 and 4(2) of this Directive.\nArticle 4\n1.   The levels of taxation which Member States shall apply to the energy products and electricity listed in Article 2 may not be less than the minimum levels of taxation prescribed by this Directive.\n2.   For the purpose of this Directive ‘level of taxation’ is the total charge levied in respect of all indirect taxes (except VAT) calculated directly or indirectly on the quantity of energy products and electricity at the time of release for consumption.\nArticle 5\nProvided that they respect the minimum levels of taxation prescribed by this Directive and that they are compatible with Community law, differentiated rates of taxation may be applied by Member States, under fiscal control, in the following cases:\n—\nwhen the differentiated rates are directly linked to product quality;\n—\nwhen the differentiated rates depend on quantitative consumption levels for electricity and energy products used for heating purposes;\n—\nfor the following uses: local public passenger transport (including taxis), waste collection, armed forces and public administration, disabled people, ambulances;\n—\nbetween business and non-business use, for energy products and electricity referred to in Articles 9 and 10.\nArticle 6\nMember States shall be free to give effect to the exemptions or reductions in the level of taxation prescribed by this Directive either:\n(a)\ndirectly,\n(b)\nby means of a differentiated rate,\nor\n(c)\nby refunding all or part of the amount of taxation.\nArticle 7\n1.   As from 1 January 2004 and from 1 January 2010, the minimum levels of taxation applicable to motor fuels shall be fixed as set out in Annex I Table A.\nNot later than 1 January 2012, the Council, acting unanimously after consulting the European Parliament, shall, on the basis of a report and a proposal from the Commission, decide upon the minimum levels of taxation applicable to gas oil for a further period beginning on 1 January 2013.\n2.   Member States may differentiate between commercial and non-commercial use of gas oil used as propellant, provided that the Community minimum levels are observed and the rate for commercial gas oil used as propellant does not fall below the national level of taxation in force on 1 January 2003, notwithstanding any derogations for this use laid down in this Directive.\n3.   ‘Commercial gas oil used as propellant’ shall mean gas oil used as propellant for the following purposes:\n(a)\nthe carriage of goods for hire or reward, or on own account, by motor vehicles or articulated vehicle combinations intended exclusively for the carriage of goods by road and with a maximum permissible gross laden weight of not less than 7,5 tonnes;\n(b)\nthe carriage of passengers, whether by regular or occasional service, by a motor vehicle of category M2 or category M3, as defined in Council Directive 70/156/EEC of 6 February 1970 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the type-approval of motor vehicles and their trailers (8).\n4.   Notwithstanding paragraph 2, Member States which introduce a system of road user charges for motor vehicles or articulated vehicle combinations intended exclusively for the carriage of goods by road may apply a reduced rate on gas oil used by such vehicles, that goes below the national level of taxation in force on 1 January 2003, as long as the overall tax burden remains broadly equivalent, provided that the Community minimum levels are observed and that the national level of taxation in force on 1 January 2003 for gas oil used as propellant is at least twice as high as the minimum level of taxation applicable on 1 January 2004.\nArticle 8\n1.   As from 1 January 2004, notwithstanding Article 7, the minimum levels of taxation applicable to products used as motor fuel for the purposes set out in paragraph 2 shall be fixed as set out in Annex I Table B.\n2.   This Article shall apply to the following industrial and commercial purposes:\n(a)\nagricultural, horticultural or piscicultural works, and in forestry;\n(b)\nstationary motors;\n(c)\nplant and machinery used in construction, civil engineering and public works;\n(d)\nvehicles intended for use off the public roadway or which have not been granted authorisation for use mainly on the public roadway.\nArticle 9\n1.   As from 1 January 2004, the minimum levels of taxation applicable to heating fuels shall be fixed as set out in Annex I Table C.\n2.   Member States, which on 1 January 2003 are authorised to apply a monitoring charge for heating gas oil, may continue to apply a reduced rate of EUR 10 per 1 000 litres for that product. This authorisation shall be repealed on 1 January 2007 if the Council, acting unanimously on the basis of a report and a proposal from the Commission, so decides, having noted that the level of the reduced rate is too low to avoid problems of trade distortion between the Member States.\nArticle 10\n1.   As from 1 January 2004, the minimum levels of taxation applicable to electricity shall be fixed as set out in Annex I Table C.\n2.   Above the minimum levels of taxation referred to in paragraph 1, Member States will have the option of determining the applicable tax base provided that they respect Directive 92/12/EEC.\nArticle 11\n1.   In this Directive, ‘business use’ shall mean the use by a business entity, identified in accordance with paragraph 2, which independently carries out, in any place, the supply of goods and services, whatever the purpose or results of such economic activities.\nThe economic activities comprise all activities of producers, traders and persons supplying services including mining and agricultural activities and activities of the professions.\nStates, regional and local government authorities and other bodies governed by public law shall not be considered as business entities in respect of the activities or transactions in which they engage as public authorities. However, when they engage in such activities or transactions, they shall be considered as a business in respect of these activities or transactions where treatment as non-business would lead to significant distortions of competition.\n2.   With respect to this Directive, the business entity cannot be considered as smaller than a part of an enterprise or a legal body that from an organisational point of view constitutes an independent business, that is to say an entity capable of functioning by its own means.\n3.   Where mixed use takes place, taxation shall apply in proportion to each type of use, although where either the business or non-business use is insignificant, it may be treated as nil.\n4.   Member States may limit the scope of the reduced level of taxation for business use.\nArticle 12\n1.   Member States may express their national levels of taxation in units other than those specified in Articles 7 to 10 provided that the corresponding levels of taxation, following conversion into those units, are not below the minimum levels specified in this Directive.\n2.   For energy products specified in Articles 7, 8 and 9, with levels of taxation based on volumes, the volume shall be measured at a temperature of 15° C.\nArticle 13\n1.   For Member States that have not adopted the euro, the value of the euro in national currencies to be applied to the value of the levels of taxation shall be fixed once a year. The rates to be applied shall be those obtaining on the first working day of October and published in the Official Journal of the European Union and shall have effect from 1 January of the following calendar year.\n2.   Member States may maintain the amounts of taxation in force at the time of the annual adjustment provided for in paragraph 1 if the conversion of the amounts of the level of taxation expressed in euro would result in an increase of less than 5 % or EUR 5, whichever is the lower amount, in the level of taxation expressed in national currency.\nArticle 14\n1.   In addition to the general provisions set out in Directive 92/12/EEC on exempt uses of taxable products, and without prejudice to other Community provisions, Member States shall exempt the following from taxation under conditions which they shall lay down for the purpose of ensuring the correct and straightforward application of such exemptions and of preventing any evasion, avoidance or abuse:\n(a)\nenergy products and electricity used to produce electricity and electricity used to maintain the ability to produce electricity. However, Member States may, for reasons of environmental policy, subject these products to taxation without having to respect the minimum levels of taxation laid down in this Directive. In such case, the taxation of these products shall not be taken into account for the purpose of satisfying the minimum level of taxation on electricity laid down in Article 10;\n(b)\nenergy products supplied for use as fuel for the purpose of air navigation other than in private pleasure-flying.\nFor the purposes of this Directive ‘private pleasure-flying’ shall mean the use of an aircraft by its owner or the natural or legal person who enjoys its use either through hire or through any other means, for other than commercial purposes and in particular other than for the carriage of passengers or goods or for the supply of services for consideration or for the purposes of public authorities.\nMember States may limit the scope of this exemption to supplies of jet fuel (CN code 2710 19 21);\n(c)\nenergy products supplied for use as fuel for the purposes of navigation within Community waters (including fishing), other than private pleasure craft, and electricity produced on board a craft.\nFor the purposes of this Directive ‘private pleasure craft’ shall mean any craft used by its owner or the natural or legal person who enjoys its use either through hire or through any other means, for other than commercial purposes and in particular other than for the carriage of passengers or goods or for the supply of services for consideration or for the purposes of public authorities.\n2.   Member States may limit the scope of the exemptions provided for in paragraph 1(b) and (c) to international and intra-Community transport. In addition, where a Member State has entered into a bilateral agreement with another Member State, it may also waive the exemptions provided for in paragraph 1(b) and (c). In such cases, Member States may apply a level of taxation below the minimum level set out in this Directive.\nArticle 15\n1.   Without prejudice to other Community provisions, Member States may apply under fiscal control total or partial exemptions or reductions in the level of taxation to:\n(a)\ntaxable products used under fiscal control in the field of pilot projects for the technological development of more environmentally-friendly products or in relation to fuels from renewable resources;\n(b)\nelectricity:\n—\nof solar, wind, wave, tidal or geothermal origin;\n—\nof hydraulic origin produced in hydroelectric installations;\n—\ngenerated from biomass or from products produced from biomass;\n—\ngenerated from methane emitted by abandoned coalmines;\n—\ngenerated from fuel cells;\n(c)\nenergy products and electricity used for combined heat and power generation;\n(d)\nelectricity produced from combined heat and power generation, provided that the combined generators are environmentally friendly. Member States may apply national definitions of ‘environmentally-friendly’ (or high efficiency) cogeneration production until the Council, on the basis of a report and a proposal from the Commission, unanimously adopts a common definition;\n(e)\nenergy products and electricity used for the carriage of goods and passengers by rail, metro, tram and trolley bus;\n(f)\nenergy products supplied for use as fuel for navigation on inland waterways (including fishing) other than in private pleasure craft, and electricity produced on board a craft;\n(g)\nnatural gas in Member States in which the share of natural gas in final energy consumption was less than 15 % in 2000;\nThe total or partial exemptions or reductions may apply for a maximum period of ten years after the entry into force of this Directive or until the national share of natural gas in final energy consumption reaches 25 %, whichever is the sooner. However, as soon as the national share of natural gas in final energy consumption reaches 20 %, the Member States concerned shall apply a strictly positive level of taxation, which shall increase on a yearly basis in order to reach at least the minimum rate at the end of the period referred to above.\nThe United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland may apply the total or partial exemptions or reductions for natural gas separately for Northern Ireland;\n(h)\nelectricity, natural gas, coal and solid fuels used by households and/or by organisations recognised as charitable by the Member State concerned. In the case of such charitable organisations, Member States may confine the exemption or reduction to use for the purpose of non-business activities. Where mixed use takes place, taxation shall apply in proportion to each type of use. If a use is insignificant, it may be treated as nil;\n(i)\nnatural gas and LPG used as propellants;\n(j)\nmotor fuels used in the field of the manufacture, development, testing and maintenance of aircraft and ships;\n(k)\nmotor fuels used for dredging operations in navigable waterways and in ports;\n(l)\nproducts falling within CN code 2705 used for heating purposes.\n2.   Member States may also refund to the producer some or all of the amount of tax paid by the consumer on electricity produced from products specified in paragraph 1(b).\n3.   Member States may apply a level of taxation down to zero to energy products and electricity used for agricultural, horticultural or piscicultural works, and in forestry.\nOn the basis of a proposal from the Commission, the Council shall before 1 January 2008 examine if the possibility of applying a level of taxation down to zero shall be repealed.\nArticle 16\n1.   Member States may, without prejudice to paragraph 5, apply an exemption or a reduced rate of taxation under fiscal control on the taxable products referred to in Article 2 where such products are made up of, or contain, one or more of the following products:\n—\nproducts falling within CN codes 1507 to 1518;\n—\nproducts falling within CN codes 3824 90 55 and 3824 90 80 to 3824 90 99 for their components produced from biomass;\n—\nproducts falling within CN codes 2207 20 00 and 2905 11 00 which are not of synthetic origin;\n—\nproducts produced from biomass, including products falling within CN codes 4401 and 4402.\nMember States may also apply a reduced rate of taxation under fiscal control on the taxable products referred to in Article 2 where such products contain water (CN codes 2201 and 2851 00 10).\n‘Biomass’ shall mean the biodegradable fraction of products, waste and residues from agriculture (including vegetal and animal substances), forestry and related industries, as well as the biodegradable fraction of industrial and municipal waste.\n2.   The exemption or reduction in taxation resulting from the application of the reduced rate laid down in paragraph 1 may not be greater than the amount of taxation payable on the volume of the products referred to in paragraph 1 present in the products eligible for the reduction.\nThe levels of taxation applied by Member States on the products made up of or containing the products referred to in paragraph 1 may be lower than the minimum levels specified in Article 4.\n3.   The exemption or reduction in taxation applied by Member States shall be adjusted to take account of changes in raw material prices to avoid over-compensating for the extra costs involved in the manufacture of the products referred to in paragraph 1.\n4.   Until 31 December 2003, Member States may exempt or continue to exempt products solely or almost solely made up of the products referred to in paragraph 1.\n5.   The exemption or reduction provided for the products referred to in paragraph 1 may be granted under a multiannual programme by means of an authorisation issued by an administrative authority to an economic operator for more than one calendar year. The exemption or reduction authorised may not be applied for a period of more than six consecutive years. This period may be renewed.\nAs part of a multiannual programme authorised by an administrative authority prior to 31 December 2012, Member States may apply the exemption or reduction under paragraph 1 after 31 December 2012 and until the end of the multiannual programme. The period may not be renewed.\n6.   Should Member States be required by Community law to comply with legally binding obligations to place on their markets a minimum proportion of the products referred to in paragraph 1, paragraphs 1 to 5 shall cease to apply as from the date when such obligations become binding on the Member States.\n7.   Member States shall communicate to the Commission the schedule of tax reductions or exemptions applied in accordance with this Article by 31 December 2004 and every 12 months thereafter.\n8.   No later than 31 December 2009, the Commission shall report to the Council on the fiscal, economic, agricultural, energy, industrial and environmental aspects of the reductions granted in accordance with this Article.\nArticle 17\n1.   Provided the minimum levels of taxation prescribed in this Directive are respected on average for each business, Member States may apply tax reductions on the consumption of energy products used for heating purposes or for the purposes of Article 8(2)(b) and (c) and on electricity in the following cases:\n(a)\nin favour of energy-intensive business\nAn ‘energy-intensive business’ shall mean a business entity, as referred to in Article 11, where either the purchases of energy products and electricity amount to at least 3,0 % of the production value or the national energy tax payable amounts to at least 0,5 % of the added value. Within this definition, Member States may apply more restrictive concepts, including sales value, process and sector definitions.\n‘Purchases of energy products and electricity’ shall mean the actual cost of energy purchased or generated within the business. Only electricity, heat and energy products that are used for heating purposes or for the purposes of Article 8(2)(b) and (c) are included. All taxes are included, except deductible VAT.\n‘Production value’ shall mean turnover, including subsidies directly linked to the price of the product, plus or minus the changes in stocks of finished products, work in progress and goods and services purchased for resale, minus the purchases of goods and services for resale.\n‘Value added’ shall mean the total turnover liable to VAT including export sales minus the total purchases liable to VAT including imports.\nMember States, which currently apply national energy tax systems in which energy-intensive businesses are defined according to criteria other than energy costs in comparison with production value and national energy tax payable in comparison with value added, shall be allowed a transitional period until no later than 1 January 2007 to adapt to the definition set out in point (a) first subparagraph;\n(b)\nwhere agreements are concluded with undertakings or associations of undertakings, or where tradable permit schemes or equivalent arrangements are implemented, as far as they lead to the achievement of environmental protection objectives or to improvements in energy efficiency.\n2.   Notwithstanding Article 4(1), Member States may apply a level of taxation down to zero to energy products and electricity as defined in Article 2, when used by energy-intensive businesses as defined in paragraph 1 of this Article.\n3.   Notwithstanding Article 4(1), Member States may apply a level of taxation down to 50 % of the minimum levels in this Directive to energy products and electricity as defined in Article 2, when used by business entities as defined in Article 11, which are not energy-intensive as defined in paragraph 1 of this Article.\n4.   Businesses that benefit from the possibilities referred to in paragraphs 2 and 3 shall enter into the agreements, tradable permit schemes or equivalent arrangements as referred to in paragraph 1(b). The agreements, tradable permit schemes or equivalent arrangements must lead to the achievement of environmental objectives or increased energy efficiency, broadly equivalent to what would have been achieved if the standard Community minimum rates had been observed.\nArticle 18\n1.   By way of derogation from the provisions of the present directive, Member States are hereby authorised to continue to apply the reductions in the levels of taxation or exemptions set out in Annex II.\nSubject to a prior review by the Council, on the basis of a proposal from the Commission, this authorisation shall expire on 31 December 2006 or on the date specified in Annex II.\n2.   Notwithstanding the periods set out in paragraphs 3 to 12 and provided that this does not significantly distort competition, Member States with difficulties in implementing the new minimum levels of taxation will be allowed a transitional period of until 1 January 2007, particularly in order to avoid jeopardising price stability.\n3.   The Kingdom of Spain may apply a transitional period until 1 January 2007 to adjust its national level of taxation on gas oil used as propellant to the new minimum level of EUR 302 and until 1 January 2012 to reach EUR 330. Until 31 December 2009, it may furthermore apply a special reduced rate on commercial use of gas oil used as propellant, provided that this does not result in taxation at below EUR 287 per 1 000 l and that the national levels of taxation in force on 1 January 2003 are not reduced. From 1 January 2010 until 1 January 2012, it may apply a differentiated rate on commercial use of gas oil used as propellant, provided that it does not result in taxation at below EUR 302 per 1 000 l and that the national levels of taxation in force on 1 January 2010 are not reduced. The special reduced rate on commercial use of gas oil used as propellant may also be applied for taxis until 1 January 2012. With respect to Article 7(3)(a), it may apply, until 1 January 2008, a maximum permissible gross laden weight of not less than 3,5 tonnes in the definition of commercial purposes.\n4.   The Republic of Austria may apply a transitional period until 1 January 2007 to adjust its national level of taxation on gas oil used as propellant to the new minimum level of EUR 302 and until 1 January 2012 to reach EUR 330.

In addition to the provisions set out in the previous Articles, in particular in Articles 5, 15 and 17, the Council, acting unanimously on a proposal from the Commission, may authorise any Member State to introduce further exemptions or reductions for specific policy considerations.\nA Member State wishing to introduce such a measure shall inform the Commission accordingly and shall also provide the Commission with all relevant and necessary information.\nThe Commission shall examine the request, taking into account, inter alia, the proper functioning of the internal market, the need to ensure fair competition and Community health, environment, energy and transport policies.\nWithin three months of receiving all relevant and necessary information, the Commission shall either present a proposal for the authorisation of such a measure by the Council or, alternatively, shall inform the Council of the reasons why it has not proposed the authorisation of such a measure.\n2.   The authorisations referred to in paragraph 1 shall be granted for a maximum period of 6 years, with the possibility of renewal in accordance with the procedure set out in paragraph 1.\n3.   If the Commission considers that the exemptions or reductions provided for in paragraph 1 are no longer sustainable, particularly in terms of fair competition or distortion of the operation of the internal market, or in terms of Community policy in the areas of health, protection of the environment, energy and transport, it shall submit appropriate proposals to the Council. The Council shall take a unanimous decision on these proposals.\nArticle 20\n1.   Only the following energy products shall be subject to the control and movement provisions of Directive 92/12/EEC:\n(a)\nproducts falling within CN codes 1507 to 1518, if these are intended for use as heating fuel or motor fuel;\n(b)\nproducts falling within CN codes 2707 10, 2707 20, 2707 30 and 2707 50;\n(c)\nproducts falling within CN codes 2710 11 to 2710 19 69. However, for products falling within CN codes 2710 11 21, 2710 11 25 and 2710 19 29, the control and movement provisions shall only apply to bulk commercial movements;\n(d)\nproducts falling within CN codes 2711 (except 2711 11, 2711 21 and 2711 29);\n(e)\nproducts falling within CN code 2901 10;\n(f)\nproducts falling within CN codes 2902 20, 2902 30, 2902 41, 2902 42, 2902 43 and 2902 44;\n(g)\nproducts falling within CN code 2905 11 00, which are not of synthetic origin, if these are intended for use as heating fuel or motor fuel;\n(h)\nproducts falling within CN code 3824 90 99 if these are intended for use as heating fuel or motor fuel.\n2.   If a Member State finds that energy products other than those referred to in paragraph 1 are intended for use, offered for sale or used as heating fuel, motor fuel or are otherwise giving rise to evasion, avoidance or abuse, it shall advise the Commission forthwith. This provision shall also apply for electricity. The Commission shall transmit the communication to the other Member States within one month of receipt. A Decision as to whether the products in question should be made subject to the control and movement provisions of Directive 92/12/EEC shall then be taken in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 27(2).\n3.   Member States may, pursuant to bilateral arrangements, dispense with some or all of the control measures set out in Directive 92/12/EEC in respect of some or all of the products referred to in paragraph 1, insofar as they are not covered by Articles 7 to 9 of this Directive. Such arrangements shall not affect Member States which are not party to them. All such bilateral arrangements shall be notified to the Commission, which shall inform the other Member States.\nArticle 21\n1.   In addition to the general provisions defining the chargeable event and the provisions for payment set out in Directive 92/12/EEC, the amount of taxation on energy products shall also become due on the occurrence of one of the chargeable events mentioned in Article 2(3).\n2.   For the purpose of this Directive, the word ‘production’ in Article 4(c) and 5(1) of Directive 92/12/EEC shall be deemed to include ‘extraction’, when appropriate.\n3.   The consumption of energy products within the curtilage of an establishment producing energy products shall not be considered as a chargeable event giving rise to taxation, if the consumption consist of energy products produced within the curtilage of the establishment. Member States may also consider the consumption of electricity and other energy products not produced within the curtilage of such an establishment and the consumption of energy products and electricity within the curtilage of an establishment producing fuels to be used for generation of electricity as not giving rise to a chargeable event. Where the consumption is for purposes not related to the production of energy products and in particular for the propulsion of vehicles, this shall be considered a chargeable event, giving rise to taxation.\n4.   Member States may also provide that taxation on energy products and electricity shall become due when it is established that a final use condition laid down in national rules for the purpose of a reduced level of taxation or exemption is not, or is no longer, fulfilled.\n5.   For the purpose of applying Articles 5 and 6 of Directive 92/12/EEC, electricity and natural gas shall be subject to taxation and shall become chargeable at the time of supply by the distributor or redistributor. Where the delivery to consumption takes place in a Member State where the distributor or redistributor is not established, the tax of the Member States of delivery shall be chargeable to a company that has to be registered in the Member State of delivery. Tax shall in all cases be levied and collected according to procedures laid down by each Member State.\nNotwithstanding the first subparagraph, Member States have the right to determine the chargeable event, in the case where there are no connections between their gas pipe lines and those of other Member States.\nAn entity producing electricity for its own use is regarded as a distributor. Notwithstanding Article 14(1)(a), Member States may exempt small producers of electricity provided that they tax the energy products used for the production of that electricity.\nFor the purpose of applying Articles 5 and 6 of Directive 92/12/EEC, coal, coke and lignite shall be subject to taxation and shall become chargeable at the time of delivery by companies, which have to be registered for that purpose by the relevant authorities. Those authorities may allow the producer, trader, importer or fiscal representative to substitute the registered company for the fiscal obligations imposed upon it. Tax shall be levied and collected according to procedures laid down by each Member State.\n6.   Member States need not treat as ‘production of energy products’:\n(a)\noperations during which small quantities of energy products are obtained incidentally;\n(b)\noperations by which the user of an energy product makes its reuse possible in his own undertaking provided that the taxation already paid on such product is not less than the taxation which would be due if the reused energy product were again to be liable to taxation;\n(c)\nan operation consisting of mixing, outside a production establishment or a tax warehouse, energy products with other energy products or other materials, provided that:\n(i)\ntaxation on the components has been paid previously; and\n(ii)\nthe amount paid is not less than the amount of the tax which would be chargeable on the mixture.\nThe condition under (i) shall not apply where the mixture is exempted for a specific use.\nArticle 22\nWhen taxation rates are changed, stocks of energy products already released for consumption may be subject to an increase in, or a reduction of, the tax.\nArticle 23\nMember States may refund the amounts of taxation already paid on contaminated or accidentally mixed energy products sent back to a tax warehouse for recycling.\nArticle 24\n1.   Energy products released for consumption in a Member State, contained in the standard tanks of commercial motor vehicles and intended to be used as fuel by those same vehicles, as well as in special containers, and intended to be used for the operation, during the course of transport, of the systems equipping those same containers shall not be subject to taxation in any other Member State.\n2.   For the purposes of this Article,\n‘standard tanks’ shall mean:\n—\nthe tanks permanently fixed by the manufacturer to all motor vehicles of the same type as the vehicle in question and whose permanent fitting enables fuel to be used directly, both the purpose of propulsion and, where appropriate, for the operation, during transport, of refrigeration systems and other systems. Gas tanks fitted to motor vehicles designed for the direct use of gas as a fuel and tanks fitted to the other systems with which the vehicle may be equipped shall also be considered to be standard tanks;\n—\nthe tanks permanently fixed by the manufacturer to all containers of the same type as the container in question and whose permanent fitting enables fuel to be used directly for the operation, during transport, of the refrigeration systems and other systems with which special containers are equipped.\n‘Special container’ shall mean any container fitted with specially designed apparatus for refrigeration systems, oxygenation systems, thermal insulation systems or other systems.\nArticle 25\n1.   Member States shall inform the Commission of the levels of taxation which they apply to the products listed in Article 2 on 1 January each year and following each change in national law.\n2.   Where the levels of taxation applied by the Member States are expressed in units of measurement other than those specified for each product in Articles 7 to 10, Member States shall also notify the corresponding levels of taxation following conversion into these units.\nArticle 26\n1.   Member States shall inform the Commission of measures taken pursuant to Articles 5, 14(2), 15 and 17.\n2.   Measures such as tax exemptions, tax reductions, tax differentiation and tax refunds within the meaning of this Directive might constitute State aid and in those cases have to be notified to the Commission pursuant to Article 88(3) of the Treaty.\nInformation provided to the Commission on the basis of this Directive does not free Member States from the notification obligation pursuant to Article 88(3) of the Treaty.\n3.   The obligation to inform the Commission pursuant to paragraph 1 of measures taken pursuant to Article 5 does not free Member States from any notification obligations pursuant to Directive 83/189/EEC.\nArticle 27\n1.   The Commission shall be assisted by the Committee on Excise Duties set up by Article 24(1) of Directive 92/12/EEC.\n2.   Where reference is made to this paragraph, Article 5 and 7 of Decision 1999/468/EC shall apply.\nThe period laid down in Article 5(6) of Decision 1999/468/EC shall be set at three months.\n3.   The Committee shall adopt its Rules of Procedure.\nArticle 28\n1.   Member States shall adopt and publish the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive not later than 31 December 2003. They shall forthwith inform the Commission thereof.\n2.   They shall apply these provisions from 1 January 2004, except the provisions laid down in Articles 16 and 18(1), which may be applied by the Member States from 1 January 2003.\n3.   When Member States adopt these measures, they shall contain a reference to this Directive or shall be accompanied by such reference on the occasion of their official publication. The methods of making such reference shall be laid down by the Member States.\n4.   Member States shall communicate to the Commission the texts of the main provisions of national law which they adopt in the field governed by this Directive.\nArticle 29\nThe Council, acting on the basis of a report and, where appropriate, a proposal from the Commission, shall periodically examine the exemptions and reductions and the minimum levels of taxation laid down in this Directive and, acting unanimously after consulting the European Parliament, shall adopt the necessary measures. The report by the Commission and the consideration by the Council shall take into account the proper functioning of the internal market, the real value of the minimum levels of taxation and the wider objectives of the Treaty.\nArticle 30\nNotwithstanding Article 28(2), Directives 92/81/EEC and 92/82/EEC shall be repealed as from 31 December 2003.\nArticle 31\nThis Directive shall enter into force on the day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nArticle 32\nThis Directive is addressed to the Member States.\nDone at Luxembourg, 27 October 2003.\nFor the Council\nThe President\nA.

Governments may exempt from taxation renewable energy sources such as biofuels or fuels and electricity used to transport goods and passengers by train, metro, tram or trolleybus.\nThe legislation allows for reduced taxes for energy-intensive firms — those that have made the greatest effort to reduce consumption. EU countries which had difficulty implementing the new measures were given transitional arrangements before applying the legislation (Belgium, Germany, Ireland, Greece, Spain, France, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Austria and Portugal).\nSimilar temporary exemptions and transitional periods were granted to the countries that joined the EU in 2004 and 2007.\nThe legislation does not apply to some energy-intensive sectors (e.g. in metallurgy) or to energy products which have a dual use, i.e. they are used both for heating and for another purpose (e.g. for the production of certain chemicals).\nFROM WHEN DOES THE DIRECTIVE APPLY?\n              \nIt has applied since 31 October 2003. EU countries had to incorporate it into national law by 31 December 2003.\nBACKGROUND\n              \nFor more information, see:\n‘Excise Duties: Current Energy Tax Rules’ on the European Commission's website.\nMAIN DOCUMENT\n            \nCouncil Directive 2003/96/EC of 27 October 2003 restructuring the Community framework for the taxation of energy products and electricity (OJ L 283, 31.10.2003, pp. 51–70)\nSuccessive amendments to Directive 2003/96/EC have been incorporated into the original text.
