In view of the rapid technological developments in this industrial sector worldwide it is normal practice of the Member States authorities in charge of national defence to procure weapons and military materials from producers or other suppliers located in third countries. Given the security interest of the Member States it is compatible with the interests of the Community that certain of these weapons and equipment may be imported free of import duties.(3) In order to ensure consistent application of such duty suspension it is appropriate to establish a common list of weapons and military equipment eligible for the duty suspension. It is also appropriate in view of the specific nature of the products concerned that parts, components or subassemblies for incorporation in or fitting to goods included in the list or for the repair, refurbishment or maintenance of such goods as well as goods for use in training or testing of goods included in this list could be imported free of customs duties. Imports of military equipment, which are not covered by this Regulation, are subject to the appropriate duties in the Common Customs Tariff.(4) Given the different organisational structures of the competent authorities in the Member States it is necessary solely for customs-related purposes to define end uses for the imported materials in accordance with the provisions of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 of 12 October 1992 establishing the Community Customs Code(2) and its implementing regulations (herein after called the \"Customs Code\"). In order to limit the administrative burden for the authorities concerned it is appropriate to set a time limit for the end use customs supervisions.(5) In order to take account of the protection of the military confidentiality of the Member States it is necessary to lay down specific administrative procedures for the granting of the benefit of the suspension of duties. A declaration by the competent authority of the Member State for whose forces the weapons or military equipment are destined, which could also be used as customs declaration as required by the Customs Code, would constitute an appropriate guarantee that these conditions are fulfilled. The declaration should be given in the form of a certificate. It is appropriate to specify the form, which such certificates must take and to allow also the use of means of data processing techniques for the declaration.(6) It is necessary to lay down rules for the Member States in order to provide information on the quantity, the value and the number of certificates issued and the procedures for the implementation of this Regulation,HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:Article 1This Regulation lays down the conditions for the autonomous suspension of import duties on certain weapons and military equipment imported by or on behalf of the authorities in charge of the military defence of the Member States from third countries.Article 21.

Such duties shall also be totally suspended for:(a) parts, components or subassemblies imported for incorporation in or fitting to goods included in the list in Annex I and II or parts, components or subassemblies thereof, or for the repair, refurbishment or maintenance of such goods;(b) goods imported for training or testing of goods included in the list at Annex I and II.3.

The use of the goods listed in Annex I for training purposes or the temporary use of these goods in the customs territory of the Community by the military forces or other forces for civil purposes due to unforeseen or natural disasters shall not constitute a violation of the end use determined in paragraph 1.Article 31. The request for entry for free circulation of goods for which the benefit of a duty suspension under the provisions of Article 2 is claimed shall be accompanied by a certificate issued by the competent authority of the Member State for whose military forces the goods are destined.

It may replace the customs declaration required by Articles 59 to 76 of Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92.2. Notwithstanding paragraph 1, for reasons of military confidentiality, the certificate and the imported goods may be submitted to other authorities designated by the importing Member State for this purpose. In such cases the competent authority issuing the certificate shall send before 31 January and 31 July of each year a summary report to the customs authorities of its Member State on such imports. The report shall cover a period of 6 months immediately preceding the month on which the report has to be submitted. It shall contain the number and issuing date of the certificates, the date of importation and the total value and gross weight of the products imported with the certificates.3.

Any material that is not listed in the regulation and in its annexes is subject to customs duties, even if it is imported by the armed forces of an EU country.\nGoods concerned\nThe goods on which the duties are suspended are arms and ammunition, including parts and accessories, certain rare gases, explosives, detonators, certain photographic materials and certain chemical products.\nThe regulation also applies the suspension of customs duties to imported parts, components and sub-assemblies that are to be incorporated into or fitted to the goods in the annexes or which are necessary for training or testing.\nPrivate companies\nPrivate companies established in the EU will only be able to import the goods duty-free provided that that they manufacture the relevant military equipment, and that they supply final products to the authorities in charge of defence in the EU countries. All other uses are liable for customs duties.\nPROCEDURES AND CONTROLS\nCertificate\nThe request for entry for free circulation of these goods must be accompanied by a certificate issued by the competent authority of the EU country for whose armed forces the goods are intended.\nThe model for this certificate is reproduced in Annex III to the regulation. It is to be submitted to the customs authorities of the importing EU country with the goods to which it refers.\nMilitary confidentiality\nTo ensure military confidentiality, there is a specific administrative procedure for granting duty suspension: the authorities responsible for national defence may issue the certificate instead of the regular customs services. The authorities must be notified accordingly.\nCustoms supervision\nThe goods concerned are subject to end-use conditions laid down by the EU Customs Code, i.e. their use will be supervised. Customs supervision of the end-use finishes 3 years after the date of release for free circulation.\nFor the purposes of customs supervision, the competent authority issuing the certificate or using the goods must notify the customs authorities of its country of any diversion of the goods from the use specified in the regulation.\nExchanging information\nEU countries must communicate the names of those authorised to issue the certificate. The European Commission forwards this information to the customs authorities of the other EU countries.\nEU countries must inform the Commission about the implementation of the regulation, and send information each year to the Commission on the number of certificates issued, together with the total value and gross weight of goods imported under the regulation.\nFROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?\n              \nIt applies from 1 January 2003.\nBACKGROUND\n              \nFor more information, see:\nTaxation and customs: suspensions (European Commission).\nMAIN DOCUMENT\n            \nCouncil Regulation (EC) No 150/2003 of 21 January 2003 suspending import duties on certain weapons and military equipment (OJ L 25, 30.1.2003, pp. 1-6)\nlast update 10.11.2017", "tags": ["free movement of goods", "military equipment", "customs regulations", "import (EU)", "suspension of customs duties"], "subjects": ["Free movement of goods", "CCT: derogations"], "split": "train", "reference_annotations": {}, "summary_annotations": {}}
