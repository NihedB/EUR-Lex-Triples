{"celex_id": "32009L0065", "reference": "17.11.2009\nEN\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\nL 302/32\nDIRECTIVE 2009/65/EC OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL\nof 13 July 2009\non the coordination of laws, regulations and administrative provisions relating to undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities (UCITS)\n(recast)\n(Text with EEA relevance)\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 47(2) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the Commission,\nActing in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty (1),\nWhereas:\n(1)\nCouncil Directive 85/611/EEC of 20 December 1985 on the coordination of laws, regulations and administrative provisions relating to undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities (UCITS) (2) has been substantially amended several times (3). Since further amendments are to be made, it should be recast in the interests of clarity.\n(2)\nDirective 85/611/EEC has largely contributed to the development and success of the European investment funds industry. However, despite the improvements introduced since its adoption, in particular in 2001, it has steadily become clear that changes need to be introduced into the UCITS legal framework in order to adapt it to the financial markets of the twenty-first century. The Commission Green Paper of 12 July 2005 on the enhancement of the EU framework for investment funds launched a public debate on the way in which Directive 85/611/EEC should be amended in order to meet those new challenges. That intense consultation process led to the largely shared conclusion that substantial amendments to that Directive are needed.\n(3)\nNational laws governing collective investment undertakings should be coordinated with a view to approximating the conditions of competition between those undertakings at Community level, while at the same time ensuring more effective and more uniform protection for unit-holders. Such coordination facilitates the removal of the restrictions on the free movement of units of UCITS in the Community.\n(4)\nHaving regard to those objectives, it is desirable to provide for common basic rules for the authorisation, supervision, structure and activities of UCITS established in the Member States and the information that they are required to publish.\n(5)\nThe coordination of the laws of the Member States should be confined to UCITS other than of the closed-ended type that promote the sale of their units to the public in the Community. It is desirable that UCITS be permitted, as part of their investment objective, to invest in financial instruments, other than transferable securities, which are sufficiently liquid. The financial instruments which are eligible to be investment assets of the portfolio of the UCITS should be listed in this Directive. The selection of investments for a portfolio by means of an index is a management technique.\n(6)\nWhere a provision of this Directive requires that UCITS take action, that provision should be understood to refer to the management company in cases where the UCITS is constituted as a common fund managed by a management company and where a common fund is not in a position to act by itself because it has no legal personality of its own.\n(7)\nUnits of UCITS are considered to be financial instruments for the purposes of Directive 2004/39/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 April 2004 on markets in financial instruments (4).\n(8)\nAn authorisation granted to the management company in its home Member State should ensure investor protection and the solvency of management companies, with a view to contributing to the stability of the financial system. The approach adopted in this Directive is to ensure the essential harmonisation necessary and sufficient to secure the mutual recognition of authorisation and of prudential supervision systems, making possible the grant of a single authorisation valid throughout the Community and the application of the principle of home Member State supervision.\n(9)\nIn order to ensure that the management company will be able to fulfil the obligations arising from its activities and thus to ensure its stability, initial capital and an additional amount of own funds are required. To take account of developments, particularly those pertaining to capital charges on operational risk, within the Community and other international forums, those requirements, including the use of guarantees, should be reviewed.\n(10)\nIt is necessary, for the protection of investors, to guarantee the internal overview of every management company in particular by means of a two-person management system and by adequate internal control mechanisms.\n(11)\nBy virtue of the principle of home Member State supervision, management companies authorised in their home Member States should be permitted to provide the services for which they have received authorisation throughout the Community by establishing branches or under the freedom to provide services.\n(12)\nWith regard to collective portfolio management (management of unit trusts/common funds or investment companies), the authorisation granted to a management company in its home Member State should permit the company to pursue in host Member States the following activities, without prejudice to Chapter XI: to distribute, through the establishment of a branch, the units of the harmonised unit trusts/common funds managed by that company in its home Member State; to distribute, through the establishment of a branch, the shares of the harmonised investment companies, managed by that company; to distribute the units of the harmonised unit trusts/common funds or shares of the harmonised investment companies managed by other management companies; to perform all the other functions and tasks included in the activity of collective portfolio management; to manage the assets of investment companies incorporated in Member States other than its home Member State; to perform, on the basis of mandates, on behalf of management companies incorporated in Member States other than its home Member State, the functions included in the activity of collective portfolio management. Where a management company distributes the units of its own harmonised unit trusts/common funds or shares of its own harmonised investment companies in host Member States, without the establishment of a branch, it should be subject only to rules regarding cross-border marketing.\n(13)\nWith regard to the scope of activity of management companies and in order to take into account national law and permit such companies to achieve significant economies of scale, it is desirable to permit them also to pursue the activity of management of portfolios of investments on a client-by-client basis (individual portfolio management), including the management of pension funds as well as some specific non-core activities linked to the main business without prejudicing the stability of such companies. However, specific rules should be laid down in order to prevent conflicts of interest when management companies are authorised to pursue the business of both collective and individual portfolio management.\n(14)\nThe activity of management of individual portfolios of investments is an investment service covered by Directive 2004/39/EC. In order to ensure a homogeneous regulatory framework in this area, it is desirable to subject management companies, the authorisation of which also covers that service, to the operating conditions laid down in that Directive.\n(15)\nA home Member State should be able, as a general rule, to establish rules stricter than those laid down in this Directive, in particular as regards authorisation conditions, prudential requirements and the rules on reporting and the prospectus.\n(16)\nIt is desirable to lay down rules defining the preconditions under which a management company may delegate, on the basis of mandates, specific tasks and functions to third parties so as to increase the efficiency of the conduct of its business. In order to ensure the correct functioning of the principle of the home Member State supervision, Member States permitting such delegations should ensure that the management company to which they granted authorisation does not delegate the totality of its functions to one or more third parties, so as to become a letter-box entity, and that the existence of mandates does not hinder an effective supervision over the management company. However, the fact that the management company has delegated its functions should not affect the liabilities of that company or of the depositary vis-à-vis the unit-holders and the competent authorities.\n(17)\nIn order to ensure a level playing field and appropriate supervision in the long term, it should be possible for the Commission to examine the possibilities for harmonising delegation arrangements at Community level.\n(18)\nThe principle of home Member State supervision requires that the competent authorities withdraw or refuse to grant authorisation where factors, such as the content of programmes of operations, the geographical distribution or the activities in fact pursued indicate clearly that a management company has opted for the legal system of one Member State for the purpose of evading the stricter standards in force in another Member State within the territory of which it intends to pursue or does pursue the greater part of its activities. For the purposes of this Directive, a management company should be authorised in the Member State in which it has its registered office. In accordance with the principle of home Member State supervision, only the competent authorities of the management company’s home Member State should be considered competent to supervise the organisation of the management company, including all procedures and resources to perform the function of administration referred to in Annex II, which should be subject to the law of the management company’s home Member State.\n(19)\nWhere the UCITS is managed by a management company authorised in a Member State other than the UCITS home Member State, that management company should adopt and establish appropriate procedures and arrangements to deal with investor complaints, such as through appropriate provisions in distribution arrangements or through an address in the UCITS home Member State, which should not need to be an address of the management company itself. Such a management company should also establish appropriate procedures and arrangements to make information available at the request of the public or the competent authorities of the UCITS home Member State, such as through the designation of a contact person, from among the employees of the management company, to deal with requests for information. However, such a management company should not be required by the law of the UCITS home Member State to have a local representative in that Member State in order to fulfil those duties.\n(20)\nThe competent authorities that authorise the UCITS should take into account the rules of the common fund or the instruments of incorporation of the investment company, the choice of the depositary and the ability of the management company to manage the UCITS. Where the management company is established in another Member State, the competent authorities should be able to rely on an attestation, issued by the competent authorities of the management company’s home Member State, regarding the type of UCITS that the management company is authorised to manage. Authorisation of a UCITS should not be subject to an additional capital requirement at the level of the management company, the location of the management company’s registered office in the UCITS home Member State, or the location of any activity of the management company in the UCITS home Member State.\n(21)\nThe competent authorities of the UCITS home Member State should be competent to supervise compliance with the rules regarding the constitution and functioning of the UCITS, which should be subject to the law of the UCITS home Member State. To this end, the competent authorities of the UCITS home Member State should be able to obtain information directly from the management company. In particular, the competent authorities of the management company’s host Member State may require management companies to provide information on transactions concerning the investments of the UCITS authorised in that Member State, including information contained in books and records of those transactions and fund accounts. To remedy any breach of the rules under their responsibility, the competent authorities of the management company’s host Member States should be able to rely on the cooperation of the competent authorities of the management company’s home Member State and, if necessary, should be able to take action directly against the management company.\n(22)\nIt should be possible for the UCITS home Member State to provide for rules regarding the content of the unit-holder register of the UCITS. The organisation of the maintenance and the location of that register should, however, remain part of the organisational arrangements of the management company.\n(23)\nIt is necessary to provide the UCITS home Member State with all means to remedy any breach in the rules of the UCITS. To that end, the competent authorities of the UCITS home Member State should be able to take preventive measures and adopt penalties as regards the management company. As a last resort, the competent authorities of the UCITS home Member State should have the possibility to require the management company to cease managing the UCITS. Member States should provide for the necessary provisions in order to arrange for an orderly management or liquidation of the UCITS in such a case.\n(24)\nIn order to prevent supervisory arbitrage and promote confidence in the effectiveness of supervision by the home Member State’s competent authorities, authorisation should be refused where a UCITS is prevented from marketing its units in its home Member State. Once authorised, UCITS should be free to choose the Member State(s) where its units are to be marketed, in accordance with this Directive.\n(25)\nTo safeguard shareholders’ interests and secure a level playing field in the market for harmonised collective investment undertakings, initial capital is required for investment companies. Investment companies which have designated a management company will, however, be covered through the management company’s additional amount of own funds.\n(26)\nWhere there are applicable rules on the conduct of business and the delegation of functions and where such delegation by a management company is allowed under the law of its home Member State, authorised investment companies should comply with such rules, mutatis mutandis, either directly, where they have not designated a management company authorised in accordance with this Directive, or indirectly, where they have designated such a management company.\n(27)\nDespite the need for consolidation between UCITS, mergers of UCITS encounter many legal and administrative difficulties in the Community. It is therefore necessary, in order to improve the functioning of the internal market, to lay down Community provisions facilitating mergers between UCITS (and investment compartments thereof). Although some Member States are likely to authorise only contractual funds, cross-border mergers between all types of UCITS (contractual, corporate and unit trusts) should be permitted and recognised by each Member State without the need for Member States to provide for new legal forms of UCITS in their national law.\n(28)\nThis Directive concerns those merger techniques which are most commonly used in Member States. It does not require all Member States to introduce all three techniques into their national law, but each Member State should recognise a transfer of assets resulting from those merger techniques. This Directive does not prevent UCITS from using other techniques on a purely national basis, in situations where none of the UCITS concerned by the merger has been notified for cross-border marketing of its units. Those mergers will remain subject to the relevant provisions of national law. National rules on quorum should neither discriminate between national and cross-border mergers, nor be more stringent than those laid down for mergers of corporate entities.\n(29)\nIn order to safeguard investors’ interests, Member States should require proposed domestic or cross-border mergers between UCITS to be subject to authorisation by their competent authorities. For cross-border mergers, the competent authorities of the merging UCITS should authorise the merger so as to ensure that the interests of the unit-holders who effectively change UCITS are duly protected. If the merger involves more than one merging UCITS and such UCITS are domiciled in different Member States, the competent authorities of each merging UCITS will need to authorise the merger, in close cooperation with each other, including through appropriate information-sharing. Since the interests of the unit-holders of the receiving UCITS also need to be adequately safeguarded, they should be taken into account by the competent authorities of the receiving UCITS home Member State.\n(30)\nUnit-holders of both the merging and the receiving UCITS should also be able to request the repurchase or redemption of their units or, where possible, to convert them into units in another UCITS with similar investment policies and managed by the same management company or by a linked company. That right should not be subject to any additional charge, save for fees, to be retained exclusively by the respective UCITS, to cover disinvestment costs in all situations, as set out in the prospectuses of the merging and the receiving UCITS.\n(31)\nThird-party control of mergers should also be ensured. The depositaries of each of the UCITS involved in the merger should verify the conformity of the common draft terms of the merger with the relevant provisions of this Directive and of the UCITS fund rules. Either a depositary or an independent auditor should draw-up a report on behalf of all the UCITS involved in the merger validating the valuation methods of the assets and liabilities of such UCITS and the calculation method of the exchange ratio as set out in the common draft terms of merger as well as the actual exchange ratio and, where applicable, the cash payment per unit. In order to limit costs connected with cross-border mergers, it should be possible to draw up a single report for all UCITS involved and the statutory auditor of the merging or the receiving UCITS should be enabled to do so. For investor protection reasons, unit-holders should be able to obtain a copy of such report on request and free of charge.\n(32)\nIt is particularly important that the unit-holders are adequately informed about the proposed merger and that their rights are sufficiently protected. Although the interests of the unit-holders of the merging UCITS are most concerned by the merger, those of the unit-holders of the receiving UCITS should also be safeguarded.\n(33)\nThe provisions on mergers laid down in this Directive are without prejudice to the application of the legislation on control of concentrations between undertakings, in particular Council Regulation (EC) No 139/2004 of 20 January 2004 on the control of concentrations between undertakings (the EC Merger Regulation) (5).\n(34)\nThe free marketing of the units issued by UCITS authorised to invest up to 100 % of their assets in transferable securities issued by the same body (State, local authority, etc.) should not have the direct or indirect effect of disturbing the functioning of the capital market or the financing of the Member States.\n(35)\nThe definition of transferable securities included in this Directive applies only for the purposes of this Directive and does not affect the various definitions used in national legislation for other purposes such as taxation. Consequently, shares and other securities equivalent to shares issued by bodies such as building societies and industrial and provident societies, the ownership of which cannot, in practice, be transferred except by the issuing body buying them back, are not covered by this definition.\n(36)\nMoney market instruments comprise transferable instruments which are normally dealt in on the money market rather than on the regulated markets, for example treasury and local authority bills, certificates of deposit, commercial papers, medium-term notes and bankers’ acceptances.\n(37)\nThe concept of regulated market in this Directive corresponds to that in Directive 2004/39/EC.\n(38)\nIt is desirable to permit a UCITS to invest its assets in units of UCITS and other collective investment undertakings of the open-ended type which also invest in liquid financial assets referred to in this Directive and which operate on the principle of risk spreading. It is necessary that UCITS or other collective investment undertakings in which a UCITS invests be subject to effective supervision.\n(39)\nThe development of opportunities for a UCITS to invest in UCITS and in other collective investments undertakings should be facilitated. It is therefore essential to ensure that such investment activity does not diminish investor protection. Because of the enhanced possibilities for UCITS to invest in the units of other UCITS and collective investment undertakings, it is necessary to lay down certain rules on quantitative limits, the disclosure of information and prevention of the cascade phenomenon.\n(40)\nIn order to take into account market developments and in consideration of the completion of economic and monetary union it is desirable to permit UCITS to invest in bank deposits. To ensure adequate liquidity of investments in deposits, those deposits should be repayable on demand or have the right to be withdrawn. If the deposits are made with a credit institution the registered office of which is located in a third country, the credit institution should be subject to prudential rules equivalent to those laid down in Community law.\n(41)\nIn addition to the case in which a UCITS invests in bank deposits in accordance with its fund rules or instruments of incorporation, it should be possible to allow all UCITS to hold ancillary liquid assets, such as bank deposits at sight. The holding of such ancillary liquid assets may be justified, inter alia, in order to cover current or exceptional payments; in the case of sales, for the time necessary to reinvest in transferable securities, money market instruments or in other financial assets provided for in this Directive; or for a period of time strictly necessary when, because of unfavourable market conditions, the investment in transferable securities, money market instruments and in other financial assets is suspended.\n(42)\nFor prudential reasons it is necessary to avoid excessive concentration by a UCITS in investments which expose it to counterparty risk to the same entity or to entities belonging to the same group.\n(43)\nUCITS should be expressly permitted, as part of their general investment policy or for hedging purposes in order to reach a set financial target or the risk profile indicated in the prospectus, to invest in financial derivative instruments. In order to ensure investor protection, it is necessary to limit the maximum potential exposure relating to derivative instruments so that it does not exceed the total net value of the UCITS’ portfolio. In order to ensure constant awareness of the risks and commitments arising from derivative transactions and to check compliance with investment limits, those risks and commitments should be measured and monitored on an ongoing basis. Finally, in order to ensure investor protection through disclosure, UCITS should describe their strategies, techniques and investment limits governing their derivative operations.\n(44)\nIt is necessary for measures to address the potential misalignment of interests in products where credit risk is transferred by securitisation, as envisaged with regard to Directive 2006/48/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 14 June 2006 relating to the taking up and pursuit of the business of credit institutions (6) and Directive 2006/49/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 14 June 2006 on the capital adequacy of investment firms and credit institutions (7), to be consistent and coherent in all relevant financial sector regulation. The Commission will put forward the appropriate legislative proposals, including as regards this Directive, to ensure such consistency and coherence, after duly considering the impact of such proposals.\n(45)\nWith regard to over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives, requirements should be set in terms of the eligibility of counterparties and instruments, liquidity and ongoing assessment of the position. The purpose of such requirements is to ensure an adequate level of investor protection, close to that which they obtain when they acquire derivatives dealt in on regulated markets.\n(46)\nOperations in derivatives should never be used to circumvent the principles or rules set out in this Directive. With regard to OTC derivatives, additional risk-spreading rules should apply to exposures to a single counterparty or group of counterparties.\n(47)\nSome portfolio management techniques for collective investment undertakings investing primarily in shares or debt securities are based on the replication of stock indices or debt-security indices. It is desirable to permit UCITS to replicate well-known and recognised stock indices or debt-security indices. It may therefore be necessary to introduce more flexible risk-spreading rules for UCITS investing in shares or debt securities to this end.\n(48)\nCollective investment undertakings falling within the scope of this Directive should not be used for purposes other than the collective investment of the capital raised from the public according to the rules laid down in this Directive. In the cases identified by this Directive, it should be possible for a UCITS to have subsidiaries only when necessary to pursue effectively, on its own behalf, certain activities, also defined in this Directive. It is necessary to ensure effective supervision of UCITS. The establishment of a subsidiary of a UCITS in a third country should therefore be permitted only in the cases identified and in accordance with the conditions laid down in this Directive. The general obligation to act solely in the interests of unit-holders and, in particular, the objective of increasing cost efficiencies, never justify a UCITS undertaking measures that could hinder the competent authorities from effectively exercising their supervisory functions.\n(49)\nThe original version of Directive 85/611/EEC contained a derogation from the restriction on the percentage of its assets that a UCITS can invest in transferable securities issued by the same body, which applied in the case of bonds issued or guaranteed by a Member State. That derogation allowed UCITS to invest, in particular, up to 35 % of their assets in such bonds. A similar but more limited derogation is justified with regard to private sector bonds which, even in the absence of a State guarantee, offer special guarantees to the investor under the specific rules applicable thereto. It is necessary, therefore, to extend the derogation to the totality of private sector bonds which fulfil jointly fixed criteria, while leaving it to the Member States to draw up the list of bonds to which they intend, where appropriate, to grant a derogation.\n(50)\nSeveral Member States have enacted provisions that enable non-coordinated collective investment undertakings to pool their assets in one so-called master fund. In order to allow UCITS to make use of those structures, it is necessary to exempt feeder UCITS wishing to pool their assets in a master UCITS from the prohibition to invest more than 10 % of their assets or, as the case may be, 20 % of their assets in a single collective investment undertaking. Such an exemption is justified as the feeder UCITS invests all or almost all of its assets into the diversified portfolio of the master UCITS, which itself is subject to UCITS diversification rules.\n(51)\nIn order to facilitate the effective operation of the internal market and to ensure the same level of investor protection throughout the Community, master-feeder structures should be allowed both where the master and the feeder are established in the same Member State and where they are established in different Member States. In order to allow investors better to understand master-feeder-structures and regulators to supervise them more easily, notably in a cross-border situation, no feeder UCITS should be able to invest into more than one master. In order to ensure the same level of investor protection throughout the Community the master should itself be an authorised UCITS. In order to avoid an undue administrative burden, provisions on notification of cross-border marketing should not apply if a master UCITS does not raise capital from the public in a Member State other than that in which it is established, but has only one or more feeder UCITS in that other Member State.\n(52)\nIn order to protect the feeder UCITS’ investors, the feeder UCITS’ investment into the master UCITS should be subject to prior approval by the competent authorities of the feeder UCITS home Member State. Only the initial investment into the master UCITS, by which the feeder UCITS exceeds the limit applicable for investing into another UCITS, requires approval. In order to facilitate the effective operation of the internal market and to ensure the same level of investor protection throughout the Community, the conditions which must be met and the documents and information which are to be provided for approving the feeder UCITS’ investment into the master UCITS should be exhaustive.\n(53)\nIn order to allow the feeder UCITS to act in the best interests of its unit-holders and notably place it in a position to obtain from the master UCITS all information and documents necessary to perform its obligations, the feeder and the master UCITS should enter into a binding and enforceable agreement. If both feeder and master UCITS are managed by the same management company, however, it should be sufficient that the latter establish internal conduct of business rules. Information-sharing agreements between the depositaries or the auditors respectively of the feeder UCITS and the master UCITS should ensure the flow of information and documents that is needed for the feeder UCITS’ depositary or auditor to fulfil its duties. This Directive should ensure that, when complying with those requirements, the depositaries or the auditors are not to be found in breach of any restriction on disclosure of information or of data protection.\n(54)\nIn order to ensure a high level of protection of the interests of the feeder UCITS’ investors, the prospectus, the key investor information, as well as all marketing communications should be adapted to the specificities of master-feeder structures. The investment of the feeder UCITS into the master UCITS should not affect the ability of the feeder UCITS itself either to repurchase or redeem units at the request of its unit-holders or to act in the best interests of its unit-holders.\n(55)\nUnder this Directive, unit-holders should be protected from being charged unjustified additional costs by a prohibition against master UCITS charging feeder UCITS subscription and redemption fees. The master UCITS should, however, be able to charge subscription or redemption fees to other investors in the master UCITS.\n(56)\nThe conversion rules should enable an existing UCITS to convert into a feeder UCITS. At the same time they should sufficiently protect unit-holders. As conversion is a fundamental change of the investment policy, the converting UCITS should be required to provide its unit-holders with sufficient information in order to enable them to decide whether to maintain their investment. The competent authorities should not require the feeder UCITS to provide more or information other than that specified in this Directive.\n(57)\nWhere the competent authorities of the master UCITS home Member State are informed of an irregularity with regard to the master UCITS or detect that the master UCITS does not comply with the provisions of this Directive, they may decide, where appropriate, to take relevant action to ensure that unit-holders of the master UCITS are informed accordingly.\n(58)\nMember States should make a clear distinction between marketing communications and obligatory investor disclosures provided for under this Directive. Obligatory investor disclosure includes key investor information, the prospectus and annual and half-yearly reports.\n(59)\nKey investor information should be provided as a specific document to investors, free of charge, in good time before the subscription of the UCITS, in order to help them to reach informed investment decisions. Such key investor information should contain only the essential elements for making such decisions. The nature of the information to be found in the key investor information should be fully harmonised so as to ensure adequate investor protection and comparability. Key investor information should be presented in a short format. A single document of limited length presenting the information in a specified sequence is the most appropriate manner in which to achieve the clarity and simplicity of presentation that is required by retail investors, and should allow for useful comparisons, notably of costs and risk profile, relevant to the investment decision.\n(60)\nThe competent authorities of each Member State may make available to the public, in a dedicated section of their website, key investor information concerning all UCITS authorised in that Member State.\n(61)\nKey investor information should be produced for all UCITS. Management companies or, where applicable, investment companies should provide key investor information to the relevant entities, in accordance with the distribution method used (direct sales or intermediated sales). Intermediaries should provide key investor information to clients and potential clients.\n(62)\nUCITS should be able to market their units in other Member States subject to a notification procedure based on improved communication between the competent authorities of the Member States. Following transmission of a complete notification file by the competent authorities of the UCITS home Member State, it should not be possible for the UCITS host Member State to oppose access to its market by a UCITS established in another Member State or challenge the authorisation given by that other Member State.\n(63)\nUCITS should be able to market their units subject to their taking the necessary measures to ensure that facilities are available for making payments to unit-holders, repurchasing or redeeming units and making available the information which UCITS are required to provide.\n(64)\nIn order to facilitate cross-border marketing of units of UCITS, control of compliance of arrangements made for marketing of units of UCITS with laws, regulations and administrative procedures applicable in the UCITS host Member State, should be performed after the UCITS has accessed the market of that Member State. That control could cover the adequacy of arrangements made for marketing, in particular the adequacy of distribution arrangements and the obligation for marketing communications to be presented in a manner that is fair, clear and not misleading. This Directive should not prevent the competent authorities of the host Member State from verifying that marketing communications, not including key investor information, the prospectus and annual and half-yearly reports, comply with national law before the UCITS can use them, subject to such control being non-discriminatory and not preventing that UCITS from accessing the market.\n(65)\nFor the purpose of enhancing legal certainty there is a need to ensure that a UCITS which markets its units on a cross-border basis has easy access, in the form of an electronic publication and in a language customary in the sphere of international finance, to complete information on the laws, regulations and administrative provisions applicable in the UCITS host Member State, which specifically relate to the arrangements made for marketing of units of UCITS. Liabilities relating to such publications should be subject to national law.\n(66)\nTo facilitate access of UCITS to the markets of other Member States, the UCITS should be required to translate only the key investor information into the official language or one of the official languages of a UCITS host Member State or a language approved by its competent authorities. Key investor information should specify the language(s) in which other obligatory disclosure documents and additional information are available. Translations should be produced under the responsibility of the UCITS, which should decide whether a simple or a sworn translation is necessary.\n(67)\nTo facilitate the access to the markets of other Member States, it is important that notification fees are disclosed.\n(68)\nMember States should take the necessary administrative and organisational measures to enable cooperation between national authorities and competent authorities of other Member States, including through bilateral or multilateral agreements between those authorities, which could provide for the voluntary delegation of tasks.\n(69)\nIt is necessary to enhance convergence of powers at the disposal of competent authorities so as to bring about the equal enforcement of this Directive throughout the Member States. A common minimum set of powers, consistent with those conferred upon competent authorities by other Community financial services legislation should guarantee supervisory effectiveness. In addition, Member States should lay down rules on penalties, which may include criminal or administrative penalties, and administrative measures, applicable to infringements of this Directive. Member States should also take the measures necessary to ensure that those penalties are enforced.\n(70)\nIt is necessary to reinforce provisions on exchange of information between national competent authorities and to strengthen the duties of assistance and cooperation between them.\n(71)\nFor the purpose of cross-border provision of services, clear competences should be assigned to the respective competent authorities so as to eliminate any gaps or overlaps, in accordance with the applicable law.\n(72)\nThe provisions in this Directive relating to the competent authorities’ effective exercise of their supervisory functions covers supervision on a consolidated basis which must be exercised over a UCITS or an undertaking contributing towards its business activity where the provisions of Community law so provide. In such cases, the authorities applied to for authorisation must be able to identify the authorities competent to exercise supervision on a consolidated basis over that UCITS or an undertaking contributing towards its business activity.\n(73)\nThe principle of home Member State supervision requires that the competent authorities withdraw or refuse to grant authorisation where factors such as the content of programmes of operations, the geographical distribution or the activities actually pursued indicate clearly that a UCITS or an undertaking contributing towards its business activity has opted for the legal system of one Member State for the purpose of evading the stricter standards in force in another Member State within whose territory it pursues or intends to pursue the greater part of its activities.\n(74)\nCertain behaviour, such as fraud or insider offences, is liable to affect the stability, including integrity, of the financial system, even when involving undertakings other than UCITS or undertakings contributing towards their business activity.\n(75)\nIt is appropriate to provide for the possibility of exchanges of information between the competent authorities and authorities or bodies which, by virtue of their function, help to strengthen the stability of the financial system. In order to preserve the confidential nature of the information forwarded, however, the addressees of such exchanges should remain within strict limits.\n(76)\nIt is necessary to specify the conditions under which such exchanges of information are authorised.\n(77)\nWhere it is stipulated that information may be disclosed only with the express agreement of the competent authorities, these may, where appropriate, make their agreement subject to compliance with strict conditions.\n(78)\nExchanges of information between the competent authorities on the one hand and central banks, bodies with a function similar to central banks, in their capacity as monetary authorities, or, where appropriate, other public authorities responsible for supervising payment systems on the other, should also be authorised.\n(79)\nThe same obligation of professional secrecy on the authorities responsible for authorising and supervising UCITS and the undertakings contributing towards such authorising and supervising and the same possibilities for exchanging information as those granted to the authorities responsible for authorising and supervising credit institutions, investment firms and insurance undertakings, should be included in this Directive.\n(80)\nFor the purpose of strengthening the prudential supervision of UCITS or of undertakings contributing towards their business activity and protection of clients of UCITS or of undertakings contributing towards their business activity, auditors should have a duty to report promptly to the competent authorities, wherever, as provided for by this Directive, they become aware, while carrying out their tasks, of facts which are likely to have a serious effect on the financial situation or the administrative and accounting organisation of a UCITS, or an undertaking contributing towards its business activity.\n(81)\nHaving regard to the aim in this Directive, it is desirable for Member States to provide that such a duty should apply in all circumstances where such facts are discovered by an auditor during the performance of his tasks in an undertaking which has close links with a UCITS or an undertaking which contributes towards its business activity.\n(82)\nThe duty of auditors to communicate, where appropriate, to the competent authorities certain facts and decisions concerning a UCITS or an undertaking contributing towards its business activity which they discover during the performance of their tasks in an entity which is neither a UCITS nor an undertaking contributing towards the business activity of a UCITS does not, alone, change the nature of their tasks in that entity nor the manner in which they must perform those tasks in that entity.\n(83)\nThis Directive should not affect national rules on taxation, including arrangements that may be imposed by Member States to ensure compliance with those rules in their territory.\n(84)\nThe measures necessary for the implementation of this Directive should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission (8).\n(85)\nIn particular, the Commission should be empowered to adopt the following implementing measures. As regards management companies, the Commission should be empowered to adopt measures specifying the details of organisational requirements, risk management, conflicts of interest and rules of conduct. As regards depositaries, the Commission should be empowered to adopt measures specifying the measures to be taken by depositaries in order to fulfil their duties in regard to UCITS managed by a management company, established in a Member State other than the UCITS home Member State and the particulars of the agreement between the depositary and the management company. Those implementing measures should facilitate a uniform application of the obligations of management companies and depositaries but should not be a precondition for implementing the right of management companies to pursue the activities for which they have been authorised in their home Member State throughout the Community by establishing branches or under the freedom to provide services including the management of UCITS in another Member State.\n(86)\nAs regards mergers, the Commission should be empowered to adopt measures designed to specify detailed content, format and way to provide information to unit-holders.\n(87)\nAs regards master-feeder structures, the Commission should be empowered to adopt measures designed to specify the content of the agreement between master and feeder UCITS or of the internal conduct of business rules, the content of the information-sharing agreement between either their depositaries or their auditors, the definition of measures appropriate to coordinate the timing of their net asset value calculation and publication in order to avoid market timing, the impact of the merger of the master on the authorisation of the feeder, the type of irregularities originating from the master to be reported to the feeder, the format and the way to provide information to unit-holders in case of conversion from a UCITS to a feeder UCITS, the procedure for valuing and auditing the transfer of assets from a feeder to a master, and the role of the depositary of the feeder in this process.\n(88)\nAs regards the provisions on disclosure, the Commission should be empowered to adopt measures designed to specify the specific conditions to be met when the prospectus is provided in a durable medium other than paper or by means of a website which does not constitute a durable medium, the detailed and exhaustive content, form and presentation of the key investor information taking into account the different nature or components of the UCITS concerned, and the specific conditions for providing key investor information in a durable medium other than paper or by means of a website which does not constitute a durable medium.\n(89)\nAs regards notification, the Commission should be empowered to adopt measures designed to specify the scope of the information on the applicable local rules to be published by host Member State competent authorities and the technical details on access by host Member State competent authorities to stored and updated UCITS documents.\n(90)\nThe Commission should also be empowered, inter alia, to clarify definitions and align terminology and framing definitions in accordance with subsequent acts on UCITS and related matters.\n(91)\nSince the measures referred to in Recitals 85 to 90 are of general scope and are designed to amend non-essential elements of this Directive, by supplementing it with new non-essential elements, they must be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny provided for in Article 5a of Decision 1999/468/EC.\n(92)\nSince the objectives of this Directive cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States in so far as they involve the adoption of rules with common features applicable at Community level and can therefore, by reason of the scale and effects of those rules, be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Directive does not go beyond what is necessary to achieve those objectives.\n(93)\nThe obligation to transpose this Directive into national law should be confined to those provisions that represent a substantive change as compared with the directives that it recasts. The obligation to transpose the provisions which are unchanged arises under the earlier directives.\n(94)\nThis Directive should be without prejudice to the obligations of the Member States relating to the time limits for transposition into national law and application of the Directives set out in Annex III, Part B.\n(95)\nIn accordance with point 34 of the Interinstitutional Agreement on better law-making (9), Member States are encouraged to draw up, for themselves and in the interest of the Community, their own tables illustrating, as far as possible, the correlation between this Directive and the transposition measures, and to make them public,\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:\nCONTENT\nCHAPTER I\nSUBJECT MATTER, SCOPE AND DEFINITIONS\nCHAPTER II\nAUTHORISATION OF UCITS\nCHAPTER III\nOBLIGATIONS REGARDING MANAGEMENT COMPANIES\nSECTION 1\nConditions for taking up business\nSECTION 2\nRelations with third countries\nSECTION 3\nOperating conditions\nSECTION 4\nFreedom of establishment and freedom to provide services\nCHAPTER IV\nOBLIGATIONS REGARDING THE DEPOSITARY\nCHAPTER V\nOBLIGATIONS REGARDING INVESTMENT COMPANIES\nSECTION 1\nConditions for taking up business\nSECTION 2\nOperating conditions\nSECTION 3\nObligations regarding the depositary\nCHAPTER VI\nMERGERS OF UCITS\nSECTION 1\nPrinciple, authorisation and approval\nSECTION 2\nThird party control, information of unit-holders and other rights of unit-holders\nSECTION 3\nCosts and entry into effect\nCHAPTER VII\nOBLIGATIONS CONCERNING THE INVESTMENT POLICIES OF UCITS\nCHAPTER VIII\nMASTER-FEEDER STRUCTURES\nSECTION 1\nScope and approval\nSECTION 2\nCommon provisions for feeder UCITS and master UCITS\nSECTION 3\nDepositaries and auditors\nSECTION 4\nCompulsory information and marketing communications by the feeder UCITS\nSECTION 5\nConversion of existing UCITS into feeder UCITS and change of master UCITS\nSECTION 6\nObligations and competent authorities\nCHAPTER IX\nOBLIGATIONS CONCERNING INFORMATION TO BE PROVIDED TO INVESTORS\nSECTION 1\nPublication of a prospectus and periodical reports\nSECTION 2\nPublication of other information\nSECTION 3\nKey investor information\nCHAPTER X\nGENERAL OBLIGATIONS OF UCITS\nCHAPTER XI\nSPECIAL PROVISIONS APPLICABLE TO UCITS WHICH MARKET THEIR UNITS IN MEMBER STATES OTHER THAN THOSE IN WHICH THEY ARE ESTABLISHED\nCHAPTER XII\nPROVISIONS CONCERNING THE AUTHORITIES RESPONSIBLE FOR AUTHORISATION AND SUPERVISION\nCHAPTER XIII\nEUROPEAN SECURITIES COMMITTEE\nCHAPTER XIV\nDEROGATIONS, TRANSITIONAL AND FINAL PROVISIONS\nSECTION 1\nDerogations\nSECTION 2\nTransitional and final provisions\nANNEX I\nSchedules A and B\nANNEX II\nFunctions included in the activity of collective portfolio management\nANNEX III\nPart A\nRepealed Directive with list of its successive amendments\nPart B\nList of time limits for transposition into national law and application\nANNEX IV\nCorrelation table\nCHAPTER I\nSUBJECT MATTER, SCOPE AND DEFINITIONS\nArticle 1\n1.

Where close links exist between the management company and other natural or legal persons, the competent authorities shall grant authorisation only if those close links do not prevent the effective exercise of their supervisory functions.\nThe competent authorities shall also refuse authorisation if the laws, regulations or administrative provisions of a third country governing one or more natural or legal persons with which the management company has close links, or difficulties involved in their enforcement, prevent the effective exercise of their supervisory functions.\nThe competent authorities shall require management companies to provide them with the information they require to monitor compliance with the conditions referred to in this paragraph on a continuous basis.\n3.   The competent authorities shall inform the applicant within six months of the submission of a complete application whether or not authorisation has been granted.

In the case of branches of management companies that have registered offices outside the Community and are taking up or pursuing business, the Member States shall not apply provisions that result in treatment more favourable than that accorded to branches of management companies that have registered offices in Member States.\n3.   The competent authorities of the other Member State involved shall be consulted beforehand in relation to the authorisation of any management company which is one of the following:\n(a)\na subsidiary of another management company, an investment firm, a credit institution or an insurance undertaking authorised in another Member State;\n(b)\na subsidiary of the parent undertaking of another management company, an investment firm, a credit institution or an insurance undertaking authorised in another Member State; or\n(c)\na company controlled by the same natural or legal persons as control another management company, an investment firm, a credit institution or an insurance undertaking authorised in another Member State.\nSECTION 2\nRelations with third countries\nArticle 9\n1.   Relations with third countries shall be regulated in accordance with the relevant rules laid down in Article 15 of Directive 2004/39/EC.\nFor the purposes of this Directive, the terms ‘investment firm’ and ‘investment firms’ referred to in Article 15 of Directive 2004/39/EC shall mean, respectively, ‘management company’ and ‘management companies’; the term ‘providing investment services’ referred to in Article 15(1) of Directive 2004/39/EC shall mean ‘providing services’.\n2.

The prudential supervision of a management company shall be the responsibility of the competent authorities of the management company’s home Member State, whether the management company establishes a branch or provides services in another Member State or not, without prejudice to those provisions of this Directive which confer responsibility to the competent authorities of a management company’s host Member State.\nArticle 11\n1.   Qualifying holdings in management companies shall be subject to the same rules as those laid down in Articles 10, 10a and 10b of Directive 2004/39/EC.\n2.   For the purposes of this Directive, the terms ‘investment firm’ and ‘investment firms’ referred to in Article 10 of Directive 2004/39/EC, mean, respectively, ‘management company’ and ‘management companies’.\nArticle 12\n1.

However, the rules for the valuation of such investment companies’ assets shall be stated in the applicable national law or in their instruments of incorporation.\n5.   An investment company’s home Member State may decide that investment companies established on its territory which market at least 80 % of their units through one or more stock exchanges designated in their instruments of incorporation are not required to have depositaries within the meaning of this Directive provided that their units are admitted to official listing on the stock exchanges of those Member States within the territories of which the units are marketed, and that any transactions which such an investment company may effect outwith stock exchanges are effected at stock exchange prices only.\nThe instruments of incorporation of an investment company shall specify the stock exchange in the country of marketing the prices on which shall determine the prices at which that investment company will effect any transactions outwith stock exchanges in that country.\nA Member State shall avail itself of the derogation provided for in the first subparagraph only if it considers that unit-holders have protection equivalent to that of unit-holders in UCITS which have depositaries within the meaning of this Directive.\nInvestment companies referred to in this paragraph and in paragraph 4, shall, in particular:\n(a)\nin the absence of national law to this effect, state in their instruments of incorporation the methods of calculation of the net asset values of their units;\n(b)\nintervene on the market to prevent the stock exchange values of their units from deviating by more than 5 % from their net asset values;\n(c)\nestablish the net asset values of their units, communicate them to the competent authorities at least twice a week and publish them twice a month.\nAt least twice a month, an independent auditor shall ensure that the calculation of the value of units is effected in accordance with the law and the instruments of incorporation of the investment company.\nOn such occasions, the auditor shall ensure that the investment company’s assets are invested in accordance with the rules laid down by law and the instruments of incorporation of the investment company.\n6.   Member States shall inform the Commission of the identities of the investment companies benefiting from the derogations provided for in paragraphs 4 and 5.\nArticle 33\n1.   A depositary shall either have its registered office or be established in the same Member State as that of the investment company.\n2.   A depositary shall be an institution which is subject to prudential regulation and ongoing supervision.\n3.   Member States shall determine which of the categories of institutions referred to in paragraph 2 shall be eligible to be depositaries.\n4.   The depositary shall enable the competent authorities of the UCITS home Member State to obtain, on request, all information that the depositary has obtained while discharging its duties and that is necessary for the competent authorities to supervise compliance of the UCITS with this Directive.\n5.   Where the management company’s home Member State is not the UCITS home Member State, the depositary shall sign a written agreement with the management company regulating the flow of information deemed necessary to allow it to perform the functions set out in Article 32 and in other laws, regulations or administrative provisions which are relevant for depositaries in the UCITS home Member State.\n6.   The Commission may adopt implementing measures in relation to the measures to be taken by a depositary in order to fulfil its duties regarding a UCITS managed by a management company established in another Member State, including the particulars that need to be included in the standard agreement to be used by the depositary and the management company in accordance with paragraph 5.\nThose measures, designed to amend non-essential elements of this Directive by supplementing it, shall be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny referred to in Article 112(2).\nArticle 34\nA depositary shall, in accordance with the national law of the investment company’s home Member State, be liable to the investment company and the unit-holders for any loss suffered by them as a result of its unjustifiable failure to perform its obligations, or its improper performance of them.\nArticle 35\n1.   No company shall act as both investment company and depositary.\n2.   In carrying out its role as depositary, the depositary shall act solely in the interests of the unit-holders.\nArticle 36\nThe law or the instruments of incorporation of the investment company shall lay down the conditions for the replacement of the depositary and rules to ensure the protection of unit-holders in the event of such replacement.\nCHAPTER VI\nMERGERS OF UCITS\nSECTION 1\nPrinciple, authorisation and approval\nArticle 37\nFor the purposes of this Chapter, a UCITS shall include investment compartments thereof.\nArticle 38\n1.

Once the file is complete, the competent authorities of the merging UCITS home Member State shall immediately transmit copies of the information referred to in paragraph 2 to the competent authorities of the receiving UCITS home Member State. The competent authorities of the merging and the receiving UCITS home Member State shall, respectively, consider the potential impact of the proposed merger on unit-holders of the merging and the receiving UCITS to assess whether appropriate information is being provided to unit-holders.\nIf the competent authorities of the merging UCITS home Member State consider it necessary, they may require, in writing, that the information to unit-holders of the merging UCITS be clarified.\nIf the competent authorities of the receiving UCITS home Member State consider it necessary, they may require, in writing, and no later than 15 working days of receipt of the copies of the complete information referred to in paragraph 2, that the receiving UCITS modify the information to be provided to its unit-holders.\nIn such a case, the competent authorities of the receiving UCITS home Member State shall send an indication of their dissatisfaction to the competent authorities of the merging UCITS home Member State. They shall inform the competent authorities of the merging UCITS home Member State whether they are satisfied with the modified information to be provided to the unit-holders of the receiving UCITS within 20 working days of being notified thereof.\n4.   The competent authorities of the merging UCITS home Member State shall authorise the proposed merger if the following conditions are met:\n(a)\nthe proposed merger complies with all of the requirements of Articles 39 to 42;\n(b)\nthe receiving UCITS has been notified, in accordance with Article 93, to market its units in all Member States where the merging UCITS is either authorised or has been notified to market its units in accordance with Article 93; and\n(c)\nthe competent authorities of the merging and the receiving UCITS home Member State are satisfied with the proposed information to be provided to unit-holders, or no indication of dissatisfaction from the competent authorities of the receiving UCITS home Member State has been received under the fourth subparagraph of paragraph 3.\n5.   If the competent authorities of the merging UCITS home Member State consider that the file is not complete, they shall request additional information within 10 working days of receiving the information referred to in paragraph 2.\nThe competent authorities of the merging UCITS home Member State shall inform the merging UCITS, within 20 working days of submission of the complete information, in accordance with paragraph 2, whether or not the merger has been authorised.\nThe competent authorities of the merging UCITS home Member State shall also inform the competent authorities of the receiving UCITS home Member State of their decision.\n6.   Member States may, in accordance with the second subparagraph of Article 57(1), provide for a derogation from Articles 52 to 55 for receiving UCITS.\nArticle 40\n1.   Member States shall require that the merging and the receiving UCITS draw up common draft terms of merger.\nThe common draft terms of merger shall set out the following particulars:\n(a)\nan identification of the type of merger and of the UCITS involved;\n(b)\nthe background to and rationale for the proposed merger;\n(c)\nthe expected impact of the proposed merger on the unit-holders of both the merging and the receiving UCITS;\n(d)\nthe criteria adopted for valuation of the assets and, where applicable, the liabilities on the date for calculating the exchange ratio as referred to in Article 47(1);\n(e)\nthe calculation method of the exchange ratio;\n(f)\nthe planned effective date of the merger;\n(g)\nthe rules applicable, respectively, to the transfer of assets and the exchange of units; and\n(h)\nin the case of a merger pursuant to point (p)(ii) of Article 2(1) and, where applicable, point (p)(iii) of Article 2(1), the fund rules or instruments of incorporation of the newly constituted receiving UCITS.\nThe competent authorities shall not require that any additional information is included in the common draft terms of mergers.\n2.   The merging UCITS and the receiving UCITS may decide to include further items in the common draft terms of merger.\nSECTION 2\nThird-party control, information of unit-holders and other rights of unit-holders\nArticle 41\nMember States shall require that the depositaries of the merging and of the receiving UCITS verify the conformity of the particulars set out in points (a), (f) and (g) of Article 40(1) with the requirements of this Directive and the fund rules or instruments of incorporation of their respective UCITS.\nArticle 42\n1.   The law of the merging UCITS home Member States shall entrust either a depositary or an independent auditor, approved in accordance with Directive 2006/43/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 May 2006 on statutory audits of annual accounts and consolidated accounts (13), to validate the following:\n(a)\nthe criteria adopted for valuation of the assets and, where applicable, the liabilities on the date for calculating the exchange ratio, as referred to in Article 47(1);\n(b)\nwhere applicable, the cash payment per unit; and\n(c)\nthe calculation method of the exchange ratio as well as the actual exchange ratio determined at the date for calculating that ratio, as referred to in Article 47(1).\n2.   The statutory auditors of the merging UCITS or the statutory auditor of the receiving UCITS shall be considered independent auditors for the purposes of paragraph 1.\n3.   A copy of the reports of the independent auditor, or, where applicable, the depositary shall be made available on request and free of charge to the unit-holders of both the merging UCITS and the receiving UCITS and to their respective competent authorities.\nArticle 43\n1.   Member States shall require merging and receiving UCITS to provide appropriate and accurate information on the proposed merger to their respective unit-holders so as to enable them to make an informed judgement of the impact of the proposal on their investment.\n2.   That information shall be provided to unit-holders of the merging and of the receiving UCITS only after the competent authorities of the merging UCITS home Member State have authorised the proposed merger under Article 39.\nIt shall be provided at least 30 days before the last date for requesting repurchase or redemption or, where applicable, conversion without additional charge under Article 45(1).\n3.   The information to be provided to unit-holders of the merging and of the receiving UCITS, shall include appropriate and accurate information on the proposed merger such as to enable them to take an informed decision on the possible impact thereof on their investment and to exercise their rights under Articles 44 and 45.\nIt shall include the following:\n(a)\nthe background to and the rationale for the proposed merger;\n(b)\nthe possible impact of the proposed merger on unit-holders, including but not limited to any material differences in respect of investment policy and strategy, costs, expected outcome, periodic reporting, possible dilution in performance, and, where relevant, a prominent warning to investors that their tax treatment may be changed following the merger;\n(c)\nany specific rights unit-holders have in relation to the proposed merger, including but not limited to the right to obtain additional information, the right to obtain a copy of the report of the independent auditor or the depositary on request, and the right to request the repurchase or redemption or, where applicable, the conversion of their units without charge as specified in Article 45(1) and the last date for exercising that right;\n(d)\nthe relevant procedural aspects and the planned effective date of the merger; and\n(e)\na copy of the key investor information, referred to in Article 78, of the receiving UCITS.\n4.   If the merging or the receiving UCITS has been notified in accordance with Article 93, the information referred to in paragraph 3 shall be provided in the official language, or one of the official languages, of the relevant UCITS host Member State, or in a language approved by its competent authorities. The UCITS required to provide the information shall be responsible for producing the translation. That translation shall faithfully reflect the content of the original.\n5.   The Commission may adopt implementing measures specifying the detailed content, format and method by which to provide the information referred to in paragraphs 1 and 3.\nThose measures, designed to amend non-essential elements of this Directive by supplementing it, shall be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny referred to in Article 112(2).\nArticle 44\nWhere the national laws of Member States require approval by the unit-holders of mergers between UCITS, Member States shall ensure that such approval does not require more than 75 % of the votes actually cast by unit-holders present or represented at the general meeting of unit-holders.\nThe first paragraph shall be without prejudice to any presence quorum provided for under national laws. Member States shall impose neither more stringent presence quorums for cross-border than for domestic mergers nor more stringent presence quorums for UCITS mergers than for mergers of corporate entities.\nArticle 45\n1.   The laws of Member States shall provide that unit-holders of both the merging and the receiving UCITS have the right to request, without any charge other than those retained by the UCITS to meet disinvestment costs, the repurchase or redemption of their units or, where possible, to convert them into units in another UCITS with similar investment policies and managed by the same management company or by any other company with which the management company is linked by common management or control, or by a substantial direct or indirect holding. That right shall become effective from the moment that the unit-holders of the merging UCITS and those of the receiving UCITS, have been informed of the proposed merger in accordance with Article 43 and shall cease to exist five working days before the date for calculating the exchange ratio referred to in Article 47(1).\n2.   Without prejudice to paragraph 1, for mergers between UCITS and by way of derogation from Article 84(1), Member States may allow the competent authorities to require or to allow the temporary suspension of the subscription, repurchase or redemption of units provided that such suspension is justified for the protection of the unit-holders.\nSECTION 3\nCosts and entry into effect\nArticle 46\nExcept in cases where UCITS have not designated a management company, Member States shall ensure that any legal, advisory or administrative costs associated with the preparation and the completion of the merger shall not be charged to the merging or the receiving UCITS, or to any of their unit-holders.\nArticle 47\n1.   For domestic mergers, the laws of the Member States shall determine the date on which a merger takes effect as well as the date for calculating the exchange ratio of units of the merging UCITS into units of the receiving UCITS and, where applicable, for determining the relevant net asset value for cash payments.\nFor cross-border mergers, the laws of the receiving UCITS home Member State shall determine those dates. Member States shall ensure that, where applicable, those dates are after the approval of the merger by unit-holders of the receiving UCITS or the merging UCITS.\n2.   The entry into effect of the merger shall be made public through all appropriate means in the manner prescribed by the laws of the receiving UCITS home Member State, and shall be notified to the competent authorities of the home Member States of the receiving and the merging UCITS.\n3.   A merger which has taken effect as provided for in paragraph 1 shall not be declared null and void.\nArticle 48\n1.   A merger effected in accordance with point (p)(i) of Article 2(1) shall have the following consequences:\n(a)\nall the assets and liabilities of the merging UCITS are transferred to the receiving UCITS or, where applicable, to the depositary of the receiving UCITS;\n(b)\nthe unit-holders of the merging UCITS become unit-holders of the receiving UCITS and, where applicable, they are entitled to a cash payment not exceeding 10 % of the net asset value of their units in the merging UCITS; and\n(c)\nthe merging UCITS cease to exist on the entry into effect of the merger.\n2.   A merger effected in accordance with point (p)(ii) of Article 2(1) shall have the following consequences:\n(a)\nall the assets and liabilities of the merging UCITS are transferred to the newly constituted receiving UCITS or, where applicable, to the depositary of the receiving UCITS;\n(b)\nthe unit-holders of the merging UCITS become unit-holders of the newly constituted receiving UCITS and, where applicable, they are entitled to a cash payment not exceeding 10 % of the net asset value of their units in the merging UCITS; and\n(c)\nthe merging UCITS cease to exist on the entry into effect of the merger.\n3.   A merger effected in accordance with point (p)(iii) of Article 2(1) shall have the following consequences:\n(a)\nthe net assets of the merging UCITS are transferred to the receiving UCITS or, where applicable, the depositary of the receiving UCITS;\n(b)\nthe unit-holders of the merging UCITS become unit-holders of the receiving UCITS; and\n(c)\nthe merging UCITS continues to exist until the liabilities have been discharged.\n4.   Member States shall provide for the establishment of a procedure whereby the management company of the receiving UCITS confirms to the depositary of the receiving UCITS that transfer of assets and, where applicable, liabilities is complete. Where the receiving UCITS has not designated a management company, it shall give that confirmation to the depositary of the receiving UCITS.\nCHAPTER VII\nOBLIGATIONS CONCERNING THE INVESTMENT POLICIES OF UCITS\nArticle 49\nWhere UCITS comprise more than one investment compartment, each compartment shall be regarded as a separate UCITS for the purposes of this Chapter.\nArticle 50\n1.   The investments of a UCITS shall comprise only one or more of the following:\n(a)\ntransferable securities and money market instruments admitted to or dealt in on a regulated market as defined in Article 4(1)(14) of Directive 2004/39/EC;\n(b)\ntransferable securities and money market instruments dealt in on another regulated market in a Member State, which operates regularly and is recognised and open to the public;\n(c)\ntransferable securities and money market instruments admitted to official listing on a stock exchange in a third country or dealt in on another regulated market in a third country which operates regularly and is recognised and open to the public provided that the choice of stock exchange or market has been approved by the competent authorities or is provided for in law or the fund rules or the instruments of incorporation of the investment company;\n(d)\nrecently issued transferable securities, provided that:\n(i)\nthe terms of issue include an undertaking that an application will be made for admission to official listing on a stock exchange or to another regulated market which operates regularly and is recognised and open to the public, provided that the choice of stock exchange or market has been approved by the competent authorities or is provided for in law or the fund rules or the instruments of incorporation of the investment company; and\n(ii)\nthe admission referred to in point (i) is secured within a year of issue;\n(e)\nunits of UCITS authorised according to this Directive or other collective investment undertakings within the meaning of Article 1(2)(a) and (b), whether or not established in a Member State, provided that:\n(i)\nsuch other collective investment undertakings are authorised under laws which provide that they are subject to supervision considered by the competent authorities of the UCITS home Member State to be equivalent to that laid down in Community law, and that cooperation between authorities is sufficiently ensured;\n(ii)\nthe level of protection for unit-holders in the other collective investment undertakings is equivalent to that provided for unit-holders in a UCITS, and in particular that the rules on asset segregation, borrowing, lending, and uncovered sales of transferable securities and money market instruments are equivalent to the requirements of this Directive;\n(iii)\nthe business of the other collective investment undertakings is reported in half-yearly and annual reports to enable an assessment to be made of the assets and liabilities, income and operations over the reporting period;

A UCITS shall not, however:\n(a)\ninvest more than 10 % of its assets in transferable securities or money market instruments other than those referred to in paragraph 1; or\n(b)\nacquire either precious metals or certificates representing them.\nUCITS may hold ancillary liquid assets.\n3.   An investment company may acquire movable or immovable property which is essential for the direct pursuit of its business.\nArticle 51\n1.   A management or investment company shall employ a risk-management process which enables it to monitor and measure at any time the risk of the positions and their contribution to the overall risk profile of the portfolio.\nIt shall employ a process for accurate and independent assessment of the value of OTC derivatives.\nIt shall communicate to the competent authorities of its home Member State regularly in regard to the types of derivative instruments, the underlying risks, the quantitative limits and the methods which are chosen in order to estimate the risks associated with transactions in derivative instruments regarding each managed UCITS.\n2.   Member States may authorise UCITS to employ techniques and instruments relating to transferable securities and money market instruments under the conditions and within the limits which they lay down provided that such techniques and instruments are used for the purpose of efficient portfolio management.\nWhen those operations concern the use of derivative instruments, the conditions and limits shall conform to the provisions laid down in this Directive.\nUnder no circumstances shall those operations cause the UCITS to diverge from its investment objectives as laid down in the UCITS’ fund rules, instruments of incorporation or prospectus.\n3.   A UCITS shall ensure that its global exposure relating to derivative instruments does not exceed the total net value of its portfolio.\nThe exposure is calculated taking into account the current value of the underlying assets, the counterparty risk, future market movements and the time available to liquidate the positions. This shall also apply to the third and fourth subparagraphs.\nA UCITS may invest, as a part of its investment policy and within the limit laid down in Article 52(5), in financial derivative instruments provided that the exposure to the underlying assets does not exceed in aggregate the investment limits laid down in Article 52. Member States may provide that, when a UCITS invests in index-based financial derivative instruments, those investments are not required to be combined for the purposes of the limits laid down in Article 52.\nWhen transferable securities or money market instruments embed a derivative, the derivative shall be taken into account when complying with the requirements of this Article.\n4.   Without prejudice to Article 116, the Commission shall adopt, by 1 July 2010, implementing measures specifying the following:\n(a)\ncriteria for assessing the adequacy of the risk management process employed by the management company in accordance with the first subparagraph of paragraph 1;\n(b)\ndetailed rules regarding the accurate and independent assessment of the value of OTC derivatives; and\n(c)\ndetailed rules regarding the content of and procedure to be followed for communicating the information referred to in the third subparagraph of paragraph 1 to the competent authorities of the management company’s home Member State.\nThose measures, designed to amend non-essential elements of this Directive by supplementing it, shall be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny referred to in Article 112(2).\nArticle 52\n1.   A UCITS shall invest no more than:\n(a)\n5 % of its assets in transferable securities or money market instruments issued by the same body; or\n(b)\n20 % of its assets in deposits made with the same body.\nThe risk exposure to a counterparty of the UCITS in an OTC derivative transaction shall not exceed either:\n(a)\n10 % of its assets when the counterparty is a credit institution referred to in Article 50(1)(f); or\n(b)\n5 % of its assets, in other cases.\n2.   Member States may raise the 5 % limit laid down in the first subparagraph of paragraph 1 to a maximum of 10 %. If they do so, however, the total value of the transferable securities and the money market instruments held by the UCITS in the issuing bodies in each of which it invests more than 5 % of its assets shall not exceed 40 % of the value of its assets. That limitation shall not apply to deposits or OTC derivative transactions made with financial institutions subject to prudential supervision.\nNotwithstanding the individual limits laid down in paragraph 1, a UCITS shall not combine, where this would lead to investment of more than 20 % of its assets in a single body, any of the following:\n(a)\ninvestments in transferable securities or money market instruments issued by that body;\n(b)\ndeposits made with that body; or\n(c)\nexposures arising from OTC derivative transactions undertaken with that body.\n3.   Member States may raise the 5 % limit laid down in the first subparagraph of paragraph 1 to a maximum of 35 % if the transferable securities or money market instruments are issued or guaranteed by a Member State, by its local authorities, by a third country or by a public international body to which one or more Member States belong.\n4.   Member States may raise the 5 % limit laid down in the first subparagraph of paragraph 1 to a maximum of 25 % where bonds are issued by a credit institution which has its registered office in a Member State and is subject by law to special public supervision designed to protect bond-holders. In particular, sums deriving from the issue of those bonds shall be invested in accordance with the law in assets which, during the whole period of validity of the bonds, are capable of covering claims attaching to the bonds and which, in the event of failure of the issuer, would be used on a priority basis for the reimbursement of the principal and payment of the accrued interest.\nWhere a UCITS invests more than 5 % of its assets in the bonds referred to in the first subparagraph which are issued by a single issuer, the total value of these investments shall not exceed 80 % of the value of the assets of the UCITS.\nMember States shall send to the Commission a list of the categories of bonds referred to in the first subparagraph together with the categories of issuers authorised, in accordance with the laws and supervisory arrangements mentioned in that subparagraph, to issue bonds complying with the criteria set out in this Article. A notice specifying the status of the guarantees offered shall be attached to those lists. The Commission shall immediately forward that information to the other Member States together with any comments which it considers appropriate and shall make the information available to the public. Such communications may be the subject of exchanges of views within the European Securities Committee referred to in Article 112(1).\n5.   The transferable securities and money market instruments referred to in paragraphs 3 and 4 shall not be taken into account for the purpose of applying the limit of 40 % referred to in paragraph 2.\nThe limits provided for in paragraphs 1 to 4 shall not be combined, and thus investments in transferable securities or money market instruments issued by the same body or in deposits or derivative instruments made with this body carried out in accordance with paragraphs 1 to 4 shall not exceed in total 35 % of the assets of the UCITS.\nCompanies which are included in the same group for the purposes of consolidated accounts, as defined in Directive 83/349/EEC or in accordance with recognised international accounting rules, shall be regarded as a single body for the purpose of calculating the limits contained in this Article.\nMember States may allow cumulative investment in transferable securities and money market instruments within the same group up to a limit of 20 %.\nArticle 53\n1.   Without prejudice to the limits laid down in Article 56, Member States may raise the limits laid down in Article 52 to a maximum of 20 % for investment in shares or debt securities issued by the same body when, according to the fund rules or instruments of incorporation, the aim of the UCITS’ investment policy is to replicate the composition of a certain stock or debt securities index which is recognised by the competent authorities, on the following basis:\n(a)\nits composition is sufficiently diversified;\n(b)\nthe index represents an adequate benchmark for the market to which it refers; and\n(c)\nit is published in an appropriate manner.\n2.   Member States may raise the limit laid down in paragraph 1 to a maximum of 35 % where that proves to be justified by exceptional market conditions in particular in regulated markets where certain transferable securities or money market instruments are highly dominant. The investment up to that limit shall be permitted only for a single issuer.\nArticle 54\n1.

The UCITS referred to in paragraph 1 shall make express mention in the fund rules or in the instruments of incorporation of the investment company of the Member States, local authorities, or public international bodies issuing or guaranteeing securities in which they intend to invest more than 35 % of their assets.\nSuch fund rules or instruments of incorporation shall be approved by the competent authorities.\n3.

A Member State may waive the application of paragraphs 1 and 2 as regards:\n(a)\ntransferable securities and money market instruments issued or guaranteed by a Member State or its local authorities;\n(b)\ntransferable securities and money market instruments issued or guaranteed by a third country;\n(c)\ntransferable securities and money market instruments issued by a public international body to which one or more Member States belong;\n(d)\nshares held by a UCITS in the capital of a company incorporated in a third country investing its assets mainly in the securities of issuing bodies having their registered offices in that country, where under the legislation of that country such a holding represents the only way in which the UCITS can invest in the securities of issuing bodies of that country; or\n(e)\nshares held by an investment company or investment companies in the capital of subsidiary companies pursuing only the business of management, advice or marketing in the country where the subsidiary is established, in regard to the repurchase of units at unit-holders’ request exclusively on its or their behalf.\nThe derogation referred to in point (d) of the first subparagraph of this paragraph shall apply only if in its investment policy the company from the third country complies with the limits laid down in Articles 52 and 55 and in paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Article. Where the limits set in Articles 52 and 55 are exceeded, Article 57 shall apply mutatis mutandis.\nArticle 57\n1.

If the limits referred to in paragraph 1 are exceeded for reasons beyond the control of a UCITS or as a result of the exercise of subscription rights, that UCITS shall adopt as a priority objective for its sales transactions the remedying of that situation, taking due account of the interests of its unit-holders.\nCHAPTER VIII\nMASTER-FEEDER STRUCTURES\nSECTION 1\nScope and approval\nArticle 58\n1.

The authorities of the UCITS home Member State shall be competent to supervise that UCITS including, where relevant, pursuant to Article 19.

The competent authorities shall be given all supervisory and investigatory powers that are necessary for the exercise of their functions.

Member States shall lay down the rules on measures and penalties applicable to infringements of the national provisions adopted pursuant to this Directive and shall take all measures necessary to ensure that those rules are enforced. Without prejudice to the procedures for the withdrawal of authorisation or to the right of Member States to impose criminal penalties, Member States shall, in particular, ensure, in conformity with their national law, that the appropriate administrative measures can be taken or administrative penalties be imposed against the persons responsible where the provisions adopted in the implementation of this Directive have not been complied with.\nThe measures and penalties provided for shall be effective, proportionate and dissuasive.\n2.   Without precluding rules on measures and penalties applicable to infringements of the other national provisions adopted pursuant to this Directive, Member States shall, in particular, lay down effective, proportionate and dissuasive measures and penalties concerning the duty to present key investor information in a way that is likely to be understood by retail investors according to Article 78(5).\n3.

The competent authorities of the Member States shall immediately provide each other with the information required for the purposes of carrying out their duties under this Directive.\n3.   Where a competent authority of one Member State has good reason to suspect that acts contrary to the provisions of this Directive, are being or have been carried out by entities not subject to that competent authority’s supervision on the territory of another Member State, it shall notify the competent authorities of the other Member State thereof in as specific a manner as possible. The recipient authorities shall take appropriate action, shall inform the notifying competent authority of the outcome of that action and, to the extent possible, of significant interim developments. This paragraph shall be without prejudice to the competences of the notifying competent authority.\n4.   The competent authorities of one Member State may request the cooperation of the competent authorities of another Member State in a supervisory activity or for an on-the-spot verification or in an investigation on the territory of the latter within the framework of their powers pursuant to this Directive. Where a competent authority receives a request with respect to an on-the-spot verification or investigation, it shall:\n(a)\ncarry out the verification or investigation itself;\n(b)\nallow the requesting authority to carry out the verification or investigation; or\n(c)\nallow auditors or experts to carry out the verification or investigation.\n5.   If the verification or investigation is carried out on the territory of one Member State by a competent authority of the same Member State, the competent authority of the Member State which has requested cooperation may request that its own officials accompany the officials carrying out the verification or investigation. The verification or investigation shall, however, be subject to the overall control of the Member State on whose territory it is conducted.\nIf the verification or investigation is carried out on the territory of one Member State by a competent authority of another Member State, the competent authority of the Member State on whose territory the verification or investigation is carried out may request that its own officials accompany the officials carrying out the verification or investigation.\n6.   The competent authorities of the Member State where the verification or investigation is carried out may refuse to exchange information as provided for in paragraph 2 or to act on a request for cooperation in carrying out an investigation or on-the-spot verification as provided for in paragraph 4, only where:\n(a)\nsuch an investigation, on-the-spot verification or exchange of information might adversely affect the sovereignty, security or public policy of that Member State;\n(b)\njudicial proceedings have already been initiated in respect of the same persons and the same actions before the authorities of that Member State;\n(c)\nfinal judgment in respect of the same persons and the same actions has already been delivered in that Member State.\n7.

Member States shall provide that all persons who work or who have worked for the competent authorities, as well as auditors and experts instructed by the competent authorities, be bound by the obligation of professional secrecy. Such obligation implies that no confidential information which those persons receive in the course of their duties shall be divulged to any person or authority whatsoever, save in summary or aggregate form such that UCITS, management companies and depositaries (undertakings contributing towards UCITS’ business activity) cannot be individually identified, without prejudice to cases covered by criminal law.\nHowever, when a UCITS or an undertaking contributing towards its business activity has been declared bankrupt or is being compulsorily wound up, confidential information which does not concern third parties involved in rescue attempts may be divulged in the course of civil or commercial proceedings.\n2.   Paragraph 1 shall not prevent the competent authorities of the Member States from exchanging information in accordance with this Directive or other Community law applicable to UCITS or to undertakings contributing towards their business activity. That information shall be subject to the conditions of professional secrecy laid down in paragraph 1.\nThe competent authorities exchanging information with other competent authorities under this Directive may indicate at the time of communication that such information must not be disclosed without their express consent, in which case such information may be exchanged solely for the purposes for which those authorities gave their consent.\n3.   Member States may conclude cooperation agreements providing for exchange of information with the competent authorities of third countries, or with authorities or bodies of third countries, as determined in paragraph 5 of this Article and Article 103(1) only if the information disclosed is subject to guarantees of professional secrecy at least equivalent to those referred to in this Article.

Member States shall communicate to the Commission and to the other Member States the names of the authorities which may receive information pursuant to paragraph 1.\n4.   Notwithstanding Article 102(1) to (4), Member States may, with the aim of strengthening the stability, including the integrity, of the financial system, authorise the exchange of information between the competent authorities and the authorities or bodies responsible under the law for the detection and investigation of breaches of company law.\n5.   Member States which have recourse to the derogation provided for in paragraph 4 shall require that at least the following conditions are met:\n(a)\nthe information is used for the purpose of performing the task referred to in paragraph 4;\n(b)\nthe information received is subject to the conditions of professional secrecy provided for in Article 102(1); and\n(c)\nwhere the information originates in another Member State, it is not disclosed without the express consent of the competent authorities which have disclosed it and, where appropriate, solely for the purposes for which those authorities gave their consent.\nFor the purposes of point (c), the authorities or bodies referred to in paragraph 4 shall communicate to the competent authorities which have disclosed the information the names and precise responsibilities of the persons to whom it is to be sent.\n6.   Where, in a Member State, the authorities or bodies referred to in paragraph 4 perform their task of detection or investigation with the aid, in view of their specific competence, of persons appointed for that purpose and not employed in the public sector the possibility of exchanging information provided for in that paragraph may be extended to such persons under the conditions stipulated in paragraph 5.\n7.   Member States shall communicate to the Commission and to the other Member States the names of the authorities or bodies which may receive information pursuant to paragraph 4.\nArticle 104\n1.   Articles 102 and 103 shall not prevent a competent authority from transmitting to central banks and other bodies with a similar function in their capacity as monetary authorities information intended for the performance of their tasks, nor shall those articles prevent such authorities or bodies from communicating to the competent authorities such information as they may need for the purposes of Article 102(4). Information received in this context shall be subject to the conditions of professional secrecy imposed in Article 102(1).\n2.   Articles 102 and 103 shall not prevent the competent authorities from communicating the information referred to in Article 102(1) to (4) to a clearing house or other similar body recognised under national law for the provision of clearing or settlement services for one of their Member State’s markets if they consider that it is necessary to communicate the information in order to ensure the proper functioning of those bodies in relation to defaults or potential defaults by market participants.\nThe information received in this context shall be subject to the conditions of professional secrecy imposed in Article 102(1).\nMember States shall, however, ensure that information received under Article 102(2) is not disclosed in the circumstances referred to in the first subparagraph of this paragraph without the express consent of the competent authorities which disclosed it.\n3.   Notwithstanding Article 102(1) and (4), Member States may, by virtue of provisions laid down by law, authorise the disclosure of certain information to other departments of their central government administrations responsible for legislation on the supervision of UCITS and of undertakings contributing towards their business activity, credit institutions, financial institutions, investment undertakings and insurance undertakings and to inspectors instructed by those departments.\nSuch disclosures may, however, be made only where necessary for reasons of prudential control.\nMember States shall, however, provide that information received under Article 102(2) and (5) is never disclosed in the circumstances referred to in this paragraph except with the express consent of the competent authorities which disclosed the information.\nArticle 105\nThe Commission may adopt implementing measures relating to the procedures for exchange of information between competent authorities.\nThose measures shall be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure referred to in Article 112(3).\nArticle 106\n1.

The disclosure in good faith to the competent authorities, by persons approved in accordance with Directive 2006/43/EC of any fact or decision referred to in paragraph 1 shall not constitute a breach of any restriction on disclosure of information imposed by contract or by any legislative, regulatory or administrative provision and shall not subject such persons to liability of any kind.\nArticle 107\n1.   The competent authorities shall give written reasons for any decision to refuse authorisation, or any negative decision taken in the implementation of the general measures adopted in application of this Directive, and communicate them to applicants.\n2.

In so far as it is necessary for the purpose of exercising the powers of supervision of the home Member State, the competent authorities of the management company’s host Member State shall inform the competent authorities of the management company’s home Member State of any measures taken by the management company’s host Member State pursuant to Article 21(5) which involve measures or penalties imposed on a management company or restrictions on a management company’s activities.\n3.   The competent authorities of the management company’s home Member State shall, without delay, notify the competent authorities of the UCITS home Member State of any problem identified at the level of the management company which may materially affect the ability of the management company to perform its duties properly with respect to the UCITS or of any breach of the requirements under Chapter III.\n4.   The competent authorities of the UCITS home Member State shall, without delay, notify the competent authorities of the management company’s home Member State of any problem identified at the level of the UCITS which may materially affect the ability of the management company to perform its duties properly or to comply with the requirements of this Directive which fall under the responsibility of the UCITS home Member State.\nArticle 110\n1.   Each management company’s host Member State shall ensure that where a management company authorised in another Member State pursues business within its territory through a branch the competent authorities of the management company’s home Member State may, after informing the competent authorities of the management company’s host Member State, themselves or through the intermediary they instruct for the purpose, carry out on-the-spot verification of the information referred to in Article 109.\n2.

By way of derogation from Article 16, the Member States may authorise management companies to issue bearer certificates representing the registered securities of other companies.\nArticle 114\n1.

"Strengthening the global competitiveness of EU investment funds\nStrengthening the global competitiveness of EU investment funds\nSUMMARY OF:\nDirective 2009/65/EC — rules relating to undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities (UCITS)\nWHAT IS THE AIM OF THE DIRECTIVE?\n              \nThe main aims of the directive are as follows.\nTo offer investors a wider choice of product at lower cost through: a more efficient market in undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities (UCITS)* in the European Union (EU);better investor information; andmore efficient supervision of funds.\nTo keep the EU’s investment sector competitive by adjusting the rules to market developments.\nKEY POINTS\n              \nIt lays down uniform rules on investment funds, allowing the cross-border offer of investment funds regulated at EU level.\nThe directive lays down rules on:\ninvestor information via a standardised summary information document to make it easier for the consumer to understand the product;\na genuine EU passport for UCITS management companies, which will allow a management company located in one EU Member State to manage funds in other Member States;\nmarketing of UCITS in other countries, for example by simplifying administrative procedures;\nmergers of UCITS in other countries;\nstronger supervision of UCITS and of the companies that manage them, e.g. through enhanced cooperation between national financial services supervisors.\nAmendments to Directive 2009/65/EC\nAmending Directive 2014/91/EU (UCITS V) introduced new rules on UCITS depositaries (the asset-keeping entity), including the entities eligible to assume this role, their tasks, delegation arrangements and the liability of depositaries.\nAmending Regulation (EU) 2017/2402 complements Directive 2009/65/EC with requirements for UCITS assuming exposure to securitisation (see summary).\nAmending Directive (EU) 2019/1160 introduced rules to remove regulatory barriers that previously hindered the cross-border distribution of investment funds to make their distribution easier, faster and less costly.\nAmending Directive (EU) 2019/2034 introduced a new regulatory framework for investment firms (see summary).\nAmending Directive (EU) 2019/2162 aims to protect investors by establishing minimum EU-wide harmonised rules, especially on definitions and standards, for covered bonds* issued by credit institutions* (see summary). It remedies the fact that Directive 2009/65/EC did not specify the nature and content of a special supervision framework — an element defining covered bonds — or the authorities that should be responsible for performing such supervision . It also sets out the tasks and responsibilities of the national competent authorities in this regard.\nAmending Directive (EU) 2021/2261 adds new rules to ensure key information documents set out in Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 (see summary) provided by investments companies or management companies of UCITS always satisfy the requirement applicable to key investor information set out in Directive 2009/65/EC.\nDirective 2009/65/EC was also supplemented by a delegated act adopted by the European Commission. Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2016/438 addresses non-market risks related to the depositaries’ activities. It covers aspects of depositaries’ duties such as: the safekeeping of UCITS assets;oversight duties (e.g. checking that UCITS investments are consistent with their investment strategies as described in their rules and offering documents or ensuring that UCITS do not breach their investment restrictions); andthe liability for the assets.\nDelegated Regulation (EU) 2016/438 also lays down specific due diligence requirements for insolvency protection of UCITS assets, along with detailed independence requirements for managers and custodians of UCITS.\nImplementing acts\nThe Commission has also adopted:\nRegulation (EU) No 583/2010 implementing Directive 2009/65/EC as regards key investor information and conditions to be met when providing key investor information or a prospectus in a durable medium other than paper, or by means of a website;\nRegulation (EU) No 584/2010 implementing Directive 2009/65/EC on the EU notification procedure for UCITS (see summary);\nImplementing Regulation (EU) 2016/1212 laying down technical standards with regard to standard procedures and forms for submitting information in accordance with Directive 2009/65/EC.\nFROM WHEN DOES THE DIRECTIVE APPLY?\nDirective 2009/65/EC has applied since 7 December 2009 and had to become law in the Member States by 30 June 2011.\nAmending Directive 2014/91/EU has applied since 17 September 2014 and had to become law in Member States by 18 March 2016.\nAmending Regulation (EU) 2017/2402 has applied since 1 January 2019.\nAmending Directive (EU) 2019/1160 has applied since 1 August 2019 and had to become law in Member States by 2 August 2021.\nAmending Directive (EU) 2019/2034 has applied since 25 December 2019 and had to become law in Member States by 26 June 2021.\nAmending Directive (EU) 2019/2162 has applied since 7 January 2020 and had to become law in Member States by 8 July 2021.\nBACKGROUND\n              \nDirective 2009/65/EC is the fourth version of UCITS legislation, replacing Directive 85/611/EEC.\nFor more information, see:\nUndertakings for collective investment in transferable securities (UCITS) (European Commission).\nKEY TERMS\n              \nUndertakings for collective investment in transferable securities (UCITS). Investment vehicles that pool investors’ capital and invest that capital collectively through a portfolio of financial instruments such as stocks, bonds and other securities.\nCovered bond. A debt obligation issued by a credit institution that is secured by assets to which its investors have direct recourse. The assets in question are usually a pool of mortgage loans or credits to the public sector, or other high-quality cover assets, that ensure that the credit institution issuing the covered bonds has a claim for payment and that are secured by collateral assets subject to strictly defined requirements.\nCredit institution. An undertaking which takes deposits or other repayable funds from the public in order to grant credit.\nMAIN DOCUMENT\n            \nDirective 2009/65/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 July 2009 on the coordination of laws, regulations and administrative provisions relating to undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities (UCITS) (OJ L 302, 17.11.2009, pp. 32–96).\nSuccessive amendments to Directive 2009/65/EC have been incorporated in the original text.
