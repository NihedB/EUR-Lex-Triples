The protection of fundamental principles and rights at work is a key aspect of that promotion.\n(2)\nThe Forced Labour Convention, 1930, of the International Labour Organisation, which the Protocol of 2014 supplements, is a fundamental ILO Convention and has a bearing on rules which make reference to core labour standards.\n(3)\nIn so far as the Protocol of 2014 to the Forced Labour Convention, 1930, of the International Labour Organisation (‘the Protocol’) covers the area of protection of victims of crime governed by Article 82(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), the Union has already adopted common rules which cover this area to a large extent, in particular through Directive 2011/36/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council (1) and Directive 2012/29/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council (2). The Protocol may affect those common rules.\n(4)\nArticle 19(4) of the ILO Constitution, on the adoption and ratification of Conventions, similarly applies to Protocols, which are binding international agreements, subject to ratification and linked to Conventions.\n(5)\nThe Union cannot ratify the Protocol as only States can be parties thereto.\n(6)\nMember States should therefore be authorised to ratify the Protocol, acting jointly in the interests of the Union, with regard to those parts falling within Union competence in accordance with Article 82(2) TFEU.\n(7)\nArticles 1 to 4 of the Protocol contain obligations relating to Union legislation concerning the protection of victims of crimes. As a consequence, those provisions fall within the scope of Title V of Part Three TFEU, in particular Article 82(2) thereof.\n(8)\nArticle 82(2) TFEU is the only legal basis that this Decision should be based on. The Protocol, in particular Article 4 thereof, also refers to the residence status of victims of forced or compulsory labour to the extent that this is required to enable those victims to have access to appropriate and effective remedies. However, this objective, which relates to Article 79 TFEU, is merely incidental whilst the objectives relating to Article 82(2) TFEU are identifiable as the predominant aim and component.\n(9)\nIn accordance with Articles 1 and 2 of Protocol No 22 on the position of Denmark, annexed to the Treaty on European Union and to the TFEU, Denmark is not taking part in the adoption of this Decision and is not bound by it or subject to its application.\n(10)\nThe United Kingdom and Ireland are bound by Directive 2011/36/EU and Directive 2012/29/EU, and are therefore taking part in the adoption of this Decision.\n(11)\nMember States should be authorised to ratify the Protocol with regard to matters relating to judicial cooperation in criminal matters contained in Articles 1 to 4 thereof. The parts of the Protocol falling within the competence conferred upon the Union, other than the parts related to judicial cooperation in criminal matters, will be subject to a Decision adopted in parallel to this Decision,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\nArticle 1\nMember States are hereby authorised to ratify, for the parts, contained in Articles 1 to 4 of the Protocol, falling within the competence conferred upon the European Union under Article 82(2) TFEU, the Protocol of 2014 to the Forced Labour Convention, 1930, of the International Labour Organisation.\nArticle 2\nMember States should take the necessary steps to deposit their instruments of ratification of the Protocol with the Director-General of the International Labour Office as soon as possible, preferably by 31 December 2016.\nArticle 3\nThis Decision is addressed to the Member States.\nDone at Brussels, 10 November 2015.\nFor the Council\nThe President\nP. GRAMEGNA\n(1)  Directive 2011/36/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 5 April 2011 on preventing and combating trafficking in human beings and protecting its victims, and replacing Council Framework Decision 2002/629/JHA (OJ L 101, 15.4.2011, p. 1).\n(2)  Directive 2012/29/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 October 2012 establishing minimum standards on the rights, support and protection of victims of crime, and replacing Council Framework Decision 2001/220/JHA (OJ L 315, 14.11.2012, p. 57).", "summary": "ILO Forced Labour Protocol: ratification by EU countries\nILO Forced Labour Protocol: ratification by EU countries\nSUMMARY OF:\nCouncil Decision (EU) 2015/2037 authorising EU countries to ratify the Protocol of 2014 to the Forced Labour Convention (1930), as regards matters relating to social policy\nCouncil Decision (EU) 2015/2071 authorising EU countries to ratify the Protocol of 2014 to the Forced Labour Convention (1930), as regards Articles 1 to 4 of the Protocol, relating to judicial cooperation in criminal matters\nSUMMARY\nWHAT DO THESE DECISIONS DO?\nThey authorise EU governments to ratify the Protocol which the International Labour Organisation (ILO) adopted in 2014 and call for them to do so by the end of 2016. This gives new impetus to ILO’s Forced Labour Convention of 1930 in preventing the use of forced labour, in particular in the context of trafficking in persons, protecting victims and providing access to remedies.\nKEY POINTS\nThe ILO Forced Labour Protocol covers areas of social policy and judicial cooperation in criminal matters which come under the EU’s competence.\nThe EU as such cannot ratify the protocol. Only individual EU countries may do so. The 2 decisions authorise EU governments to ratify the text, ‘acting jointly in the interests of the Union’.\nDecision 2015/2037 covers areas of social policy in the Protocol, such as the employment relationship, working time, temporary agency work, and health and safety at work which are already the object of EU legislation.\nDecision 2015/2071 covers criminal matters in the Protocol, such as the protection of victims of crime. The EU has already legislated in this area with directives on combating trafficking in human beings and protection of victims.\nOn the basis of its opt-out for the area of freedom, security and justice, Denmark is not bound by Decision 2015/2071.\nCountries ratifying the Forced Labour Protocol are required to develop a national policy and plan of action and engage in international cooperation for the suppression of forced labour, in consultation with social partners. They must take measures to prevent forced labour, to improve the protection of victims and to provide them access to remedies, including compensation.\nBACKGROUND\n              \nForced labour is work performed involuntarily and under coercion and is universally recognised as a crime since the ILO landmark Forced Labour Convention No 29 as adopted in 1930.\nHowever, the ILO estimates that 20.9 million people around the world are still victims of forced labour. The vast majority of them are now in the private economy, in particular in the form of trafficking for labour exploitation. The Forced Labour Protocol and Recommendation, adopted by the ILO in 2014, aim at stepping up the global fight against all forms of forced labour.\nFROM WHEN DO THE DECISIONS APPLY?\n              \nThey apply from 12 November 2015. EU countries should take the necessary steps to deposit their instruments of ratification by 31 December 2016.\nBACKGROUND\n              \nFor more information, see\nInternational Labour Standards on Forced Labour on the International Labour Organisation’s website\nACTS\n            \nCouncil Decision (EU) 2015/2037 of 10 November 2015 authorising Member States to ratify, in the interests of the European Union, the Protocol of 2014 to the Forced Labour Convention, 1930, of the International Labour Organisation with regard to matters relating to social policy (OJ L 298, 14.11.2015, pp. 23-24)\nCouncil Decision (EU) 2015/2071 of 10 November 2015 authorising Member States to ratify, in the interests of the European Union, the Protocol of 2014 to the Forced Labour Convention, 1930, of the International Labour Organisation as regards Articles 1 to 4 of the Protocol with regard to matters relating to judicial cooperation in criminal matters (OJ L 301, 18.11.2015, pp. 47-48)\nRELATED ACTS\nProtocol of 2014 to the Forced Labour Convention, 1930\nlast update 17.03.2016", "tags": ["International Labour Organisation", "protocol to an agreement", "ratification of an agreement", "EU Member State", "judicial cooperation in criminal matters in the EU", "slavery"], "subjects": ["Employment"], "split": "train", "reference_annotations": {"32015D2071_p1": {"text": "(1)  directive 2011/36/eu of the European Parliament and of the Council of 5 April 2011 on preventing and combating trafficking in human beings and protecting its victims, and replacing Council Framework decision 2002/629/jha (OJ L 101, 15.4.2011, p. 1).", "triples": [" directive 2011/36/eu,  replacing,  decision 2002/629/jha"]}, "32015D2071_p2": {"text": "(2)  directive 2012/29/eu of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 October 2012 establishing minimum standards on the rights, support and protection of victims of crime, and replacing Council Framework decision 2001/220/jha (OJ L 315, 14.11.2012, p. 57).", "triples": [" directive 2012/29/eu,  replacing,  decision 2001/220/jha"]}}, "summary_annotations": {}}
