Information exchangeThe competent type-approval authorities in Switzerland and the Member States shall in particular exchange the information referred to in Article 4(5) and (6) of Directive 70/156/EEC, as amended by Directive 92/53/EEC and as last adapted to technical progress by Commission Directive 98/14/EC.In the event of refusal by Switzerland or the Member States to grant type-approval in accordance with Article 4(2) of Directive 70/156/EEC, as amended by Directive 92/53/EEC, and as last adapted to technical progress by Commission Directive 98/14/EC, their competent authorities shall notify each other of their decision and give the reasons for it. The competent Swiss authority shall likewise inform the Commission thereof.2. Recognition of vehicle type-approvalSwitzerland shall also recognise vehicle type-approval granted before the entry into force of this Agreement in accordance with Directive 70/156/EEC, as amended by Directive 92/53/EEC, and as last adapted to technical progress by Commission Directive 98/14/EC, by the authorities responsible for type-approval listed in section II of this Chapter where that approval is still valid in the EC.The European Community shall recognise Swiss type-approval where Switzerland's requirements are deemed to be equivalent to those of Directive 70/156/EEC, as amended by Directive 92/53/EEC, and as last adapted to technical progress by Commission Directive 98/14/EC.Recognition of Swiss-issued type-approval shall be suspended should Switzerland fail to adapt its legislation to all the Community type-approval legislation in force.3. Vehicle type-approval safeguard clausesRegistration and entry into service1. Each Member State and Switzerland shall register, permit the sale or entry into service of new vehicles on grounds relating to their construction and functioning if, and only if, they are accompanied by a valid certificate of conformity. In the case of incomplete vehicles, each Member State and Switzerland may not prohibit the sale of such vehicles but may refuse their permanent registration and entry into service so long as they are not completed.2. Each Member State and Switzerland shall permit the sale or entry into service of components or separate technical units if, and only if, they comply with the requirements of the relevant separate Directive or the requirements of the Swiss legislation equivalent to the relevant separate Directive.3. If a Member State or Switzerland finds that vehicles, components or separate technical units of a particular type are a serious risk to road safety although they are accompanied by a valid certificate of conformity or are properly marked, it may, for a maximum period of six months, refuse to register such vehicles or may prohibit the sale or entry into service in its territory of such vehicles, components or separate technical units. It shall forthwith notify the other Member States, Switzerland and the Commission thereof, stating the reasons on which its decision is based. If the Member State or Switzerland which granted type-approval disputes the risk to road safety notified to it, the Member States or Switzerland concerned shall endeavour to settle the dispute. The Commission and the Committee shall be kept informed and shall, where necessary, hold appropriate consultations for the purpose of reaching a settlement.Measures related to the conformity of production1. When a Member State or Switzerland grants type-approval, it shall take the necessary measures in accordance with Annex X to Framework Directive 70/156/EEC, as amended by Directive 92/53/EEC, and as last adapted to technical progress by Commission Directive 98/14/EC, in relation to that approval to verify, if need be in cooperation with the approval authorities of the other Member States or Switzerland, that adequate arrangements have been made to ensure that vehicles, systems, components or separate technical units produced, conform to the approved type.2. When a Member State or Switzerland has granted a type approval, it shall take the necessary measures in accordance with Annex X to Framework Directive 70/156/EEC, as amended by Directive 92/53/EEC, and as last adapted to technical progress by Commission Directive 98/14/EC, in relation to that approval to verify, if need be in cooperation with the approval authorities of the other Member States or Switzerland, that the arrangements referred to in paragraph 1 continue to be adequate and that vehicles, systems, components or separate technical units produced, continue to conform to the approved type. Verification to ensure that products conform to the approved type shall be limited to the procedures set out in section 2 of Annex X to Framework Directive 70/156/EEC, as amended by Directive 92/53/EEC, and as last adapted to technical progress by Commission Directive 98/14/EC, and in those separate Directives that contain specific requirements.Nonconformity with the approved type1. There shall be failure to conform to the approved type where deviations from the particulars in the type-approval certificate and/or the information package are found to exist and where these deviations have not been authorised under Article 5 (3) or (4), by the Member States or Switzerland which granted the type-approval. A vehicle shall not be considered to deviate from the approved type where tolerances are permitted by separate Directives and these tolerances are respected.2. Where a Member State or Switzerland has granted type-approval and finds that vehicles, components or separate technical units accompanied by a certificate of conformity or bearing an approval mark do not conform to the type it has approved, it shall take the necessary measures to ensure that vehicles, components or separate technical units produced again conform to the approved type. The approval authorities of that Member State or Switzerland shall notify those of the other Member States and/or Switzerland of the measures taken which may extend to withdrawal of type-approval.3. If a Member State or Switzerland demonstrates that vehicles, components or separate technical units accompanied by a certificate of conformity or bearing an approval mark do not conform to the approved type, it may request the Member State or Switzerland which granted the type-approval to verify that vehicles, components or separate technical units produced conform to the approved type. Such action shall be taken as soon as possible and in any case within six months of the date of the request.4. In the case of:- a vehicle type-approval where the nonconformity of a vehicle arises exclusively from the nonconformity of a system, component or separate technical unit, or- a multi-stage type-approval where the nonconformity of a completed vehicle arises exclusively from the nonconformity of a system, component or separate technical unit being part of the incomplete vehicle, or of the incomplete vehicle itself, the vehicle-approval authority shall request the Member State(s) or Switzerland which granted any relevant system, component, separate technical unit or incomplete vehicle type-approval(s) to take the necessary action to ensure that vehicles produced again conform to the approved type. Such action shall be taken as soon as possible and in any case within six months of the date of the request, if necessary in conjunction with the Member State or Switzerland making the request.Where a failure to conform is established, the approval authorities of the Member State or Switzerland which granted the system, component or separate technical unit type-approval or the approval of the incomplete vehicle shall take the measures set out in paragraph 2 of Directive 70/156/EEC, as amended by Directive 92/53/EEC, and as last adapted to technical progress by Commission Directive 98/14/EC.5. The approval authorities of the Member States or Switzerland shall inform each other within one month of any withdrawal of type-approval and of the reasons for such a measure.6. If the Member State or Switzerland which granted type-approval disputes the failure to conform notified to it, the Member States concerned and Switzerland shall endeavour to settle the dispute. The Commission and the Committee shall be kept informed and shall, where necessary, hold appropriate consultations for the purpose of reaching a settlement.CHAPTER 13AGRICULTURAL OR FORESTRY TRACTORSSection ILegislative, regulatory and administrative provisionsProvisions covered by Article 1(2)>TABLE>Section IIConformity assessment bodiesThe Committee established under Article 10 of this Agreement shall draw up and keep up to date, according to the procedure described in Article 11 of the Agreement, a list of the authorities responsible for type-approval, technical services and testing bodies.European CommunitySwitzerlandAuthority responsible for type-approvalSwiss Federal Roads Office CH - 3003   BerneSection IIIDesignating authoritiesEuropean Community>TABLE>Section IVSpecial rules relating to the designation of conformity assessment bodiesFor the designation of conformity assessment bodies, the designating authorities shall refer to their respective legislative, regulatory and administrative provisions as listed in section I.Section VSupplementary provisionsInformation exchangeThe competent Member State's and Swiss authorities shall notify each other of conforming (Art. 5 and 6, Directive 74/150/EEC) or non-conforming (Art. 8, Directive 74/150/EEC) vehicles, devices and systems placed on the market.CHAPTER 14GOOD LABORATORY PRACTICE (GLP)Scope and coverageThe provisions of this Chapter shall apply to the testing of chemicals according to GLP, being either substances or preparations, covered by the legislative, regulatory and administrative provisions listed in section I.

CooperationBased on Article 9 of the Agreement, each Party may, on request, participate as an observer in an inspection of a test facility conducted by the authorities of the other Party with the consent of the test facility concerned in order to maintain a continuing understanding of the other Party's inspection procedures.CHAPTER 15MEDICINAL PRODUCTS GMP INSPECTION AND BATCH CERTIFICATIONScope and coverageThe provisions of this Sectoral Chapter cover all medicinal products which are industrially manufactured in Switzerland or the European Community, and to which Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) requirements apply.For medicinal products covered by this Chapter, each party shall recognise the conclusions of inspections of manufacturers carried out by the relevant inspection services of the other Party and the relevant manufacturing authorisations granted by the competent authorities of the other Party.The manufacturer's certification of the conformity of each batch to its specifications shall be recognised by the other Party without recontrol at import.In addition, official batch releases carried out by an authority of the exporting Party will be recognised by the other Party.\"Medicinal products\" means all products regulated by pharmaceutical legislation in the European Community and Switzerland as listed in Section I of this Chapter. The definition of medicinal products includes all human and veterinary products, such as chemical and biological pharmaceuticals, immunologicals, radio-pharmaceuticals, stable medicinal products derived from human blood or human plasma, pre-mixes for the preparation of veterinary medicated feedingstuffs and, where appropriate, vitamins, minerals, herbal remedies and homeopathic medicinal products.\"GMP\" is that part of quality assurance which ensures that products are consistently produced and controlled to the quality standards appropriate to their intended use and as required by the marketing authorisation and products specifications. For the purpose of this Chapter it includes the system whereby the manufacturer receives the specification of the product and the process from the marketing authorisation holder or applicant and ensures that the medicinal product is made in compliance with this specification (Equivalent to \"Qualified Person\" for certification in the EC).With respect to medicinal products covered by the legislation of one Party but not the other, the manufacturing company can request, for the purpose of this Agreement, an inspection be made by the locally competent inspection service. This provision shall apply i.a. to the manufacture of active pharmaceutical ingredients, intermediate products and investigational medicinal products, as well as to pre-marketing inspections. Operational arrangements are detailed under section III, paragraph 3.Certification of manufacturersAt the request of an exporter, importer or the competent authority of the other Party, the authorities responsible for granting manufacturing authorisations and for supervision of the manufacture of medicinal products shall certify that the manufacturer:- is appropriately authorised to manufacture the relevant medicinal product, or to carry out the relevant specified manufacturing operation- is regularly inspected by the authorities- complies with the national GMP requirements recognised as equivalent by the two parties, and which are listed in Section I of this Chapter. Should different GMP requirements be used as reference, this is to be mentioned in the certificate.The certificates shall also identify the site(s) of manufacture (and contract quality control laboratories, if any).Certificates shall be issued expeditiously, and the time taken should not exceed thirty calendar days. In exceptional cases, i.a. when a new inspection has to be carried out, this period may be extended to sixty days.Batch certificationEach batch exported shall be accompanied by a batch certificate established by the manufacturer (self-certification) after a full qualitative analysis, a quantitative analysis of all the active ingredients and all the other tests or checks necessary to ensure the quality of the product in accordance with the requirements of the marketing authorisation. This certificate shall attest that the batch meets its specifications and shall be kept by the importer of the batch. It will be made available upon request of the competent authority.When issuing a certificate, the manufacturer shall take account of the provisions of the current WHO certification scheme on the quality of pharmaceutical products moving in international commerce. The certificate shall detail the agreed specifications of the product, the reference of the analytical methods and the analytical results. It shall contain a statement that the batch processing and packaging records were reviewed and found in conformity with GMP. The batch certificate shall be signed by the person responsible for releasing the batch for sale or supply, i.e. in the European Community the \"qualified person\" referred to in Article 21 of Directive 75/319/EEC, and in Switzerland the responsible person referred to in Articles 4 and 5 of the Ordinance on immunobiological products, Articles 4 and 5 of the Ordinance on immunobiological products for veterinary use and Article 10 of the Directives of the IOCM on the manufacture of medicinal products.Official Batch ReleaseWhen an official batch release procedure applies, official batch releases carried out by an authority of the exporting Party (listed in section II) will be recognised by the other Party. The manufacturer shall provide the certificate of the official batch release.For the Community, the official batch release procedure is specified in document \"Control/Authority Batch Release of Vaccination and Blood Products of 24 September 1998\" and different specific batch release procedures. For Switzerland, the official batch release procedure is specified in Articles 22-27 of the Ordinance on immunobiological products, Articles 20-25 of the Ordinance on immunobiological products for veterinary use and Articles 4-6 of the Directives of the IOCM on the Authority Batch Release.Section IWith regard to GMP, the relevant parts of the legislative, regulatory and administrative provisions listed below apply. However, the reference quality requirements of products to be exported, including their manufacturing method and product specifications, shall be those of the relevant marketing authorisation granted by the competent authority of the importing Party.Provisions covered by Article 1(2)>TABLE>Section IIConformity assessment bodiesFor the purpose of this Chapter \"Conformity Assessment Bodies\" means the official GMP inspection services of each Party.European Community- GermanyBundesministerium für GesundheitAm Propsthof 78aD-53108 BonnTel.

Transmission of inspection reportsUpon reasoned request, the relevant inspection services shall forward a copy of the last inspection report of the manufacturing site or, in case analytical operations are contracted out, of the control site. The request may concern a \"full inspection report\" or a \"detailed report\" (see item 2 below). Each party shall deal with these inspection reports with the degree of confidentiality requested by the providing Party.Parties will ensure that inspection reports are forwarded in no more than 30 calendar days, this period being extended to 60 days should a new inspection be carried out.2. Inspection reportsA \"full inspection report\" comprises a Site Master File (compiled by the manufacturer or by the inspectorate) and a narrative report by the inspectorate. A \"detailed report\" responds to specific queries about a firm by the other Party.3. GMP Reference(a) Manufacturers shall be inspected against the applicable GMP of the exporting party (see section I).(b) With respect to medicinal products covered by the pharmaceutical legislation of the importing Party but not the exporting one, the locally competent inspection service willing to carry out an inspection of the relevant manufacturing operations shall inspect against its own GMP or, in the absence of specific GMP requirements, against the applicable GMP of the importing Party.For specific products or classes of products (e.g. investigational medicinal products, starting materials not limited to active pharmaceutical ingredients), equivalence of GMP requirements shall be determined according to a procedure established by the Committee.4. Nature of inspections(a) Inspections shall routinely assess the compliance of the manufacturer with GMP. These are called general GMP inspections (also regular, periodic, or routine inspections).(b) \"Product- or process-oriented\" inspections (which may be \"pre-marketing\" inspections as relevant) focus on the manufacture of one or a series of product(s) or process(es) and include an assessment of the validation of and compliance with specific process or control aspects as described in the marketing authorisation. Where necessary, relevant product information (the quality dossier of an application/authorisation dossier) shall be provided in confidence to the inspectorate.5. FeesThe regime of inspection/establishment fees is determined by the manufacturer's location. Inspection/establishment fees shall not be charged to manufacturers located on the territory of the other Party.6. Safeguard clause for inspectionsEach Party reserves the right to have its own inspection conducted for reasons identified to the other Party. Such inspections are to be notified in advance to the other Party and shall, in accordance with Article 8 of the Agreement, be carried out jointly by the competent authorities of the two Parties. Recourse to this safeguard clause should be an exception.7. Exchange of information between authorities and approximation of quality requirementsIn accordance with the general provisions of the Agreement, the parties shall exchange any information necessary for the mutual recognition of inspections.The relevant authorities in Switzerland and in the Community shall also keep each other informed of any new technical guidance or inspection procedure. Each party shall consult the other before their adoption and shall endeavour to proceed towards their approximation.8. Inspectors trainingIn accordance with Article 9 of the Agreement, training sessions for inspectors, organised by the authorities, shall be accessible to inspectors of the other Party. The Parties to the Agreement shall keep each other informed on these sessions.9. Joint InspectionsIn accordance with Article 12 of the Agreement, and by mutual agreement between the Parties, joint inspections may be organised. These inspections are intended to develop common understanding and interpretation of practice and requirements. The setting up of these inspections and their form shall be agreed through procedures approved by the Committee established under Article 10 of the Agreement.10. Alert systemContact points shall be agreed between both Parties to permit authorities and manufacturers to inform the authorities of the other Party with the appropriate speed in case of quality defect, batch recalls, counterfeiting and other problems concerning quality, which could necessitate additional controls or suspension of the distribution of the batch. A detailed alert procedure shall be agreed.The Parties shall ensure that any suspension or withdrawal (total or partial) of a manufacturing authorisation, based on non-compliance with GMP and which could have public health implications, are communicated to each other with the appropriate degree of urgency.11. Contact pointsFor the purpose of this Agreement, the contact points for any technical question, such as exchanges of inspection reports, inspectors training sessions, technical requirements, are:for the ECthe Director of the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products andfor Switzerlandthe official GMP inspection services listed in Section II above.12. Divergence of viewsBoth Parties shall use their best endeavours to resolve any divergence of views concerning inter alia compliance of manufacturers and conclusions of inspection reports. Unresolved divergences of view will be referred to the Committee as established under Article 10 of the Agreement.(1) In the context of this Agreement, the expression \"public telecommunications network\" is to be interpreted for the purpose of Swiss law as \"installations provided by a telecommunications services provider\".ANNEX 2GENERAL RULES REGARDING THE DESIGNATION OF CONFORMITY ASSESSMENT BODIESA. General terms and conditions1. Under this Agreement, the designating authorities shall remain solely responsible for the competence and the capacity of the bodies they have designated and shall designate only legally identifiable bodies under their jurisdiction.2. Designating authorities shall designate conformity assessment bodies able to demonstrate by objective means that they understand and have the requisite experience and competence to apply the requirements and certification procedures laid down in the legislative, regulatory and administrative provisions referred to in Annex I, that are applicable to the specific product, product category or sector for which they are designated.3. Demonstration of technical competence shall cover:- the conformity assessment body's technical knowledge of the relevant products, processes or services which it is willing to treat;- the understanding of the technical standards and/or legislative, regulatory and administrative provisions for which designation is sought;- the physical capability to perform a given conformity assessment activity;- the adequate management of the activity concerned; and- any other circumstance necessary to give assurance that the conformity assessment activity will be adequately performed at all times.4. The technical competence criteria shall be based as far as possible on internationally accepted documents, such as the EN 45000 series of standards or equivalents as well as on supplemented interpretative documents as appropriate. However these documents clearly need to be interpreted in such a way as to take account of the different types of requirements laid down in the applicable legislative, regulatory and administrative provisions.5. The Parties shall encourage harmonisation of designation procedures and coordination of conformity assessment procedures through cooperation between designating authorities and conformity assessment bodies based on coordination meetings, participation in mutual recognition arrangements, and ad hoc working party meetings. The Parties shall also encourage accreditation bodies to participate in mutual recognition arrangements.B. System for verification of conformity assessment bodies' competence6. In order to verify the technical competence of conformity assessment bodies, the authorities concerned may use various procedures ensuring an appropriate level of trust between the Parties. If necessary, a Party shall indicate to the designating authority possible ways of demonstrating competence.(a) AccreditationAccreditation shall constitute a presumption of the technical competence of conformity assessment bodies in relation to the application of the requirements of the other Party provided that the competent accreditation body:- complies with the relevant international provisions in force (EN 45000 standards or ISO/IEC guides); and- is signatory to multilateral arrangements under which it is subject to peer evaluation, or- takes part, under the authority of a Designating Authority, and in accordance with whatever conditions are decided on, in programmes to conduct comparisons and exchange technical experience, in the interests of ensuring continued trust in the technical competence of the accreditation and conformity-assessment bodies. Such programmes could include joint evaluations, special cooperation exercises or conformity assessment.Where the criteria applicable to conformity assessment bodies require the latter to assess the conformity of products, processes or services directly to standards or technical specifications, the designating authorities may use accreditation as a presumption of the conformity assessment body's technical competence provided that it enables assessment of those bodies' ability to apply such standards or technical specifications. Designation shall be limited to those activities of the conformity assessment body.Where the criteria applicable to conformity assessment bodies require the latter to assess the conformity of products, processes or services not directly to standards or technical specifications, but to general (essential) requirements, the designating authorities may use accreditation as a presumption of the conformity assessment body's technical competence provided that it incorporates elements which will enable assessment of the capacity of the conformity assessment body (technical knowledge of the product, of its use, etc.) to assess the conformity of the product to those essential requirements. Designation shall be limited to those activities of the conformity assessment body.(b) Other meansIf there is no accreditation scheme, or on other grounds, the authorities concerned shall require the conformity assessment bodies to demonstrate their competence by other means, e.g.:- participation in regional or international mutual recognition arrangements or certification systems;- regular peer evaluation, based on clear criteria and conducted with the appropriate expertise;- aptitude tests; or- comparison of conformity assessment bodies.C. Evaluation of the verification system7.

They agree to work towards an approximation of Good Clinical Practice, namely by implementing the current Declarations of Helsinki and Tokyo and all guidance relevant to clinical trials adopted in the framework of the International Conference on Harmonisation.
