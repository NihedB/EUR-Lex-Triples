{"celex_id": "32013R0228", "reference": "20.3.2013\nEN\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\nL 78/23\nREGULATION (EU) No 228/2013 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL\nof 13 March 2013\nlaying down specific measures for agriculture in the outermost regions of the Union and repealing Council Regulation (EC) No 247/2006\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular the first paragraph of Article 42, Article 43(2) and Article 349 thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee (1),\nActing in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure (2),\nWhereas:\n(1)\nSpecific measures in the agricultural sector to remedy the difficulties caused by the specific situation facing the Union’s outermost regions, as referred to in Article 349 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (‘the Treaty’), have been established by Council Regulation (EC) No 247/2006 (3). Those measures have been implemented by means of support programmes for each region, which constitute an essential tool for supplying such regions with agricultural products. In view of the need to update the current measures, including as a result of the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, it is necessary to repeal Regulation (EC) No 247/2006 and replace it with a new Regulation.\n(2)\nThe fundamental objectives which the scheme promoting the Union’s outermost regions will help to achieve need to be specified.\n(3)\nIt is also necessary to specify the content of the Programmes of Options Specifically Relating to Remoteness and Insularity (‘POSEI programmes’) which, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, should be established by the Member States concerned at the most appropriate geographical level and submitted by the Member States to the Commission for approval.\n(4)\nIn order to achieve more effectively the objectives of the scheme promoting the Union’s outermost regions, the POSEI programmes should include measures which ensure the supply of agricultural products and the preservation and development of local agricultural production. The level of programming for the regions concerned needs to be harmonised and the policy of partnership between the Commission and the Member States needs to become systematic.\n(5)\nIn keeping with the principle of subsidiarity and in order to ensure flexibility, the two principles which form the basis of the programming approach adopted for the scheme promoting the Union’s outermost regions, the authorities appointed by the Member State may propose amendments to the programme to bring it into line with the reality of the situation in the outermost regions. It should be possible for these authorities to modify the POSEI programmes, in accordance with the principle of administrative simplification, provided that they do not thereby jeopardise the effectiveness of the POSEI programmes and the corresponding financial resources allocated to them. Also in keeping with this approach, the procedure for amending the programmes should be adapted to reflect the level of relevance of each type of amendment.\n(6)\nIn order to ensure the supply of essential agricultural products to the outermost regions and to compensate for the additional costs caused by their extreme remoteness, it is appropriate to introduce a specific supply arrangement. In fact, the exceptional geographical situation of the outermost regions results in additional transport costs for supplying products which are essential for human consumption, for processing or as agricultural inputs. In addition, other objective factors linked to these regions’ extreme remoteness, and in particular their insularity and small surface areas, lead to further constraints on economic operators and producers in the outermost regions that severely handicap their activities. Those handicaps can be alleviated by lowering the price of those essential products. The specific supply arrangement should, however, under no circumstances damage local products and their development.\n(7)\nTo that end, notwithstanding Article 28 of the Treaty, imports of certain agricultural products from third countries should be exempt from the applicable import duties. To take account of their origin and the customs treatment accorded to them under Union law, products which have entered the Union’s customs territory under inward-processing or customs-warehousing arrangements should, for the purpose of granting the benefits of the specific supply arrangements, be considered to be direct imports.\n(8)\nIn order to achieve in an effective manner the goal of lowering prices in the outermost regions, mitigating the additional costs of their extreme remoteness, aid should be granted for the supply of Union products to the outermost regions. Such aid should take account of the additional cost of transport to these regions and the cost of exports to third countries and, in the case of agricultural inputs and products intended for processing, the additional costs associated with their extreme remoteness, and in particular their insularity and small surface areas, their difficult topography and climate and the fact that they are scattered islands.\n(9)\nSupport for traditional sectors is all the more necessary because it enables them to remain competitive on the Union market in the face of competition from third countries. When they draw up their programmes, Member States should, however, also ensure, as far as possible, that agricultural activities in the outermost regions are diversified.\n(10)\nIn order to avoid speculation which would be harmful to end users in the outermost regions, it is important to specify that the specific supply arrangements may only apply to products of sound, fair and marketable quality.\n(11)\nRules should be established concerning the operation of the scheme, particularly those relating to the creation of a register of operators and a system of certificates, based on the licences referred to in Articles 130 and 161 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 of 22 October 2007 establishing a common organisation of agricultural markets and on specific provisions for certain agricultural products (Single CMO Regulation) (4).\n(12)\nGiven the requirements relating to the monitoring of transactions benefiting from the specific supply arrangements, administrative checks should be conducted on the products concerned at the time of their import or entry into the outermost regions and also at the time of their export or dispatch from the same. In addition, in order to achieve the objectives of the arrangements, the economic advantages of the specific supply arrangements should be reflected in production costs and should reduce prices up to the end user stage. They should therefore be granted only on condition that they are actually passed on, and appropriate checks should be carried out.\n(13)\nSince the quantities covered by the specific supply arrangements are limited to the supply requirements of the outermost regions, those arrangements should not impair the proper functioning of the internal market. Nor should the economic advantages of the specific supply arrangements lead to diversions of trade in the products concerned. The dispatch or export of those products from the outermost regions should therefore be prohibited. However, the dispatch or export of those products should be authorised if the financial advantage resulting from the specific supply arrangements is reimbursed.\n(14)\nWith regard to processed products, trade between the outermost regions should be authorised in order to allow commerce between these regions. Account should also be taken of trade flows within the context of regional commerce and traditional exports and dispatching with the rest of the Union or third countries in the outermost regions, and exports of processed products corresponding to traditional trade for all those regions should be authorised. For the sake of clarity, the reference period for defining traditionally exported or dispatched quantities should be specified.\n(15)\nAppropriate measures should be taken to allow for the necessary restructuring of the sugar processing sector in the Azores. These measures should take into account the fact that, in order for the sugar sector on the Azores to be viable, a certain level of production and processing needs to be ensured. Against this background, the Azores should exceptionally, be permitted to dispatch to the rest of the Union quantities of sugar in excess of traditional flows for a limited period of five years, subject to progressively reducing annual limits. Because the quantities that may be re-dispatched will be proportional and limited to those strictly necessary for ensuring the viability of local sugar production and processing, such temporary dispatching of sugar from the Azores will not adversely affect the internal market of the Union.\n(16)\nWith regard to out-of-quota sugar to be supplied to the Azores, Madeira and the Canary Islands, the scheme of exemption from import duties will continue to apply. In particular, the Azores should also be authorised to benefit from the exemption from import duties for raw cane sugar up to their forecast supply balance.\n(17)\nTo date, the Canary Islands have been supplied under specific supply arrangements with skimmed milk powder falling within CN code 1901 90 99 (skimmed milk powder containing vegetable fat) for industrial processing. The continued supply of this product, which has become a traditional component of the local diet, should be permitted.\n(18)\nGiven that rice constitutes a staple of the diet of Réunion, that rice processing and polishing industries have been established in Réunion for many years and that Réunion does not produce sufficient quantities to meet local requirements, the import of this product to the island should continue to be exempt from any form of import tax.\n(19)\nUnion policy to assist local production in the outermost regions has involved a multitude of products and measures for their production, marketing or processing. Those measures have proved effective and have ensured that agriculture continues and develops. The Union should continue to support these lines of production, which are a key element to ensure the environmental, social and economic equilibrium of the outermost regions. Experience has shown that, as in the case of rural development policy, a closer partnership with local authorities can help to address, in a more targeted way, the particular issues affecting the regions concerned. Support to promote local production therefore needs to continue through the POSEI programmes.\n(20)\nIn order to support the marketing of products from the outermost regions, aid should be established to assist the commercialisation of these products outside of the region in which they are produced, taking account of the high additional costs they face as a result of their distance from consumer markets and the need for double storage, factors which result in crucial competitive disadvantages for the outermost regions, affecting their ability to compete in the internal market. These factors justify the need to review the POSEI scheme in the near future.\n(21)\nThe minimum elements which should be provided under the POSEI programmes in order to establish the measures supporting local agricultural production, specifically the description of the location, of the strategy proposed, of the objectives and of the measures, should be established. The principles underlying the consistency of these measures with other Union policies should also be stated, in order to avoid any incompatibility and overlapping of aid.\n(22)\nFor the purposes of applying this Regulation, it should also be possible for the POSEI programmes to contain measures for financing studies, demonstration projects, training and technical assistance.\n(23)\nFarmers in the outermost regions should be encouraged to continue to supply high-quality products and to prioritise their marketing. Use of the logo introduced in this Regulation and of other forms of quality certification introduced by the Union may be useful to this end.\n(24)\nThe structures of certain farms or processing and marketing firms in the outermost regions are seriously deficient and face specific difficulties. Articles 26(2) and 28(2) of Council Regulation (EC) No 1698/2005 of 20 September 2005 on support for rural development by the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD) (5) therefore provide for more favourable support rates for certain types of investment in the outermost regions.\n(25)\nArticle 27(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1698/2005 excludes the outermost regions from the restriction to a grant of forestry support provided for in that Regulation.\n(26)\nRegulation (EC) No 1698/2005 determines the maximum annual amounts eligible for agri-environmental payments. To take into account the specific environmental situation of certain very sensitive pasture areas in the Azores and the preservation of the landscape, the biodiversity and the traditional features of agricultural land, in particular the areas of terrace cultivation in Madeira and the Canary Islands, as well as the conservation of stone walls in the outermost regions, provision should be made for the possibility, in the case of certain specific measures, of increasing those amounts up to twofold.\n(27)\nA derogation may be granted from the Commission’s consistent policy of not authorising State operating aid for the production, processing and marketing of agricultural products covered by Annex I to the Treaty, in order to mitigate the specific constraints on farming in the outermost regions linked to their extreme remoteness, specifically their isolation, insularity, small surface areas, mountainous terrain and climate and their economic dependency on a small number of products. Agricultural production plays a vital role in revitalising rural areas and encouraging people to stay in them, and the outermost rural areas are particularly affected by population ageing, low population density and, in some cases, depopulation.\n(28)\nThe plant health of agricultural crops in the outermost regions is affected by particular problems such as the arrival of parasites associated with the increase in the amount of imports, the climate and the inadequacy of the control measures previously applied there. Programmes should therefore be implemented to combat harmful organisms, including by sustainable and environmentally sound organic methods. The Union’s financial contribution towards such programmes should be defined, taking into account the fact that, under the multiannual financial framework, it is envisaged that, with effect from 2014, the financing of these programmes will fall under a different budgetary heading.\n(29)\nThe maintenance of vineyards, which are the most widespread type of cultivation in the regions of Madeira and the Canary Islands and a very important one for the Azores, is an economic, social and environmental imperative. To help support production, the abandonment premiums, the market mechanisms and, in the case of the Canary Islands, the planting rights system, provided for in Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 should not be applicable in these regions. Nonetheless, in the Canary Islands, it should be possible to apply crisis distillation measures in the event of exceptional market disturbance arising from quality problems. Similarly, technical and socio-economic difficulties have prevented complete conversion, within the time limits established, of the areas in the regions of Madeira and the Azores under vines of hybrid varieties prohibited by Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007. The wine produced by such vineyards is intended solely for traditional local consumption.\n(30)\nThe restructuring of the milk sector is not yet complete in the Azores. In line with the high dependence of the Azores on milk production, combined with other handicaps connected with their extreme remoteness and the absence of profitable alternative lines of production, the derogation from certain provisions of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 concerning surplus levies on milk and milk products should be maintained.\n(31)\nGiven the irreplaceable nature of milk production in the Azores, where it is one of the main driving forces for the economy, social stability, the quality of the environment and occupation of the land, the POSEI programmes are the best instruments for adopting any necessary measures to maintain this production.\n(32)\nSupport for the production of cow’s milk in Madeira and Réunion has not been sufficient to maintain the balance between domestic and external supply, chiefly because of the serious structural difficulties affecting the sector and its problems adapting to new economic environments. Consequently, authorisation to produce UHT milk reconstituted from milk powder of Union origin should continue, in order to cover local consumption more fully, provided that this does not pose an obstacle to the collection and marketing of all locally produced milk, or hamper efforts to promote the expansion of local production. In order to inform the consumer correctly, it should be made compulsory to indicate on the sales labelling the method by which UHT milk is reconstituted using milk powder. This provision should also be applicable in Martinique, French Guiana and Guadeloupe, if France makes a request to that effect, stating the wish of local stakeholders to be covered by it and their ability to develop the milk sector.\n(33)\nThe need to maintain local milk production by means of incentives justifies not applying Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 in the French overseas departments and Madeira. This exemption should apply to Madeira subject to a limit of 4 000 tonnes.\n(34)\nTrade among outermost regions should be fostered with a view to meeting local consumption needs. The export of surplus production from each of the outermost regions — for example, the export of milk, beef and young male bovine animals from the Azores — to those regions with shortages should be encouraged with a view to strengthening trade, while avoiding harming the growth of local production. The conditions necessary for fair and equitable trade should also be guaranteed.\n(35)\nTraditional livestock farming activities should be supported. In order to meet the local consumption needs of the French overseas departments and Madeira, duty-free imports from third countries of male bovine animals intended for fattening should be authorised subject to certain conditions and up to a maximum annual limit.\n(36)\nThe possibility introduced by Council Regulation (EC) No 73/2009 of 19 January 2009 establishing common rules for direct support schemes for farmers under the common agricultural policy and establishing certain support schemes for farmers (6) to enable Portugal to transfer rights to the suckler cow premium from the mainland to the Azores should be renewed and that instrument should be adjusted in the light of the support arrangements for the outermost regions.\n(37)\nTobacco growing is of historical importance in the Canary Islands. From an economic perspective, tobacco preparation continues to be one of the chief industrial activities in the region. In social terms, tobacco cultivation is very labour-intensive and is carried out by small farms. Since the crop is not sufficiently profitable, however, it is in danger of dying out. Tobacco is currently only cultivated on a small area on the island of La Palma for the small-scale manufacture of cigars. Spain should therefore be authorised to continue to grant aid, in addition to Union aid, so that this traditional crop can be maintained with a view to supporting the artisanal activity associated with it. In addition, to maintain the manufacture of tobacco products, imports into the Canary Islands of raw and semi-manufactured tobacco should continue to be exempt from customs duty, up to an annual limit of 20 000 tonnes of stripped raw tobacco equivalent.\n(38)\nImplementation of this Regulation should not jeopardise the level of special support from which the outermost regions have benefited up to now. The Member States should have at their disposal sums equivalent to the support already granted by the Union under Regulation (EC) No 247/2006, in order to implement the appropriate measures.\n(39)\nGiven the potential effects that negotiation of future trade agreements and modifications to the common agricultural policy may have on the outermost regions, specific regard should be given to the special characteristics of these regions in the context of the analyses, studies and assessments carried out in relation to these negotiations and modifications.\n(40)\nSince 2006, requirements in essential products have increased in some outermost regions, particularly in the Azores and in the French overseas departments, as a result of the increasing livestock population and demographic pressure. The proportion of the budget which Member States may use for the specific supply arrangements for the regions concerned should therefore be increased.\n(41)\nThe socio-economic fabric of the outermost regions remains very fragile and, for some of them, is often highly dependent on the banana sector, which itself clearly suffers from a lack of competitiveness and difficulties responding to changing market conditions. The POSEI budget allocated to the banana sector should therefore be increased by a one-off, limited amount to be paid to banana producers during the financial year 2013.\n(42)\nIn order to ensure the proper functioning of the regime established by this Regulation, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty should be delegated to the Commission, in respect of supplementing or modifying certain non-essential elements of this Regulation. It is of particular importance that the Commission carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level. The Commission, when preparing and drawing up delegated acts, should ensure a simultaneous, timely and appropriate transmission of relevant documents to the European Parliament and to the Council.\n(43)\nIn order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of the POSEI programme in the Member States and to avoid unfair competition or discrimination between operators, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission. Those powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 February 2011 laying down the rules and general principles concerning mechanisms for control by Member States of the Commission’s exercise of implementing powers (7).\n(44)\nIn order to allow for the prompt application of the measures envisaged, this Regulation should enter into force on the day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union,\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nCHAPTER I\nSUBJECT MATTER AND OBJECTIVES\nArticle 1\nSubject matter\nThis Regulation lays down specific measures for agriculture to mitigate the difficulties caused by extreme remoteness, specifically remoteness, isolation, small surface areas, terrain, difficult climate and economic dependence on a limited number of products of the regions of the Union referred to in Article 349 of the Treaty (‘the outermost regions’).\nArticle 2\nObjectives\n1.   The specific measures referred to in Article 1 shall help to meet the following objectives:\n(a)\nguaranteed supply to the outermost regions of products essential for human consumption or for processing and as agricultural inputs by mitigating the additional costs incurred due to their extreme remoteness, without harming local production and the growth thereof;\n(b)\nsecuring the long-term future and development of the ‘livestock’ and ‘crop-diversification’ sectors in the outermost regions, including the production, processing and sale of local products;\n(c)\nmaintaining the development and strengthening the competitiveness of traditional agricultural activities in the outermost regions, including the production, processing and marketing of local crops and products.\n2.   The objectives set out in paragraph 1 shall be implemented by means of the measures referred to in Chapters III, IV and V.\nCHAPTER II\nPOSEI PROGRAMMES\nArticle 3\nEstablishing the POSEI programmes\n1.   The measures provided for in Article 1 shall be defined for each outermost region by a Programme of Options Specifically Relating to Remoteness and Insularity (POSEI), (‘the POSEI programme’), comprising:\n(a)\nspecific supply arrangements as provided for in Chapter III; and\n(b)\nspecific measures to assist local agricultural production as provided for in Chapter IV.\n2.   The POSEI programme shall be established at the geographical level which the Member State concerned deems to be the most appropriate. It shall be prepared by the competent authorities designated by the said Member State, which shall submit it to the Commission for approval in accordance with Article 6 after the competent authorities and organisations at the appropriate regional level have been consulted.\n3.   A single POSEI programme may be submitted for each Member State in respect of its outermost regions.\nArticle 4\nCompatibility and consistency\n1.   Measures taken under POSEI programmes shall comply with Union law. Such measures shall be consistent with other Union policies and with the measures taken under such policies.\n2.   Consistency of the measures taken under POSEI programmes with measures implemented under other instruments of the common agricultural policy, and in particular the common organisations of markets, rural development, product quality, animal welfare and the protection of the environment, shall be ensured.\nIn particular, no measure under this Regulation shall be financed as:\n(a)\nadditional support for premium or aid schemes under a common organisation of the market save in exceptional cases justified by objective criteria;\n(b)\nsupport for research projects, measures to support research projects or measures eligible for Union financing under Council Decision 2009/470/EC of 25 May 2009 on expenditure in the veterinary field (8);\n(c)\nsupport for measures within the scope of Regulation (EC) No 1698/2005.\nArticle 5\nContent of the POSEI programmes\nA POSEI programme shall comprise:\n(a)\na schedule for the implementation of the measures and a general annual indicative financing table showing the resources to be deployed;\n(b)\nproof of the compatibility and consistency between the various measures under the programmes and with the criteria and quantitative indicators to be used for monitoring and evaluation;\n(c)\nthe steps taken to ensure that the programmes are implemented effectively and appropriately, including the arrangements for publicity, monitoring and evaluation, and a specified set of quantified indicators for use in programme evaluation;\n(d)\nthe designation of the competent authorities and bodies responsible for implementing the programme and the designation at the appropriate levels of authorities or associated bodies and socio-economic partners, and the results of consultations held.\nArticle 6\nApproval and amendments of the POSEI programmes\n1.   The POSEI programmes are established by Regulation (EC) No 247/2006 and are financed under the financial allocation referred to in Article 30(2) and (3).\nEach programme comprises a forecast supply balance indicating the products, the quantities thereof and the amount of aid for supply from the Union together with a draft programme of support for local production.\n2.   Depending on the annual evaluation of the implementation of measures included in the POSEI programmes, the Member States may, after consulting the socio-economic partners concerned, submit to the Commission duly substantiated proposals for amendments to those measures within the context of the financial allocation referred to in Article 30(2) and (3), to bring them more into line with the requirements of the outermost regions and the strategy proposed. The Commission shall adopt implementing acts laying down the procedures for assessing whether the amendments proposed comply with Union law and for deciding whether to approve them. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 34(2).\n3.   The procedures laid down by the implementing acts referred to in paragraph 2 may take account of the following elements: the importance of the modifications proposed by the Member States with reference to the introduction of new measures, whether the changes to the budget allocated to the measures are substantial, changes in the quantities and in the level of aid for products in the forecast supply balances and any amendments to codes and descriptions laid down in Council Regulation (EEC) No 2658/87 of 23 July 1987 on the tariff and statistical nomenclature and on the Common Customs Tariff (9).\n4.   The implementing acts referred to in paragraph 2 shall also determine, for each procedure, the frequency with which requests for amendments are to be made, as well as the time frames within which the approved amendments are to be implemented.\nArticle 7\nAmendments regarding the financial allocations\nBy 22 April 2013, Member States shall submit to the Commission the draft amendments to their POSEI programmes to reflect the changes introduced by Article 30(5).\nThese amendments shall become applicable one month after their submission if during this period the Commission raises no objections.\nThe competent authorities shall pay the aid referred to in Article 30(5) not later than 30 June 2013.\nArticle 8\nMonitoring and follow-up\nThe Member States shall conduct verifications by means of administrative and on-the-spot checks. The Commission shall adopt implementing acts regarding the minimum characteristics of the checks to be carried out by the Member States.\nThe Commission shall also adopt implementing acts regarding the procedures and physical and financial indicators in order to ensure that the implementation of the programmes is monitored in an effective manner.\nThose implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 34(2).\nCHAPTER III\nSPECIFIC SUPPLY ARRANGEMENTS\nArticle 9\nForecast supply balance\n1.   Specific supply arrangements are hereby established for the agricultural products listed in Annex I to the Treaty which are essential in the outermost regions for human consumption, for the manufacture of other products or as agricultural inputs.\n2.   The Member State concerned shall establish, at the geographical level which it deems most appropriate, a forecast supply balance so as to quantify the annual supply requirements for each outermost region with regard to the products listed in Annex I to the Treaty.\nA separate forecast balance may be drawn up for the requirements of undertakings packaging and processing products intended for the local market for traditional consignment to the rest of the Union or for export as part of regional trade, in accordance with Article 14(3), or within the context of traditional trade flows.\nArticle 10\nOperation of the specific supply arrangements\n1.   Within the limit of the quantities determined in the forecast supply balance, no duties shall apply to direct imports from third countries into the outermost regions of products covered by the specific supply arrangements.\nProducts which have entered the Union’s customs territory under inward processing or customs warehousing arrangements shall be considered to be direct imports from third countries for the purposes of this Chapter.\n2.   In order to ensure coverage of the requirements established in accordance with Article 9(2) in terms of price and quality, while taking care to maintain the Union’s share in supplies, aid shall be granted to supply the outermost regions with Union products held in public intervention storage or available on the Union market.\nSuch aid shall be determined for each type of product concerned, taking account of the additional cost of transport to the outermost regions and the prices applied to exports to third countries and, in the case of products intended for processing or agricultural inputs, other additional costs associated with extreme remoteness, and in particular their insularity and small surface areas.\n3.   No aid shall be granted for the supply of products which have already benefited from the specific supply arrangements in another outermost region.\n4.   Only products of sound, fair and marketable quality shall benefit from the specific supply arrangements. Products from third countries shall provide an equivalent level of guarantees to those produced under the Union’s veterinary and plant health standards.\nArticle 11\nImplementation\nIn implementing the specific supply arrangements, account shall be taken, in particular, of the following:\n(a)\nthe specific requirements of the outermost regions and, in the case of products intended for processing and agricultural inputs, the quality requirements;\n(b)\ntrade flows with the rest of the Union;\n(c)\nthe economic aspect of the proposed aid;\n(d)\nthe need to ensure that existing local production is neither destabilised, nor obstructed in its development.\nArticle 12\nCertificates\n1.   Exemption from import duties or access to aid within the framework of the specific supply arrangements shall be granted on the presentation of a certificate.\nCertificates shall be issued only to operators entered in a register held by the competent authorities.\nLicences and certificates shall not be transferable.\n2.   No security shall be required when applying for import licences, exemption certificates or aid certificates. However, to the extent necessary to ensure the proper application of this Regulation, the competent authority may require a security to be lodged equal to the amount of the advantage as referred to in Article 13. In such cases, Article 34(1), (4), (5), (6), (7) and (8) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 376/2008 of 23 April 2008 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of import and export licences and advance fixing certificates for agricultural products (10) shall apply.\nThe Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts, in accordance with Article 33, determining the conditions for recording operators in the register and providing for the full exercise by operators of their rights to participate in the specific supply arrangements.\n3.   The Commission shall adopt implementing acts regarding the measures necessary to ensure the uniform application by the Member States of this Article, specifically relating to the introduction of the system of certificates and the commitment undertaken by operators at the time of registration. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 34(2).\nArticle 13\nImpact of advantage\n1.   Benefiting from the specific supply arrangements resulting from the exemption of import duty or the awarding of aid shall be subject to the condition that the impact of the economic advantage is passed on up to the end user who, as appropriate, may be the consumer in the case of products meant for direct consumption, the end processor or packager in the case of products meant for the processing or packaging industries, or farmers in the case of products used for animal feed or as agricultural inputs.\nThe advantage referred to in the first subparagraph shall be equal to the amount of the exemption from import duties or to the amount of the aid.\n2.   In order to ensure that paragraph 1 is applied in a uniform manner, the Commission shall adopt implementing acts regarding the application of the rules set out in paragraph 1 and more specifically the conditions for the monitoring by Member States, that the advantage has in fact been passed on up to the end user. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 34(2).\nArticle 14\nExport to third countries and dispatch to the rest of the Union\n1.   The Commission shall adopt implementing acts establishing the requirements in accordance with which products covered by the specific supply arrangements may be exported to third countries or dispatched to the rest of the Union, which shall include the payment of import duty or the reimbursement of the aid received, as indicated in Article 10. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 34(2).\nExports to third countries of products covered by the specific supply arrangements shall not be subject to the presentation of a certificate.\nThe first subparagraph shall not apply to trade flows between French overseas departments.\n2.   The first subparagraph of paragraph 1 shall not apply to products processed in the outermost regions from products that have benefited from the specific supply arrangements which are:\n(a)\nexported to third countries or dispatched to the rest of the Union within the limits of traditional exports and traditional dispatches. The Commission shall adopt implementing acts establishing those amounts, on the basis of dispatches or export average figures, taking as a reference the verified average figures for the three best years between 2005 and 2012. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 34(2);\n(b)\nexported to third countries as part of regional trade;\n(c)\ndispatched between the regions of the Azores, Madeira and the Canary Islands;\n(d)\ndispatched between French overseas departments.\nNo export refund shall be granted on the export of products referred to in points (a) and (b) of the first subparagraph.\nExports to third countries of products referred to in points (a) and (b) of the first subparagraph shall not be subject to the presentation of a certificate.\n3.   For the purposes of this Chapter, ‘regional trade’ shall be understood as trade, for each outermost region, with third countries belonging to the same geographical area as those outermost regions, and with countries with which there are historical trade links. The Commission shall adopt implementing acts establishing a list of those countries, taking into account objective requests made by the Member States following consultation with the sectors concerned. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 34(2).\n4.   Products delivered to the French overseas departments, the Azores, Madeira or the Canary Islands which have benefited from the specific supply arrangements and are used to supply ships and aircraft shall be deemed to have been consumed locally.\n5.

To ensure the continuity and development of local agricultural production in the longer term, the advantage must not be at a level that would harm the local production of such products. The aid should be proportional to the additional cost incurred by the particular geographical situation of the outermost region.\nSupport is implemented via import licences, exemption certificates and aid certificates issued to registered operators. Any operator established in the EU may apply to be in the register under certain conditions.\nMeasures to assist local agricultural products\nThe programme may include measures to support the production, processing or sale of agricultural products in the outermost regions.\nEach measure may include a variety of actions. For each action, the programme must define at least the beneficiaries, the eligibility conditions and the unit amount of aid allocated to that action.\nChecks and penalties\nProducts that are subject to specific supply arrangements are checked when they enter the outermost regions and when they are exported or dispatched. If the rules are not respected, the authorities may recover the advantage granted to operators (i.e. farmers and companies that own farms) and temporarily suspend/revoke their registration.\nThe measures to assist local agricultural products are verified by means of both administrative and on-the-spot checks. In the event of a wrongful payment, the beneficiary is obliged to reimburse the amount in question.\nProtective measures against pests of plants\nRegulation (EU) 2016/2031, amending Regulation (EU) No 228/2013, requires EU financing of the pest control programmes in the outermost regions, to be implemented in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 652/2014, which was subsequently repealed and replaced by Regulation (EU) 2021/690 establishing the single market programme (see summary).\nDelegated act\nDelegated Regulation (EU) No 179/2014 supplements Regulation (EU) No 228/2013 with regard to:\nthe register of operators;\nthe amount of aid for the marketing of products outside the region;\nthe logo;\nthe exemption from import duties for certain bovine animals;\nthe financing of certain measures relating to specific measures for agriculture in the EU’s outermost regions.\nImplementing acts\nThe European Commission adopted Implementing Regulation (EU) No 180/2014, which lays down rules for applying Regulation (EU) No 228/2013. It contains nine annexes and detailed rules which cover:\nspecific supply arrangements (for example, forecast supply balances, supply through imports from non-EU countries, supply from the EU, export and dispatch, management, controls and monitoring);\nmeasures to support local agricultural products (aid applications, checks, reductions and exclusions and undue payments);\naccompanying measures (logo, animal products, import of tobacco into the Canary Islands).\nImplementing Regulation (EU) 2020/532, amended by Implementing Regulations (EU) 2020/2086 and (EU) 2021/238, allows for certain derogations from Implementing Regulation (EU) No 180/2014, to take into account the COVID-19 pandemic.\nRepeal\nRegulation (EU) No 228/2013 repeals Regulation (EC) No 247/2006.\nFROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?\n              \nIt has applied since 21 March 2013.\nBACKGROUND\n              \nFor further information, see:\nPOSEI scheme (European Commission).\nMAIN DOCUMENT\n            \nRegulation (EU) No 228/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 March 2013 laying down specific measures for agriculture in the outermost regions of the Union and repealing Council Regulation (EC) No 247/2006 (OJ L 78, 20.3.2013, pp. 23–40).\nSuccessive amendments to Regulation (EU) No 228/2013 have been incorporated in the original text.
