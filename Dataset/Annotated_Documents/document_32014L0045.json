With a view to attaining that objective, vehicle technology is expected to contribute greatly to improvement of the safety record of road transport.\n(2)\nIn its Communication entitled ‘Towards a European road safety area: policy orientations on road safety 2011-2020’, the Commission proposed a further halving of the overall number of road fatalities in the Union by 2020, starting from 2010. With a view to attaining that goal, the Commission set out seven strategic objectives, and identified actions for safer vehicles, a strategy to reduce the number of injuries and measures to improve the safety of vulnerable road users, in particular motorcyclists.\n(3)\nRoadworthiness testing is a part of a wider regime designed to ensure that vehicles are kept in a safe and environmentally acceptable condition during their use. That regime should cover periodic roadworthiness testing of vehicles and technical roadside inspection of vehicles used for commercial road transport activities, as well as providing for a vehicle registration procedure allowing for the suspension of a vehicle’s authorisation to be used in road traffic where the vehicle constitutes an immediate risk to road safety. Periodic testing should be the main tool to ensure roadworthiness. Technical roadside inspections of commercial vehicles should merely be complementary to periodic testing.\n(4)\nMember States should be allowed to set higher test standards than those required by this Directive.\n(5)\nEnforcement of roadworthiness measures may include awareness campaigns focusing on vehicle owners and aimed at developing good practices and habits resulting from basic checks on their vehicles.\n(6)\nVehicles with malfunctioning technical systems have an impact on road safety and may contribute to road crashes involving injuries or fatalities. That impact could be reduced if adequate improvements to the roadworthiness testing system were put in place. Early disclosure of a deficiency in the roadworthiness of a vehicle would help to remedy that deficiency and hence prevent accidents.\n(7)\nVehicles with malfunctioning emission control systems have a greater impact on the environment than properly maintained vehicles. Therefore, a periodic regime of roadworthiness tests would contribute to improving the environment by reducing average vehicle emissions.\n(8)\nMember States should consider appropriate measures to prevent adverse manipulation of, or tampering with, vehicle parts and components that could have a negative bearing on required safety and environmental characteristics of the vehicle, in particular through the periodic roadworthiness test, including effective, proportionate, dissuasive and non-discriminatory penalties.\n(9)\nDuring the last two decades, requirements in respect of vehicle emissions for type-approval have been continuously strengthened. However, air quality has not improved as much as predicted with the tightening of emission standards for vehicles, especially in respect of nitrogen oxides (NOx) and fine particulate matter. Possibilities for improving test cycles to match on-road conditions should be closely examined in order to develop future solutions, including the establishment of test methods for the measurement of NOx levels and of limit values for NOx emissions.\n(10)\nFor vehicles complying with emission classes Euro 6 and Euro VI, on-board diagnostics systems (OBD) are becoming more effective in assessing emissions, justifying their use as an equivalent to standard emission testing for the purpose of roadworthiness tests. With a view to providing for the use of OBD in roadworthiness tests for vehicles up to emission classes Euro 5 and Euro V, Member States should be able to allow this testing method in accordance with the manufacturer’s recommendations and other requirements for such vehicles where the equivalence, taking into account any relevant type-approval legislation, where appropriate, has been independently verified.\n(11)\nA number of technical standards and requirements in respect of vehicle safety have been adopted in the Union. It is necessary to ensure, through a regime of periodic roadworthiness tests, that vehicles continue to meet safety standards. That regime should apply to certain categories of vehicles as defined in Directives 2002/24/EC (3), 2003/37/EC (4) and 2007/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (5).\n(12)\nWheeled tractors with a maximum design speed exceeding 40 km/h are increasingly used to replace trucks in local transport activities and for commercial road haulage purposes. Their risk potential is comparable to that of trucks, and vehicles in that category, which are used mainly on public roads, should therefore be subject to roadworthiness testing.\n(13)\nVehicles of historical interest are supposed to conserve the heritage of the period during which they were constructed, and are considered to be hardly used on public roads. It should be left to Member States to determine the periodicity of roadworthiness testing for such vehicles. It should also be for Member States to regulate roadworthiness testing for other types of specialised vehicles.\n(14)\nVehicles used exclusively on remote territories of Member States, in particular on small islands with fewer than 5 000 inhabitants or in sparsely populated areas with a population density below five persons per square kilometre, are used under conditions that may require a specific roadworthiness testing regime. Member States should therefore be empowered to exempt such vehicles from the application of this Directive.\n(15)\nRoadworthiness testing is a sovereign activity and should therefore be carried out by the Member States or by public or private bodies entrusted to carry out such testing under their supervision. Member States should invariably remain responsible for roadworthiness testing, even where the national system allows for private bodies, including those which also perform vehicle repairs, to carry out roadworthiness testing.\n(16)\nMember States should be empowered to designate testing centres located outside their territory to carry out roadworthiness tests for vehicles registered in their territory, if those testing centres have already been authorised to carry out tests on vehicles by the Member State in which they are located.\n(17)\nFor the inspection of vehicles, and especially for their electronic safety components, it is crucial to have access to the technical specifications of each individual vehicle. Consequently, vehicle manufacturers should provide the data needed for verification of the functionality of safety and environment-related components. The provisions concerning access to repair and maintenance information should likewise be applied for that purpose, allowing inspection centres to have access to all information necessary for roadworthiness testing. The data should include the details that allow the functionality of the vehicle safety systems to be monitored in a way that allows such systems to be tested in a periodic technical inspection environment. This is of crucial importance, especially in the field of electronically controlled systems, and should cover all elements that have been installed by the manufacturer.\n(18)\nVehicles used on public roads are required to be roadworthy when they are used. The holder of the registration certificate and, where applicable, the operator of the vehicle should be responsible for keeping the vehicle in a roadworthy condition.\n(19)\nIt is important for road safety and for its impact on society that vehicles used on roads should be in a proper technical condition. Therefore, Member States should not be prevented from allowing, on a voluntary basis, additional roadworthiness tests.\n(20)\nTo allow for a degree of flexibility for holders of a registration certificate and operators, Member States should be able to specify a period of several weeks in which the periodic roadworthiness test is to be performed.\n(21)\nTesting during the life cycle of a vehicle should be relatively simple, quick and inexpensive, while at the same time effective in achieving the objectives of this Directive.\n(22)\nRoadworthiness tests should cover all items relevant to the specific design, construction and equipment of the tested vehicle. Compatibility between parts and components, such as between wheels and wheel hubs, should be treated as a critical safety item and should be checked during roadworthiness testing. In the context of those items, and considering the current state of vehicle technology, modern electronic systems should be included in the list of items to be tested. With a view to harmonising roadworthiness testing, recommended testing methods should be established for each of the test items. Those items should be updated to take account of evolving research and technical progress in the field of vehicle safety.\n(23)\nIn order to facilitate harmonisation and to ensure consistency of standards, a non-exhaustive list of the main reasons for failure should be provided in respect of all test items. To achieve consistency in the judgement of the condition of the tested vehicle, detected failures should be assessed to a common standard.\n(24)\nWith a view to better applying the principle of freedom of movement within the Union, for the purpose of re-registration of a vehicle, Member States should recognise roadworthiness certificates issued by other Member States. This should not affect the right of a Member State to verify the roadworthiness certificate and the vehicle identification during re-registration and to require a new roadworthiness test to be carried out under the conditions laid down in this Directive.\n(25)\nOdometer fraud should be regarded as an offence liable to a penalty, because manipulation of an odometer may lead to an incorrect evaluation of the roadworthiness of a vehicle. The recording of mileage in the roadworthiness certificate and access for inspectors to that information should facilitate the detection of odometer tampering or manipulation. The exchange of information on odometer readings between the competent authorities of Member States should be examined by the Commission.\n(26)\nA roadworthiness certificate should be issued after each test. This should include, inter alia, information concerning the identity of the vehicle and the results of the test. The test results should be made available electronically. With a view to ensuring a proper follow-up of roadworthiness tests, Member States should collect and retain such information in a database, in particular for the purposes of analysis of the results of the periodic roadworthiness tests.\n(27)\nThe holder of the registration certificate and, where applicable, the operator of a vehicle subject to a roadworthiness test during which deficiencies are found, in particular those which represent a risk to road safety, should rectify such deficiencies without delay. In the case of dangerous deficiencies, it may be necessary to restrict the use of the vehicle until those deficiencies are fully rectified.\n(28)\nWhere a tested vehicle belongs to a vehicle category which is not subject to registration in the Member State where it has been put into service, that Member State should be allowed to require that the proof of test be displayed in a visible manner on the vehicle.\n(29)\nIn order to achieve a high quality of testing throughout the Union, test equipment to be used during testing, its maintenance and its calibration should be verified with reference to specifications provided by the Member States or by manufacturers.\n(30)\nIt should be possible for alternative equipment reflecting technological progress and innovation to be used, provided that an equivalent high-quality level of testing is ensured.\n(31)\nWhen authorising testing centres on their territory, Member States should take into account the fact that Directive 2006/123/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (6) excludes from its scope services of general interest in the field of transport.\n(32)\nTesting centres should ensure the objectivity and the high quality of the vehicle testing. Therefore, in order to meet minimum requirements in terms of quality management, testing centres should comply with the requirements laid down by the authorising Member State.\n(33)\nHigh standards of roadworthiness testing require that testing personnel have a high level of skills and competences. A training system including initial training and periodic refreshers or an appropriate examination should be introduced. Provision should be made for a transitional period to allow for a smooth transition of existing testing personnel into the periodic training or examination regime. In order to ensure high standards of training, competence and testing, Member States should be allowed to lay down additional competence and corresponding training requirements.\n(34)\nInspectors, when carrying out roadworthiness tests, should act independently and their judgement should not be affected by conflicts of interest, including those of an economic or personal nature. There should therefore be no direct correlation between the reward of inspectors and the results of roadworthiness tests. It should be possible for Member States to prescribe requirements regarding the separation of activities or to authorise a private body to carry out both roadworthiness tests and vehicle repairs, even on the same vehicle in cases where the supervising body has established to its satisfaction that a high level of objectivity is maintained.\n(35)\nThe results of a roadworthiness test should not be altered for commercial purposes. Only if the findings of a roadworthiness test performed by an inspector are manifestly incorrect should the supervising body be able to modify the results of that test.\n(36)\nWith a view to ensuring that a high quality of testing is maintained over time, Member States should set up a quality assurance system that covers the processes of authorisation, supervision, withdrawal, suspension or cancellation of authorisation to carry out roadworthiness tests.\n(37)\nAccreditation of testing centres under Regulation (EC) No 765/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council (7) should not constitute an obligation for the Member States.\n(38)\nIn several Member States, a high number of private authorised testing centres carry out roadworthiness tests. In order to ensure the efficient exchange of information between Member States in this regard, national contact points should be designated.\n(39)\nRoadworthiness testing forms part of a wider regulatory scheme, governing vehicles throughout their lifetime from approval via registrations and inspections until scrapping. Sharing of the information contained in national and manufacturers’ electronic vehicle databases should in principle help to improve the efficiency of the entire chain of vehicle administration and should help to reduce costs and administrative burdens. The Commission should examine the feasibility, costs and benefits of establishing an electronic vehicle information platform by taking advantage of existing and already implemented IT solutions with regard to international data exchange, so as to minimise costs and avoid duplication. In carrying out its examination of this issue, the Commission should consider the most appropriate way to link the existing national systems with a view to exchanges of information on data relating to roadworthiness testing and odometer readings between the competent authorities of Member States responsible for testing, registration and vehicle approval, testing centres, test equipment manufacturers and vehicle manufacturers. The Commission should also examine the feasibility, costs and benefits of collection and storage of available information concerning the main safety-related components of vehicles which have been involved in serious accidents as well as the possibility of making information on accident history and odometer readings available in anonymised form to vehicle inspectors, holders of registration certificates and accident researchers.\n(40)\nIn order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of this Directive, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission. Those powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council (8).\n(41)\nThe Commission should not adopt implementing acts relating to the information to be made accessible by vehicle manufacturers for roadworthiness testing where the committee established pursuant to this Directive delivers no opinion on the draft implementing act presented by the Commission.\n(42)\nIn order to update the vehicle category designations in Article 2(1) and Article 5(1) and (2), to update point 3 of Annex I in respect of methods, and to adapt point 3 of Annex I, in respect of the list of test items, methods and assessment of deficiencies, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union should be delegated to the Commission. It is of particular importance that the Commission carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level. The Commission, when preparing and drawing up delegated acts, should ensure a simultaneous, timely and appropriate transmission of relevant documents to the European Parliament and to the Council.\n(43)\nRoadworthiness has a direct impact on road safety and should therefore be reviewed periodically. The Commission should report on the effectiveness of the provisions of this Directive, including those relating to its scope, the frequency of testing, further enhancement of the roadworthiness system through electronic information exchange and the potential in the future for mutual recognition of roadworthiness certificates.\n(44)\nTesting facilities and equipment used in testing centres should fulfil the requirements set out for carrying out roadworthiness tests. Since this necessitates substantial investment and adaptations which it may not be possible to carry out immediately, a period of five years should be granted to comply with those requirements. A period of five years should likewise be granted to enable supervisory bodies to fulfil all the criteria and requirements concerning the authorisation and supervision of testing centres.\n(45)\nSince the objective of this Directive, namely to improve road safety by laying down minimum common requirements and harmonised rules concerning roadworthiness tests of vehicles within the Union, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States but can rather, by reason of the scale of the action, be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Directive does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve that objective.\n(46)\nThis Directive respects fundamental rights and observes the principles recognised in particular by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union as referred to in Article 6 of the Treaty on European Union.\n(47)\nThis Directive integrates and updates the rules contained in Commission Recommendation 2010/378/EU (9) with a view to better regulating roadworthiness testing outcomes.\n(48)\nThis Directive updates the technical requirements laid down in Directive 2009/40/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (10) and enlarges its scope in order to include, in particular, provisions concerning the setting-up of testing centres and of their supervisory bodies as well as the designation of inspectors entrusted to carry out roadworthiness tests. Therefore, that Directive should be repealed,\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:\nCHAPTER I\nSUBJECT MATTER, DEFINITIONS AND SCOPE\nArticle 1\nSubject matter\nThis Directive establishes minimum requirements for a regime of periodic roadworthiness tests of vehicles used on public roads.\nArticle 2\nScope\n1.

Each Member State shall ensure that vehicles registered in its territory are periodically tested in accordance with this Directive by testing centres authorised by the Member State in which those vehicles are registered.\n2.   Roadworthiness tests shall be carried out by the Member State of registration of the vehicle, by a public body entrusted with the task by that Member State or by bodies or establishments designated and supervised by that Member State, including authorised private bodies.\n3.   In accordance with the principles laid down by Regulation (EC) No 715/2007 of the European Parliament and of the Council (11) and by Regulation (EC) No 595/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council (12), the Commission shall, by means of implementing acts, and before 20 May 2018, adopt:\n(a)\na set of technical information on braking equipment, steering, visibility, lamps, reflectors, electrical equipment, axles, wheels, tyres, suspension, chassis, chassis attachments, other equipment and nuisance necessary for roadworthiness testing of the items to be tested and on the use of the recommended test methods, in accordance with point 3 of Annex I, and\n(b)\nthe detailed rules concerning the data format and the procedures for accessing the relevant technical information.\nThose implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 19(2).\nThe technical information referred to in point (a) of the first subparagraph shall be made available, free of charge or at a reasonable price, by the manufacturers to testing centres and relevant competent authorities, in a non-discriminatory manner.\nThe Commission shall examine the feasibility of establishing a single point of access for that technical information.\n4.   Member States shall ensure that the responsibilities for keeping a vehicle in a safe and roadworthy condition are defined in national law.\nCHAPTER III\nMINIMUM REQUIREMENTS CONCERNING ROADWORTHINESS TESTS\nArticle 5\nDate and frequency of testing\n1.   Vehicles shall be subject to a roadworthiness test at least within the following intervals, without prejudice to the period of flexibility applied in Member States under paragraph 3:\n(a)\nvehicles of category M1 and N1: four years after the date on which the vehicle was first registered, and thereafter every two years;\n(b)\nvehicles of category M1 used as taxis or ambulances, vehicles of categories M2, M3, N2, N3, O3 and O4: one year after the date on which the vehicle was first registered, and thereafter annually;\n(c)\nvehicles of category T5 the use of which mainly takes place on public roads for commercial road haulage purposes: four years after the date on which the vehicle was first registered, and thereafter every two years.\n2.   Member States shall establish appropriate intervals within which vehicles of categories L3e, L4e, L5e and L7e, with an engine displacement of more than 125 cm3, are to be subject to a roadworthiness test.\n3.   Member States or competent authorities may establish a reasonable period during which the roadworthiness test is to be carried out, not exceeding the intervals laid down in paragraph 1.\n4.   Notwithstanding the date of a vehicle’s last roadworthiness test, the Member State or competent authority concerned may require it to undergo a roadworthiness test before the dates referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 in the following cases:\n—\nafter an accident affecting the main safety-related components of the vehicle, such as wheels, suspension, deformation zones, airbag systems, steering or brakes;\n—\nwhen the safety and environmental systems and components of the vehicle have been altered or modified;\n—\nwhere the holder of the registration certificate of a vehicle has changed;\n—\nwhen the vehicle has reached a mileage of 160 000 km;\n—\nin cases where road safety is seriously affected.\nArticle 6\nContents and methods of testing\n1.   For vehicle categories falling within the scope of this Directive, with the exception of categories L3e, L4e, L5e and L7e with an engine displacement of more than 125 cm3, Member States shall ensure that roadworthiness tests cover at least the areas referred to in point 2 of Annex I.\n2.   For each area referred to in paragraph 1, the competent authorities of the Member State or the testing centre shall carry out a roadworthiness test covering at least the items referred to in point 3 of Annex I, using the recommended or an equivalent method approved by a competent authority applicable to the testing of those items, as set out in point 3 of Annex I. The test may also include a verification as to whether the respective parts and components of the vehicle correspond to the required safety and environmental characteristics that were in force at the time of approval or, if applicable, at the time of retrofitting.\nThe tests shall be carried out using techniques and equipment currently available without the use of tools to dismantle or remove any part of the vehicle.\n3.   For vehicle categories L3e, L4e, L5e and L7e, with an engine displacement of more than 125 cm3, Member States shall determine the areas, items and appropriate methods of testing.\nArticle 7\nAssessment of deficiencies\n1.   For each item to be tested, Annex I provides a minimum list of possible deficiencies and their level of severity.\n2.   Deficiencies that are found during periodic testings of vehicles shall be categorised in one of the following groups:\n(a)\nminor deficiencies having no significant effect on the safety of the vehicle or impact on the environment, and other minor non-compliances;\n(b)\nmajor deficiencies that may prejudice the safety of the vehicle or have an impact on the environment or put other road users at risk, or other more significant non-compliances;\n(c)\ndangerous deficiencies constituting a direct and immediate risk to road safety or having an impact on the environment which justify that a Member State or its competent authorities may prohibit the use of the vehicle on public roads.\n3.   A vehicle having deficiencies falling into more than one of the deficiency groups referred to in paragraph 2 shall be classified in the group corresponding to the more serious deficiency. A vehicle showing several deficiencies within the same inspection area as identified in the scope of the test referred to in point 2 of Annex I, may be classified in the next most serious deficiency group if it can be demonstrated that the combined effect of those deficiencies results in a higher risk to road safety.\nArticle 8\nRoadworthiness certificate\n1.   Member States shall ensure that testing centres or, if relevant, the competent authorities, which have carried out a roadworthiness test on a vehicle issue a roadworthiness certificate for that vehicle indicating at least the standardised elements of the corresponding harmonised Union codes as laid down in Annex II.\n2.   Member States shall ensure that testing centres or, if relevant, the competent authorities make the roadworthiness certificate or, in the case of an electronically produced roadworthiness certificate, a certified printout of such certificate available to the person presenting the vehicle for testing.\n3.   Without prejudice to Article 5, in the case of re-registration of a vehicle already registered in another Member State, each Member State shall recognise the roadworthiness certificate issued by that other Member State, as if it had itself issued that certificate, provided that the roadworthiness certificate is still valid in terms of the frequency intervals established for periodic roadworthiness tests by the re-registering Member State. In cases of doubt, the re-registering Member State may verify the validity of the roadworthiness certificate before recognising it. Member States shall communicate to the Commission a description of the roadworthiness certificate before 20 May 2018. The Commission shall inform the Committee referred to in Article 19. This paragraph shall not apply to vehicle categories L3e, L4e, L5e and L7e.\n4.   Without prejudice to Article 5(4) and paragraph 3 of this Article, Member States shall recognise, as a matter of principle, the validity of the roadworthiness certificate in the event that the ownership of a vehicle — having a valid proof of periodic roadworthiness test — changes.\n5.   As from 20 May 2018 and at the latest by 20 May 2021, testing centres shall communicate electronically, to the competent authority of the Member State concerned, the information mentioned in the roadworthiness certificates which they issue. Such communication shall take place within a reasonable time after each roadworthiness certificate is issued. Until the latter date, testing centres may communicate the relevant information to the competent authority by any other means. Member States shall determine the period during which the competent authority is to retain that information. The duration of that period shall not be less than 36 months, without prejudice to the national tax systems of the Member States.\n6.   Member States shall ensure that, for the purposes of checking the odometer, where an odometer is normally fitted, the information included in the previous roadworthiness test is made available to the inspectors as soon as it is available electronically. In cases where an odometer is found to have been manipulated with the aim of reducing or misrepresenting the distance record of a vehicle, such manipulation shall be punishable by effective, proportionate, dissuasive and non-discriminatory penalties.\n7.   Member States shall ensure that the results of the roadworthiness test are notified, or made available electronically, as soon as possible to the authority responsible for registration of the vehicle. That notification shall contain the information mentioned in the roadworthiness certificate.\nArticle 9\nFollow-up of deficiencies\n1.   In the case of minor deficiencies only, the test shall be deemed to have been passed, the deficiencies shall be rectified, and the vehicle shall not be re-tested.\n2.   In the case of major deficiencies, the test shall be deemed to have been failed. The Member State or the competent authority shall decide on the period during which the vehicle in question may be used before it is required to undergo another roadworthiness test. The subsequent test shall take place during a period defined by the Member State or competent authority but not later than two months following the initial test.\n3.   In the case of dangerous deficiencies, the test shall be deemed to have been failed. The Member State or the competent authority may decide that the vehicle in question is not to be used on public roads and that the authorisation for its use in road traffic is to be suspended for a limited period of time, without requiring a new process of registration, until such time as the deficiencies are rectified and a new roadworthiness certificate is issued testifying that the vehicle is in a roadworthy condition.\nArticle 10\nProof of test\n1.

For heavy-duty diesels, this means waiting for at least 10 seconds after the release of the throttle.\n2.\nTo initiate each free acceleration cycle, the throttle pedal must be fully depressed quickly and continuously (in less than one second) but not violently, so as to obtain maximum delivery from the injection pump.\n3.\nDuring each free acceleration cycle, the engine shall reach cut-off speed or, for vehicles with automatic transmissions, the speed specified by the manufacturer or, if this data is not available, then two thirds of the cut-off speed, before the throttle is released. This could be checked, for instance, by monitoring engine speed or by allowing a sufficient time to elapse between initial throttle depression and release, which in the case of vehicles of categories M2, M3, N2 and N3, should be at least two seconds.\n4.\nVehicles shall only be failed if the arithmetic means of at least the last three free acceleration cycles are in excess of the limit value.

To be tested 4 years after the date when first registered, and thereafter every 2 years.\nVehicles in category M1 used as taxis or ambulances, buses or minibuses (M2, M3), heavy goods vehicles (N2, N3) and heavy trailers (O3, O4). To be tested 1 year after first registration, and thereafter yearly.\nFast tractors with a design speed above 40 km/h (T5) and used commercially. To be tested 4 years after registration, and thereafter every 2 years.\nPowerful motorcycles\nCategory L vehicles with an engine larger than 125 cm3 will be tested from 2022 unless road safety statistics for the previous 5 years show that the same level of road safety could be achieved by alternative measures.\nRoadworthiness tests prior to the due dates\nIn certain circumstances, vehicles may be required to undergo a test before the due dates:\nafter an accident;\nwhere the holder of the registration certificate has changed;\non reaching 160,000 km;\nin cases where road safety is seriously affected.\nExemptions\nThe following types of vehicles are exempted from roadworthiness tests:\nvehicles of historic interest;\ndiplomatic vehicles;\nvehicles used by the armed forces, police, customs, fire services or for agricultural and forestry purposes only;\nvehicles used exclusively on small islands.\nApproved testing centres\nEach EU Member State must have approved and compliant testing centres, while inspectors must meet competence criteria and be free from any conflict of interest.\nAssessment of defects\nDefects are classified as minor, major or dangerous, with minor defects insufficient to fail vehicles.\nWhere defects are dangerous, the use of the vehicle on public roads may be suspended until the fault is rectified.\nRoadworthiness certificate\nWhere a vehicle already registered in another Member State is re-registered, its certificate must be recognised by other Member States, even where ownership has changed. By 2021, testing centres will be required to share relevant information with the competent authority of their country.\nEuropean electronic vehicle information platform\nThe feasibility, costs and benefits of setting up a European electronic vehicle information platform are to be examined.\nFraud\nTo detect odometer fraud, data from the preceding test is to be made available to the inspectors.\nMisrepresenting the distance a vehicle has covered is a punishable offence.\nCOVID-19 pandemic\nRegulation (EU) 2020/698 lays down specific and temporary measures in view of the COVID-19 outbreak concerning the renewal or extension of certain certificates, licences and authorisations and the postponement of certain periodic checks and periodic training in certain areas of transport legislation. The regulation extended the time limits provided for in Directive 2014/45/EU with regard to the following. Roadworthiness tests which should have been carried out between 1 February 2020 and 31 August 2020 by a period of 7 months.Roadworthiness certificates which should have been issued between 1 February 2020 and 31 August 2020 by a period of 7 months.Where a Member State considers that carrying out roadworthiness tests or the certification thereof are likely to remain impracticable beyond 31 August 2020, due to the COVID-19-related measures that it has taken, it may submit a reasoned request to the European Commission by 1 August 2020 for an authorisation to extend the periods. That request may concern the period between 1 February 2020 and 31 August 2020 or the period of 7 months, or both.\nIn view of the persistence of the COVID-19 crisis, Regulation (EU) 2021/267 extends certain periods referred to in Regulation (EU) 2020/698 due to difficulties in carrying out periodic roadworthiness tests. More specifically, the regulation covers the following areas. The regulation allows periodic roadworthiness tests which were to have been carried out between 1 September 2020 and 30 June 2021 to be carried out at a later date, but not later than 10 months after the original time limit, and the certificates concerned should remain valid until that later date.Where a Member State considers that carrying out roadworthiness tests or the certification thereof are likely to remain impracticable beyond 30 June 2021, due to measures that it has taken to prevent or contain the spread of COVID-19, it may submit a reasoned request for an authorisation to apply an extension of the periods. That request may concern the period between 1 September 2020 and 30 June 2021 or the period of 10 months, or both. It must be submitted to the Commission by 31 May 2021.If the requirements are fulfilled and the requested extension does not lead to disproportionate risks in terms of transport safety and security, the Commission can authorise the Member State to apply an extension. The extension must be limited to reflect the period during which the renewal of roadworthiness tests is likely to remain impracticable and, in any event, cannot exceed 6 months. The Commission’s decision in this regard is published in the Official Journal of the European Union.Where a Member State does not need to apply the measures laid down in Regulation (EU) 2021/267, it should inform the Commission of this by 3 March 2021. The Commission must inform the other Member States accordingly and publish a notice in the Official Journal. A Member State in this situation must not impede the cross-border activities of any economic operator or individual that has relied on these exceptional measures in another Member State.\nFROM WHEN DOES THE DIRECTIVE APPLY?\n              \nThe directive had to become law in the Member States by 20 May 2017. Member States have to apply the rules as of 20 May 2018.\nBACKGROUND\n              \nFor further information, see:\nRoad safety (European Commission).\nMAIN DOCUMENT\n            \nDirective 2014/45/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 3 April 2014 on periodic roadworthiness tests for motor vehicles and their trailers and repealing Directive 2009/40/EC (OJ L 127, 29.4.2014, pp. 51-128)\nSuccessive amendments to Directive 2014/45/EU have been incorporated into the original text.
