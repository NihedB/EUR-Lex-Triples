{"celex_id": "32021R1059", "reference": "30.6.2021\nEN\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\nL 231/94\nREGULATION (EU) 2021/1059 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL\nof 24 June 2021\non specific provisions for the European territorial cooperation goal (Interreg) supported by the European Regional Development Fund and external financing instruments\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 178, Articles 209(1) and 212(2) and Article 349 thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee (1),\nHaving regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions (2),\nActing in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure (3),\nWhereas:\n(1)\nArticle 176 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) provides that the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) is intended to help to redress the main regional imbalances in the Union. Pursuant to that Article and to the second and third paragraphs of Article 174 TFEU, the ERDF is to contribute to reducing disparities between the levels of development of the various regions and the backwardness of the least-favoured regions, among which particular attention is to be paid to certain categories of regions, including a specific reference to cross-border regions.\n(2)\nRegulation (EU) 2021/1060 of the European Parliament and of the Council (4) sets out provisions common to the ERDF and certain other funds and Regulation (EU) 2021/1058 of the European Parliament and of the Council (5) sets out provisions concerning the specific objectives and the scope of the ERDF support. It is also necessary to adopt specific provisions concerning the European territorial cooperation goal (Interreg) where one or more Member States and their regions and, where relevant, partner countries and third countries cooperate across borders with regard to effective programming, including provisions on technical assistance, monitoring, evaluation, communication, eligibility, management and control and financial management.\n(3)\nThe promotion of Interreg is a major priority of Union cohesion policy. Support for small and medium-sized enterprises for costs incurred in European territorial cooperation (ETC) projects is already block-exempted pursuant to Commission Regulation (EU) No 651/2014 (6) and special provisions in relation to regional aid for investments by undertakings of all sizes are also included in the regional aid section of that Regulation and in the Commission Guidelines on regional State aid for 2014-2020. Taking into account the 30 years’ experience gained, and given the low financial value of projects and the unlikely negative impact on trade and competition, on the one hand, and the high added value brought by the existing programmes to territorial cohesion in Europe, on the other, the scope of the State aid rules with regard to public financing of ETC projects is expected to be further clarified through future amendment of Regulation (EU) No 651/2014, thereby largely exempting the public financing of Interreg projects from the obligation of prior notification and greatly facilitating the implementation of those projects.\n(4)\nIn order to support the harmonious development of the Union’s territory at different levels, the ERDF should support cross-border cooperation, transnational cooperation, interregional cooperation and outermost regions’ cooperation under Interreg goal. In the process, the principles of partnership and multi-level governance should be taken into account, while ensuring that the scale of partnership for a programme remains effective.\n(5)\nReflecting the importance of tackling climate change in line with the Union’s commitments to implement the Paris Agreement adopted under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and to achieve the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, the Funds will contribute to mainstream climate actions and to the achievement of an overall target of 30 % of Union budget expenditure supporting climate objectives. In that context the Funds should support activities that respect the climate and environmental standards and that would do no significant harm to environmental objectives within the meaning of Article 17 of Regulation (EU) 2020/852 of the European Parliament and of the Council (7).\n(6)\nThe cross-border cooperation strand should aim to tackle common challenges identified jointly in the border regions, and to exploit the untapped growth potential in border areas as evidenced in the Commission communication of 20 September 2017 entitled ‘Boosting Growth and Cohesion in EU Border Regions’ (‘Border Regions Communication’). As a result, the programme areas for cross-border cooperation should be identified as those regions and areas on the border or separated by a maximum of 150 km of sea where cross-border interaction may effectively take place or in which functional areas can be identified, without prejudice to potential adjustments needed to ensure the coherence and continuity of cooperation programme areas.\n(7)\nThe cross-border cooperation strand should also involve cooperation between one or more Member States or their regions, and one or more countries or regions, or other territories outside the Union. Covering internal and external cross-border cooperation under this Regulation should result in a major simplification and streamlining of applicable provisions for the programme authorities in Member States and for the partner authorities and beneficiaries outside the Union compared to the 2014-2020 programming period.\n(8)\nThe transnational cooperation strand should aim to strengthen cooperation by means of actions conducive to integrated territorial development linked to the Union’s priorities, in full respect of subsidiarity. Transnational cooperation should cover larger territories on the mainland of the Union and around sea basins with maximum flexibility to ensure the coherence and continuity of cooperation programmes, including previous external maritime cross-border cooperation within a larger maritime cooperation framework, in particular by defining the territory covered, the specific objectives for such cooperation, the requirements for a project partnership and the possibility to set up sub-programmes and specific steering committees.\n(9)\nBased on the experience with cross-border and transnational cooperation during the 2014-2020 programming period in outermost regions, where the combination of both strands within a single programme per cooperation area has not brought about sufficient simplification for programme authorities and beneficiaries, a specific outermost regions’ strand should be established in order to enable outermost regions to cooperate with their neighbouring countries and territories in the most effective and simple way. Under that strand, calls for proposals could be launched for combined funding under the ERDF, the Neighbourhood, Development and International Cooperation Instrument (NDICI) established by Regulation (EU) 2021/947 of the European Parliament and of the Council (8) and the Overseas Association Decision (OAD) established by Council Decision 2013/755/EU (9), through management modes to be agreed upon between participating Member States and regions and third countries.\n(10)\nBased on the experience with the interregional cooperation programmes under Interreg, the interregional cooperation strand should focus on boosting the effectiveness of cohesion policy through four specific programmes: a programme to enable the exchange of experiences, innovative approaches and capacity building focusing on policy objectives and the Interreg-specific objective ‘a better cooperation governance’, in relation to the identification, dissemination and transfer of good practices into regional development policies including Investment for jobs and growth goal programmes; a programme dedicated to the exchange of experiences and capacity building in relation to the identification, transfer and capitalisation of good practices on integrated and sustainable urban development, taking into account the linkages between urban and rural areas including support to actions developed in the framework of Article 11 of Regulation (EU) 2021/1058, complementing and being coordinated with the initiative outlined in Article 12 thereof; a programme for the exchange of experiences, innovative approaches and capacity building with a view to harmonising and simplifying the implementation of Interreg programmes, to harmonising and simplifying cooperation actions referred in point (d) (vi) of Article 22(3) of Regulation (EU) 2021/1060, and supporting the setting-up, functioning and use of European groupings of territorial cooperation (‘EGTCs’) already set up or to be set up pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 1082/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council (10) as well as macro-regional strategies; and a programme to improve the analysis of development trends. The four programmes under the interregional cooperation strand should cover the whole Union and should also be open for the participation of third countries.\n(11)\nCommon objective criteria for designating eligible regions and areas should be established. To that end, the identification of eligible regions and areas at Union level should be based on the common system of classification of the regions established by Regulation (EC) No 1059/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council (11).\n(12)\nIt is necessary to continue supporting or, as appropriate, to establish cooperation in all its dimensions with the Union’s neighbouring third countries, as such cooperation is an important regional development policy tool and should benefit the regions of the Member States which border third countries. To that effect, the ERDF and the external financing instruments of the Union, the Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance (IPA III) established by a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing the Instrument for Pre-accession Assistance (IPA III) (the ‘IPA III Regulation’), NDICI and OAD should support programmes under cross-border cooperation, transnational cooperation, interregional cooperation and outermost regions’ cooperation. The support from the ERDF and from the external financing instruments of the Union should be based on reciprocity and proportionality. However, for IPA III funds allocated to cross-border cooperation (‘IPA III-CBC’) and NDICI funds allocated to cross-border cooperation for the neighbourhood geographic area (‘NDICI-CBC’), the ERDF support should be complemented by at least equivalent amounts under IPA III-CBC and NDICI-CBC, subject to a maximum amount set out in the respective legal act.\n(13)\nIPA III assistance is to mainly focus on assisting the IPA III beneficiaries to strengthen democratic institutions and the rule of law, reform the judiciary and public administration, respect fundamental rights and promote gender equality, tolerance, social inclusion and non-discrimination as well as regional and local development. IPA III assistance is to continue to support the efforts of the IPA III beneficiaries to advance regional, macro-regional and cross-border cooperation as well as territorial development, including through the implementation of Union macro-regional strategies. In addition, IPA III assistance is to address security, migration and border management, ensuring access to international protection, sharing relevant information, enhancing border control and pursuing common efforts in the fight against irregular migration and migrant smuggling.\n(14)\nWith regard to NDICI assistance, the Union should develop a special relationship with neighbouring countries, aiming to establish an area of prosperity and good neighbourliness, founded on the values of the Union and characterised by close and peaceful relations based on cooperation. This Regulation should therefore support internal and external aspects of relevant macro-regional strategies. Those initiatives are strategically important and offer meaningful political frameworks for deepening relations with and among partner countries, based on the principles of mutual accountability, shared ownership and responsibility.\n(15)\nIt is important to continue observing the role of the European External Action Service as established in Council Decision 2010/427/EU (12) and that of the Commission in the preparation of the strategic programming and of Interreg programmes supported by the ERDF and the NDICI.\n(16)\nIn view of the specific situation of outermost regions of the Union, it is necessary to adopt measures concerning the improvement of conditions under which those regions are able to have access to structural funds. Consequently, certain provisions of this Regulation should be adapted to the specificities of the outermost regions of the Union in order to simplify and foster their cooperation with overseas countries and territories (‘OCTs’) and third countries, while taking into account the Commission communication of 24 October 2017 entitled ‘A stronger and renewed strategic partnership with the EU’s outermost regions’. It should be possible for that cooperation to be carried out in close partnership with regional integration and cooperation organisations.\n(17)\nThis Regulation should lay down the possibility of the OCTs to participate in Interreg programmes. The specificities and challenges of the OCTs should be taken into consideration in order to facilitate their effective access and participation.\n(18)\nIt is necessary to set out the resources allocated to each of the different strands of Interreg, including each Member State’s share of the global amounts for cross-border cooperation, transnational cooperation, outermost regions’ cooperation and the potential available to Member States concerning flexibility between those strands.\n(19)\nFor the most efficient use of the support from the ERDF and the external financing instruments of the Union, a mechanism should be set up to organise the return of such support in cases where external cooperation programmes cannot be adopted or have to be discontinued, including with third countries which do not receive support from any financing instrument of the Union. That mechanism should seek to achieve optimal functioning of the programmes and the maximum possible coordination between those instruments.\n(20)\nThe ERDF should contribute, under Interreg, to the specific objectives under the cohesion policy objectives. However, the list of the specific objectives under the different policy objectives should be adapted to the specific needs of Interreg in order to allow for ESF-type interventions, according to points (a) to (l) of Article 4(1) of Regulation (EU) 2021/1057 of the European Parliament and of the Council (13) through joint actions under Interreg programmes.\n(21)\nWithin the context of the unique and specific circumstances on the island of Ireland, and with a view to supporting North-South cooperation under the Good Friday Agreement, a PEACE PLUS cross-border programme is to continue and build on the work of previous programmes between the border counties of Ireland and Northern Ireland. Taking into account its practical importance, it is necessary to ensure that, where that programme is acting in support of peace and reconciliation, the ERDF should also contribute to promoting social, economic and regional stability and cooperation in the regions concerned, in particular through actions that promote cohesion between communities. Given the specificities of that programme, it should be managed in an integrated manner with the United Kingdom contribution being integrated into that programme as external assigned revenue. Furthermore, certain rules on the selection of operations in this Regulation should not apply to that programme in relation to operations in support of peace and reconciliation.\n(22)\nThis Regulation should add two Interreg-specific objectives: an objective to support strengthening institutional capacity, enhancing legal and administrative cooperation, in particular where linked to implementation of the Border Regions Communication, intensify cooperation between citizens and institutions and the development and coordination of macro-regional and sea-basin strategies, build up mutual trust, in particular by encouraging people-to-people actions; and a second objective to address cooperation issues on safety, security, border crossing management and migration.\n(23)\nThe major part of the Union support should be concentrated on a limited number of policy objectives in order to maximise the impact of Interreg. Synergies and complementarities between the strands of Interreg should be strengthened.\n(24)\nProvisions on the preparation, approval and amendment of Interreg programmes as well as on territorial development, on the selection of operations, on monitoring and evaluation, on the programme authorities, on audit of operations, and on transparency and communication should be adapted to the specificities of Interreg programmes compared to the provisions set out in Regulation (EU) 2021/1060. Those specific provisions should be kept simple and clear in order to avoid gold-plating and additional administrative burdens for Member States and beneficiaries.\n(25)\nThe provisions on the criteria for operations to be considered as genuinely joint and cooperative, on the partnership within an Interreg operation and on the obligations of the lead partner as set out during the 2014-2020 programming period should be continued. Interreg partners should cooperate in development and implementation as well as in staffing or financing, or both, and under outermost regions’ cooperation, in two out of four of these cooperation dimensions, as it should be simpler to combine support from the ERDF and external financing instruments from the Union both on the level of programmes and operations.\n(26)\nUnder cross-border cooperation programmes, people-to-people and small-scale projects are important and successful instruments, with high European added value, for eliminating border and cross border obstacles, fostering contacts between people locally and, bringing border regions and their citizens closer together. So far they have been supported via small-project funds or similar instruments, although they have never been covered by specific provisions, making it necessary to clarify the rules governing those funds. In order to maintain the added value and advantages of people-to-people and small-scale projects, also with regard to local and regional development, and to simplify the management of the financing of small projects by the final recipients who are often not used to applying for Union funds, the use of simplified cost options and of lump sums should be made obligatory below a certain threshold.\n(27)\nDue to the involvement of more than one Member State, and the resulting higher administrative costs, including for regional points of contact also known as ‘antennae’, which are important points of contact for those proposing and implementing projects, and therefore function as a direct line to the joint secretariats or the relevant authorities, but in particular in respect of controls and translation, the ceiling for technical assistance expenditure should be higher than that under the Investment for jobs and growth goal. In order to offset the higher administrative costs, Member States should be encouraged to reduce the administrative burden with regard to the implementation of joint projects wherever possible. In addition, Interreg programmes with limited Union support or external cross-border Interreg programmes should receive a certain minimum amount for technical assistance to ensure sufficient funding for effective technical assistance activities, including for regional branch offices of joint secretariats and contact points set up to be closer to potential beneficiaries and partners.\n(28)\nPursuant to paragraphs 22 and 23 of the Interinstitutional Agreement of 13 April 2016 on Better Law-Making (14), this Regulation should be evaluated on the basis of information collected in accordance with specific monitoring requirements, while avoiding an administrative burden, in particular on Member States, and overregulation. Those requirements, where appropriate, should include measurable indicators as a basis for evaluating the effects of the funding on the ground.\n(29)\nBased on the experience gained during the 2014-2020 programming period, the system introducing a clear hierarchy of rules on eligibility of expenditure should be continued while maintaining the principle of rules on eligibility of expenditure to be established at Union level and for an Interreg programme as a whole to avoid any possible contradictions or inconsistencies between different regulations and between Union and national law. Additional rules adopted by one Member State which would only apply to the beneficiaries in that Member State should be limited to the strict minimum. In particular, Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 481/2014 (15), adopted for the 2014-2020 programming period, should be integrated into this Regulation.\n(30)\nMember States should be encouraged to assign the functions of the managing authority to an EGTC or to make such a grouping, like other cross-border legal bodies, responsible for managing a sub-programme, an integrated territorial investment or one or more small project funds, or to act as sole partner. In that context, a cross-border legal body, including euroregions, should be established and have legal personality pursuant to the law of one of the participating countries, and the participation of regional and local authorities from all participating countries should be granted.\n(31)\nIn order to continue the payment chain established for the 2014-2020 programming period, namely, from the Commission to the lead partner via the certifying authority, that payment chain should be continued under the accounting function. The Union support should be paid to the lead partner, unless this would result in double fees for conversion into euro and back into another currency or vice versa between the lead partner and the other partners. If not otherwise specified, the lead partner should ensure that the other partners receive the total amount of the contribution from the respective Union fund in full and within the timeframe agreed by all partners and following the same procedure applied in respect of the lead partner.\n(32)\nPursuant to Article 63(9) of Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2018/1046 of the European Parliament and of the Council (16) (the ‘Financial Regulation’) sector-specific rules are to take account of the needs of Interreg programmes in particular as regards the audit function. The provisions on the annual audit opinion, the annual control report and the audits of operations should therefore be simplified and adapted to those programmes involving more than one Member State.\n(33)\nA clear chain of financial liability in respect of recovery for irregularities should be established from sole or other partners via the lead partner and the managing authority to the Commission. Provision should be made for liability of Member States, third countries, partner countries or OCTs, where obtaining recovery from the sole or other or lead partner is not successful, meaning that the Member State reimburses the managing authority. Consequently, under Interreg programmes there is no scope for irrecoverable amounts at the level of beneficiaries. It is, however, necessary to clarify the rules, should a Member State, third country, partner country or OCT not reimburse the managing authority. The obligations of the lead partner for recovery should also be clarified.\n(34)\nIn order to apply a mostly common set of rules both in the participating Member States and third countries, partner countries or OCTs, this Regulation should also apply to the participation of third countries, partner countries or OCTs, unless specific rules are set out in a specific chapter of this Regulation. Interreg programme authorities may be mirrored by comparable authorities in third countries, partner countries or OCTs. The starting point for the eligibility of expenditure should be linked to the signature of the financing agreement by the relevant third country, partner country or OCT. Procurement for beneficiaries in the third country, partner country or OCT should follow the rules for external procurement provided for in the Financial Regulation. The procedures for the conclusion of financing agreements with each of the third countries, partner countries or OCTs as well as of the agreements between the managing authority and each third country, partner country or OCT with regard to the support from an external financing instrument of the Union or in the case of transfer of an additional contribution from a third country, partner country or OCT to the Interreg programme other than national co-financing should be set out.\n(35)\nAlthough Interreg programmes with the participation of third countries, partner countries or OCTs should be implemented under shared management, it should be possible for outermost regions’ cooperation to be implemented under indirect management. Specific rules should be set out on how to implement those programmes as a whole or partially under indirect management.\n(36)\nBased on the experience gained during the 2014-2020 programming period with large infrastructure projects within cross-border cooperation programmes under the European Neighbourhood Instrument established by Regulation (EU) No 232/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council (17), the procedures should be simplified. However, the Commission should retain certain rights concerning the selection of such projects.\n(37)\nIn order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of this Regulation, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission to adopt and amend the lists of Interreg programme areas to receive support and the list of the global amount of the Union support for each Interreg programme. Implementing powers should also be conferred on the Commission to adopt the multi-annual strategy documents for Interreg programmes supported by an external financing instrument of the Union. Those powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council (18). Although those acts are of a general nature, the advisory procedure should be used given that they only implement the provisions in a technical way. Where applicable, the multi-annual strategy documents for Interreg programmes supported by an external financial instrument should also respect the procedure set out in the IPA III Regulation and Regulation (EU) 2021/947.\n(38)\nIn order to ensure uniform conditions for the approval Interreg programmes and of amendments thereto, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission. Where applicable, external cross-border Interreg programmes should respect committee procedures established under the IPA III Regulation and Regulation (EU) 2021/947 with regard to the first approval decision of those programmes.\n(39)\nIn order to supplement or amend certain non-essential elements of this Regulation, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 TFEU should be delegated to the Commission in respect of amending the Annex. It is of particular importance that the Commission carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level, and that those consultations be conducted in accordance with the principles laid down in the Interinstitutional Agreement of 13 April 2016 on Better Law-Making. In particular, to ensure equal participation in the preparation of delegated acts, the European Parliament and the Council receive all documents at the same time as Member States’ experts, and their experts systematically have access to meetings of Commission expert groups dealing with the preparation of delegated acts.\n(40)\nIn view of the adoption of this Regulation after the start of the programming period, and taking into account the need to implement Interreg in a coordinated and harmonised manner, and in order to allow for its prompt implementation, it should enter into force on the day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\n(41)\nSince the objective of this Regulation, namely to foster cooperation between Member States and between Member States and third countries, partner countries or OCTs cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States but can rather, by reason of the scale or effects of the action, be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve that objective,\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS

PROVISIONS\nSECTION I\nSubject matter, scope and Interreg strands\nArticle 1\nSubject matter and scope\nThis Regulation lays down rules for the European territorial cooperation goal (Interreg) with a view to fostering cooperation between Member States and their regions inside the Union and between Member States, their regions and third countries, partner countries, other territories or overseas countries and territories (OCTs), or regional integration and cooperation organisations.\nThis Regulation also lays down the provisions necessary to ensure effective programming including on technical assistance, monitoring, evaluation, communication, eligibility, management and control, as well as financial management of programmes under Interreg (‘Interreg programmes’) supported by the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF).\nWith regard to support from the Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance (IPA III), the Neighbourhood, Development and International Cooperation Instrument (NDICI) and the funding for all the OCTs for the 2021-2027 programming period established as a programme by Decision 2013/755/EU (jointly referred to as ‘the external financing instruments of the Union’) to Interreg programmes, this Regulation sets out additional specific objectives as well as the integration of those funds into Interreg programmes, the criteria for third countries, partner countries and OCTs and their regions to be eligible and certain specific implementation rules.\nWith regard to support from the ERDF and the external financing instruments of the Union (jointly referred to as ‘the Interreg funds’) to Interreg programmes, this Regulation sets out the Interreg-specific objectives as well as the organisation of Interreg, the eligibility criteria for Member States, third countries, partner countries and OCTs and their regions, the financial resources, and the criteria for their allocation.\nRegulation (EU) 2021/1060 and Regulation (EU) 2021/1058 shall apply to Interreg programmes, except where specifically provided for otherwise under those Regulations and this Regulation or where Regulation (EU) 2021/1060 can only apply to the Investment for jobs and growth goal.\nArticle 2\nDefinitions\nFor the purpose of this Regulation, the definitions in Article 2 of Regulation (EU) 2021/1060 apply.

Member States and, where applicable, third countries, partner countries and OCTs participating in an Interreg programme shall identify, for the purposes of Article 71 of Regulation (EU) 2021/1060, a single managing authority and a single audit authority.\n2.   The managing authority and the audit authority shall be located in the same Member State.\n3.   As regards the PEACE PLUS cross-border programme, the Special EU Programmes Body, where it is identified as the managing authority, shall be considered to be located in a Member State.\n4.   Member States and, where applicable, third countries, partner countries and OCTs participating in an Interreg programme may identify an EGTC as managing authority of that programme.\n5.   Where the managing authority identifies one or more intermediate bodies under an Interreg programme in accordance with Article 71(3) of Regulation (EU) 2021/1060, the intermediate body shall carry out those tasks in more than one participating Member State or, where applicable, in a third country, partner country or OCT. Without prejudice to Article 22 of this Regulation, one or more intermediate bodies may carry out those tasks in only one participating Member State or, where applicable, in a third country, partner country or OCT where such an approach is based on existing structures.\nArticle 46\nFunctions of the managing authority\n1.   The managing authority of an Interreg programme shall carry out the functions laid down in Articles 72, 74 and 75 of Regulation (EU) 2021/1060, with the exception of the task of selecting operations referred to in point (a) of Article 72(1) and Article 73 of that Regulation and, where the accounting function is carried out by a different body pursuant to Article 47 of this Regulation, of payments to beneficiaries referred to in point (b) of Article 74(1) of Regulation (EU) 2021/1060. Those functions shall be carried out in the whole territory covered by that programme, subject to derogations set out pursuant to Chapter VIII of this Regulation.\n2.   The managing authority, after consultation with the Member States and, where applicable, any third countries, partner countries or OCTs participating in the Interreg programme, shall set up a joint secretariat, with staff taking into account the programme partnership.\nThe joint secretariat shall assist the managing authority and the monitoring committee in carrying out their respective functions. The joint secretariat shall also provide information to potential beneficiaries about funding opportunities under Interreg programmes and shall assist beneficiaries and partners in the implementation of operations.\nFor Interreg programmes also supported by external financing instruments from the Union, one or more branch offices of the joint secretariat may be set up in one or more partner countries or OCTs in order to carry out its tasks closer to potential beneficiaries and partners from the partner country or OCT, respectively.\n3.   By way of derogation to point (a) of Article 74(1) of Regulation (EU) 2021/1060 and without prejudice to Article 45(5) of this Regulation, the Member States, and where applicable, the third country, partner country or OCT, participating in the Interreg programme, may decide that management verifications referred to in point (a) of Article 74(1) of Regulation (EU) 2021/1060 are to be done through the identification by each Member State of a body or person responsible for this verification on its territory (the ‘controller’).\n4.   The controllers may be the same bodies responsible for carrying out such verifications for the programmes under the Investment for jobs and growth goal or, in the case of third countries, partner countries or OCTs for carrying out comparable verifications under external financing instruments of the Union. Any controller shall be functionally independent from the audit authority or any member of the group of auditors.\n5.   Where it has been decided that management verifications are carried out by identified controllers pursuant to paragraph 4, the managing authority shall satisfy itself that the expenditure of beneficiaries participating in an operation has been verified by an identified controller.\n6.   Each Member State, third country, partner country or OCT shall ensure that the expenditure of a beneficiary can be verified within a period of three months of the submission of the documents by the beneficiary concerned.\n7.   Each Member State, third country, partner country or OCT shall be responsible for verifications carried out on its territory.\n8.   Each Member State, third country, partner country and OCT shall identify as controller either a national or regional authority or a private body or a natural person as set out in paragraph 9.\n9.   Where the controller carrying out management verifications is a private body or a natural person, those controllers shall meet at least one of the following requirements:\n(a)\nbe a member of a national accounting or auditing body or institution which in turn is a member of International Federation of Accountants (IFAC);\n(b)\nbe a member of a national accounting or auditing body or institution without being a member of IFAC, but committing to carry out the management verifications in accordance with IFAC standards and ethics;\n(c)\nbe registered as a statutory auditor in the public register of a public oversight body in a Member State in accordance with the principles of public oversight set out in Directive 2006/43/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (21); or\n(d)\nbe registered as a statutory auditor in the public register of a public oversight body in a third country, partner country or OCT, provided this register is subject to principles of public oversight as set out in the legislation of the country concerned.\nArticle 47\nThe accounting function\n1.   Member States and, where applicable, third countries, partner countries and OCTs participating in an Interreg programme shall agree on the arrangements for carrying out the accounting function.\n2.   The accounting function shall consist of the tasks listed in points (a) and (b) of Article 76(1) of Regulation (EU) 2021/1060 and shall also cover the payments made by the Commission and, as a general rule, the payments made to the lead partner in accordance with point (b) of Article 74(1) of that Regulation.\nArticle 48\nFunctions of the audit authority\n1.   The audit authority of an Interreg programme shall carry out the functions provided for in this Article and in Article 49 in the whole of the territory covered by that Interreg programme.\nWhere the audit authority does not have the authorisation in the whole territory covered by a cooperation programme, it shall be assisted by a group of auditors composed of a representative from each Member State and, where applicable, third country, partner country or OCT, participating in the Interreg programme. Each Member State and, where applicable, each third country, partner country or OCT shall be responsible for audits carried out on its territory.\nEach representative from each Member State and, where applicable, each third country, partner country or OCT, participating in the Interreg programme shall be responsible for providing the factual elements relating to expenditure on its territory that are required by the audit authority in order to perform its assessment.\nThe group of auditors shall be set up within three months of the decision approving the Interreg programme pursuant to Article 18. It shall draw up its rules of procedure and be chaired by the audit authority for the Interreg programme.\nThe auditors shall be functionally independent from bodies or persons responsible for management verifications pursuant to Article 46(3).\n2.   The audit authority of an Interreg programme shall be responsible for carrying out system audits and audits on operations in order to provide independent assurance to the Commission that management and control systems function effectively and that expenditure included in the accounts submitted to the Commission is legal and regular.\n3.   Where an Interreg programme is included in the population from which the Commission selects a common sample pursuant to Article 49(1), the audit authority shall carry out audits of operations selected by the Commission in order to provide independent assurance to the Commission that management and control systems function effectively.\n4.   Audit work shall be carried out in accordance with internationally accepted audit standards.\n5.   The audit authority shall draw up and submit to the Commission, each year by 15 February following the end of the accounting year, an annual audit opinion in accordance with Article 63(7) of the Financial Regulation using the template set out in Annex XIX to Regulation (EU) 2021/1060 and based on all audit work carried out, covering each of the following components:\n(a)\nthe completeness, veracity and accuracy of the accounts;\n(b)\nthe legality and regularity of the expenditure included in the accounts submitted to the Commission; and\n(c)\nthe management and control system of the Interreg programme.\nWhere the Interreg programme is included in the population from which the Commission selects a common sample pursuant to Article 49(1), the annual audit opinion shall only cover the elements referred to in points (a) and (c) of the first subparagraph of this paragraph.\nThe deadline of 15 February may exceptionally be extended by the Commission to 1 March, upon communication by the audit authority.\n6.   The audit authority shall draw up and submit to the Commission, each year by 15 February following the end of the accounting year, an annual control report in accordance with point (b) of Article 63(5) of the Financial Regulation using the template set out in Annex XX of Regulation (EU) 2021/1060 and, supporting the audit opinion provided for in paragraph 5 of this Article and setting out a summary of the findings, including an analysis of the nature and extent of any errors and deficiencies in the systems as well as the proposed and implemented corrective actions and the resulting total error rate and residual error rate for the expenditure entered in the accounts submitted to the Commission.\n7.   Where the Interreg programme is included in the population from which the Commission selects a common sample pursuant to Article 49(1), the audit authority shall draw up, using the template set out in Annex XX to Regulation (EU) 2021/1060, the annual control report referred to in paragraph 6 of this Article that fulfils the requirements of point (b) of Article 63(5) of the Financial Regulation and supports the audit opinion provided for in paragraph 5 of this Article.\nThat report shall set out a summary of the findings, including an analysis of the nature and extent of any errors and deficiencies in the systems as well as the proposed and implemented corrective actions, the results of the audits of operations carried out by the audit authority in relation to the common sample referred to in Article 49(1) and the financial corrections applied by the Interreg programme authorities in respect of any individual irregularities detected by the audit authority for these operations.\n8.   The audit authority shall transmit system audit reports to the Commission as soon as the required contradictory procedure with the relevant auditees is concluded.\n9.   The Commission and the audit authority shall meet on a regular basis and at least once a year, unless otherwise agreed, to examine the audit strategy, the annual control report and the audit opinion, to coordinate their audit plans and methods and to exchange views on issues relating to the improvement of management and control systems.\nArticle 49\nAudit of operations\n1.   The Commission shall select a common sample of operations, or other sampling units, using a statistical sampling method for the audits of operations to be carried out by the audit authorities for the Interreg programmes receiving support from the ERDF or an external financing instrument of the Union in respect of each accounting year.\nThe common sample shall be representative of all the Interreg programmes constituting the population.\nFor the purposes of selecting the common sample, the Commission may stratify groups of Interreg programmes according to their specific risks.\n2.   The programme authorities shall provide the information necessary for the selection of a common sample to the Commission by 1 August following the end of each accounting year.\nThat information shall be submitted in a standardised electronic format, shall be complete and shall reconcile with the expenditure declared to the Commission for the reference accounting year.\n3.   Without prejudice to the requirement to carry out an audit as referred to in Article 48(2), the audit authorities for Interreg programmes covered by the common sample shall not carry out additional audits of operations under those programmes, unless requested to do so by the Commission in accordance with paragraph 8 of this Article or in cases for which an audit authority has identified specific risks.\n4.   The Commission shall inform the audit authorities of the Interreg programmes concerned of the common sample selected in sufficient time to allow these authorities to carry out the audits of operations, in general, by 1 September following the end of each accounting year.\n5.   The audit authorities concerned shall submit information on the results of these audits as well as on any financial correction taken in relation to individual irregularities detected, at the latest in the annual control reports to be submitted to the Commission pursuant to Article 48(6) and (7).\n6.   Following its assessment of the results of audits of operations selected pursuant to paragraph 1, the Commission shall calculate a global extrapolated error rate with regard to the Interreg programmes included in the population from which the common sample was selected, for the purposes of its own assurance process.\n7.   Where the global extrapolated error rate referred to in paragraph 6 is above 2 % of the total expenditure declared for the Interreg programmes included in the population from which the common sample was selected, the Commission shall calculate a global residual error rate, taking account of financial corrections applied by the respective Interreg programme authorities for individual irregularities detected by the audits of operations selected pursuant to paragraph 1.\n8.   Where the global residual error rate referred to in paragraph 7 is more than 2 % of the expenditure declared for the Interreg programmes included in the population from which the common sample was selected, the Commission shall determine whether it is necessary to request the audit authority of a specific Interreg programme or a group of Interreg programmes most affected to carry out additional audit work in order to further evaluate the error rate and assess the required corrective measures for the Interreg programmes affected by the irregularities detected.\n9.   Based on the assessment of the results of the additional audit work requested pursuant to paragraph 8 of this Article, the Commission may request additional financial corrections to be applied on the Interreg programmes affected by the irregularities detected. In such cases, the Interreg programme authorities shall carry out the required financial corrections in accordance with Article 103 of Regulation (EU) 2021/1060.\n10.   Each audit authority of an Interreg programme for which the information referred to in paragraph 2 of this Article is missing or incomplete or has not been submitted by the deadline laid down in the first subparagraph of that paragraph shall carry out a separate sampling exercise for the respective Interreg programme in accordance with Article 79 of Regulation (EU) 2021/1060.\nCHAPTER VII\nFINANCIAL MANAGEMENT\nArticle 50\nBudgetary commitments\nThe Commission decisions approving Interreg programmes pursuant to Article 18 of this Regulation shall meet the requirements necessary to constitute financing decisions within the meaning of Article 110(2) of the Financial Regulation with regard to the ERDF and the support by an external financing instrument of the Union under shared management.\nArticle 51\nPayments and pre-financing\n1.   The ERDF contribution and, where applicable, the support from external financing instruments of the Union to each Interreg programme shall be paid, in accordance with Article 47(2), into a single account with no national subaccounts.\n2.   The Commission shall pay a pre-financing based on the total support from each Interreg fund, as set out in the decision approving each Interreg programme pursuant to Article 18, subject to available funds, in yearly instalments as follows and before 1 July of the years 2022 to 2026, or, in the year of the approving decision, not later than 60 days after that decision is adopted:\n(a)\n2021: 1 %;\n(b)\n2022: 1 %;\n(c)\n2023: 3 %;\n(d)\n2024: 3 %;\n(e)\n2025: 3 %;\n(f)\n2026: 3 %.\n3.   Where Interreg programmes are supported by the ERDF and IPA III CBC and where the contribution from the ERDF is 50 % or less of the total Union allocation, the Commission shall pay a pre-financing in accordance with the relevant provision of the IPA III Regulation.\n4.   Where Interreg programmes are supported by the ERDF and either NDICI or both NDICI and IPA III, and where the contribution from the ERDF is 50 % or less of the total Union allocation, the Commission shall pay a pre-financing in accordance with Article 22(5) of Regulation (EU) 2021/947, taking into account the actual financial needs.\nArticles 96 and 97 of Regulation (EU) 2021/1060 shall apply mutatis mutandis to the pre-financing pursuant to the first subparagraph of this paragraph.\n5.   The amount paid as pre-financing shall be cleared from the Commission accounts each year for 2021 and 2022 and not later than with the final accounting year for 2023 and subsequent years as well as for amounts paid as pre-financing set out pursuant to paragraphs 3 and 4.\nArticle 52\nRecoveries\n1.   The managing authority shall ensure that any amount paid as a result of an irregularity is recovered from the lead or sole partner. Partners shall repay to the lead partner any amounts unduly paid.\n2.   The Member States, third countries, partner countries or OCTs participating in a given Interreg programme may decide that the lead or sole partner and the programme’s managing authority are not obliged to recover an amount unduly paid that does not exceed EUR 250, not including interest, in contribution from any of the Interreg funds to an operation in an accounting year.\nNo information needs to be provided to the Commission beyond the information about making a decision pursuant to the first subparagraph.\n3.   Where the lead partner does not succeed in securing repayment from other partners or where the managing authority does not succeed in securing repayment from the lead or sole partner, the Member State, third country, partner country or OCT on whose territory the partner concerned is located or, in the case of an EGTC, is registered, shall reimburse the managing authority any amounts unduly paid to that partner. The managing authority shall be responsible for reimbursing the amounts concerned to the general budget of the Union, in accordance with the apportionment of liabilities among the participating Member States, third countries, partner countries or OCTs set out in the Interreg programme.\n4.   Once the Member State, third country, partner country or OCT has reimbursed the managing authority any amounts unduly paid to a partner, it may continue or start a recovery procedure against that partner pursuant to its national law. In the event of successful recovery, the Member State, third country, partner country or OCT may use those amounts for the national co-financing of the Interreg programme concerned. The Member State, third country, partner country or OCT shall not have any reporting obligations towards the programme authorities, the monitoring committee or the Commission with regard to such national recoveries.\n5.   Where a Member State, third country, partner country or OCT has not reimbursed the managing authority any amounts unduly paid to a partner pursuant to paragraph 4 of this Article, those amounts shall be subject to a recovery order issued by the Commission which shall be executed, where possible, by offsetting to the Member State, third country, partner country or OCT, respectively. Such recovery shall not constitute a financial correction and shall not reduce the support from the ERDF or any external financing instrument of the Union to the respective Interreg programme. The amount recovered shall constitute assigned revenue in accordance with Article 21(3) of the Financial Regulation.\nWith regard to amounts not reimbursed to the managing authority by a Member State, the offsetting shall concern subsequent payments to the same Interreg programme. The managing authority shall then offset with regard to that Member State in accordance with the apportionment of liabilities among the participating Member States set out in the Interreg programme in the event of financial corrections imposed by the managing authority or the Commission.\nWith regard to amounts not reimbursed to the managing authority by a third country, partner country or OCT, the offsetting shall concern subsequent payments to programmes under the respective external financing instruments of the Union.\nCHAPTER VIII\nPARTICIPATION OF THIRD COUNTRIES OR PARTNER COUNTRIES, OCTS, OR REGIONAL INTEGRATION AND COOPERATION ORGANISATIONS IN INTERREG PROGRAMMES UNDER SHARED MANAGEMENT\nArticle 53\nApplicable provisions\nChapters I to VII and Chapter X shall apply to the PEACE PLUS cross-border programme and to participation of third countries, partner countries and OCTs as well as regional integration and cooperation organisations supported by external financing instruments from the Union in Interreg programmes, subject to the provisions set out in this Chapter.\nArticle 54\nInterreg programme authorities and their functions\n1.

Interreg A programmes supported both by the ERDF and IPA III CBC or NDICI-CBC shall be implemented under shared management both in the Member States and in any participating third country or partner country.\nThe PEACE PLUS cross-border programme shall be implemented under shared management both in Ireland and in the United Kingdom.\n2.   Interreg B and C programmes combining contributions from the ERDF and from one or more external financing instrument of the Union shall be implemented under shared management both in the Member States and in any participating third country, partner country, participating OCT or, with regard to Interreg D, in any OCT, whether or not that OCT receives support under one or more external financing instruments of the Union.\n3.   Interreg D programmes combining contributions from the ERDF and one or more external financing instruments of the Union shall be implemented in any of the following ways:\n(a)\nunder shared management both in the Member States and in any participating third country or OCT;\n(b)\nunder shared management only in the Member States and in any participating third country or OCT with regard to ERDF expenditure outside the Union for one or more operations, whereas the contributions from one or more external financing instruments of the Union are managed under indirect management;\n(c)\nunder indirect management both in the Member States and in any participating third country or OCT.\nWhere all or part of an Interreg D programme is implemented under indirect management, Article 61 shall apply.\nArticle 56\nEligibility\n1.   By way of derogation from Article 63(2) of Regulation (EU) 2021/1060, expenditure shall be eligible for a contribution from external financing instruments of the Union if it has been incurred and paid in the preparation and implementation of Interreg operations from 1 January 2021 or from the date of the programme submission, whichever date is earlier, but may be claimed from the programme after the date when the financing agreement with the respective third country, partner country or OCT was concluded.\nHowever, expenditure for technical assistance managed by programme authorities located in a Member State may already be claimed from the programme before the date when the financing agreement with the respective third country, partner country or OCT was concluded.\n2.   Where an Interreg programme selects operations based on calls for proposals, such calls may include applications for a contribution from external financing instruments of the Union, even where the calls were launched and operations were selected before the relevant financing agreement was concluded.\nThe managing authority may provide the document provided for in Article 22(6) before the relevant financing agreement was concluded.\nArticle 57\nLarge infrastructure projects\n1.   Interreg programmes under this Chapter may support large infrastructure projects meaning operations comprising a set of works, activities or services intended to fulfil an indivisible function of a precise nature pursuing clearly identified objectives of common interest for the purposes of implementing investments delivering a cross-border impact and benefits and where a budget share of a total cost of at least EUR 2 500 000 is allocated to the acquisition, construction or modernisation of infrastructure.\n2.   Each beneficiary implementing a large infrastructure project or a part thereof shall apply the applicable public procurement rules.\n3.   The Member State hosting the managing authority of the relevant Interreg programme shall send to the Commission a list of planned large infrastructure projects indicating the prospective name, location, budget and lead partner. That list shall be sent as a separate document either when transmitting the signed copy of the financing agreement or a copy of the implementing agreement as referred to in Article 59 to the Commission or at the latest two months before the meeting of the monitoring committee or, if applicable, the steering committee selecting the first of the envisaged large infrastructure projects.\n4.   Where the selection of one or more large infrastructure projects is on the agenda of a monitoring committee or, where applicable, steering committee meeting, the managing authority shall transmit a concept note for each such project to the Commission, for information, at the latest two months before the date of the meeting. The concept note shall be a maximum of three pages and shall indicate the name, the location, the budget, the lead partner and the partners as well as the main objectives and deliverables thereof. If the concept note concerning one or more large infrastructure projects is not transmitted to the Commission by that deadline, the Commission may request that the chair of the monitoring committee or steering committee remove the projects concerned from the agenda of the meeting.\nArticle 58\nProcurement\n1.   Where the implementation of an operation requires procurement of service, supply or works contracts by a beneficiary, the following rules shall apply:\n(a)\nwhere the beneficiary is located in a Member State and is a contracting authority or a contracting entity within the meaning of the Union law applicable to public procurement procedures, it shall apply national laws, regulations and administrative provisions;\n(b)\nwhere the beneficiary is a public authority of a partner country under IPA III or NDICI whose co-financing is transferred to the managing authority, it may apply national laws, regulations and administrative provisions, provided that the financing agreement allows it and that the contract is awarded to the tender offering best value for money, or as appropriate, to the tender offering the lowest price, while avoiding any conflict of interests.\n2.   For the award of goods, works or services in all cases other than those referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article, the procurement procedures provided for in Articles 178 and 179 of the Financial Regulation and points 36 to 41 of Chapter 3 of Annex I to that Regulation shall apply.\nArticle 59\nConclusion of financing agreements under shared management\n1.   In order to implement an Interreg programme in a third country, partner country or OCT, in accordance with Article 112(4) of the Financial Regulation, a financing agreement shall be concluded between the Commission, representing the Union, and each participating third country, partner country or OCT represented in accordance with its national legal framework.\n2.   Any financing agreement shall be concluded by 31 December of the year following the year when the first budget commitment was made and shall be considered to be concluded on the date when the last party has signed it.\nAny financing agreement shall enter into force either on the date:\n(a)\nwhen the last party has signed it; or\n(b)\nwhen the third or partner country or OCT has completed the procedure required for ratification in accordance with its national legal framework and has informed the Commission.\n3.   The Commission shall provide the draft financing agreement when approving the external programme.\nWhere an Interreg programme involves more than one third country, partner country or OCT, at least one financing agreement shall be concluded by both parties before the date specified in paragraph 2. The other third countries, partner countries or OCTs may sign their respective financing agreements at the latest on 30 June of the second year following the year when the first budget commitment was made.\n4.   The Member State hosting the managing authority of the relevant Interreg programme either:\n(a)\nmay also sign the financing agreement; or\n(b)\nshall sign, without delay, an implementing agreement with each third country, partner country or OCT participating in that Interreg programme setting out the mutual rights and obligations with regard to its implementation and financial management.\n5.   An implementing agreement signed pursuant to point (b) of paragraph 4 shall at least cover the following elements:\n(a)\ndetailed arrangements for payments;\n(b)\nfinancial management;\n(c)\nrecord keeping;\nd)\nreporting obligations;\n(e)\nverifications, controls and audit; and\n(f)\nirregularities and recoveries.\n6.   Where the Member State hosting the managing authority of the Interreg programme decides to sign the financing agreement pursuant to point (a) of paragraph 4 of this Article, that financing agreement shall be considered to be a tool to implement the Union budget in accordance with the Financial Regulation and not an international agreement as referred to in Articles 216 to 219 TFEU.\nArticle 60\nThird country, partner country or OCT contribution other than co-financing\n1.   Where a third country, partner country or OCT transfers to the managing authority a financial contribution to support the Interreg programme, other than its co-financing of the Union support to the Interreg programme, the rules concerning that financial contribution shall be contained in the following document:\n(a)\nwhere the Member State concerned signs the financing agreement pursuant to point (a) of Article 59(4), in one of the following:\n(i)\na distinct part of that financing agreement; or\n(ii)\nin a separate implementing agreement signed either between the Member State hosting the managing authority and the third country, partner country or OCT or directly between the managing authority and the competent authority in the third country, partner country or OCT; and\n(b)\nwhere the Member State concerned signs an implementing agreement pursuant to point (b) of Article 59(4), in one of the following:\n(i)\na distinct part of that implementing agreement; or\n(ii)\nan additional implementing agreement signed between the same parties referred to in point (a).\nFor the purposes of point (b)(i) of the first subparagraph, sections of the implementing agreement may, where applicable, cover both the transferred financial contribution and the Union support to the Interreg programme.\n2.   An implementing agreement provided for in paragraph 1 of this Article shall at least contain the elements concerning the third country’s, partner country’s or OCT’s co-financing listed in Article 59(5).\nIn addition, it shall set out both of the following:\n(a)\nthe amount of the additional financial contribution; and\n(b)\nthe intended use and conditions for its use, including conditions for applications for that additional contribution.\n3.   With regard to the PEACE PLUS cross-border programme, the financial contribution to Union activities from the United Kingdom in the form of external assigned revenue as referred to in point (e) of Article 21(2) of the Financial Regulation shall be part of the budget appropriations for Heading 2 ‘Cohesion and Values’, sub-ceiling ‘Economic, social and territorial cohesion’.\nThat contribution shall be subject to a specific financing agreement with the United Kingdom in accordance with Article 59 of this Regulation. The Commission and the United Kingdom as well as Ireland shall be parties to this specific financing agreement.\nThe specific financing agreement shall be concluded before the beginning of the implementation of the programme, thus allowing the Special EU Programmes Body to apply the Union legislation applicable to the implementation of the programme.\nCHAPTER IX\nSPECIFIC PROVISIONS FOR INDIRECT MANAGEMENT\nArticle 61\nOutermost regions’ cooperation\n1.   Where, with the agreement of the Member State and the regions concerned, part or all of an Interreg D programme is implemented under indirect management pursuant to point (b) or (c), respectively, of Article 55(3) of this Regulation, implementation tasks shall be entrusted to one of the bodies listed in point (c) of the first subparagraph of Article 62(1) of the Financial Regulation, in particular to such a body located in the participating Member State, including the managing authority of the Interreg programme concerned.\n2.   In accordance with point (c) of Article 154(6) of the Financial Regulation, the Commission may decide not to require an ex-ante assessment as referred to in paragraphs 3 and 4 of that Article when the budget implementation tasks referred to in point (c) of the first subparagraph of Article 62(1) of that Regulation are entrusted to a managing authority of an outermost regions’ Interreg programme identified pursuant to Article 45(1) of this Regulation and in accordance with Article 71 of Regulation (EU) 2021/1060.\n3.   Where the budget implementation tasks referred to in point (c) of the first subparagraph of Article 62(1) of the Financial Regulation are entrusted to a Member State organisation, Article 157 of that Regulation shall apply.\n4.   Where a programme or action co-financed by one or more external financing instrument is implemented by a third country, a partner country, an OCT or any of the other bodies listed to in point (c) of the first subparagraph of Article 62(1) of the Financial Regulation or referred to in Regulation (EU) 2021/947 or Decision 2013/755/EU, or both, the relevant rules of these instruments shall apply.\nConditions for the implementation of part of an Interreg strand D programme under indirect management pursuant to point (b) or (c) of Article 55(3) of this Regulation shall be defined by an agreement concluded between the Commission, the managing authority or its Member State, and the entrusted body.\nCHAPTER X\nFINAL PROVISIONS\nArticle 62\nExercise of the delegation\n1.

Interreg encourages the harmonious economic, social and territorial development of the EU as a whole and its neighbourhood – a core objective of the EU’s cohesion policy.\nIt lays down the necessary rules to ensure effective programming including on technical assistance, monitoring, evaluation, communication, eligibility, management and control. It also sets out the rules for the financial management of Interreg programmes, which are supported by the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) set up by Regulation (EU) 2021/1058 (see summary), along with the specific objectives and the integration of the external financing instruments of the EU: the Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance (IPA III);the Neighbourhood, Development and International Cooperation Instrument (NDICI);the funding for all OCTs for the period 2021–2027.\nKEY POINTS\nStructure\nTerritorial cooperation under Interreg is built around four strands.\nInterreg A – cross-border cooperation between adjacent regions (which should in principle be located along land or sea borders separated by up to 150 km of sea) to tackle common challenges identified jointly in the border regions and to exploit the untapped growth potential in these areas.\nInterreg B – transnational cooperation over larger transnational territories or around sea basins with a view to achieving a higher degree of territorial integration.\nInterreg C – interregional cooperation through four specific programmes to boost the effectiveness of cohesion policy by promoting: the exchange of experiences, innovative approaches and capacity building with a view to identifying and disseminating good practices and implementing them in regional development policies, including the ‘investment for jobs and growth goal’ programmes (the Interreg Europe programme);the exchange of experiences, innovative approaches and capacity building with a view to identifying, transferring and capitalising on good practices on integrated and sustainable urban development (the Urbact programme);the exchange of experiences, innovative approaches and capacity building with a view to improving and simplifying the implementation of Interreg programmes and cooperation actions, along with the setting up and operation of European groupings of territorial cooperation* (the Interact programme);the analysis of development trends in relation to territorial cohesion goals (the European Spatial Planning Observation Network (ESPON) programme).\nInterreg D – cooperation between outermost regions to facilitate the development and integration of outermost regions and OCTs (for example, Caribbean regions) in their neighbouring environment.\nResources and co-financing rates\nInterreg is supported by the ERDF and, where one or more Member States and their regions along with one or more Member States and non-EU countries and their regions cooperate across borders, by the EU’s external financing instruments (i.e. IPA III and NDICI).\nOver the period covered by the current multiannual financial framework (2021–2027), Interreg will receive an allocation of €8.05 billion (2018 prices) from ERDF resources.\nThe ERDF resources for Interreg programmes will be allocated as follows: 72.2% (a total of €5,812,790,000 for land and maritime cross-border cooperation (Interreg A));18.2% (a total of €1,466,000,000 for transnational cooperation (Interreg B));6.1% (a total of €490,000,000 for interregional cooperation (Interreg C)); and3.5% (a total of €281,210,000 for cooperation between outermost regions (Interreg D)).\nThe co-financing rate at the level of each Interreg programme must not exceed 80%.\nInterreg-specific objectives and thematic concentration\nUnder Interreg programmes, the ERDF and, where appropriate, the EU’s external financing instruments may also support the specific Interreg objectives of better cooperation governance and a safer and more secure Europe.\nAt least 60% of resources allocated to Interreg A, B and D programmes should go to a maximum of three of the policy objectives set out in Article 5 of the common provisions regulation (CPR), Regulation (EU) 2021/1060 (see summary), one of which must be a greener, low-carbon Europe. Interreg A programmes along internal land borders must allocate at least 60% of resources for policy objectives 2 and 4, and a maximum of two other policy objectives set out in the CPR.\nImplementing and delegated acts\nThe European Commission is able to adopt implementing acts setting out: the list of Interreg programme areas to receive support (Implementing Decision (EU) 2022/74);a list indicating per programme the global amount of support (Implementing Decision (EU) 2022/75) from the ERDF and the external financing instruments of the EU;the multi-annual strategy documents with regard to external cross-border and transnational cooperation programmes supported by the ERDF and NDICI, by the ERDF and IPA III, or by the ERDF, NDICI and IPA III.\nThe Commission is also able to adopt delegated acts in order to amend the annex to the regulation which contains a template for Interreg programmes.\nProgramme authorities and management\nInterreg is implemented through programmes under shared management*, except for Interreg D programmes, which may be iwholly or partially implemented under indirect management* in agreement with the Member State(s) concerned after consulting stakeholders.\nThe regulation requires Member States and, where applicable, non-EU countries, partner countries* and OCTs participating in an Interreg programme to identify, for the purposes of the CPR, a single managing authority and a single audit authority. It sets out detailed rules regarding these authorities, their functions and responsibilities.\nEach managing authority must send cumulative data for the respective Interreg programme to the Commission every quarter, in accordance with the template set out in Annex VII to the CPR.\nMonitoring committee\nThe Member States and, where applicable, the non-EU countries, partner countries and OCTs participating in that programme must set up, in agreement with the managing authority, a monitoring committee to oversee the implementation of the respective Interreg programme within 3 months of the date of notification to the Member States of an Interreg programme’s approval. The committee must meet at least once a year and review all issues that affect the programme’s progress towards achieving its objectives.\nEvaluations\nThe Member State or the managing authority must carry out evaluations of the programmes related to one or more of the following criteria: effectiveness, efficiency, relevance, coherence and EU added value, with the aim of improving the quality of the programme design and implementation. Evaluations may also cover other relevant criteria, such as inclusiveness, non-discrimination and visibility.\nAn additional evaluation must be undertaken for each programme to assess its impact before 30 June 2029.\nFROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?\n              \nIt has applied since 1 July 2021.\nBACKGROUND\n              \nRegulation (EU) 2021/1059 is part of the EU’s legislative package on cohesion policy for the period 2021–2027. The main focus of this policy is to promote economic, social and territorial cohesion through sustainable competitiveness, research and innovation, the digital transition, the European Green Deal and the European Pillar of Social Rights.\nFor more information, see:\nQuestions and answers on the EU Cohesion policy legislative package 2021–2027 (European Commission)\nCouncil adopts €330 billion cohesion package for 2021–2027 (Council of the European Union).\nKEY TERMS\n              \nEuropean groupings of territorial cooperation (EGTCs). These aim to facilitate and promote cross-border, transnational and interregional cooperation in the EU.
