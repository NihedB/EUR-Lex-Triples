It also may lead to additional costs for business if they are requested to measure the environmental performance of the product or the organisation based on different methods by public authorities, business partners, private initiatives and investors. Such costs reduce the opportunities for cross-border trading of green products. There is a risk that these failures on the market of green products will continue to deepen (1).\n(3)\nThe Communication from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament on \"Integrated Product Policy - Building on Environmental Life-Cycle Thinking\" (2) recognised the importance of addressing environmental impacts throughout the life cycle of a product in an integrated way.\n(4)\nThe Conclusions of the Council on \"Sustainable materials management and sustainable production and consumption\" of 20 December 2010 (3) invited the Commission to develop a common methodology on the quantitative assessment of the environmental impacts of products, throughout their life cycle, in order to support the assessment and labelling of products.\n(5)\nThe Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament, the Council, the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions \"Towards a Single Market Act - For a highly competitive social market economy. 50 proposals for improving our work, business and exchanges with one another\" (4) outlined that possibilities would be explored for establishing a common European methodology to assess and label products, to address the issue of their environmental impact, including carbon emissions. The need for such an initiative was re-iterated in the two follow-up Single Market Acts (5).\n(6)\nThe Communication on “A European Consumer Agenda - Boosting confidence and growth” stressed that consumers have the right to know the environmental impacts throughout the life cycle of the products they intend to buy and they should be supported in easily identifying the truly sustainable choice. It stated that the Commission will develop harmonised methodologies to assess the life cycle environmental performance of products and companies as a basis for providing reliable information to consumers.\n(7)\nThe Communication on \"A Stronger European Industry for Growth and Economic Recovery - Industrial Policy Communication Update\" (6) mentioned that the Commission is studying the best possible ways to integrate green products and services in the Internal Market, including environmental footprinting.\n(8)\nIn the Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament, the Council, the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions \"Roadmap to a Resource Efficient Europe\" (7), the European Commission pledged to establish a common methodological approach to enable Member States and the private sector to assess, display and benchmark the environmental performance of products, services and companies based on a comprehensive assessment of environmental impacts over the life cycle (‧environmental footprint‧).\n(9)\nThe same document invited Member States to put in place incentives that stimulate a large majority of companies to measure, benchmark and improve their resource efficiency systematically.\n(10)\nAs a response to these policy needs, the Product Environmental Footprint and Organisation Environmental Footprint methods were developed by the Commission on the basis of existing, widely recognised methods. The Communication \"Building the Single Market for Green Products\" outlines a framework for developing them further and for refining the methodologies with the participation of a wide range of stakeholders (including industry, and particularly SMEs) through testing. The testing will also explore possible solutions for practical challenges such access to, and quality of, life cycle data, or cost-effective verification methods.\n(11)\nThe final objective of the initiative is to overcome the fragmentation of the internal market as regards different available methods for measuring environmental performance. The Commission considers that for mandatory application further developments are necessary in order to minimise administrative burdens. As with any new method upfront costs can be expected, the Commission therefore recommends that those businesses that decide to apply the methodology on a voluntary basis, should do so after careful assessment of the impact on their competitiveness and equally Member States using the methodology should assess costs and benefits on SME's.\n(12)\nThe Commission is working on developing sector and product category tailored approaches in line with the requirements of the environmental footprint methods, taking into account the need to address the special characteristics of complex products, flexible supply chains and dynamic markets.\n(13)\nBy recommending the use of the environmental footprint methods to Member States, private companies and associations, operators of schemes related to the measurement or communication of environmental performance and the financial community, the current proliferation of methods and labels is expected to be reduced, benefiting both providers and users of environmental performance information. For clarification purposes, potential fields of application are listed in Annex I to this Recommendation.\n(14)\nThe Commission notes that while this initiative focuses on environmental impacts, in the global context also other performance indicators, such as economic and social impacts, as well as labour practice concerns play increasingly important roles, and have also trade-offs. The Commission will follow closely these developments and other international methodologies (such as the Global Reporting Initiative/Sustainability Reporting Guidance).\n(15)\nMost SMEs lack the expertise and resources to address the requests for life cycle environmental performance information. Therefore, support to SMEs should be provided by Member States and industrial associations.\n(16)\nComplementary to the pilot phase supporting tools will be developed (such as quality criteria for LCA databases, data management systems, scientific arbitration, compliance and verification systems, coordination authorities) at European Union and Member States levels so as to contribute to the achievement of the policy objectives. The Commission, aware of the global market, and will keep international organisations informed about this voluntary initiative.\nHAS ADOPTED THIS RECOMMENDATION:\n1.

Product Environmental Footprint (PEF) is a multi-criteria measure of the environmental performance of a good or service throughout its life cycle. PEF information is produced for the overarching purpose of seeking to reduce the environmental impacts of goods and services taking into account supply chain (1) activities (from extraction of raw materials, through production and use, to final waste management). This PEF Guide provides a method for modelling the environmental impacts of the flows of material/energy and the emissions and waste streams associated with a product throughout its life cycle.\nThis document provides guidance on how to calculate a PEF, as well as how to develop product category-specific methodological requirements for use in Product Environmental Footprint Category Rules (PEFCRs). PEFs are complimentary to other instruments focused on specific sites and thresholds.\nContext\nThis PEF Guide has been developed in the context of one of the building blocks of the Flagship initiative of the Europe 2020 Strategy – “A Resource-Efficient Europe” (2). The European Commission's “Roadmap to a Resource Efficient Europe” (3) proposes ways to increase resource productivity and to decouple economic growth from both resource use and environmental impacts, taking a life-cycle perspective. One of its objectives is to: “Establish a common methodological approach to enable Member States and the private sector to assess, display and benchmark the environmental performance of products, services and companies based on a comprehensive assessment of environmental impacts over the life-cycle (‧environmental footprint‧)”. The European Council invited the Commission to develop supporting methodologies.\nThus, the Product and Organisation Environmental Footprint (OEF) project was initiated with the aim of developing a harmonised European methodology for Environmental Footprint (EF) studies that can accommodate a broader suite of relevant environmental performance criteria using a life-cycle approach (4). A life-cycle approach refers to taking into consideration the spectrum of resource flows and environmental interventions associated with a product or organisation from a supply chain perspective. It includes all stages from raw material acquisition through processing, distribution, use, and end-of-life processes, and all relevant related environmental impacts, health effects, resource-related threats and burdens to society. This approach is also essential for exposing any potential trade-offs between different types of environmental impacts associated with specific policy and management decisions. It thus helps to avoid unintended shifting of burdens.\nObjectives and target audience\nThis document aims to provide detailed and comprehensive technical guidance on how to conduct a PEF study. PEF studies may be used for a variety of purposes, including in-house management and participation in voluntary or mandatory programmes. It is primarily aimed at technical experts who need to develop a PEF study, for example engineers and environmental managers in companies and other institutions. No expertise in environmental assessment methods is needed to use this Guide for conducting a PEF study.\nThis PEF Guide is not intended to directly support comparisons or comparative assertions (i.e. claims of overall superiority or equivalence of the environmental performance of one product compared to another (based on ISO 14040:2006)). Such comparisons require the development of additional PEFCRs that would complement the more general guidance given here, in order to further increase methodological harmonisation, specificity, relevance and reproducibility for a given product-type. PEFCRs will furthermore facilitate the focusing of attention on the most important parameters, thus also reducing the time, efforts, and costs involved in completing a PEF study. In addition to providing general guidance and defining the requirements for PEF studies, this document also specifies the requirements for the development of PEFCRs.\nProcess and Results\nEach requirement specified in this PEF Guide has been chosen taking into consideration the recommendations of similar, widely recognised environmental accounting methods and guidance documents. Specifically, the methodology guides considered were: ISO standards (5) (in particular: ISO 14044(2006), Draft ISO/DIS 14067(2012); ISO 14025(2006), ISO 14020(2000)), the ILCD (International Reference Life Cycle Data System) Handbook (6); the Ecological Footprint Standards (7); the Greenhouse Gas Protocol (8) (WRI/ WBCSD); the general principles for an environmental communication on mass market products BPX 30-323-0 (ADEME) (9); and the specification for the assessment of the life cycle greenhouse gas emissions of goods and services (PAS 2050, 2011) (10).\nThe outcome of this analysis is summarised in Annex X. A more detailed description can be found in “Analysis of Existing Environmental Footprint Methodologies for Products and Organizations: Recommendations, Rationale, and Alignment” (EC-JRC-IES 2011b) (11). Whereas existing methods may provide several alternatives for a given methodological decision point, the intention of this PEF Guide is (wherever feasible) to identify a single requirement for each decision point, or to provide additional guidance that will support more consistent, robust and reproducible PEF studies. Thus, comparability is given priority over flexibility.\nAs elaborated before, PEFCRs are a necessary extension of and complement to the more general guidance for PEF studies provided in this document (i.e. in terms of comparability between different PEF studies). As they are developed, PEFCRs will play an important role in increasing the reproducibility, quality, consistency, and relevance of PEF studies.\nRelationship to the Organisation Environmental Footprint Guide\nBoth the Organisation Environmental Footprint (OEF) and the PEF provide a life-cycle approach to quantifying environmental performance. Whereas the PEF method is specific to individual goods or services, the OEF method applies to organisational activities as a whole – in other words, to all activities associated with the goods and/or services the organisation provides from a supply chain perspective (from extraction of raw materials, through use, to final waste management options). Organisation and Product Environmental Footprinting can therefore be viewed as complementary activities, each undertaken in support of specific applications.\nCalculating the OEF does not require multiple product analyses. Rather, the OEF is calculated using aggregate data representing the flows of resources and waste that cross a defined organisational boundary. Once the OEF is calculated, however, it may be disaggregated to the product level using appropriate allocation keys. In theory, the sum of the PEFs of the products provided by an organisation over a certain reporting interval (e.g. 1 year) should be close to its OEF for the same reporting interval (12). The methodologies in this PEF Guide have been purposefully developed towards this end. Moreover, the OEF can help to identify areas of the organisation’s product portfolio where environmental impacts are most significant and, hence, where detailed, individual product-level analyses may be required.\nTerminology: shall, should and may\nThis PEF Guide uses precise terminology to indicate the requirements, the recommendations and options that companies may choose.\nThe term “shall” is used to indicate what is required in order for a PEF study to be in conformance with this Guide.\nThe term “should” is used to indicate a recommendation rather than a requirement. Any deviation from a “should” requirement has to be justified by the conductor of the study and made transparent.\nThe term “may” is used to indicate an option that is permissible.\n1.   GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS FOR PRODUCT ENVIRONMENTAL FOOTPRINT (PEF) STUDIES\n1.1   Approach and examples for potential applications\nThe Product Environmental Footprint (PEF) is a multi-criteria measure of the environmental performance of a good or service throughout its life cycle (13). PEF information is produced for the overarching purpose of helping to reduce the environmental impacts of goods and services.\nThis document provides guidance on how to calculate a PEF, as well as how to create product category-specific methodological requirements for use in Product Environmental Footprint Category Rules (PEFCRs). PEFCRs are a necessary extension of and complement to the general guidance for PEF studies. As they are developed, PEFCRs will play an important role in increasing the reproducibility, consistency, and relevance of PEF studies. PEFCRs help focus on the most important parameters, thus also possibly reducing the time, efforts, and costs involved in conducting a PEF study.\nBased on a life-cycle approach (14), the PEF Guide provides a method for modelling the environmental impacts of the flows of material/energy and resulting emissions and waste (15) streams associated with a product (16) from a supply chain (17) perspective (from extraction of raw materials (18), through use, to final waste management). A life cycle approach refers to taking into consideration the spectrum of resource flows and environmental interventions associated with a product or organisation from a supply chain perspective. It includes all stages from raw material acquisition through processing, distribution, use, and end-of-life processes, and all relevant related environmental impacts, health effects, resource-related threats and burdens to society.\nIt is primarily aimed at technical experts who need to develop a PEF study, for example engineers and environmental managers. No expertise in environmental assessment methods is necessary in order to use this Guide to develop a PEF study.\nThe PEF method is based on the life-cycle approach. The life-cycle approach to environmental management, and Life Cycle Thinking (LCT) in general, takes into consideration all relevant environmental interactions associated with a good, service, activity, or entity from a supply chain perspective. This is in contrast to focusing on site-level impacts only or on single environmental impacts in order to reduce the possibility of unintended burden shifting; shifting of the environmental impact burden from one stage in a supply chain to another, from one impact category to another, between impacts and resource efficiency, and/or between countries.\nIn order to develop a model that provides a realistic representation of these physical flows and impacts, modelling parameters need to be defined, insofar as possible, based on clear physical terms and relationships.\nEach requirement specified in this PEF Guide has been chosen taking into consideration the recommendations of similar, widely recognised product environmental accounting methods and guidance documents. Specifically, the methodology guides considered were:\n—\nISO standards (19), in particular: ISO 14044(2006), Draft ISO/DIS 14067(2012); ISO 14025(2006), ISO 14020(2000);\n—\nILCD (International Reference Life Cycle Data System) Handbook (20);\n—\nEcological Footprint (21);\n—\nGreenhouse Gas Protocol (22) (WRI/WBCSD);\n—\nGeneral principles for an environmental communication on mass market products BPX 30-323-0 (ADEME) (23);\n—\nSpecification for the assessment of the life cycle greenhouse gas emissions of goods and services (PAS 2050, 2011) (24).\nAnnex X provides an overview of some key selected requirements contained in this PEF Guide compared to the requirements/specifications contained in the abovementioned methodology guides. A more detailed description of the analysed methods and of the outcome of the analysis can be found in “Analysis of Existing Environmental Footprint Methodologies for Products and Organizations: Recommendations, Rationale, and Alignment” (25). Whereas existing methods may provide several alternatives for a given methodological decision point, the intention of this PEF Guide is (wherever feasible) to identify a single requirement for each decision point, or to provide additional guidance, in order to support more consistent, robust and reproducible PEF studies.\nPotential applications of PEF studies may be grouped depending on in-house or external objectives:\n—\nIn-house applications may include support to environmental management, identification of environmental hotspots, and environmental performance improvement and tracking, and may implicitly include cost-saving opportunities;\n—\nExternal applications (e.g. Business-to-Business (B2B), Business-to-Consumers (B2C)) cover a wide range of possibilities, from responding to customer and consumer demands, to marketing, benchmarking, environmental labelling, supporting eco-design throughout supply chains, green procurement and responding to the requirements of environmental policies at European or Member State level;\n—\nBenchmarking could for example include defining an average performing product (based on data provided by stakeholders or on generic data or approximations) followed by a grading of other products according to their performance versus the benchmark.\nTable 1 provides an overview of the intended applications of PEF studies in relation to the key requirements for conducting PEF studies according to this PEF Guide\nTable 1\nKey requirements for PEF studies in relation to the intended application\nIntended applications\nGoal & Scope definition\nScreening exercise\nMeet data quality requirements\nMultifunctionality hierarchy\nChoice of impact assessment methods\nClassification & Characterisation\nNormalisation\nWeighting\nInterpretation of PEF results\nReporting element requirements\nCritical review (1 person)\nCritical review panel (3 persons)\nRequires PEFCR\nIn-house\n(claiming to be in line with the PEF Guide)\nM\nR\nR\nM\nM\nM\nR\nO\nM\nO\nM\nO\nO\nExternal\nB2B/B2C without comparisons/comparative assertions\nM\nR\nM\nM\nM\nM\nR\nO\nM\nM\nM\nR\nR\nB2B/B2C with comparisons/comparative assertions\nM\nR\nM\nM\nM\nM\nR\nO\nM\nM\n/\nM\nM\n“M”\n=\nmandatory;\n“R”\n=\nrecommended (not mandatory);\n“O”\n=\noptional (not mandatory);\n“/”\n=\nnot applicable\nRequirement for PEF studies\nA PEF study shall be based on a life-cycle approach.\n1.2   How to Use this Guide\nThis Guide provides the information necessary to conduct a PEF study. The material in the PEF Guide is presented in a sequential manner, in the order of the methodological phases that shall be completed when calculating a PEF. Each section begins with a general description of the methodological phase, along with an overview of necessary considerations and supporting examples. “Requirements” specify the methodological norms that “shall/should” be satisfied in order to achieve a PEF-compliant study. These are positioned in text boxes with single line borders following the general description sections. “Tips” describe non-mandatory but recommended best practices. These are positioned in shaded text boxes, also with solid line borders. Where additional requirements for creating PEFCRs are specified, these are positioned in text boxes with double line borders at the end of each respective section.\n1.3   Principles for Product Environmental Footprint Studies\nTo produce consistent, robust and reproducible PEF studies, a core suite of analytical principles shall be strictly adhered to. These principles provide overarching guidance in the application of the PEF method. They shall be considered with respect to each phase of PEF studies, from the definition of study goals and the scope of the research, through data collection, impact assessment, reporting and verification of study outcomes.\nRequirement for PEF studies\nUsers of this Guide shall observe the following principles in conducting a PEF study:\n(1)\nRelevance\nAll methods used and data collected for the purpose of quantifying the PEF shall be as relevant to the study as possible.\n(2)\nCompleteness\nQuantification of the PEF shall include all environmentally relevant material/energy flows and other environmental interventions as required for adherence to the defined system boundaries (26), the data requirements, and the impact assessment methods employed.\n(3)\nConsistency\nStrict conformity to this Guide shall be observed in all steps of the PEF study so as to ensure internal consistency and comparability with similar analyses.\n(4)\nAccuracy\nAll reasonable efforts shall be taken to reduce uncertainties in product system (27) modelling and the reporting of results.\n(5)\nTransparency\nPEF information shall be disclosed in such a way as to provide intended users with the necessary basis for decision making, and for stakeholders to assess its robustness and reliability.\nPrinciples for PEFCR\n1.   Relationship with the PEF Guide\nIn addition to the requirements of this PEF Guide, the methodological requirements set out in PEFCR shall also apply to PEF studies. Where the requirements of the PEFCR are more specific than those of the PEF Guide, such specific requirements shall be fulfilled.\n2.   Involvement of selected interested parties\nThe process of developing PEFCRs shall be open and transparent and shall include consultation with relevant stakeholders’ parties. Reasonable efforts should be made to achieve a consensus throughout the process (adapted from ISO 14020:2000, 4.9.1, Principle 8). The PEFCRs shall be peer reviewed.\n3.   Striving for comparability\nThe results of PEF studies that have been conducted in line with this PEF Guide and the relevant PEFCR document may be used to support the comparison of the environmental performance of products from the same product category on a life-cycle basis, as well as to support comparative assertions (28) (intended to be disclosed to the public). Therefore, comparability of the results is crucial. The information provided for this comparison shall be transparent in order to allow the user to understand the limitations of comparability inherent in the calculated result (adapted from ISO 14025).\n1.4   Phases of a Product Environmental Footprint study\nA number of phases shall be completed in carrying out a PEF study in line with this Guide - i.e. Goal Definition, Scope Definition, Resource Use and Emissions Profile, Environmental Footprint Impact Assessment, and Environmental Footprint Interpretation and Reporting – see Figure 1.\nFigure 1\nPhases of a Product Environmental Footprint study\n2.   ROLE OF PRODUCT ENVIRONMENTAL FOOTPRINT CATEGORY RULES (PEFCRS)\n2.1   General\nIn addition to providing general guidance and requirements for PEF studies, this PEF Guide also specifies the requirements for developing PEFCRs. PEFCRs will play an important role in increasing the reproducibility, consistency (and therefore comparability between PEF calculations within the same product category (29) level), and relevance of PEF studies. PEFCRs will help direct the focus to the most important parameters of the PEF study, thus also reducing time, efforts and costs.\nThe objective is to ensure that PEFCRs are developed according to the PEF Guide and that they provide the specifications needed to achieve the comparability, increased reproducibility, consistency, relevance, focus and efficiency of PEF studies. PEFCRs should aim to focus PEF studies on those aspects and parameters which are most pertinent in determining the environmental performance of a given product type. A PEFCR can further specify requirements made in this PEF Guide and can add new requirements where the PEF Guide leaves several choices.\nPEF studies may be carried out in the absence of PEFCRs if they are not intended for use in making comparative assertions intended to be disclosed to the public.\nRequirement for PEF studies\nIn absence of PEFCRs, the key areas that would be covered in PEFCRs (as listed in this PEF Guide) shall be specified, justified and explicitly reported in the PEF study.\n2.2   Role of PEFCRs and relation with existing Product Category Rules (PCRs)\nPEFCRs aim to provide detailed technical guidance on how to conduct a PEF study for a specific product category. PEFCRs shall provide further specification at the process and/or product level. In particular, PEFCRs will typically provide further specification and guidance in e.g.:\n—\nDefining the goal and scope of the study;\n—\nDefining relevant/irrelevant impact categories;\n—\nIdentifying appropriate system boundaries for the analysis;\n—\nIdentifying key parameters and life-cycle stages;\n—\nProviding guidance on possible data sources;\n—\nCompleting the Resource Use and Emissions Profile phase;\n—\nProviding further specification on how to solve multi-functionality (30) problems.\nAll of these aspects are explored in this PEF Guide.\nAs defined in ISO 14025(2006), Product Category Rules (PCRs) (31) include sets of specific rules, guidelines and requirements that aim to develop “Type III environmental declarations” for any product category (i.e. goods and/or services providing equivalent functions). “Type III environmental declarations” are quantitative, LCA-based claims of the environmental aspects (32) of a certain good or service, e.g. quantitative information regarding potential environmental impacts.\nFor development and review of Product Category Rules (PCRs), ISO 14025(2006) describes the procedure and establishes requirements for comparability of different so-called “Type III environmental declarations”. Type III environmental declarations may, for instance, be a potential application of a PEF study.\nThe guidelines on how to develop PEFCRs are based on the minimum content of a PCR document as required by ISO 14025. Following ISO 14025 for PCRs this includes, but is not limited to:\n—\nIdentification of the product category for which a PCR is to be developed, including a description of for example, the product’s function(s), technical performance and use(s);\n—\nDefinition of the goal and scope for the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) (33) of the product, according to the requirement of the ISO 14040 series in terms of, for example, functional unit, system boundary, data quality requirements (34);\n—\nDescription of the Life Cycle Inventory (LCI) analysis, with special focus on the data collection phase, calculation procedures, and allocation (35) rules;\n—\nChoice of the EF impact category indicators to be included in the LCA;\n—\nDescription of any eventual predetermined parameter for the reporting of LCA data, for example, certain predetermined inventory data categories and/or EF impact category indicators;\n—\nIf not all life-cycle stages are included in the LCA, information/justification on which stages are not covered;\n—\nTimespan of the validity of the PEFCR being developed.\nIf other PCRs are available from other schemes, these can be used as a basis for developing a PEFCR (36), in line with the requirements provided in this PEF Guide.\nRequirement for developing PEFCRs\nPEFCRs should, to the extent possible and recognising the different application contexts, be in conformity with existing international Product Category Rule (PCR) guidance documents.\n2.3   PEFCR structure based on the Classification of Products by Activity (CPA)\nThe PEFCR document describes the type of information to be given about a product from a life-cycle perspective as well as how this information shall be generated. The Classification of Products by Activity (CPA) scheme (Figure 2) shall be used for coding and defining the information modules used to represent the product life cycle.\nCPA product categories relate to activities as defined using NACE codes (i.e. by the Statistical classification of economic activities in the European Community). Each CPA product is assigned to one single NACE activity, hence the CPA structure is parallel to that of NACE at all levels.\nNACE consists of a hierarchical structure as follows (NACE Rev. 2 2008 (37), page 15):\n1.\nHeadings identified by an alphabetical code (sections);\n2.\nHeadings identified by a two-digit numerical code (divisions);\n3.\nHeadings identified by a three-digit numerical code (groups);\n4.\nHeadings identified by a four-digit numerical code (classes).\nThe International Standard Industrial Classification (ISIC) and NACE have the same code at the highest levels, but NACE is more detailed at the lower levels. As the NACE code in the context of this study applies to the sector level, at a minimum a 2-digit code (i.e. division level) shall be assigned (38). This complies with the ISIC system.\nAn example of such an approach for a PEFCR document is given below for “Milk and milk-based products.” Here, the two-digit code (divisions) defines an industry-specific product group (e.g. division 10 - Food products) which has a number of individual products coded under it (e.g. group 10.51.1 - Processed liquid milk and cream) (Figure 2). Thus, the two-digit code, and sometimes the one digit code, may be used to define industry-specific information modules which, when combined, build up specific product life cycles in a horizontal structure. Each of these also provides an embedded vertical structure going from a general product group to more specific individual products.\nFigure 2\nOutline of the principles of the CPA scheme\nRequirement for developing PEFCRs\nPEFCRs shall be based at a minimum on a two-digit CPA code division (default option). However, PEFCRs may allow for (justified) deviations (e.g. allow for three-digits). For example, more than two-digits are necessary when addressing the complexity of the sector. Where multiple production routes for similar products are defined using alternative CPAs, the PEFCR shall accommodate all such CPAs.\n3.   DEFINING THE GOAL(S) OF THE PRODUCT ENVIRONMENTAL FOOTPRINT STUDY\n3.1   General\nGoal definition is the first step of a PEF study, and sets the overall context for the study. The purpose of clearly defining goals is to ensure that the analytical aims, methods, results and intended applications are optimally aligned, and that a shared vision is in place to guide participants in the study. The decision to use the PEF Guide implies that some aspects of the goal definition will be decided a priori. Nonetheless, it is important to take the time to carefully consider and articulate goals in order to ensure the success of the PEF study.\nIn defining goals, it is important to identify the intended applications and the degree of analytical depth and rigour of the study. This should be reflected in the defined study limitations (scope definition phase). Quantitative studies in conformance with the analytical requirements specified in this PEF Guide will be necessary for analyses geared towards, for example, least environmental-cost sourcing, product design, benchmarking and reporting. Combined approaches are also possible within one PEF study where only certain parts of the supply chain are subject to quantitative analysis and others to qualitative descriptions of potential environmental hotspots (for example, a quantitative cradle-to-gate (39) analysis combined with qualitative descriptions of gate-to-grave (40) environmental considerations or with quantitative analyses of the use and end-of-life stages for selected representative product types).\nRequirement for PEF studies\nGoal definition for a PEF study shall include:\n—\nIntended application(s);\n—\nReasons for carrying out the study and decision context;\n—\nTarget audience;\n—\nWhether comparisons and/or comparative assertions (41) are to be disclosed to the public;\n—\nCommissioner of the study;\n—\nReview procedure (if applicable).\nExample - Environmental Footprint of a T-shirt: goal definition\nAspects\nDetail\nIntended application(s):\nProvide product information to customer\nReasons for carrying out the study and decision context:\nRespond to a request from a customer\nComparisons intended to be disclosed to the public:\nNo, it will be publically available but it is not intended to be used for comparisons or comparative assertions.\nTarget audience:\nExternal technical audience, business-to-business.\nReview:\nIndependent external reviewer, Mr Y\nCommissioner of the study:\nG company limited\nAdditional requirement for development of PEFCRs\nThe PEFCR shall specify the review requirements for a PEF study.\n4.   DEFINING THE SCOPE OF THE PRODUCT ENVIRONMENTAL FOOTPRINT STUDY\n4.1   General\nIn defining the scope of the PEF study, the system to be evaluated and the associated analytical specifications are described in detail.\nRequirement for PEF studies\nThe scope definition for a PEF study shall be in line with the defined goals of the study and shall include (see subsequent sections for a more detailed description):\n—\nUnit of analysis (42) and reference flow (43);\n—\nSystem boundaries;\n—\nEnvironmental Footprint impact categories;\n—\nAssumptions/Limitations.\n4.2   Unit of analysis and reference flow\nUsers of the PEF Guide are required to define the unit of analysis and reference flow for the PEF study. The unit of analysis qualitatively and quantitatively describes the function(s) and duration of the product.\nRequirement for PEF studies\nThe unit of analysis for a PEF study shall be defined according to the following aspects:\n—\nThe function(s)/service(s) provided: “what”;\n—\nThe extent of the function or service: “how much”;\n—\nThe expected level of quality: “how well”;\n—\nThe duration/life time of the product: “how long”;\n—\nThe NACE code(s).\nAdditional requirement for development of PEFCRs\nPEFCRs shall specify the unit(s) of analysis.\nExample:\nGuide/Requirement: Define functional unit Names and quantifies the qualitative and quantitative aspects of the function(s) of product along the questions “what”, “how much”, “how well”, and “for how long”.\nExample define functional unit,\nFunction unit of T shirt:\n(WHAT) T shirt (average for size S, M, L) made from polyester,\n(HOW MUCH) One T shirt,\n(HOW WELL) Wear One time per week and use washing machine at 30 degree for cleaning\n(HOW LONG) for 5 years.\nNote:\nSome interim products may have more than one function. It may be necessary to identify and choose among these functions.\nThe reference flow is the amount of product needed in order to provide the defined function. All other input (44) and output (45) flows in the analysis quantitatively relate to it. The reference flow can be expressed in direct relation to the unit of analysis or in a more product-oriented way.\nRequirement for PEF studies\nAn appropriate reference flow shall be determined in relation to the unit of analysis. The quantitative input and output data collected in support of the analysis shall be calculated in relation to this flow.\nExample:\nReference flow: 160 grammes of polyester\n4.3   System boundaries for Product Environmental Footprint Studies\nThe system boundaries define which parts of the product life cycle and which associated processes belong to the analysed system (i.e. are required for carrying out its function as defined by the unit of analysis). Therefore, the system boundary must be clearly defined for the product system to be evaluated.\nSystem boundary diagram (recommended)\nA system boundary diagram, or a flow diagram, is a schematic representation of the analysed system. It details which parts of the product life cycle are included or excluded from the analysis. A system boundary diagram can be a useful tool in defining the system boundary and organising subsequent data collection activities.\nTIP: It is not mandatory to prepare a system boundary diagram, but it is highly recommended. The system boundary diagram will help to define and structure the analysis.\nRequirement for PEF studies\nThe system boundary shall be defined following general supply-chain logic, including all stages from raw material (46) extraction through processing, production, distribution, storage, use stage and end-of-life treatment of the product (i.e. cradle-to-grave (47)), as appropriate to the intended application of the study. The system boundaries shall include all processes linked to the product supply chain relative to the unit of analysis.\nThe processes included in the system boundaries shall be divided into foreground processes (i.e. core processes in the product life cycle for which direct access to information is available (48)) and background processes (i.e. those processes in the product life cycle for which no direct access to information is possible (49)).\nA system boundary diagram should be included in the scope definition.\nAdditional requirements for development of PEFCRs\nThe PEFCR shall specify the system boundaries for product category PEF studies, including specification of relevant life cycle stages and processes that should be generally assigned to each stage (including temporal, geographical, and technological specifications). Any deviation from the default cradle-to-grave approach shall be explicitly specified and justified, e.g. exclusion of the unknown use-stage or end-of-life of intermediate products (50).\nThe PEFCR shall specify downstream (51) scenarios so as to ensure comparability and consistency among PEF studies.\nOffsets\nThe term “offset” is frequently used with reference to third-party greenhouse gas mitigation activities, e.g. regulated schemes in the framework of the Kyoto Protocol (CDM – Clean Development Mechanism, JI – Joint Implementation, ETS - Emissions Trading Schemes), or voluntary schemes. Offsets are discrete greenhouse gas (GHG) reductions used to compensate for (i.e., offset) GHG emissions elsewhere, for example to meet a voluntary or mandatory GHG target or cap. Offsets are calculated relative to a baseline that represents a hypothetical scenario for what emissions would have been in the absence of the mitigation project that generates the offsets. Examples of offset emissions are carbon off-setting by the Clean Development Mechanism, carbon credits, and other system-external off-sets.\nRequirement for PEF studies\nOffsets shall not be included in the PEF study, but may be reported separately as “Additional Environmental Information.”\n4.4   Selecting Environmental Footprint Impact Categories and Assessment Methods\nEnvironmental footprint (EF) impact categories (52) refer to specific categories of impacts considered in a PEF study. These are generally related to resource use, emissions of environmentally damaging substances (e.g., greenhouse gases and toxic chemicals), which may as well affect human health. EF impact assessment methods use models for quantifying the causal relationships between the material/energy inputs and emissions associated with the product life cycle (inventoried in the Resource Use and Emissions Profile) and each EF impact category (53) considered. Each category hence refers to a certain stand-alone EF impact assessment model.\nThe purpose of EF impact assessment (54) is to group and aggregate the inventoried Resource Use and Emissions Profile data according to the respective contributions to each EF impact category. This subsequently provides the necessary basis for interpretation of the EF results relative to the goals of the PEF study (for example, identification of supply chain “hotspots” and “options” for improvement). The selection of EF impact categories should therefore be comprehensive in the sense that they cover all relevant environmental issues related to the product supply chain of interest.\nTable 2 provides a default list of EF impact categories and related assessment methods to be used (55). Further instructions on how to calculate these impacts are described in Chapter 6.\nTable 2\nDefault EF impact categories (with respective EF impact category indicators) and EF impact assessment models for PEF studies\nEF Impact Category\nEF Impact Assessment Model\nEF Impact Category indicators\nSource\nClimate Change\nBern model - Global Warming Potentials (GWP) over a 100 year time horizon.\nkg CO2 equivalent\nIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, 2007\nOzone Depletion\nEDIP model based on the ODPs of the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) over an infinite time horizon.\nkg CFC-11 (56) equivalent\nWMO, 1999\nEcotoxicity for aquatic fresh water\nUSEtox model\nCTUe (Comparative Toxic Unit for ecosystems)\nRosenbaum et al., 2008\nHuman Toxicity - cancer effects\nUSEtox model\nCTUh (Comparative Toxic Unit for humans)\nRosenbaum et al., 2008\nHuman Toxicity – non-cancer effects\nUSEtox model\nCTUh (Comparative Toxic Unit for humans)\nRosenbaum et al., 2008\nParticulate Matter/Respiratory Inorganics\nRiskPoll model\nkg PM2,5 (57) equivalent\nHumbert, 2009\nIonising Radiation – human health effects\nHuman Health effect model\nkg U235 equivalent (to air)\nDreicer et al., 1995\nPhotochemical Ozone Formation\nLOTOS-EUROS model\nkg NMVOC (58) equivalent\nVan Zelm et al., 2008 as applied in ReCiPe\nAcidification\nAccumulated Exceedance model\nmol H+ eq\nSeppälä et al.,2006; Posch et al., 2008\nEutrophication – terrestrial\nAccumulated Exceedance model\nmol N eq\nSeppälä et al.,2006; Posch et al., 2008\nEutrophication – aquatic\nEUTREND model\nfresh water: kg P equivalent marine: kg N equivalent\nStruijs et al., 2009 as implemented in ReCiPe\nResource Depletion – water\nSwiss Ecoscarcity model\nm3 water use related to local scarcity of water\nFrischknecht et al., 2008\nResource Depletion – mineral, fossil\nCML2002 model\nkg antimony (Sb) equivalent\nvan Oers et al., 2002\nLand Transformation\nSoil Organic Matter (SOM) model\nKg (deficit)\nMilà i Canals et al., 2007\nDepending on the product system and intended application, users of this PEF Guide may elect to narrow the suite of EF impact categories considered. Such exclusions should be supported by appropriate documents, such as (non-exhaustive list):\n—\nInternational consensus process;\n—\nIndependent external review;\n—\nMulti-stakeholder process;\n—\nLCA studies which have been peer reviewed;\n—\nScreening step (see section 5.2).\nRequirement for PEF studies\nThe selection of EF impact categories should be comprehensive in the sense that they cover all relevant environmental issues related to the product supply chain of interest. For a PEF study, all of the specified default EF impact categories and associated specified EF impact assessment models shall be applied. Any exclusion shall be explicitly documented, justified, reported in the PEF report and supported by appropriate documents.\nThe influence of any exclusion on the final results, especially related to limitations in terms of comparability with other PEF studies, shall be discussed in the interpretation phase and reported. Such exclusions are subject to review.\nAdditional requirement for development of PEFCRs\nPEFCRs shall specify and justify any exclusion of the default EF impact categories, especially those related to the aspects of comparability.\n4.5   Selecting additional environmental information to be included in the PEF\nRelevant potential environmental impacts of a product may go beyond the widely accepted life-cycle-based EF impact assessment models. It is important to consider these environmental impacts whenever feasible. For example, biodiversity impacts due to land use changes may occur in association with a specific site or activity. This may require the application of additional EF impact categories that are not included in the default list provided in this PEF Guide, or even additional qualitative descriptions where impacts cannot be linked to the product supply chain in a quantitative manner. Such additional methods should be viewed as complementary to the default list of EF impact categories.\nSome products might be produced in companies which are located close to the sea. Their emissions might therefore directly impact marine water instead of to fresh water. Because the default set of EF impact categories only include ecotoxicity resulting from emissions to fresh water, it is important to also consider emissions that are made directly into marine water. These shall be included at elementary level because no impact assessment model is currently available for such emissions.\nAdditional environmental information may include (non-exhaustive list):\n(a)\nBill-of-materials data;\n(b)\nDisassemblability, recyclability, recoverability, reusability information, resource efficiency;\n(c)\nInformation on the use of hazardous substances;\n(d)\nInformation on the disposal of hazardous/non-hazardous waste;\n(e)\nInformation on energy consumption;\n(f)\nInformation on local/site-specific impacts, e.g. local impacts on acidification, eutrophication and biodiversity;\nOther relevant environmental information on the activities and/or sites involved, as well as on the product output.\nRequirement for PEF studies\nIf the default set of EF impact categories or the default impact assessment models do not properly cover the potential environmental impacts of the product being evaluated, all related relevant (qualitative/quantitative) environmental aspects shall be additionally included under “additional environmental information”. These shall, however, not substitute the mandatory assessment models of the default EF impact categories. The supporting models of these additional categories shall be clearly referenced and documented with the corresponding indicators.\nAdditional environmental information shall be:\n—\nBased on information that is substantiated and has been reviewed or verified in accordance with the requirements of ISO 14020 and Clause 5 of ISO 14021:1999;\n—\nSpecific, accurate and not misleading;\n—\nRelevant to the particular product category.\nEmissions made directly into marine water shall be included in the additional environmental information (at inventory level).\nIf additional environmental information is used to support the interpretation phase of a PEF study, then all data needed to produce such information shall meet the same quality requirements established for the data used to calculate the PEF results (see section 5.6 (59)).\nAdditional environmental information shall only be related to environmental issues. Information and instructions, e.g. product safety sheets that are not related to the environmental performance of the product shall not be part of a PEF. Similarly, information related to legal requirements shall not be included.\nAdditional requirement for development of PEFCRs\nThe PEFCR shall specify and justify additional environmental information that is to be included in the PEF study. Such additional information shall be reported separately from the life-cycle-based PEF results, with all methods and assumptions clearly documented. Additional environmental information may be quantitative and/or qualitative.\nAdditional environmental information may include (non-exhaustive list):\n—\nOther relevant environmental impacts for the product category;\n—\nOther relevant technical parameters that may be used to assess the product under study and allow for comparisons with other products of the overall product efficiency. These technical parameters may refer to, for example, the use of renewable versus non-renewable energy, the use of renewable versus non-renewable fuels, the use of secondary materials, the use of fresh water resources, or the disposal of hazardous versus non-hazardous waste types;\n—\nOther relevant approaches for conducting characterisation (60) of the flows from the Resource Use and Emissions Profile, when characterisation factors (61) (CFs) in the default method are not available for certain flows (e.g. groups of chemicals);\n—\nEnvironmental indicators or product responsibility indicators (as per the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI));\n—\nLife-cycle energy consumption by primary energy source, separately accounting for “renewable” energy use;\n—\nDirect energy consumption by primary energy source, separately accounting for “renewable” energy use;\n—\nFor gate-to-gate phases, number of IUCN Red List species and national conservation list species with habitats in areas affected by operations, by level of extinction risk;\n—\nDescription of significant impacts of activities, products, and services on biodiversity in protected areas and in areas of high biodiversity value outside protected areas;\n—\nTotal weight of waste by type and disposal method;\n—\nWeight of transported, imported, exported, or treated waste deemed hazardous under the terms of the Basel Convention Annexes I, II, III, and VIII, and percentage of transported waste shipped internationally.\n4.6   Assumptions/limitations\nIn PEF studies, several limitations to carrying out the analysis may arise and therefore assumptions need to be made. For example, generic data (62) may not completely represent the reality of the product analysed and may be adapted for better representation.\nRequirement for PEF studies\nAll limitations and assumptions shall be transparently reported.\nAdditional requirements for PEFCRs\nThe PEFCR shall report product-category-specific limitations and define the assumptions necessary to overcome the limitations.\n5.   COMPILING AND RECORDING THE RESOURCE USE AND EMISSIONS PROFILE\n5.1   General\nAn inventory (profile) of all material/energy resource inputs/outputs and emissions into air, water and soil for the product supply chain shall be compiled as a basis for modelling the PEF. This is called the Resource Use and Emissions Profile (63).\nIdeally, the model of the product supply chain would be constructed using facility- or product-specific data (i.e. modelling the exact life cycle depicting the supply chain, use, and end-of-life stages as appropriate). In practice, and as a general rule, directly collected, facility-specific inventory data should be used wherever possible. For processes where the company does not have direct access to specific data (i.e. background processes), generic data (64) will typically be used. However, it is good practice to access data collected directly from suppliers for the most relevant products supplied by them when possible, unless generic data are more representative or appropriate.\nThe resource use and emissions profile shall adopt the following classifications (65) of the flows included:\n—\nElementary flows, which are (ISO 14040:2006, 3.12) “material or energy entering the system being studied that has been drawn from the environment without previous human transformation, or material or energy leaving the system being studied that is released into the environment without subsequent human transformation.” Elementary flows are, for example, resources extracted from nature or emissions into air, water, soil that are directly linked to the characterisation factors of the EF impact categories;\n—\nNon-elementary (or complex) flows, which are all the remaining inputs (e.g. electricity, materials, transport processes) and outputs (e.g. waste, by-products) in a system that require further modelling efforts to be transformed into elementary flows.\nAll non-elementary flows in the Resource Use and Emissions Profile shall be transformed into elementary flows. For example, waste flows shall not only be reported as kg of household waste or hazardous waste, but shall also include the emissions into water, air and soil due to the treatment of the solid waste. This is necessary for the comparability of PEF studies. The compilation of the resource use and emissions profile is therefore completed when all flows are expressed as elementary flows.\nTIP: Documenting the data collection process is useful for improving the data quality over time, preparing for critical review (66), and revising future product inventories to reflect changes in production practices. To ensure that all of the relevant information is documented, establishing a data management plan early in the inventory process may be helpful (see Annex II).\nCompiling the resource use and emissions profile in a PEF study may be completed following a 2-step procedure, as explained in Figure 3. The first step is not mandatory, but is highly recommended.\nFigure 3\nTwo-step procedure to compile the Resource Use and Emissions Profile\nRequirement for PEF studies\nAll resource use and emissions associated with the life-cycle stages included in the defined system boundaries shall be included in the Resource Use and Emissions Profile. The flows shall be grouped into “elementary flows” and “non-elementary (i.e. complex) flows”. All non-elementary flows in the Resource Use and Emissions Profile shall then be transformed into elementary flows.\n5.2   Screening step (recommended)\nAn initial “screening-level” Resource Use and Emissions Profile, referred to as the screening step, is highly recommended because it helps focussing data collection activities and data quality priorities for the actual Resource Use and Emissions Profile.\nRequirement for PEF studies\nIf a screening step is conducted (highly recommended), readily available specific and/or generic data shall be used fulfilling the data quality requirements as defined in Section 5.6. All processes and activities to be considered in the Resource Use and Emissions Profile shall be included in the screening step. Any exclusion of supply-chain stages shall be explicitly justified and submitted to the review process, and their influence on the final results shall be discussed.\nFor supply-chain stages for which a quantitative EF impact assessment is not intended, the screening step shall refer to existing literature and other sources in order to develop qualitative descriptions of potentially environmentally significant processes. Such qualitative descriptions shall be included in the additional environmental information.\nAdditional requirement for development of PEFCRs\nThe PEFCR shall specify processes to be included, as well as associated data quality and review requirements, which may exceed those of this PEF Guide. It shall also specify for which processes specific data are required, and for which the use of generic data is either permissible or required.\n5.3   Data management plan (optional)\nA data management plan may be a valuable tool for managing data and for tracking the process of compiling the product Resource Use and Emissions Profile.\nThe data management plan can include:\n—\nA description of data collection procedures;\n—\nData sources;\n—\nCalculation methodologies;\n—\nData transmission, storage and backup procedures;\n—\nQuality control and review procedures for data collection, input and handling activities, data documentation and emissions calculations.\nFor additional guidance on possible approaches to formulating a data management plan, see Annex II.\n5.4   Resource Use and Emissions Profile Data\nRequirement for PEF studies\nAll resource use and emissions associated with the life-cycle stages included in the defined system boundaries shall be included in the Resource Use and Emissions Profile.\nThe following elements shall be considered for inclusion in the Resource Use and Emissions Profile:\n—\nRaw material acquisition and pre-processing;\n—\nCapital goods: linear depreciation shall be used. The expected service life of the capital goods shall be taken into account (and not the time to evolve to an economic book value of 0);\n—\nProduction;\n—\nProduct distribution and storage;\n—\nUse stage;\n—\nLogistics;\n—\nEnd-of-life.\nAdditional requirement for development of PEFCRs\nThe PEFCRs should provide one or more examples for compiling the Resource Use and Emissions Profile, including specifications with respect to:\n—\nSubstance lists for activities/processes included;\n—\nUnits;\n—\nNomenclature for elementary flows.\nThese may apply to one or more supply-chain stages, processes, or activities, for the purpose of ensuring standardised data collection and reporting. The PEFCR may specify more stringent data requirements for key upstream, gate-to-gate (67) or downstream stages than those defined in this PEF Guide.\nFor modelling processes/activities within the core module (i.e. gate-to-gate stage), the PEFCR shall also specify:\n—\nProcesses/activities included;\n—\nSpecifications for compiling data for key processes, including averaging data across facilities;\n—\nAny site-specific data required for reporting as “additional environmental information”;\n—\nSpecific data quality requirements, e.g. for measuring specific activity data.\nIf the PEFCR also requires deviations from the default cradle-to-grave system boundary (e.g. PEFCR prescribes using the cradle-to-gate boundary), the PEFCR shall specify how material/energy balances in the Resource Use and Emissions Profile shall be accounted for.\n5.4.1   Raw Material Acquisition and Pre-processing (Cradle-to-Gate)\n (68)\nThe raw material acquisition and pre-processing stage starts when resources are extracted from nature and ends when the product components enter (through the gate of) the product’s production facility. Processes that may occur in this stage include:\n—\nMining and extraction of resources;\n—\nPre-processing of all material inputs to the studied product, such as:\n—\nForming metals into ingots;\n—\nCleaning coal;\n—\nConversion of recycled material;\n—\nPhotosynthesis for biogenic materials;\n—\nCultivation and harvesting of trees or crops;\n—\nTransportation within and between extraction and pre-processing facilities, and to the production facility.\n5.4.2   Capital goods\nExamples of capital goods that shall be included are:\n—\nMachinery used in production processes;\n—\nBuildings;\n—\nOffice equipment;\n—\nTransport vehicles;\n—\nTransportation infrastructure.\nLinear depreciation shall be used for the capital goods. The expected service life of the capital goods shall be taken into account (and not the time to evolve to an economic book value of 0)\n5.4.3   Production (68)\nThe production stage begins when the product components enter the production site and ends when the finished product leaves the production facility. Examples of production-related activities include:\n—\nChemical processing;\n—\nManufacturing;\n—\nTransport of semi-finished products between manufacturing processes;\n—\nAssembly of material components;\n—\nPackaging;\n—\nTreatment of waste;\n—\nEmployee transport (if relevant);\n—\nBusiness travel (if relevant).\n5.4.4   Product Distribution and Storage (68) \nProducts are distributed to users and may be stored at various points along the supply chain. Examples of processes related to distribution and storage that shall be included are (non-exhaustive list):\n—\nEnergy inputs for warehouse lighting and heating;\n—\nUse of refrigerants in warehouses and transport vehicles;\n—\nFuel use by vehicles.\n5.4.5   Use stage (68) \nThe use stage begins when the consumer or end user takes possession of the product and ends when the used product is discarded for transport to a recycling or waste treatment facility. Examples of use-stage processes to be included are (non-exhaustive list):\n—\nUse/consumption patterns, location, time (day/night, summer/winter, week/weekend), and assumed use stage lifespan of products;\n—\nTransportation to the location of use;\n—\nRefrigeration at the location of use;\n—\nPreparation for use (e.g. microwaving);\n—\nResource consumption during use (e.g. detergent, energy and water use for washing machine);\n—\nRepair and maintenance of the product during the use stage.\nThe use scenario also needs to reflect whether or not the use of the analysed products might lead to changes in the systems in which they are used. Energy-using products, for example, might affect the energy needed for heating/cooling in a building, or the weight of a car battery might affect the fuel consumption of the car. The following sources of technical information on the use scenario should be taken into account (non-exhaustive list):\n—\nPublished international standards that specify guidance and requirements for the development of scenarios for the use stage and scenarios for (i.e. estimation of) the service life of the product;\n—\nPublished national guidelines for the development of scenarios for the use stage and scenarios for (i.e. estimation of) the service life of the product;\n—\nPublished industry guidelines for the development of scenarios for the use stage and scenarios for (i.e. estimation of) the service life of the product;\n—\nMarket surveys or other market data.\nNote: The manufacturer’s recommended method to be applied in the use stage (e.g. cooking in an oven at a specified temperature for a specified time) might provide a basis for determining the use stage of a product. The actual usage pattern may, however, differ from those recommended and should be used if this information is available.\nRequirement for PEF studies\nWhere no method for determining the use stage of products has been established in accordance with the techniques specified in this PEF Guide, the approach taken in determining the use stage of products shall be established by the organisation carrying out the study. The actual usage pattern may, however, differ from those recommended and should be used if this information is available. Relevant influences on other systems due to the use of the products shall be included.\nDocumentation of methods and assumptions shall be provided. All relevant assumptions for the use stage shall be documented.\nAdditional requirement for development of PEFCRs\nThe PEFCRs shall specify:\n—\nThe use stage scenarios to be included in the study, if any;\n—\nThe timespan to be considered for the use stage.\n5.4.6   Modelling logistics for the analysed product\nImportant parameters that should, or shall (case-specific, see below) be taken into account when modelling transport include:\n1.\nTransport type: The type of transport, e.g. by land (truck, rail, pipe), by water (boat, ferry, barge), or air (airplane), shall be taken into account;\n2.\nVehicle type & fuel consumption: The type of vehicle shall be taken into account by transport type, as well as the fuel consumption when fully loaded and empty. An adjustment shall be applied to the consumption of a fully-loaded vehicle according to loading rate (69);\n3.\nLoading rate: Environmental impacts are directly linked to the actual loading rate, which shall therefore be considered;\n4.\nNumber of empty returns: the number of empty returns (i.e. the ratio of the distance travelled to collect the next load after unloading the product to the distance travelled to transport the product), when applicable and relevant, shall be taken into account. The kilometres travelled by the empty vehicle shall be allocated to the product. Specific values shall be developed by country and by type of transported product;\n5.\nTransport distance: Transport distances shall be documented, applying average transport distances specific to the context being considered;\n6.\nAllocation of impacts from transport: A fraction of the impacts from transportation activities shall be allocated to the unit of analysis (to the considered product) based on the load-limiting factor. The following modelling principles should be considered:\n—\nGoods transport: time or distance AND mass or volume (or in specific cases: pieces/pallets) of the transported good:\n(a)\nIf the maximum authorised weight is reached before the vehicle has reached its maximum physical load: at 100 % of its volume (high density products), then allocation shall be based on the mass of transported products;\n(b)\nIf the vehicle is loaded at 100 % of the volume but it does not reach the authorised maximum weight (low density products), then allocation shall be based on the volume of the transported products;\n—\nPersonal transport: time or distance;\n—\nStaff business travel: time, distance or economic value;\n7.\nFuel production: Fuel production shall be taken into account. Default values for fuel production can be found, for example, in the European Reference Life Cycle Database (ELCD) (70);\n8.\nInfrastructure: the transport infrastructure, that of road, rail and water, should be taken into account;\n9.\nResources and tools: the amount and type of additional resources and tools needed for logistic operations such as cranes and transporters should be taken into account.\nRequirement for PEF studies\nTransport parameters that shall be taken into account are: transport type, vehicle type and fuel consumption, loading rate, number of empty returns (when relevant), transport distance, allocation for goods transport based on load-limiting factor (i.e. mass for high-density products and volume for low-density products) and fuel production.\nTransport parameters that should be taken into account are: transport infrastructure, additional resources and tools such as cranes and transporters, allocation for personal transport based on time or distance, allocation for staff business travel based on time, distance or economic value.\nThe impacts due to transport shall be expressed in the default reference units, i.e. tkm for goods and person-km for passenger transport. Any deviation from these default reference units shall be justified and reported.\nThe environmental impact due to transport shall be calculated by multiplying the impact per reference unit for each of the vehicle types by\n(a)\nfor goods: the distance and load;\n(b)\nfor persons: the distance and number of persons based on the defined transport scenarios.\nAdditional requirement for development of PEFCRs\nThe PEFCRs shall specify transport, distribution and storage scenarios to be included in the study, if any.\n5.4.7   End-of-Life\n (71)\nThe end-of-life stage begins when the used product is discarded by the user and ends when the product is returned to nature as a waste product or enters another product’s life cycle (i.e. as a recycled input). Examples of end-of-life processes that shall be included in the PEF study include:\n—\nCollection and transport of end-of-life products and packages;\n—\nDismantling of components;\n—\nShredding and sorting;\n—\nConversion into recycled material;\n—\nComposting or other organic-waste-treatment methods;\n—\nLittering;\n—\nIncineration and disposal of bottom ash;\n—\nLandfilling and landfill operation and maintenance;\n—\nTransport required to all end-of-life treatment facilities.\nAs it is often not known exactly what will happen at the end-of-life of a product, end-of-life scenarios shall be defined.\nRequirement for PEF studies\nWaste flows arising from processes included in the system boundaries shall be modelled to the level of elementary flows.\nAdditional requirement for development of PEFCRs\nThe end-of-life scenarios, if any, shall be defined in the PEFCRs. These scenarios shall be based on current (year of analysis) practice, technology and data.\n5.4.8   Accounting for Electricity Use (including Use of Renewable Energy)\nElectricity from the grid consumed upstream or within the defined PEF boundary shall be modelled as precisely as possible giving preference to supplier-specific data. If (part of) the electricity is renewable it is important that no double counting occurs. Therefore the supplier shall guarantee that the electricity supplied to the organisation to produce the product is effectively generated using renewable sources and is not put into the grid to be used by other consumers (e.g., Guarantee of Origin for production of renewable electricity (72)).\nRequirement for PEF studies\nFor electricity from the grid consumed upstream or within the defined PEF boundary, supplier-specific data shall be used if available. If supplier-specific data is not available, country-specific consumption-mix data shall be used of the country in which the life cycle stages occur. For electricity consumed during the use stage of products, the energy mix shall reflect ratios of sales between countries or regions. Where such data are not available, the average EU consumption mix, or otherwise most representative mix, shall be used.\nIt shall be guaranteed that the renewable electricity (and associated impacts) from the grid consumed upstream or within the defined PEF boundary is not double counted. A statement of the supplier shall be included as an annex to the PEF report, guaranteeing that the electricity supplied is effectively generated using renewable sources and is not sold to any other organisation.\n5.4.9   Additional considerations for compiling the resource use and emissions profile\nBiogenic carbon removals and emissions\nCarbon is, for example, removed from the atmosphere, due to the growth of trees (characterisation factor (73) of – 1 CO2 eq. for global warming), while it is released during the burning of wood (characterisation factor of + 1 CO2 eq. for global warming).\nRequirement for PEF studies\nRemovals and emissions of biogenic carbon sources shall be kept separated in the Resource Use and Emissions Profile (74).\nDirect Land Use Change (impact for climate change): the impact of land use change on climate change results basically from a change in carbon stocks in land. Direct Land Use Change occurs as the results of a transformation from one land use type into another, which takes place in a unique land cover, possibly incurring changes in the carbon stock of that specific land, but not leading to a change in another system. For details, see Annex VI.\nIndirect Land Use Change (impact for climate change): the impact of land use change on climate change results basically from a change in carbon stocks in land. Indirect Land Use Change occurs when a certain change in land use induces changes outside the system boundaries, i.e. in other land use types. As there is no agreed methodology on indirect land use change in the context of the Environmental Footprint, indirect land use change shall not be included in the greenhouse gas calculations in the PEF.\nRequirement for PEF studies\nGreenhouse gas emissions that occur as a result of direct land use change shall be allocated to products for (i) 20 years after the land use change occurs or (ii) a single harvest period from the extraction of the evaluated product (even if longer than 20 years) (75) and the longest period shall be chosen. For details, see Annex VI. Greenhouse gas emissions that occur as a result of indirect land use change shall not be considered unless PEFCRs explicitly require to do so. In that case, indirect land use change shall be reported separately as Additional Environmental Information, but it shall not be included in the calculation of the greenhouse gas impact category.\nAccounting for Renewable Energy Generation\nWithin the assessed system boundary, energy may be produced from renewable sources. If renewable energy is produced in excess of the amount consumed within the defined system boundary and it is provided to, for example, the electricity grid, this may only be credited to the product assessed provided that the credit has not already been taken into account in other schemes. Documentation (e.g. Guarantee of Origin for production of renewable electricity (76)) is required to explain whether or not the credit is considered in the calculation.\nRequirement for PEF studies\nCredits associated with renewable energy generated by the system boundary shall be calculated with respect to the corrected (i.e. by subtracting the externally provided amount of renewable energy) average, country-level consumption mix of the country to which the energy is provided. Where such data is not available, the corrected average EU consumption mix, or otherwise most representative mix shall be used. If no data are available on the calculation of corrected mixes, the uncorrected average mixes shall be used. It shall be transparently reported which energy mixes are assumed for the calculation of the benefits and whether or not these have been corrected.\nAccounting for temporary (carbon) storage and delayed emissions\nTemporary carbon storage happens when a product “reduces the GHGs in the atmosphere” or creates “negative emissions”, by removing and storing carbon for a limited amount of time.\nDelayed emissions are emissions that are released over time, e.g. through long use or final disposal phases, versus a single emission at time t.\nTo explain this with an example: if you have timber furniture with a life span of 120 years, you store carbon during the 120 years of the furniture and emissions due to its disposal or incineration at end of life are delayed with 120 years. CO2 is taken up for the production of the timber furniture, is stored for 120 years and is released when the furniture is disposed or incinerated at its end of life. The CO2 is stored for 120 years and the delayed CO2 emissions occur only after 120 years (at the end of the life span of the furniture) instead of now.\nRequirement for PEF studies\nCredits associated with temporary (carbon) storage or delayed emissions shall not be considered in the calculation of the default EF impact categories. However, these may be included as “additional environmental information”. Moreover, these shall be included under “additional environmental information” if specified in a supporting PEFCR.\n5.5   Nomenclature for the Resource Use and Emissions Profile\nDevelopers of PEF studies shall check the documented nomenclature and properties for a given flow in the Resource Use and Emissions Profile against the nomenclature and properties of the International Reference Life Cycle Data System (ILCD) (77).\nRequirement for PEF studies\nAll relevant resource use and emissions associated with the life cycle stages included in the defined system boundaries shall be documented using the International Reference Life Cycle Data System (ILCD) nomenclature and properties (74), as described in Annex IV.\nIf nomenclature and properties for a given flow are not available in the ILCD, the practitioner shall create an appropriate nomenclature and document the flow properties.\n5.6   Data quality requirements\nThis section describes how the data quality shall be assessed. Six quality criteria are adopted for PEF studies, five relating to the data and one to the method. These are summarised in the representativeness (technological, geographical and time-related) characterises to what degree the processes and products selected are depicting the system analysed. Once the processes and products are chosen which represent the system analysed, and the Resource Use and Emissions Profile of these processes and products are inventoried, the completeness criterion evaluates to what degree the Resource Use and Emissions Profile of these processes and products covers all the emissions and resources of these processes and products.\nBesides these criteria, three more aspects are included in the quality assessment, i.e. review, and documentation (compliance with the ILCD format) and compliance with ILCD nomenclature. The latter three are not included within the semi-quantitative assessment of the data quality as described in the following paragraphs. These however shall be fulfilled.\nTable 3\nData quality criteria, documentation, nomenclature and review\nData quality criteria\n—\nTechnological representativeness (78)\n—\nGeographical representativeness (79)\n—\nTime-related representativeness (80)\n—\nCompleteness\n—\nParameter uncertainty (81)\n—\nMethodological Appropriateness and Consistency (82) (the requirements as defined in Table 7 shall apply until end of year 2015.

For PEF studies (claiming to be in line with this PEF Guide) intended for in-house applications, the specified data quality requirements should be met (i.e. are recommended), but are not mandatory. Any deviations from the requirements shall be documented. Data quality requirements apply to both specific (85) and generic data (86).\nThe following six criteria shall be adopted for a semi-quantitative assessment of data quality in PEF studies: technological representativeness, geographical representativeness, time-related representativeness, completeness, parameter uncertainty and methodological appropriateness and consistency.\nIn the optional screening step a minimum “fair” quality data rating is required for data contributing to at least 90 % of the impact estimated for each EF impact category, as assessed via a qualitative expert judgement.\nIn the final Resource Use and Emissions Profile, for the processes or activities accounting for at least 70 % of contributions to each EF impact category, both specific and generic data shall achieve at least an overall “good quality” level (the 70 % threshold is chosen to balance the goal of achieving a robust assessment with the need to keep it feasible and accessible). A semi-quantitative assessment of data quality shall be performed and reported for these processes. At least 2/3 of the remaining 30 % (i.e. 20 % to 30 %) shall be modelled with at least “fair quality” data. Data of less than fair quality rating shall not account for more than 10 % contributions to each EF impact category.\nThe data quality requirements for technological, geographical and time-related representativeness shall be subject to review as part of the PEF study. The data quality requirements related to completeness, methodological appropriateness and consistency, and parameter uncertainty should be met by sourcing generic data exclusively from data sources that comply with the requirements of the PEF Guide.\nWith respect to the data quality criterion of “methodological appropriateness and consistency”, the requirements as defined in Table 6 shall apply until the end of 2015. From 2016, full compliance with the PEF methodology will be required.\nThe data quality assessment of generic data shall be conducted at the level of the input flows (e.g. purchased paper used in a printing office) while the data quality assessment of specific data shall be conducted at the level of an individual process or aggregated process, or at the level of individual input flows.\nAdditional requirements for development of PEFCRs\nPEFCRs shall provide further guidance on data quality assessment scoring for the product category with respect to time, geographical and technological representativeness. For example, it shall specify which data quality score relating to time representativeness should be assigned to a dataset representing a given year.\nPEFCRs may specify additional criteria for the assessment of data quality (compared to default criteria).\nPEFCRs may specify more stringent data quality requirements, if appropriate for the product category in question. These may include:\n—\nGate-to-gate activities/processes;\n—\nUpstream or downstream phases;\n—\nKey supply-chain activities for the product category;\n—\nKey EF impact categories for the product category.\nExample for determining the data quality rating\nComponent\nAchieved quality level\nCorresponding quality rating\nTechnological representativeness (TeR)\ngood\n2\nGeographical representativeness (GR)\ngood\n2\nTime-related representativeness (TiR)\nfair\n3\nCompleteness (C)\ngood\n2\nParameter uncertainty (P)\ngood\n2\nMethodological appropriateness and consistency (M)\ngood\n2\nA DQR of 2,2 corresponds to an overall “good quality” rating.\n5.7   Specific data collection\nThis section describes the collection of specific data which are data directly measured or collected representative of activities at a specific facility or set of facilities. The data should include all known inputs and outputs for the processes. Inputs are (for example) use of energy, water, materials, etc. Outputs are the products, co-products (87), and emissions. Emissions can be divided into four categories: emissions to air, to water, to soil, and emissions as solid waste. Specific data can be collected, measured or calculated using activity data (88) and related emission factors. It should be noted that emission factors may be derived from generic data subject to data quality requirements.\nData collection - measurements and tailored questionnaires\nThe most representative sources of data for specific processes are measurements directly performed on the process, or obtained from operators via interviews or questionnaires. The data may need scaling, aggregation or other forms of mathematical treatment to bring them in line with the unit of analysis and reference flow of the process.\nTypical specific data sources are:\n—\nProcess- or plant-level consumption data;\n—\nBills and stock/inventory changes of consumables;\n—\nEmission measurements (amounts and concentrations of emissions from gas and wastewater);\n—\nComposition of products and waste;\n—\nProcurement and sale department(s)/unit(s).\nRequirement for PEF studies\nSpecific data (89) shall be obtained for all foreground processes and for background processes, where appropriate (90). However, if generic data are more representative or appropriate than specific data for foreground processes (to be justified and reported), generic data shall also be used for the foreground processes.\nAdditional requirements for development of PEFCRs\nPEFCRs shall:\n1.\nSpecify for which processes specific data shall be collected;\n2.\nSpecify the requirements for the collection of specific data;\n3.\nDefine the data collection requirements for each site for:\n—\nTarget stage(s) and the data collection coverage;\n—\nLocation of data collection (domestically, internationally, specific factories, and so on);\n—\nTerm of data collection (year, season, month, and so on);\n—\nWhen the location or term of data collection must be limited to a certain range, provide a justification for this and show that the collected data will serve as sufficient samples.\n5.8   Generic data collection\nGeneric data refers to data that are not based on direct measurements or calculation of the respective processes in the system. Generic data can be either sector-specific, i.e. specific to the sector being considered for the PEF study, or multi-sector. Examples of generic data include:\n—\nData from literature or scientific papers;\n—\nIndustry-average life-cycle data from life-cycle-inventory databases, industry association reports, government statistics, etc.\nSourcing generic data\nGeneric data should where available be sourced from the data sources specified in this PEF Guide. Remaining generic data should preferentially be sourced from:\n—\nDatabases provided by international governmental organisations (for example FAO, UNEP);\n—\nCountry-specific national governmental LCI database projects (for data specific to the host country’s database);\n—\nNational governmental LCI database projects;\n—\nOther third-party LCI databases;\n—\nPeer-reviewed literature.\nOther potential sources of generic data can also be found, e.g. in the Resource Directory of the European Platform on LCA (91). If the necessary data cannot be found in the above-listed sources, other sources may be used.\nRequirement for PEF studies\nGeneric data should be used only for processes in the background system, unless (generic data) are more representative or appropriate than specific data for foreground processes, in which case generic data shall also be used for processes in the foreground system. When available, sector-specific generic data shall be used instead of multi-sector generic data. All generic data shall fulfil the data quality requirements specified in this document. The sources of the data used shall be clearly documented and reported in the PEF report.\nGeneric data (provided they fulfil the data quality requirements specified in this PEF Guide) should, where available, be sourced from:\n—\nData developed in line with the requirements of the relevant PEFCRs;\n—\nData developed in line with the requirements for PEF studies;\n—\nInternational Reference Life Cycle Data System (ILCD) Data Network (92) (giving preference to datasets that are fully compliant with the ILCD Data Network over those that are only entry-level compliant);\n—\nEuropean Reference Life Cycle Database (ELCD) (93).\nAdditional requirement for PEFCRs:\nThe PEFCR shall specify:\n—\nwhere the use of generic data is permitted as an approximation for a substance for which specific data is not available;\n—\nthe level of required similarities between the actual substance and the generic substance;\n—\nthe combination of more than one generic dataset, if necessary.\n5.9   Dealing with remaining unit process data gaps/missing data\nData gaps exist when there is no specific or generic data available that is sufficiently representative of the given process in the product’s life cycle. For most processes where data may be missing it should be possible to obtain sufficient information to provide a reasonable estimate of the missing data. Therefore, there should be few, if any, data gaps in the final Resource Use and Emissions Profile. Missing information can be of different types and have different characteristics, each requiring separate resolution approaches.\nData gaps may exist when:\n—\nData does not exist for a specific input/product, or\n—\nData exists for a similar process but:\n—\nThe data has been generated in a different region;\n—\nThe data has been generated using a different technology;\n—\nThe data has been generated in a different time period.\nRequirement for PEF studies\nAny data gaps shall be filled using the best available generic or extrapolated data (94). The contribution of such data (including gaps in generic data) shall not account for more than 10 % of the overall contribution to each EF impact category considered. This is reflected in the data quality requirements, according to which 10 % of the data can be chosen from the best available data (without any further data quality requirements).\nAdditional requirement for development of PEFCRs\nThe PEFCR shall specify potential data gaps and provide detailed guidance for filling these gaps.\n5.10   Handling multi-functional processes\nIf a process or facility provides more than one function, i.e. it delivers several goods and/or services (\"co-products\"), it is “multifunctional”. In these situations, all inputs and emissions linked to the process must be partitioned between the product of interest and the other co-products in a principled manner. Systems involving multi-functionality of processes shall be modelled in accordance with the following decision hierarchy, with additional guidance provided by PEFCRs if available.\nDecision hierarchy\nI)   Subdivision or system expansion\nWherever possible, subdivision or system expansion should be used to avoid allocation. Subdivision refers to disaggregating multifunctional processes or facilities to isolate the input flows directly associated with each process or facility output. System expansion refers to expanding the system by including additional functions related to the co-products. It shall be investigated first whether the analysed process can be subdivided or expanded. Where subdivision is possible, inventory data should be collected only for those unit processes (95) directly attributable (96) to the goods/services of concern. Or if the system can be expanded, the additional functions shall be included in the analysis with results communicated for the expanded system as a whole rather than on an individual co-product level.\nII)   Allocation based on a relevant underlying physical relationship\nWhere subdivision or system expansion cannot be applied, allocation should be applied: the inputs and outputs of the system should be partitioned between its different products or functions in a way that reflects relevant underlying physical relationships between them. (ISO 14044:2006, 14)\nAllocation based on a relevant underlying physical relationship refers to partitioning the input and output flows of a multi-functional process or facility in accordance with a relevant, quantifiable physical relationship between the process inputs and co-product outputs (for example, a physical property of the inputs and outputs that is relevant to the function provided by the co-product of interest). Allocation based on a physical relationship can be modelled using direct substitution if a product can be identified that is directly substituted (97).\nCan a direct substitution-effect be robustly modelled? This can be demonstrated by proving that (1) there is a direct, empirically demonstrable substitution effect, AND (2) the substituted product can be modelled and the resource use and emissions profile data subtracted in a directly representative manner:\n—\nIf yes (i.e. both conditions are verified), model the substitution effect.\nOr\nCan input/output flows be allocated based on some other relevant underlying physical relationship that relates the inputs and outputs to the function provided by the system? This can be demonstrated by proving that a relevant physical relationship can be defined by which to allocate the flows attributable to the provision of the defined function of the product system (98):\n—\nIf yes, allocate based on this physical relationship.\nIII)   Allocation Based on Some Other Relationship\nAllocation based on some other relationship may be possible. For example, economic allocation refers to allocating inputs and outputs associated with multi-functional processes to the co-product outputs in proportion to their relative market values. The market price of the co-functions should refer to the specific condition and point at which the co-products are produced. Allocation based on economic value shall only be applied when (I and II) are not possible. In any case, a clear justification for having discarded I and II and for having selected a certain allocation rule in step III shall be provided, to ensure the physical representativeness of the PEF results as far as possible.\nAllocation based on some other relationship can be approached in one of the following alternative ways:\nCan an indirect substitution (99) effect be identified? AND can the substituted product be modelled and the inventory subtracted in a reasonably representative manner?\n—\nIf yes (i.e. both conditions are verified), model the indirect substitution effect.\nOr\nCan the input/output flows be allocated between the products and functions on the basis of some other relationship (e.g. the relative economic value of the co-products)?\n—\nIf yes, allocate products and functions on the basis of the identified relationship\nDealing with multi-functionality of products is particularly challenging when recycling or energy recovery of one (or more) of these products is involved as the systems tend to get rather complex. Annex V provides an approach that shall be used to estimate the overall emissions associated to a certain process involving recycling and/or energy recovery. These moreover also relate to waste flows generated within the system boundaries.\nExamples of direct and indirect substitution\nDirect Substitution:\nDirect substitution may be modelled as a form of allocation based on an underlying physical relationship when a direct, empirically-demonstrable substitution effect can be identified. For example, when manure nitrogen is applied to agricultural land, directly substituting an equivalent amount of the specific fertiliser nitrogen that the farmer would otherwise have applied, the animal husbandry system from which the manure is derived is credited for the displaced fertiliser production (taking into account differences in transportation, handling, and emissions).\nIndirect Substitution:\nIndirect substitution may be modelled as a form of “allocation based on some other relationship” when a co-product is assumed to displace a marginal or average market-equivalent product via market-mediated processes. For example, when animal manure is packaged and sold for use in home gardening, the animal husbandry system from which the manure is derived is credited for the market-average home gardening fertiliser that is assumed to have been displaced (taking into account differences in transportation, handling, and emissions).\nRequirement for PEF studies\nThe following PEF multi-functionality decision hierarchy shall be applied for resolving all multi-functionality problems: (1) subdivision or system expansion; (2) allocation based on a relevant underlying physical relationship (including direct substitution or some relevant underlying physical relationship); (3) allocation based on some other relationship (including indirect substitution or some other relevant underlying relationship).\nAll choices made in this context shall be reported and justified with respect to the overarching goal of ensuring physically representative, environmentally relevant results. For multi-functionality of products in recycling or energy recovery situations, the equation described in Annex V shall be applied. The abovementioned decision process also applies for end-of-life multi-functionality.\nAdditional requirement for development of PEFCRs\nThe PEFCR shall further specify multi-functionality solutions for application within the defined system boundaries and, where appropriate, for upstream and downstream stages. If feasible/appropriate, the PEFCR may further provide specific factors to be used in the case of allocation solutions. All such multi-functionality solutions specified in the PEFCR must be clearly justified with reference to the PEF multi-functionality solution hierarchy.\nWhere subdivision is applied, the PEFCR shall specify which processes are to be sub-divided and the principles that such subdivision should adhere to.\nWhere allocation by physical relationship is applied, the PEFCR shall specify the relevant underlying physical relationships to be considered, and establish the relevant allocation factors.\nWhere allocation by some other relationship is applied, the PEFCR shall specify this relationship and establish the relevant allocation factors. For example, in the case of economic allocation, the PEFCR shall specify the rules for determining the economic values of co-products.\nFor multi-functionality in end-of-life situations, the PEFCR shall specify how the different parts are calculated within the mandatory formula provided.\nFigure 4\nDecision tree for handling multi-functional processes\n5.11   Data gathering related to the next methodological phases in a PEF study\nFigure 5 focuses on the data collection step to be taken when developing a PEF study. The “shall/should/may” requirements are summarised for both specific and generic data. The figure moreover indicates the link between the data collection step and the development of the Resource Use and Emissions Profile and subsequent EF impact assessment.\nFigure 5\nRelationship between data collection, Resource Use and Emissions Profile and EF impact assessment\n6.   ENVIRONMENTAL FOOTPRINT IMPACT ASSESSMENT\nOnce the Resource Use and Emissions Profile has been compiled, the EF impact assessment shall be undertaken to calculate the environmental performance of the product, using the selected EF impact categories and models. EF impact assessment includes two mandatory and two optional steps. The EF Impact Assessment does not intend to replace other (regulatory) tools that have a different scope and objective such as (Environmental) Risk Assessment ((E)RA), site specific Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) or Health and Safety regulations at product level or related to safety at the workplace. Especially, the EF Impact Assessment has not the objective to predict if at any specific location at any specific time thresholds are exceeded and actual impacts occur. In contrast it describes the existing pressures on the environment. Thus, the EF Impact Assessment is complementary to other well-proven tools, adding the life cycle perspective.\n6.1   Classification and Characterisation (mandatory)\nRequirement for PEF studies\nThe EF impact assessment shall include a classification and characterisation of the Product Environmental Footprint flows.\n6.1.1   Classification of Product Environmental Footprint Flows\nClassification requires assigning the material/energy inputs and outputs inventoried in the Resource Use and Emissions Profile to the relevant EF impact category. For example, during the classification phase, all inputs/outputs that result in greenhouse gas emissions are assigned to the Climate Change category. Similarly, those that result in emissions of ozone-depleting substances are classified accordingly to the Ozone Depletions category. In some cases, an input/output may contribute to more than one EF impact category (for example, chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) contribute to both Climate Change and Ozone Depletion).\nIt is important to express the data in terms of the constituent substances for which characterisation factors (see next section) are available. For example, data for a composite NPK fertiliser should be disaggregated and classified according to its N, P, and K fractions, because each constituent element will contribute to different EF impact categories. In practice, much of the Resource Use and Emissions Profile data may be drawn from existing public or commercial life-cycle-inventory databases, where classification has already been implemented. In such cases, it must be assured, for example by the provider, that the classification and linked EF impact assessment pathways correspond to the requirements of this PEF Guide.\nRequirement for PEF studies\nAll inputs/outputs inventoried during the compilation of the Resource Use and Emissions Profile shall be assigned to the EF impact categories to which they contribute (“classification”) using the classification data available at http://lct.jrc.ec.europa.eu/assessment/projects.\nAs part of the classification of the Resource Use and Emissions Profile, data should be expressed in terms of constituent substances for which characterisation factors are available.\nExample: classification of data for a T-Shirt study\nClassification of data in the climate change impact category:\nCO2\nYes\nCH4\nYes\nSO2\nNo\nNOx\nNo\nClassification of data in the acidification impact category:\nCO2\nNo\nCH4\nNo\nSO2\nYes\nNOx\nYes\n6.1.2   Characterisation of Environmental Footprint Flows\nCharacterisation refers to the calculation of the magnitude of the contribution of each classified input/output to their respective EF impact categories, and aggregation of the contributions within each category. This is carried out by multiplying the values in the Resource Use and Emissions Profile by the relevant characterisation factor for each EF impact category.\nThe characterisation factors are substance- or resource- specific. They represent the impact intensity of a substance relative to a common reference substance for an EF impact category (impact category indicator). For example, in the case of calculating climate change impacts, all greenhouse gas emissions inventoried in the Resource Use and Emissions Profile are weighted in terms of their impact intensity relative to carbon dioxide, which is the reference substance for this category. This allows for the aggregation of impact potentials and expression in terms of a single equivalent substance (in this case, CO2 equivalents) for each EF impact category. For example, the CF expressed as global warming potential for methane equals 25 CO2 – equivalents and its impact on global warming is thus 25 times higher than of CO2 (i.e. CF of 1 CO2-equivalent).\nRequirement for PEF studies\nAll classified inputs/outputs in each EF impact category shall be assigned characterisation factors representing the contribution per unit of input/output to the category, using the provided characterisation factors available online at http://lct.jrc.ec.europa.eu/assessment/projects. EF impact assessment results shall subsequently be calculated for each EF impact category by multiplying the amount of each input/output by its characterisation factor and summing the contributions of all inputs/outputs within each category in order to obtain a single measure expressed in the appropriate reference unit.\nIf characterisation factors (CFs) from the default model are not available for certain flows (e.g. a group of chemicals) of the Resource Use and Emissions Profile, then other approaches may be used for characterising these flows. In such circumstances, this shall be reported under “additional environmental information”. The characterisation models shall be scientifically and technically valid, and based upon distinct, identifiable environmental mechanisms (100) or reproducible empirical observations.\nExample: Calculation of EF impact assessment results\nGlobal warming\nCF\nCO2\ng\n5,132\n×\n1\n=\n5,132 kg CO2eq\nCH4\ng\n8,2\n×\n25\n=\n0,205 kg CO2eq\nSO2\ng\n3,9\n×\n0\n=\n0 kg CO2eq\nNOx\ng\n26,8\n×\n0\n=\n0 kg CO2eq\nTotal\n=\n5,337 kg CO2eq\nAcidification\nCF\nCO2\ng\n5,132\n×\n0\n=\n0 Mol H+ eq\nCH4\ng\n8,2\n×\n0\n=\n0 Mol H+ eq\nSO2\ng\n3,9\n×\n1,31\n=\n0,005 Mol H+ eq\nNOx\ng\n26,8\n×\n0,74\n=\n0,019 Mol H+ eq\nTotal\n=\n0,024kg Mol H+ eq\n6.2   Normalisation and Weighting (recommended/optional)\nFollowing the two mandatory steps of classification and characterisation, the EF impact assessment may be complemented with normalisation and weighting, which are recommended/optional steps.\n6.2.1   Normalisation of Environmental Footprint Impact Assessment Results (recommended)\nNormalisation is not a required, but recommended step in which the EF impact assessment results are multiplied by normalisation factors in order to calculate and compare the magnitude of their contributions to the EF impact categories relative to a reference unit (typically the pressure related to that category caused by the emissions over one year of a whole country or an average citizen). As a result, dimensionless, normalised EF results are obtained. These reflect the burdens attributable to a product relative to the reference unit, such as per capita for a given year and region. This allows the relevance of the contributions made by individual processes to be compared to the reference unit of the EF impact categories considered. For example, EF impact assessment results may be compared to the same EF impact assessment results for a given region such as the EU-27 and on a per-person basis. In this case they would reflect person-equivalents relative to the emissions associated with the EU-27. Normalised environmental footprint results do not, however, indicate the severity/relevance of the respective impacts.\nRequirement for PEF studies\nNormalisation is not a required, but recommended step for PEF studies. If normalisation is applied, the normalised environmental footprint results shall be reported under “additional environmental information”, with all methods and assumptions documented.\nNormalised results shall not be aggregated as this implicitly applies weighting. Results from the EF impact assessment prior to normalisation shall be reported alongside the normalised results.\n6.2.2   Weighting of Environmental Footprint Impact Assessment Results (optional)\nWeighting is not a required, but optional step that may support the interpretation and communication of the results of the analysis. In this step, EF results, for example normalised results, are multiplied by a set of weighting factors which reflect the perceived relative importance of the EF impact categories considered. Weighted EF results can then be compared to assess their relative importance. They can also be aggregated across EF impact categories to obtain several aggregated values or a single overall impact indicator.\nWeighting requires making value judgements as to the respective importance of the EF impact categories considered. These judgements may be based on expert opinion, cultural/political viewpoints, or economic considerations (101).\nRequirement for PEF studies.\nWeighting is not a required, but optional step for PEF studies. If weighting is applied, the methods and results shall be reported under “additional environmental information”. Results of the EF impact assessment prior to weighting shall be reported alongside weighted results.\nThe application of normalisation and weighting steps in PEF studies shall be consistent with the defined goals and scope of the study, including the intended applications (102).\n7.   INTERPRETATION OF PRODUCT ENVIRONMENTAL FOOTPRINT RESULTS\n7.1   General\nInterpretation of the results of the PEF (103) study serves two purposes:\n—\nThe first is to ensure that the performance of the PEF model corresponds to the goals and quality requirements of the study. In this sense, PEF interpretation may inform iterative improvements of the PEF model until all goals and requirements are met;\n—\nThe second purpose is to derive robust conclusions and recommendations from the analysis, for example in support of environmental improvements.\nTo meet these objectives, the PEF interpretation phase shall include four key steps, as outlined in this chapter.\nRequirement for PEF studies\nThe interpretation phase shall include the following steps: “assessment of the robustness of the PEF model”; “identification of hotspots”; “estimation of uncertainty”; and “conclusions, limitations and recommendations”.\n7.2   Assessment of the robustness of the Product Environmental Footprint model\nThe assessment of the robustness of the PEF model assesses the extent to which methodological choices such as system boundaries, data sources, allocation choices, and coverage of EF impact categories influence the analytical outcomes.\nTools that should be used to assess the robustness of the PEF model include:\n—\nCompleteness checks: assess the Resource Use and Emissions Profile data to ensure that it is complete relative to the defined goals, scope, system boundaries and quality criteria. This includes completeness of process coverage (i.e. all processes at each supply-chain stage considered have been included) and input/output coverage (i.e. all material or energy inputs and emissions associated with each process have been included).\n—\nSensitivity checks: assess the extent to which the results are determined by specific methodological choices, and the impact of implementing alternative choices where these are identifiable. It is useful to structure sensitivity checks for each phase of the PEF study, including goal and scope definition, the Resource Use and Emissions Profile, and the EF impact assessment.\n—\nConsistency checks: assess the extent to which assumptions, methods, and data quality considerations have been applied consistently throughout the PEF study.\nAny issues flagged in this evaluation may be used to inform iterative improvements to the PEF study.\nRequirement for PEF studies\nThe assessment of the robustness of the PEF model shall include an assessment of the extent to which methodological choices influence the results. These choices shall correspond to the requirements specified in this PEF Guide and shall be appropriate to the context. Tools that should be used to assess the robustness of the PEF model are completeness checks, sensitivity checks and consistency checks.\n7.3   Identification of Hotspots\nOnce it has been ensured that the PEF model is robust and conforms to all aspects defined in the goal and scope definition phases, the next step is to identify the main contributing elements to the PEF results. This step may also be referred to as “hotspot” or “weak point” analysis. Contributing elements may be specific life-cycle stages, processes, or individual material/energy inputs/outputs associated with a given stage or process in the product supply chain. These are identified by systematically reviewing the PEF study results. Graphical tools may be particularly useful in this context. Such analyses provide the necessary basis to identify improvement potentials associated with specific management interventions.\nRequirement for PEF studies\nPEF results shall be evaluated to assess the effect of supply-chain hotspots/weak points at the level of the inputs/outputs-, processes-, and supply-chain stages and to assess potential improvements.\nRequirement for PEFCR\nThe PEFCR shall identify the most relevant EF impact categories for the sector. Normalisation and weighting may be used to achieve such prioritisation.\n7.4   Estimation of Uncertainty\nEstimating the uncertainties of the final PEF results supports iterative improvement of PEF studies. It also helps the target audience to assess the robustness and applicability of the PEF study results.\nThere are two key sources of uncertainty in PEF studies:\n(1)\nStochastic uncertainties for “Resource Use and Emissions Profile” data\nStochastic uncertainties (both parameter and model) refer to statistical descriptions of variance around a mean/average. For normally distributed data, this variance is typically described in terms of an average and standard deviation. PEF results that are calculated using average data (i.e. the mean of multiple data points for a given process) do not reflect the uncertainty associated with such variance. However, uncertainty may be estimated and communicated using appropriate statistical tools.\n(2)\nChoice-related uncertainties\nChoice-related uncertainties arise from methodological choices including modelling principles, system boundaries, allocation choices, choice of EF impact assessment methods, and other assumptions related to time, technology, geography, etc. These are not readily amenable to statistical description, but rather can only be characterised via scenario model assessments (e.g. modelling worst- and best-case scenarios for significant processes) and sensitivity analyses.\nRequirement for PEF studies\nAt least a qualitative description of the uncertainties of the PEF results shall be provided for both choice-related uncertainties and uncertainties of inventory data, in order to facilitate an overall appreciation of the uncertainties of the PEF study results.\nRequirement for PEFCRs\nThe PEFCR shall describe the uncertainties common to the product category and should identify the range in which results could be seen as not being significantly different in comparisons or comparative assertions.\nTIP: Quantitative uncertainty assessments may be calculated for variance associated with the Resource Use and Emissions Profile data using, for example, Monte Carlo simulations. The influence of choice-related uncertainties should be estimated at the upper and lower bounds through sensitivity analyses based on scenario assessments. These should be clearly documented and reported.\n7.5   Conclusions, Recommendations and Limitations\nThe final aspect of the EF interpretation phase is to draw conclusions based on the analytical results, answer the questions posed at the outset of the PEF study, and advance recommendations appropriate to the intended audience and context whilst explicitly taking into account any limitations to the robustness and applicability of the results. The PEF needs to be seen as complementary to other assessments and instruments such as site specific environmental impact assessments or chemical risk assessments.\nPotential improvements should be identified such, as for example, cleaner technology techniques, changes in product design, environmental management systems (e.g. Eco-Management and Audit Scheme (EMAS) or ISO 14001), or other systematic approaches.\nRequirement for PEF studies\nConclusions, recommendations and limitations shall be described in accordance with the defined goals and scope of the PEF study. PEF studies intended to support comparative assertions to be disclosed to the public (i.e. claims about the environmental superiority or equivalence of the product) shall be based both on this PEF Guide and related PEFCRs. The conclusions should include a summary of identified supply chain “hotspots” and the potential improvements associated with management interventions.\n8.   PRODUCT ENVIRONMENTAL FOOTPRINT REPORTS\n8.1   General\nA PEF report provides a relevant, comprehensive, consistent, accurate, and transparent account of the study and of the calculated environmental impacts associated with the product. It reflects the best possible information in such a way as to maximise its usefulness to intended current and future users, whilst honestly and transparently communicating limitations. Effective PEF reporting requires that several criteria, both procedural (report quality) and substantive (report content), are met.\n8.2   Reporting elements\nA PEF report consists of at least three elements: a Summary, the Main Report, and an Annex.

GLOSSARY\nAdditional Environmental Information– EF impact categories and other environmental indicators that are calculated and communicated alongside PEF results.\nAcidification– EF impact category that addresses impacts due to acidifying substances in the environment. Emissions of NOx, NH3 and SOx lead to releases of hydrogen ions (H+) when the gases are mineralised. The protons contribute to the acidification of soils and water when they are released in areas where the buffering capacity is low, resulting in forest decline and lake acidification.\nAllocation– An approach to solving multi-functionality problems. It refers to “partitioning the input or output flows of a process or a product system between the product system under study and one or more other product systems” (ISO 14040:2006).\nAttributional– Refers to process-based modelling intended to provide a static representation of average conditions, excluding market-mediated effects.\nAverage Data– Refers to a production-weighted average of specific data.\nBackground processes– Refers to those processes in the product life cycle for which no direct access to information is possible. For example, most of the upstream life-cycle processes and generally all processes further downstream will be considered part of the background processes.\nBusiness to Business (B2B)– Describes transactions between businesses, such as between a manufacturer and a wholesaler, or between a wholesaler and a retailer.\nBusiness to Consumers (B2C)– Describes transactions between business and consumers, such as between retailers and consumers. According to ISO 14025:2006, a consumer is defined as “an individual member of the general public purchasing or using goods, property or services for private purposes”.\nCharacterisation– Calculation of the magnitude of the contribution of each classified input/output to their respective EF impact categories, and aggregation of contributions within each category. This requires a linear multiplication of the inventory data with characterisation factors for each substance and EF impact category of concern. For example, with respect to the EF impact category “climate change”, CO2 is chosen as the reference substance and kg CO2-equivalents as the reference unit.\nCharacterisation factor– Factor derived from a characterisation model which is applied to convert an assigned Resource Use and Emissions Profile result to the common unit of the EF impact category indicator (based on ISO 14040:2006).\nClassification– Assigning the material/energy inputs and outputs tabulated in the Resource and Emissions Profile to EF impact categories according to each substance’s potential to contribute to each of the EF impact categories considered.\nCo-function– Any of two or more functions resulting from the same unit process or product system.\nComparative Assertion– An environmental claim regarding the superiority or equivalence of products, based on the results of a PEF study and supporting PEFCRs (based on ISO 14040:2006).\nComparison– A comparison (graphic or otherwise) of two or more products regarding the results of their PEF, taking into account their PEFCRs, not including a comparative assertion.\nCo-product– Any of two or more products resulting from the same unit process or product system (ISO 14040:2006).\nCradle to Gate– A partial product supply chain, from the extraction of raw materials (cradle) up to the manufacturer’s “gate”. The distribution, storage, use stage and end-of-life stages of the supply chain are omitted.\nCradle to Grave– A product’s life cycle that includes raw material extraction, processing, distribution, storage, use, and disposal or recycling stages. All relevant inputs and outputs are considered for all of the stages of the life cycle.\nCritical review– Process intended to ensure consistency between a PEF study and the principles and requirements of this PEF Guide and PEFCRs (if available) (based on ISO 14040:2006).\nData Quality– Characteristics of data that relate to their ability to satisfy stated requirements (ISO 14040:2006). Data quality covers various aspects, such as technological, geographical and time-related representativeness, as well as completeness and precision of the inventory data.\nDelayed emissions– Emissions that are released over time, e.g. through long use or final disposal stages, versus a single emission at time t.\nDirect Land Use Changes (dLUC)– The transformation from one land use type into another, which takes place in a unique land area and does not lead to a change in another system.\nDirectly attributable– Refers to a process, activity or impact occurring within the defined system boundary.\nDownstream– Occurring along a product supply chain after the point of referral.\nEcological Footprint– Refers to “the area of productive land and water ecosystems required to produce the resources that the population consumes and assimilate the wastes that the population produces, wherever on Earth the land and water is located” (Wackernagel and Rees, 1996). According to the PEF Guide the environmental footprint is not equal to the ecological footprint of Wackernagel and Rees; the main differences are highlighted in Annex X.\nEcotoxicity– Environmental footprint impact category that addresses the toxic impacts on an ecosystem, which damage individual species and change the structure and function of the ecosystem. Ecotoxicity is a result of a variety of different toxicological mechanisms caused by the release of substances with a direct effect on the health of the ecosystem.\nElementary flows– In the Resource Use and Emissions Profile, elementary flows include “material or energy entering the system being studied that has been drawn from the environment without previous human transformation, or material or energy leaving the system being studied that is released into the environment without subsequent human transformation” (ISO 14040, 3.12). Elementary flows include, for example, resources taken from nature or emissions into air, water, soil that are directly linked to the characterisation factors of the EF impact categories.\nEnvironmental aspect– An element of an organisation’s activities or products that has or can have an impact on the environment (EMAS regulation).\nEnvironmental Footprint (EF) Impact Assessment– Phase of the PEF analysis aimed at understanding and evaluating the magnitude and significance of the potential environmental impacts for a product system throughout the life cycle of the product (based on ISO 14044:2006). The EF impact assessment methods provide impact characterisation factors for elementary flows in order to aggregate the impact to obtain a limited number of midpoint and/or damage indicators.\nEnvironmental Footprint (EF) Impact Assessment Method– Protocol for quantitative translation of Resource Use and Emissions Profile data into contributions to an environmental impact of concern.\nEnvironmental Footprint (EF) Impact Category– Class of resource use or environmental impact to which the Resource Use and Emissions Profile data are related.\nEnvironmental Footprint (EF) impact category indicator– Quantifiable representation of an EF impact category (based on ISO 14000:2006).\nEnvironmental impact– Any change to the environment, whether adverse or beneficial, that wholly or partially results from an organisation’s activities, products or services (EMAS regulation).\nEnvironmental mechanism– System of physical, chemical and biological processes for a given EF impact category linking the Resource Use and Emissions Profile results to EF category indicators (based on ISO 14040:2006).\nEutrophication– Nutrients (mainly nitrogen and phosphorus) from sewage outfalls and fertilised farmland accelerate the growth of algae and other vegetation in water. The degradation of organic material consumes oxygen resulting in oxygen deficiency and, in some cases, fish death. Eutrophication translates the quantity of substances emitted into a common measure expressed as the oxygen required for the degradation of dead biomass.\nExtrapolated Data– Refers to data from a given process that is used to represent a similar process for which data is not available, on the assumption that it is reasonably representative.\nFlow diagram– Schematic representation of the flows occurring during one or more process stages within the life cycle of the product being assessed.\nForeground Processes– Refer to those processes in the product life cycle for which direct access to information is available. For example, the producer’s site and other processes operated by the producer or its contractors (e.g. goods transport, head-office services, etc.) belong to the foreground processes.\nGate to Gate– A partial product’s supply chain that includes only the processes carried out on a product within a specific organisation or site.\nGate to Grave– A partial product’s supply chain that includes only the distribution, storage, use, and disposal or recycling stages.\nGeneric Data– Refers to data that is not directly collected, measured, or estimated, but rather sourced from a third-party life-cycle-inventory database or other source that complies with the data quality requirements of the PEF method.\nGlobal Warming Potential– Capacity of a greenhouse gas to influence radiative forcing, expressed in terms of a reference substance (for example, CO2-equivalent units) and specified time horizon (e.g. GWP 20, GWP 100, GWP 500, for 20, 100, and 500 years respectively). It relates to the capacity to influence changes in the global average surface-air temperature and subsequent change in various climate parameters and their effects, such as storm frequency and intensity, rainfall intensity and frequency of flooding, etc.\nHuman Toxicity – cancer– EF impact category that accounts for the adverse health effects on human beings caused by the intake of toxic substances through inhalation of air, food/water ingestion, penetration through the skin insofar as they are related to cancer.\nHuman Toxicity - non cancer– EF impact category that accounts for the adverse health effects on human beings caused by the intake of toxic substances through inhalation of air, food/water ingestion, penetration through the skin insofar as they are related to non-cancer effects that are not caused by particulate matter/respiratory inorganics or ionising radiation.\nIndirect Land Use Changes (iLUC)– Occur when a demand for a certain land use leads to changes, outside the system boundaries, i.e. in other land use types. These indirect effects can be mainly assessed by means of economic modelling of the demand for land or by modelling the relocation of activities on a global scale. The main drawbacks of such models are their reliance on trends, which might not reflect future developments. They are commonly used as the basis for political decisions.\nInput– Product, material or energy flow that enters a unit process. Products and materials include raw materials, intermediate products and co-products (ISO 14040:2006).\nIntermediate product– Output form a unit process that is input to other unit processes that require further transformation within the system (ISO 14040:2006).\nIonising Radiation, human health– EF impact category that accounts for the adverse health effects on human health caused by radioactive releases.\nLand Use– EF impact category related to use (occupation) and conversion (transformation) of land area by activities such as agriculture, roads, housing, mining, etc. Land occupation considers the effects of the land use, the amount of area involved and the duration of its occupation (changes in quality multiplied by area and duration). Land transformation considers the extent of changes in land properties and the area affected (changes in quality multiplied by the area).\nLife cycle– Consecutive and interlinked stages of a product system, from raw material acquisition or generation from natural resources to final disposal (ISO 14040:2006).\nLife-Cycle Approach– Takes into consideration the spectrum of resource flows and environmental interventions associated with a product from a supply-chain perspective, including all stages from raw material acquisition through processing, distribution, use, and end-of-life processes, and all relevant related environmental impacts (instead of focusing on a single issue).\nLife-Cycle Assessment (LCA)– Compilation and evaluation of the inputs, outputs and the potential environmental impacts of a product system throughout its life cycle (ISO 14040:2006).\nLife-Cycle Impact Assessment (LCIA)– Phase of life cycle assessment that aims at understanding and evaluating the magnitude and significance of the potential environmental impacts for a system throughout the life cycle (ISO 14040:2006). The LCIA methods used provide impact characterisation factors for elementary flows to in order to aggregate the impact to obtain a limited number of midpoint and/or damage indicators.\nLoading rate– Ratio of actual load to the full load or capacity (e.g. mass or volume) that a vehicle carries per trip.\nMulti-functionality– If a process or facility provides more than one function, i.e. it delivers several goods and/or services (\"co-products\"), it is “multifunctional”. In these situations, all inputs and emissions linked to the process must be partitioned between the product of interest and the other co-products in a principled manner.\nNon-elementary (or complex) flows– In the Resource Use and Emissions Profile, non-elementary flows include all the inputs (e.g. electricity, materials, transport processes) and outputs (e.g. waste, by-products) in a system that need further modelling efforts to be transformed into elementary flows.\nNormalisation– After the characterisation step, normalisation is an optional step in which the EF impact assessment results are multiplied by normalisation factors that represent the overall inventory of a reference unit (e.g. a whole country or an average citizen). Normalised EF impact assessment results express the relative shares of the impacts of the analysed system in terms of the total contributions to each impact category per reference unit. When displaying the normalised EF impact assessment results of the different impact topics next to each other, it becomes evident which impact categories are affected most and least by the analysed system. Normalised EF impact assessment results reflect only the contribution of the analysed system to the total impact potential, not the severity/relevance of the respective total impact. Normalised results are dimensionless, but not additive.\nOutput– Product, material or energy flow that leaves a unit process. Products and materials include raw materials, intermediate products, co-products and releases (ISO 14040:2006).\nOzone Depletion– EF impact category that accounts for the degradation of stratospheric ozone due to emissions of ozone-depleting substances, for example long-lived chlorine and bromine containing gases (e.g. CFCs, HCFCs, Halons).\nParticulate Matter/Respiratory Inorganics– EF impact category that accounts for the adverse health effects on human health caused by emissions of Particulate Matter (PM) and its precursors (NOx, SOx, NH3)\nPhotochemical Ozone Formation– EF impact category that accounts for the formation of ozone at the ground level of the troposphere caused by photochemical oxidation of Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) and carbon monoxide (CO) in the presence of nitrogen oxides (NOx) and sunlight. High concentrations of ground-level tropospheric ozone damage vegetation, human respiratory tracts and manmade materials through reaction with organic materials.\nProduct– Any goods or services (ISO 14040:2006).\nProduct category– Group of products that can fulfil equivalent functions (ISO 14025:2006).\nProduct Category Rules (PCR)– Set of specific rules, requirements and guidelines for developing Type III environmental declarations for one or more product categories (ISO 14025:2006).\nProduct Environmental Footprint Category Rules (PEFCRs)– Are product-type-specific, life-cycle-based rules that complement general methodological guidance for PEF studies by providing further specification at the level of a specific product category. PEFCRs can help to shift the focus of the PEF study towards those aspects and parameters that matter the most, and hence contribute to increased relevance, reproducibility and consistency.\nProduct flow– Products entering from or leaving to another product system (ISO 14040:2006).\nProduct system– Collection of unit processes with elementary and product flows, performing one or more defined functions, and which models the life cycle of a product (ISO 14040:2006).\nRaw material– Primary or secondary material that is used to produce a product (ISO 14040:2006).\nReference Flow– Measure of the outputs from processes in a given product system required to fulfil the function expressed by the unit of analysis (based on ISO 14040:2006).\nReleases– Emissions to air and discharges to water and soil (ISO 14040:2006).\nResource Depletion– EF impact category that addresses use of natural resources, either renewable or non-renewable, biotic or abiotic.\nResource Use and Emissions Profile– Refers to the inventory of data collected to represent the inputs and outputs associated with each stage of the product supply chain being studied. The compilation of the Resource Use and Emissions Profile is completed when non-elementary (i.e. complex) flows are transformed into elementary flows.\nResource Use and Emissions Profile results– Outcome of a Resource Use and Emissions Profile that catalogues the flows crossing the system boundary and provides the starting point for the EF impact assessment.\nSensitivity analysis– Systematic procedures for estimating the effects of the choices made regarding methods and data on the results of a PEF study (based on ISO 14040: 2006).\nSoil Organic Matter (SOM)– Is the measure of the content of organic material in soil. This derives from plants and animals and comprises all of the organic matter in the soil exclusive of the matter that has not decayed.\nSpecific Data– Refers to directly measured or collected data representative of activities at a specific facility or set of facilities. Synonymous with “primary data.”\nSubdivision– Subdivision refers to disaggregating multifunctional processes or facilities to isolate the input flows directly associated with each process or facility output. The process is investigated to see whether it can be subdivided. Where subdivision is possible, inventory data should be collected only for those unit processes directly attributable to the products/services of concern.\nSystem Boundary– Definition of aspects included or excluded from the study. For example, for a “cradle-to-grave” EF analysis, the system boundary should include all activities from the extraction of raw materials through the processing, distribution, storage, use, and disposal or recycling stages.\nSystem boundary diagram– Graphic representation of the system boundary defined for the PEF study.\nTemporary carbon storage– happens when a product “reduces the GHGs in the atmosphere” or creates “negative emissions”, by removing and storing carbon for a limited amount of time.\nType III environmental declaration– An environmental declaration providing quantified environmental data using predetermined parameters and, where relevant, additional environmental information (ISO 14025:2006). The predetermined parameters are based on the ISO 14040 series of standards, which is made up of ISO 14040 and ISO 14044.\nUncertainty analysis– Procedure to assess the uncertainty introduced into the results of a PEF study due to data variability and choice-related uncertainty.\nUnit of Analysis– The unit of analysis defines the qualitative and quantitative aspects of the function(s) and/or service(s) provided by the product being evaluated; the unit of analysis definition answers the questions “what?”, “how much?”, “how well?”, and “for how long?”\nUnit process– Smallest element considered in the Resource Use and Emissions Profile for which input and output data are quantified (based on ISO 14040:2006).\nUpstream– Occurring along the supply chain of purchased goods/services prior to entering the system boundary.\nWaste– Substances or objects which the holder intends or is required to dispose of (ISO 14040:2006).\nWeighting– Weighting is an additional, but not mandatory, step that may support the interpretation and communication of the results of the analysis. PEF results are multiplied by a set of weighting factors, which reflect the perceived relative importance of the impact categories considered. Weighted EF results can be directly compared across impact categories, and also summed across impact categories to obtain a single-value overall impact indicator. Weighting requires making value judgements as to the respective importance of the EF impact categories considered. These judgements may be based on expert opinion, social science methods, cultural/political viewpoints, or economic considerations.\n12.

These are extensively explained throughout this Guide, as indicated in the left-hand column of the table.\nTable 9\nSummary of Key Mandatory requirements for PEF studies and additional requirements for developing PEFCRs\nChapter/section\nCriteria\nRequirements for PEF\nAdditional Requirements for Developing PEFCRs\n1\nGeneral Approach\nA PEF study shall be based on a life-cycle approach.\n1.1\nPrinciples\nUsers of this Guide shall observe the following principles in conducting a PEF study:\n1.\nRelevance;\n2.\nCompleteness;\n3.\nConsistency;\n4.\nAccuracy;\n5.\nTransparency.\nPrinciples for PEFCRs:\n1.\nRelationship with the PEF Guide;\n2.\nInvolvement of selected interested parties;\n3.\nStriving for comparability.\n2.1\nRole of PEFCRs\nIn the absence of PEFCRs, the key areas that would be covered in PEFCRs (as listed in this PEF Guide) shall be specified, justified and explicitly reported in the PEF study.\n2.2\nRelation with existing PCRs\nPEFCRs should, to the extent possible and recognising the different application contexts, be in conformity with existing international Product Category Rule (PCR) guidance documents.\n2.3\nCPA-based PEFCR structure\nPEFCRs shall be based at a minimum on a two-digit CPA code division (default option). However, PEFCRs may allow for (justified) deviations (e.g. allow for three-digits). For example, more than two-digits are necessary when addressing the complexity of the sector. Where multiple production routes for similar products are defined using alternative CPAs, the PEFCR shall accommodate all such CPAs.\n3.1\nGoal definition\nGoal definition for a PEF study shall include:\n—\nIntended application(s);\n—\nReasons for carrying out the study and decision context;\n—\nTarget audience;\n—\nWhether comparisons and/or comparative assertions are to be disclosed to the public;\n—\nCommissioner of the study;\n—\nReview procedure (if applicable).\nThe PEFCR shall specify the review requirements for a PEF study.\n4.1\nScope definition\nThe scope definition for a PEF study shall be in line with the defined goals of the study and shall include:\n—\nUnit of analysis and reference flow;\n—\nSystem boundaries;\n—\nEF impact categories;\n—\nAssumptions and limitations.\n4.2\nUnit of analysis and reference flow\nThe unit of analysis for a PEF study shall be defined according to the following aspects:\n—\nThe function(s)/service(s) provided: “what”;\n—\nThe magnitude of the function or service: “how much”;\n—\nThe expected level of quality: “how well”;\n—\nThe duration/life time of the product: “how long”;\n—\nThe NACE code(s).\nAn appropriate reference flow shall be determined in relation to the unit of analysis. The quantitative input and output data collected in support of the analysis shall be calculated in relation to this flow.\nThe PEFCR shall specify the unit(s) of analysis\n4.3\nSystem boundaries\nThe system boundary shall be defined following general supply-chain logic, including all stages from raw material extraction through processing, production, distribution, storage, use stage and end-of-life treatment of the product (i.e. cradle-to-grave), as appropriate to the intended application of the study. The system boundaries shall include all processes linked to the product supply chain relative to the unit of analysis.\nThe processes included in the system boundaries shall be divided into foreground processes (i.e. core processes in the product life cycle for which direct access to information is available) and background processes (i.e. those processes in the product life cycle for which no direct access to information is possible).\nThe PEFCR shall specify the system boundaries for product category PEF studies, including specification of relevant life-cycle stages and processes. Any deviation from the default cradle-to-grave approach shall be explicitly specified and justified, e.g. exclusion of the unknown use-stage or end-of-life of intermediate products.\nThe PEFCR shall specify downstream scenarios so as to ensure comparability and consistency among PEF studies.\n4.3\nOffsets\nOffsets shall not be included in the PEF study. However, they may be reported separately as “additional environmental information”.\n4.4\nSelection of EF impact categories and methods\nFor a PEF study, all of the specified default EF impact categories and associated specified EF impact assessment models shall be applied.\nAny exclusion shall be explicitly documented, justified, reported in the PEF report and supported by appropriate documents. The influence of any exclusion on the final results, especially related to limitations in terms of comparability with other PEF studies, shall be discussed in the interpretation phase and reported. Such exclusions are subject to review.\nPEFCRs shall specify and justify any exclusion of the default EF impact categories, especially those related to the aspects of comparability.\n4.5\nSelecting additional environmental information\nIf the default set of EF impact categories or the default impact assessment models do not properly cover the potential environmental impacts of the product being evaluated, all related relevant (qualitative/quantitative) environmental aspects shall be additionally included under “additional environmental information”. These shall, however, not substitute the mandatory assessment models of the default EF impact categories. The supporting models of these additional categories shall be clearly referenced and documented with the corresponding indicators.\nAdditional environmental information shall be:\n—\nBased on information that is substantiated and has been reviewed or verified, in accordance with the requirements of ISO 14020 and Clause 5 of ISO 14021:1999;\n—\nSpecific, accurate and not misleading;\n—\nRelevant to the particular product category.\nEmissions made directly into marine water shall be included in the additional environmental information (at inventory level).\nIf additional environmental information is used to support the interpretation phase of a PEF study, then all data needed to produce such information shall meet the same quality requirements established for the data used to calculate the PEF results.\nAdditional environmental information shall only be related to environmental issues. Information and instructions, e.g. product safety sheets that are not related to the environmental performance of the product, shall not be part of a PEF. Similarly, information related to legal requirements shall not be included.\nThe PEFCR shall specify and justify additional environmental information that is to be included in the PEF study. Such additional information shall be reported separately from the life-cycle based PEF results, with all methods and assumptions clearly documented. Additional environmental information may be quantitative and/or qualitative. Additional environmental information may include (non-exhaustive list):\n—\nOther relevant environmental impacts for the product category;\n—\nOther relevant technical parameters that may be used to assess the product under study and allow for comparisons with other products of the overall product-system efficiency. These technical parameters may refer to, for example, the use of renewable versus non-renewable energy, the use of renewable versus non-renewable fuels, the use of secondary materials, the use of fresh water resources, or the disposal of hazardous versus non-hazardous waste types;\n—\nOther relevant approaches for conducting characterisation of the flows from the Resource Use and Emissions Profile, when characterisation factors (CFs) in the default method are not available for certain flows (e.g. groups of chemicals);\n—\nEnvironmental indicators or product responsibility indicators (as per the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI));\n—\nLife cycle energy consumption by primary energy source, separately accounting for “renewable” energy use;\n—\nDirect energy consumption by primary energy source, separately accounting for “renewable” energy use for facility gate;\n—\nFor gate-to-gate phases, number of IUCN Red List species and national conservation list species with habitats in areas affected by operations, by level of extinction risk;\n—\nDescription of significant impacts of activities, products, and services on biodiversity in protected areas and areas of high biodiversity value outside protected areas;\n—\nTotal weight of waste by type and disposal method;\n—\nWeight of transported, imported, exported, or treated waste deemed hazardous under the terms of the Basel Convention Annexes I, II, III, and VIII, and percentage of transported waste shipped internationally.\n4.6\nAssumptions/limitations\nAll limitations and assumptions shall be transparently reported.\nThe PEFCRs shall report product category-specific limitations and define the assumptions necessary to overcome the limitations.\n5.1\nResource Use and Emissions Profile\nAll resource use and emissions associated with the life-cycle stages included in the defined system boundaries shall be included in the Resource Use and Emissions Profile. The flows shall be grouped into “elementary flows” and “non-elementary (i.e. complex) flows”. All non-elementary flows in the Resource Use and Emissions Profile shall then be transformed into elementary flows.\n5.2\nResource Use and Emissions Profile – Screening step\nIf a screening step is conducted (highly recommended), readily available specific and/or generic data shall be used fulfilling the data quality requirements as defined in section 5.6. All processes and activities to be considered in the Resource Use and Emissions Profile shall be included in the screening step. Any exclusion of supply-chain stages shall be explicitly justified and submitted to the review process, and their influence on the final results discussed.\nFor supply-chain stages for which a quantitative EF impact assessment is not intended, the screening step shall refer to existing literature and other sources in order to develop qualitative descriptions of potentially environmentally significant processes. Such qualitative descriptions shall be included in the additional environmental information.\nThe PEFCR shall specify processes to be included, as well as associated data quality and review requirements, which may exceed those of this PEF Guide. It shall also specify for which processes specific data are required, for which the use of generic data is either permissible or required.\n5.4\nResource Use and Emissions Profile - Data\nAll resource use and emissions associated with the life-cycle stages included in the defined system boundaries shall be included in the Resource Use and Emissions Profile.\nThe following elements shall be considered for inclusion in the Resource Use and Emissions Profile:\n—\nRaw material acquisition and pre-processing;\n—\nCapital goods: linear depreciation shall be used. The expected service life of the capital goods shall be taken into account (and not the time to evolve to an economic book value of 0);\n—\nProduction;\n—\nProduct distribution and storage;\n—\nUse stage;\n—\nLogistics;\n—\nEnd-of-life.\nThe PEFCRs should provide one or more examples for compiling the Resource Use and Emissions Profile, including specifications with respect to:\n—\nSubstance lists for activities/processes included;\n—\nUnits;\n—\nNomenclature for elementary flows.\nThese may apply to one or more supply-chain stages, processes, or activities, for the purpose of ensuring standardised data collection and reporting. The PEFCR may specify more stringent data requirements for key upstream, gate-to-gate or downstream stages than those defined in this PEF Guide.\nFor modelling processes/activities within the core module (i.e. gate-to-gate stage), the PEFCRs shall also specify:\n—\nProcesses/activities included;\n—\nSpecifications for compiling data for key processes, including averaging data across facilities;\n—\nAny site-specific data required for reporting as “additional environmental information”;\n—\nSpecific data quality requirements, e.g. for measuring specific activity data.\nIf the PEFCRs also require deviations from the default cradle-to-grave system boundary (e.g. if a PEFCR prescribes using cradle-to-gate boundary), the PEFCRs shall specify how material/energy balances in the Resource Use and Emissions Profile shall be accounted for.\n5.4.5\nUse stage\nWhere no method for determining the use stage of products has been established in accordance with the techniques specified in this Guide, the approach taken in determining the use stage of products shall be established by the organisation carrying out the study. The actual usage pattern may, however, differ from those recommended and should be used if this information is available. Relevant influences on other systems due to the use of the products shall be included.\nDocumentation of methods and assumptions shall be provided. All relevant assumptions for the use stage shall be documented.\nThe PEFCRs shall specify:\n—\nThe use-stage scenarios to be included in the study, if any;\n—\nThe time span to be considered for the use stage.\n5.4.6\nLogistics\nTransport parameters that shall be taken into account are: transport type, vehicle type and fuel consumption, loading rate, number of empty returns when applicable and relevant, transport distance, allocation for goods transport based on load-limiting factor (i.e. mass for high density products and volume for low density products) and fuel production.\nThe impacts due to transport shall be expressed in the default reference units, i.e. tkm for goods and person-km for passenger transport. Any deviation from these default reference units shall be reported and justified.\nThe environmental impact due to transport shall be calculated by multiplying the impact per reference unit for each of the vehicle types by a) for goods: the distance and load and b) for persons: the distance and number of persons based on the defined transport scenarios.\nThe PEFCRs shall specify transport, distribution and storage scenarios to be included in the study, if any.\n5.4.7\nEnd-of-life stage\nWaste flows arising from processes included in the system boundaries shall be modelled to the level of elementary flows.\nThe end-of-life scenarios, if any, shall be defined in the PEFCRs. These scenarios shall be based on current (year of analysis) practice, technology and data.\n5.4.8\nElectricity use\nFor electricity from the grid consumed upstream or within the defined PEF boundary, supplier-specific data shall be used if available. If supplier-specific data is not available, country-specific consumption-mix data shall be used of the country in which the life cycle stages occur. For electricity consumed during the use stage of products, the energy mix shall reflect ratios of sales between countries or regions. Where such data are not available, the average EU consumption mix, or otherwise most representative mix, shall be used.\nIt shall be guaranteed that the renewable electricity (and associated impacts) from the grid consumed upstream or within the defined PEF boundary is not double counted. A statement of the supplier shall be included as an annexto the PEF report, guaranteeing that the electricity supplied is effectively generated using renewable sources and is not sold to any other organisation.\n5.4.9\nBiogenic carbon removals and emissions\nRemovals and emissions of biogenic carbon sources shall be kept separated in the Resource Use and Emissions Profile.\n5.4.9\nDirect and indirect land use change (impact for climate change)\nGreenhouse gas emissions from direct land use change shall be allocated to products for (i) 20 years after the land use change occurs or (ii) a single harvest period from the extraction of the evaluated product (even if longer than 20 years) and the longest period shall be chosen. For details, see Annex VI. Greenhouse gas emissions from indirect land use change shall not be considered unless PEFCRs explicitly require to do so. In that case, indirect land use change shall be reported separately as Additional Environmental Information, but it shall not be included in the calculation of the greenhouse gas impact category.\n5.4.9\nRenewable energy generation\nCredits associated with renewable energy generated by the system boundary shall be calculated with respect to the corrected (i.e. by subtracting the externally provided amount of renewable energy) average, country-level consumption mix of the country to which the energy is provided. Where such data is not available, the corrected average EU consumption mix, or otherwise most representative mix shall be used. If no data are available on the calculation of corrected mixes, the uncorrected average mixes shall be used. It shall be transparently reported which energy mixes are assumed for the calculation of the benefits and whether or not these have been corrected.\n5.4.9\nTemporary (carbon) storage and delayed emissions\nCredits associated with temporary (carbon) storage or delayed emissions shall not be considered in the calculation of the default EF impact categories. However, these may be included as “additional environmental information”. Moreover, these shall be included under “additional environmental information” if specified in a supporting PEFCR.\n5.5\nNomenclature\nAll relevant resource use and emissions associated with the life-cycle stages included in the defined system boundaries shall be documented using the International Reference Life Cycle Data System (ILCD) nomenclature and properties, as described in Annex IV. If nomenclatureand properties for a given flow are not available in the ILCD, the practitioner shall create an appropriate nomenclature and document the flow properties.\n5.6\nData Quality requirements\nData quality requirements shall be met by PEF studies intended for external communication, i.e. B2B and B2C. For PEF studies (claiming to be in line with this Guide) intended for in-house applications, the specified data quality requirements should be met (i.e. are recommended), but are not mandatory. Any deviations from the requirements shall be documented. Data quality requirements apply to both specific and generic data.\nThe following six criteria shall be adopted for a semi-quantitative assessment of data quality in PEF studies: technological representativeness, geographical representativeness, time-related representativeness, completeness, parameter uncertainty and methodological appropriateness and consistency.\nIn the optional screening step a minimum “fair” quality data rating is required for data contributing to at least 90 % of the impact estimated for each EF impact category, as assessed via a qualitative expert judgement.\nIn the final Resource Use and Emissions Profile, for the processes or activities accounting for at least 70 % of contributions to each EF impact category, both specific and generic data shall achieve at least an overall “good quality” level. A semi-quantitative assessment of data quality shall be performed and reported for these processes. At least 2/3 of the remaining 30 % (i.e. 20 % to 30 %) shall be modelled with at least “fair quality” data. Data of less than fair quality rating shall not account for more than 10 % contributions to each EF impact category.\nThe data quality requirements for technological, geographical and time-related representativeness shall be subject to review as part of the PEF study. The data quality requirements related to completeness, methodological appropriateness and consistency, and parameter uncertainty should be met by sourcing generic data exclusively from data sources that comply with the requirements of the PEF Guide.\nWith respect to the data quality criterion of “methodological appropriateness and consistency”, the requirements as defined in Table 6 shall apply until the end of 2015. From 2016, full compliance with the PEF methodology will be required.\nThe data quality assessment of generic data shall be conducted at the level of the input flows (e.g. purchased paper used in a printing office) while the data quality assessment of specific data shall be conducted at the level of an individual process or aggregated process, or at the level of individual input flows.\nPEFCRs shall provide further guidance on data-quality assessment scoring for the considered product category with respect to time, geographical and technological representativeness, e.g. it shall specify which data quality score related to time representativeness should be assigned to a dataset representing a given year.\nPEFCRs may specify additional criteria for the assessment of data quality (compared to default criteria).\nPEFCRs may specify more stringent data quality requirements, if appropriate for the product category considered. These may include:\n—\nGate-to-gate activities/processes;\n—\nUpstream or downstream phases;\n—\nKey supply-chain activities for the product category;\n—\nKey EF impact categories for the product category.\n5.7\nSpecific data collection\nSpecific data shall be obtained for all foreground processes and for background processes, where appropriate. However, if generic data are more representative or appropriate than specific data for foreground processes (to be reported and justified), generic data shall also be used for the foreground processes. It should be noted that emission factors may be derived from generic data subject to data quality requirements.\nPEFCRs shall:\n1.\nSpecify for which processes specific data shall be collected.\n2.\nSpecify the requirements for collection of specific data.\n3.\nDefine the data collection requirements for the following aspects for each site:\n—\nTarget stage(s) and the data collection coverage;\n—\nLocation of data collection (domestically, internationally, representative factories, and so on);\n—\nTerm of data collection (year, season, month, etc.);\n—\nWhen the location or term of data collection must be limited to a certain range, provide a justification and show that the collected data will serve as sufficient samples.\n5.8\nGeneric data collection\nWhen available, sector-specific generic data shall be used instead of multi-sector generic data.\nAll generic data shall fulfil the data quality requirements specified in this document.\nThe sources of the data used shall be clearly documented and reported in the PEF report.\nGeneric data (provided they fulfil the data quality requirements specified in this PEF Guide) should, where available, be sourced from:\n—\nData developed in line with the requirements of the relevant PEFCRs;\n—\nData developed in line with the requirements for PEF studies;\n—\nInternational Reference Life Cycle Data System (ILCD) Data Network (giving preference to datasets that are fully compliant with the ILCD Data Network over those that are only entry-level compliant);\n—\nELCD database.\nThe PEFCR shall specify:\n—\nWhere the use of generic data is permitted as an approximation for a substance for which specific data is not available;\n—\nThe level of required similarities between the actual substance and the generic substance;\n—\nThe combination of more than one generic dataset, if necessary.\n5.9\nDealing with Data Gaps\nAny data gaps shall be filled using best available generic or extrapolated data. The contribution of such data (including gaps in generic data) shall not account for more than 10 % of the overall contribution to each EF impact category considered. This is reflected in the data quality requirements, according to which 10 % of the data can be chosen from the best available data (without any further data quality requirements).\nThe PEFCR shall specify potential data gaps and provide detailed guidance for filling these gaps.\n5.10\nHandling Multi functionality\nThe following PEF multi-functionality decision hierarchy shall be applied for resolving all multi-functionality problems: (1) subdivision or system expansion; (2) allocation based on a relevant underlying physical relationship (including direct substitution, or some relevant underlying physical relationship); (3) allocation based on some other relationship (including indirect substitution, or some other relevant underlying relationship).\nAll choices made in this context shall be reported and justified with respect to the overarching goal of ensuring physically representative, environmentally relevant results. For multi-functionality of products in recycling or energy recovery situations, the equation described in Annex V shall be applied. The above decision hierarchy also applies for end-of-life multi-functionality.\nThe PEFCR shall further specify multi-functionality solutions for application within the defined system boundaries and, where appropriate, for upstream and downstream stages. If feasible/appropriate, then PEFCR may further provide specific factors to be used in the case of allocation solutions. All such multi-functionality solutions specified in the PEFCR must be clearly justified with reference to the PEF multi-functionality solution hierarchy.\nWhere sub-division is applied, the PEFCR shall specify which processes are to be sub-divided and the principles that such subdivision should adhere to.\nWhere allocation by physical relationship is applied, the PEFCR shall specify the relevant underlying physical relationships to be considered, and establish the relevant allocation factors.\nWhere allocation by some other relationship is applied, the PEFCR shall specify the relationship and establish the relevant allocation factors. For example, in the case of economic allocation, the PEFCR shall specify the rules for determining the economic values of co-products.\nFor multi-functionality in end-of-life situations, the PEFCR shall specify how to calculate the different parts within the mandatory formula provided.\n6.1\nEnvironmental Footprint Impact Assessment\nEF impact assessment shall include a classification and characterisation of the Product Environmental Footprint flows.\n6.1.1\nClassification\nAll inputs/outputs inventoried during the compilation of the Resource Use and Emissions Profile shall be assigned to the EF impact categories to which they contribute (“classification”) using the classification data available at: http://lct.jrc.ec.europa.eu/assessment/projects.\nAs part of the classification of the Resource Use and Emissions Profile, data should be expressed in terms of constituent substances for which characterisation factors are available.\n6.1.2\nCharacterisation\nAll classified inputs/outputs in each EF impact category shall be assigned characterisation factors representing the contribution per input/output unit to the category, using the specified characterisation factors, available at http://lct.jrc.ec.europa.eu/assessment/projects\nEF impact assessment results shall subsequently be calculated for each EF impact category by multiplying the amount of each input/output by its characterisation factor and summing contributions of all inputs/outputs within each category in order to obtain a single measure expressed in terms of an appropriate reference unit.\nIf characterisation factors (CFs) from the default method are not available for certain flows (e.g. a group of chemicals) of the Resource Use and Emissions Profile, then other approaches may be used for characterising these flows. In such circumstances, this shall be reported under “additional environmental information”. The characterisation models shall be scientifically and technically valid, and based upon distinct, identifiable environmental mechanisms or reproducible empirical observations.\n6.2.1\nNormalisation (if applied)\nNormalisation is not a required, but recommended step for PEF studies. If normalisation is applied, the methods and results shall be reported under “additional environmental information”, with all methods and assumption documented.\nNormalised results shall not be aggregated as this implicitly applies weighting. Results from the EF impact assessment prior to normalisation shall be reported alongside the normalised results.\n6.2.2\nWeighting (if applied)\nWeighting is not a required, but optional step for PEF studies. If weighting is applied, the methods and results shall be reported under “additional environmental information”. Results of the EF impact assessment prior to weighting shall be reported alongside weighted results.\nThe application of normalisation and weighting steps in PEF studies shall be consistent with the defined goals and scope of the study, including the intended applications.\n7.1\nInterpretation of results\nThe interpretation phase shall include the following steps: “assessment of the robustness of the PEF model”, “identification of hotspots”, “estimation of uncertainty” and “conclusions, limitations and recommendations”.\n7.2\nModel robustness\nThe assessment of the PEF model robustness shall include an assessment of the extent to which methodological choices influence the results. These choices shall correspond to the requirements specified in this PEF Guide and shall be appropriate to the context. Tools that should be used to assess the robustness of the PEF model are completeness checks, sensitivity checks and consistency checks.\n7.3\nIdentification of Hotspots\nPEF results shall be evaluated to assess the effect of supply-chain hotspots/weak points at the level of the inputs/outputs-, processes-, and supply-chain stages and to assess potential improvements.\nThe PEFCR shall identify the most relevant EF impact categories for the sector. Normalisation and weighting may be used to achieve such prioritisation.\n7.4\nEstimation of Uncertainty\nAt least a qualitative description of the uncertainties of the final PEF results shall be provided for both choice-related uncertainties and uncertainties of inventory data, which gives an overall appreciation of the uncertainties of the PEF study results.\nThe PEFCR shall describe the uncertainties common to the product category and should identify the range in which results could be seen as not being significantly different in comparisons or comparative assertions.\n7.5\nConclusions, Recommendations, and Limitations\nConclusions, recommendations and limitations shall be described in accordance with the defined goals and scope of the PEF study. PEF studies intended to support comparative assertions to be disclosed to the public (i.e. claims about the environmental superiority or equivalence of product compared to other product) shall be based both on this PEF Guide and related PEFCRs.\nConclusions derived from the PEF study should include a summary of identified supply chain “hotspots” and the potential improvements associated with management interventions.\n8.2\nReporting\nAny PEF study intended for external communications shall include a PEF study report, which shall provide a robust basis for assessing, tracking, and seeking to improve the environmental performance of the product over time. The PEF study report shall include, at a minimum, a Summary, a Main Report and an Annex. These shall contain all the elements specified in this chapter. Any additional supporting information may also be included, for example a Confidential Report.\nPEFCRs shall specify and justify any deviations from the default reporting requirements presented in chapter 8, as well as specify and justify any additional reporting requirements and/or differentiate reporting requirements depending on, for example, the type of applications of the PEF study and the type of product being assessed. The PEFCRs shall specify whether the PEF results shall be reported separately for each of the selected life cycle stages.\n9.1\nReview\nAny PEF study intended for internal communication claiming to be in line with the PEF Guide and any PEF study for external communication (e.g. B2B and B2C) shall be critically reviewed in order to assure that:\n—\nThe methods used to carry out the PEF study are consistent with this PEF Guide;\n—\nThe methods used to carry out the PEF study are scientifically and technically valid;\n—\nThe data used are appropriate, reasonable and meet the defined data quality requirements;\n—\nThe interpretation of results reflects the limitations identified;\n—\nThe study report is transparent, accurate and consistent.\n9.2\nReview type\nUnless otherwise specified in relevant policy instruments, any PEF study intended for external communication (e.g. B2B and B2C) shall be critically reviewed by at least one independent and qualified external reviewer (or reviewteam.) A PEF study intended to support a comparative assertion to be disclosed to the public shall be based on relevant PEFCRs and critically reviewed by an independent panel of three qualified external reviewers. Any PEF study intended for internal communication claiming to be in line with the PEF Guide shall be critically reviewed by at least one independent and qualified external reviewer (or review team).\nThe PEFCR shall specify the review requirements for PEF studies intended to be used for comparative assertions to be disclosed to the public (e.g. whether a review by at least 3 independent qualified external reviewers is sufficient).\n9.3\nReviewer Qualifications\nA critical review of the PEF study shall be conducted as per the requirements of the intended application. Unless otherwise specified, the minimum necessary score to qualify as a reviewer or a review team is six points, including at least one point for each of the three mandatory criteria (i.e. verification and audit practice, LCA methodology and practice, and knowledge of technologies or other activities relevant to the PEF study). Score points per criteria shall be achieved by individuals, while score points may be summed across criteria at the team level. Reviewers or review teams shall provide a self-declaration of their qualifications, stating how many points they achieved for each criterion and the total points achieved. This self-declaration shall form part of the PEF Report.\n(INFORMATIVE)\nAnnex II\nData Management Plan (adapted from GHG Protocol Initiative\n (115))\nIf a data management plan is developed, the following steps should be undertaken and documented.\n1.\nEstablish a product accounting quality person/team\n. This person/team should be responsible for implementing and maintaining the data management plan, continually improving the quality of product inventories, and coordinating internal data exchanges and any external interactions (such as with relevant product accounting programs and reviewers).\n2.\nDevelop Data Management Plan and Checklist\n. Development of the data management plan should begin before any data is collected to ensure that all relevant information about the inventory is documented as it proceeds. The plan should evolve over time as data collection and processes are refined. In the plan, the quality criteria and any evaluation/scoring systems are to be defined. The data management plan checklist outlines what components should be included in a data management plan and can be used as a guide for creating a plan or for pulling together existing documents to constitute the plan.\n3.\nPerform data quality checks\n. Checks should be applied to all aspects of the inventory process, focusing on data quality, data handling, documentation, and calculation procedures. The defined quality criteria and scoring systems form the basis for the data quality checks.\n4.\nReview of organisation inventory and reports\n. Selected independent external reviewers should review the study – ideally from the beginning.\n5.\nEstablish formal feedback loops to improve data collection, handling and documentation processes\n. Feedback loops are needed to improve the quality of the organisation inventory over time and to correct any errors or inconsistencies identified in the review process.\n6.\nEstablish reporting, documentation and archiving procedures\n. Establish record-keeping processes for which and how data should be stored, how they should be stored, what information should be reported as part of internal and external inventory reports, and what should be documented to support data collection and calculation methodologies. The process may also involve aligning or developing relevant database systems for record keeping.\nThe data management plan is likely to be an evolving document that is updated as data sources change, data handling procedures are refined, calculation methodologies improve, organisation inventory responsibilities change within an organisation, or the business objectives of the organisation inventory change.\n(INFORMATIVE)\nAnnex III\nData collection checklist\nA data collection template is useful for organising data collection activities and results while compiling the Resource Use and Emissions Profile. The following non-exhaustive checklist may be used as a starting point for data collection and organisation of a data collection template.\nKey elements for data collection include:\n—\nIntroduction to the PEF study, including an overview of the objectives of data collection and the template/questionnaire employed;\n—\nInformation on the entity(ies) or person(s) responsible for measurement and data collection procedures;\n—\nDescription of the site where data is to be collected (for example, maximum and normal operation capacity, annual productive output, location, number of employees, etc.);\n—\nData sources and data quality rating;\n—\nDate/year of data collection;\n—\nDescription of the product (and unit of analysis);\n—\nProduct system description and system boundary;\n—\nIndividual process-stage diagram;\n—\nInput and output per reference flow per unit.\nExample: simplified data collection template\nTechnical overview\nProcess overview diagram for the production stage at a T-shirt company\nList of processes within the system boundary: fibre production, spinning, twisting, texturising, weaving, pre-treatment, dyeing, printing, coating, finishing.\nCollection of unit process - Resource Use and Emissions Profile data\nProcess name: finishing process\nProcess diagram: finishing refers to processes performed on yarn or fabric after weaving or knitting to improve the look and performance of the finished textile product\nFigure\nProcess diagram – finishing process\nInput\nCode\nName\nAmount\nUnit\nOutput (Per reference flow)\nCode\nName\nAmount\nUnit\nTable 10\nExample of Resource Use and Emissions Profile\n (116)\nParameter\nUnit/kg\nAmount\nEnergy consumption (non-elementary)\nMJ\n115,5\nElectricity (elementary)\nMJ\n34,6\nFossil Fuel (elementary)\nMJ\n76\nOthers (non-elementary)\nMJ\n4,9\nNon-renewable resources (non-elementary)\nkg\n2,7\nNatural gas (elementary)\nkg\n0,59\nNatural gas, feedstock (elementary)\nkg\n0,16\nCrude oil (elementary)\nkg\n0,57\nCrude oil, feedstock (elementary)\nkg\n0,48\nCoal (elementary)\nkg\n0,66\nCoal, feedstock (elementary)\nkg\n0,21\nLPG (elementary)\nkg\n0,02\nHydro power (MJel) (elementary)\nMJ\n5,2\nWater (elementary)\nkg\n12 400\nEmissions to air (elementary flows)\nCO2\ng\n5,132\nCH4\ng\n8,2\nSO2\ng\n3,9\nNox\ng\n26,8\nCH\ng\n25,8\nCO\ng\n28\nEmission to water (elementary flows)\nCOD Mn\ng\n13,3\nBOD\ng\n5,7\nTot-P\ng\n0,052\nTot-N\ng\n0,002\nAnnex IV\nIdentifying Appropriate Nomenclature and Properties for Specific Flows\nThe principal target audience for this Annex are experienced Environmental Footprint practitioners and reviewers.\nThis Annex is based on the “International Reference Life Cycle Data System (ILCD) Handbook - Nomenclature and other conventions” (European Communities, JRC–IES, 2010). If further information and background is required on nomenclature and naming conventions, please refer to the aforementioned document, which is available at: http://lct.jrc.ec.europa.eu/.\nDifferent groups often use considerably different nomenclature and other conventions. As a consequence, Resource Use and Emissions Profiles (for Life Cycle Assessment practitioners: Life Cycle Inventory (LCI) datasets) are incompatible on different levels, thereby strongly limiting the combined use of Resource Use and Emissions Profiles datasets from different sources or an efficient, electronic exchange of data among practitioners. This situation also hampers a clear, unambiguous and efficient understanding and review of EF and LCA study reports.\nThe purpose of this Annex is to support data collection, documentation and use for Resource Use and Emissions Profiles and LCIs in EF and LCA studies by providing a common nomenclature and provisions on related topics. The document also forms the basis for a common reference elementary flow list for use in both EF and LCA activities.\nThis supports efficient EF, LCA and data exchange among different tools and databases.\nThe goal is to guide data collection, naming, and documentation in such a way that the data:\n—\nAre meaningful, precise and useful for further EF impact assessments, interpretation and reporting;\n—\nCan be compiled and provided in a cost-efficient way;\n—\nAre comprehensive and do not overlap;\n—\nCan be efficiently exchanged among practitioners who have different databases and software systems, thereby reducing the likelihood of errors.\nThis nomenclature and other conventions focus on elementary flows, flow properties and the related units, and give suggestions for the naming of process datasets, product and waste flows, for better compatibility among different database systems. Basic recommendations and requirements are also given on the classification of source and contact datasets. Table 11 lists the ILCD Handbook rules that are required in PEF studies. Table 12 specifies the rule-category and the relevant chapters of the ILCD Handbook.\nTable 11\nRequired rules for each flow type\nItems\nRequired Rules from the ILCD - Nomenclature\n(see Table 14)\nRaw material, Input\n2, 4, 5\nEmission, output\n2, 4, 9\nProduct flow\n10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17\nTable 12\nNomenclature Rules\nRule #\nRule Category\nChapter section in ILCD Handbook - Nomenclature and other conventions\n2\n\"Elementary flow categories\" by issuing/receiving environmental compartment\nChapter section 2.1.1\n4\nFurther differentiation of issuing/receiving environmental compartments\nChapter section 2.1.2\n5\nAdditional, non-identifying classification of \"Resources from ground\" elementary flows\nChapter section 2.1.3.1\n9\nRecommended for both technical and non-technical target audience: additional, non-identifying classification of emissions\nChapter section 2.1.3.2\n10\nTop-level classification of Product flows, Waste flows, and Processes\nChapter section 2.2\n11\nSecond-level classifications of Product flows, Waste flows, and Processes (for preceding top-level classification)\nChapter section 2.2\n13\n“Base name” field\nChapter section 3.2\n14\n“Treatment, standards, routes” name field\nChapter section 3.2\n15\n“Mix type and location type” name field\nChapter section 3.2\n16\n“Quantitative flow properties” name field\nChapter section 3.2\n17\nNaming convention of flows and processes\nChapter section 3.2\nExample of Identifying Appropriate Nomenclature and Properties for Specific Flows\nRaw material, Input: Crude oil (Rules 2, 4, 5)\n(1)\nSpecify \"elementary flow category\" by the issuing / receiving environmental compartment:\nExample: Resources - Resources from ground\n(2)\nFurther differentiation of issuing / receiving environmental compartments\nExample: Non-renewable energy resources from ground\n(3)\nAdditional, non-identifying classification for \"Resources from ground\" elementary flows\nExample: Non-renewable energy resources from ground (e.g. \"Crude oil; 42.3 MJ/kg net calorific value\")\nFlow dataset: Crude oil: 42.3 MJ/kg net calorific value\nEmission, output: Example: Carbon Dioxide (Rules 2, 4, 9)\n(1)\nSpecify \"elementary flow categories\" by issuing / receiving environmental compartment:\nExample: Emissions – Emissions to air - Emissions to air, unspecified\n(2)\nFurther differentiation of issuing / receiving environmental compartments\nExample: “Emission to air, DE”\n(3)\nAdditional, non-identifying classification of emissions\nExample: Inorganic covalent compounds (e.g. \"Carbon dioxide, fossil\", \"Carbon monoxide\", \"Sulphur dioxide\", \"Ammonia\", etc.)\nProduct flow: Example: T-shirt (Rules 10-17)\n(1)\nTop-level classification for Product flows, Waste flows, and Processes:\nExample: “System”\n(2)\nsecond-level classifications for Product flows, Waste flows, and Processes (for preceding top-level classification):\nExample: “Textiles, furniture and other interiors”\n(3)\n“Base name” field:\nExample: “Base Name: White polyester T-shirt”\n(4)\n“Treatment, standards, routes” name field:\nExample:“ ”\n(5)\n“Mix type and location type” name field:\n“Production mix, at point of sale”\n(6)\n“Quantitative flow properties” name field:\nExample: “160 grammes polyester”\n(7)\nnaming convention of flows and processes.\n<“Base name”; “Treatment, standards, routes”; “Mix type and location type”; “Quantitative flow properties”>.\nExample: “White polyester T-shirt; product mix at point of sale; 160 grammes polyester”\nAnnex V\nDealing with Multi-functionality in Recycling Situations\nDealing with multi-functionality of products is particularly challenging when reuse, recycling or energy recovery of one (or more) of these products is involved as the systems tend to get rather complex.\nThe overall resulting Resource Use and Emissions Profile (RUaEP) per unit of analysis can be estimated using the formula provided below, which:\n—\nis applicable for both open-loop (117) and closed-loop (118) recycling;\n—\nif relevant/applicable, and can accommodate re-use of the product being assessed. This is modelled in the same manner as recycling;\n—\nif relevant/applicable, can accommodate downcycling, i.e. any differences in quality between the secondary material (i.e. recycled or reused material) and the primary material (i.e. virgin material);\n—\nif relevant/applicable, can accommodate energy recovery;\n—\nallocates the impacts and benefits due to recycling equally between the producer using recycled material and the producer producing a recycled product: 50/50 allocation split (119).\nThe quantitative figures for the relevant parameters involved need to be gathered in order to use the formula provided below to estimate overall RUaEP per unit of analysis. Whenever feasible, these should be determined based on data associated with the actual processes involved. However, this may not always be possible / feasible and data may have to be found elsewhere (please notice that the explanation provided hereafter for each term of the formula contains a recommendation on how/where to find missing data).\nThe RUaEP per unit of analysis (120) is calculated with the following formula:\nThe abovementioned formula can be divided into 5 blocks:\nThese are interpreted as follows (the different parameters are explained in detail hereafter):\n—\nrepresents the RUaEP from virgin material acquisition and pre-processing.\n—\nrepresents the RUaEP associated to the recycled material input and is proportional to the fraction of material input that has been recycled in a previous system.\n—\nrepresents the RUaEP from the recycling (or re-use) process from which the credit from avoided virgin material input (accounting for any eventual downcycling) are subtracted.\n—\nrepresents the RUaEP arising from the energy recovery process from which the avoided emissions arising from the substituted energy source have been subtracted.\n—\nrepresents the net RUaEP from the disposal of the fraction of material that has not been recycled (or re-used) at End-of-Life or handed over to an energy recovery process.\nWhere:\n—   EV= specific emissions and resources consumed (per unit of analysis) arising from the acquisition and pre-processing of virgin material. If this information is not available, generic data should be used which should be sourced according to the sources of generic data listed in section 5.8.\n—   E*V= specific emissions and resources consumed (per unit of analysis) arising from the acquisition and pre-processing of virgin material assumed to be substituted by recyclable materials:\nIf only closed-loop recycling takes place: E*V = EV\nIf only open-loop recycling takes place: E*V = E’V represents the input of virgin material that refers to the actual virgin material substituted through open-loop recycling. If this information is not available, assumptions should be made as to what virgin material is substituted, or average data should be used which should be sourced according to the sources of generic data listed in section 5.8. If no other relevant information is available it could be assumed that E’V = EV, as if closed-loop recycling had taken place.\n—   Erecycled= specific emissions and resources consumed (per unit of analysis) arising from the recycling process of the recycled (or reused) material, including collection, sorting and transportation processes. If this information is not available, generic data should be used which should be sourced according to the sources of generic data listed in section 5.8.\n—   ErecyclingEoL= specific emissions and resources consumed (per unit of analysis) arising from the recycling process at the end-of-life stage, including collection, sorting and transportation processes. If this information is not available, generic data should be used which should be sourced according to the sources of generic data listed in section 5.8.\nNote: in closed loop recycling situations Erecycled = ErecyclingEoL and E*V = EV\n—   ED= specific emissions and resources consumed (per unit of analysis) arising from disposal of waste material at the EoL of the analysed product (e.g. landfilling, incineration, pyrolysis). If this information is not available, generic data should be used which should be sourced according to the sources of generic data listed in section 5.8.\n—   E*D= specific emissions and resources consumed (per unit of analysis) arising from disposal of waste material (e.g. landfilling, incineration, pyrolysis) at the EoL of the material where the recycled content is taken from. If this information is not available, generic data should be used which should be sourced according to the sources of generic data listed in section 5.8.\nIf only closed-loop recycling takes place: E*D = ED\nIf only open-loop recycling takes place: E*D = E’D represents the disposal of the material where the recycled content is taken from. If this information is not available, assumptions should be made as how this material would have been disposed if it was not recycled. If no relevant information is available it could be assumed that E’D = ED, as if closed-loop recycling had taken place.\n—   EER= specific emissions and resources consumed (per unit of analysis) arising from the energy recovery process. If this information is not available, generic data should be used which should be sourced according to the sources of generic data listed in section 5.8.\n—   ESE,heat and ESE,elec= specific emissions and resources consumed (per unit of analysis) that would have arisen from the specific substituted energy source, heat and electricity respectively. If this information is not available, generic data should be used which should be sourced according to the sources of generic data listed in section 5.8.\n—   R1 [dimensionless]= “recycled (or reused) content of material”, is the proportion of material in the input to the production that has been recycled in a previous system (0=<R1<=1). If this information is not available, comprehensive and regularly updated statistical information on recycling rates and other relevant parameters can be obtained from suppliers such as Eurostat (121).\n—   R2 [dimensionless]= “recycling (or reuse) fraction of material”, is the proportion of the material in the product that will be recycled (or reused) in a subsequent system. R2 shall therefore take into account the inefficiencies in the collection and recycling (or reuse) processes (0=<R2=<1). If this information is not available, comprehensive and regularly updated statistical information on recycling rates and other relevant parameters can be obtained from suppliers such as Eurostat (122).\n—   R3 [dimensionless]= the proportion of material in the product that is used for energy recovery (e.g. incineration with energy recovery) at EoL (0=<R3=<1). If this information is not available, comprehensive and regularly updated statistical information on recycling rates and other relevant parameters can be obtained from suppliers such as Eurostat.\n—   LHV= Lower Heating Value [e.g. J/kg] of the material in the product that is used for energy recovery. This should be determined with an appropriate laboratory method. If this is not possible or feasible, generic data should be used (see, for example, the “ELCD Reference elementary flows” (123), and the ELCD database under EoL treatment / Energy recycling (124))\n—   XER,heat and XER,elec [dimensionless]= the efficiency of the energy recovery process (0<XER<1) for both heat and electricity, i.e. the ratio between the energy content of output (e.g. output of heat or electricity) and the energy content of the material in the product that is used for energy recovery. XER shall therefore take into account the inefficiencies of the energy recovery process (0=<XER<1). If this information is not available, generic data should be used (see, for example, EoL treatment / Energy recycling in the ELCD database).\n—   Qs= quality of the secondary material, i.e. the quality of the recycled or reused material (see note below).\n—   Qp= quality of the primary material, i.e. the quality of the virgin material (see note below).\nNote: Qs/Qp is a dimensionless ratio taken as an approximation for any differences in quality between the secondary material and the primary material (“downcycling”). Following the EF multi-functionality hierarchy (see section 5.10), the possibility of identifying a relevant, underlying physical relationship as a basis for the quality correction ratio will be assessed (the limiting factor shall be determining). If this is not possible, some other relationship shall be used, for example, economic value. In this case, the prices of primary versus secondary materials are assumed to serve as a proxy for quality. In such a situation, Qs/Qp would correspond to the ratio between the market price of the secondary material (Qs) and the market price of the primary material (Qp). Market prices of primary and secondary materials can be found in online sources (125). The quality aspects to be considered for the primary and secondary material shall be specified in the PEFCR.\nAnnex VI\nGuidance on accounting for Direct Land Use Change emissions relevant for climate change\nThis Annex gives guidance on the accounting of greenhouse gas emissions related to direct land use change contributing to climate change.\nThe impact on climate is a result of biogenic CO2 emissions and removals caused by carbon stock changes, and biogenic and non-biogenic CO2, N2O and CH4 emissions (e.g. biomass burning). Biogenic emissions include those resulting from the burning (combustion) or degradation of biogenic materials, wastewater treatment and biological sources in soil and water (including CO2, CH4 and N2O), while biogenic removals correspond to the uptake of CO2 during photosynthesis. Non-biogenic emissions correspond to all emissions resulting from non-biogenic sources, such as fossil-based materials, while non-biogenic removals correspond to the CO2 that is removed from atmosphere by a non-biogenic source (WRI and WBCSD 2011b).\nChanges in land use might be classified as being direct or indirect:\nDirect Land Use Changes (dLUC) occur as the result of a transformation from one land use type into another, which takes place in a unique land cover, possibly incurring changes in the carbon stock of that specific land, but not leading to a change in another system.\nIndirect Land Use Changes (iLUC) occur when a certain transformation in land use induces changes outside the system boundaries, i.e. in other land use types.\nFigure 6 shows the schematic representation of both direct and indirect land use changes related to biofuel production.\nFigure 6\nSchematic representation of direct and indirect land use changes [adapted from (CE Delft 2010)]\nThe remaining of this annex focuses on direct land use changes as the PEF does only require to consider this and does not allow to consider indirect land use (see section 5.4.4)\nSECTION 1:   REFERENCES FOR THE CALCULATIONS OF DIRECT LAND USE CHANGE EMISSIONS\nThe Commission Decision C(2010)3751 provides guidelines for the calculation of land carbon stocks for the reference land use and the actual land use. The Decision provides values for carbon stock for four different land use categories: cropland and perennial crops, grassland and forest land. For land use changes in these categories, the Commission Decision C(2010)3751 guidelines shall be followed. However, for emissions from the conversion to other land use categories such as wetlands, settlements and other land uses (e.g. bare soil, rock and ice), not included in the Decision, the IPCC 2006 Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories (IPCC, 2006) shall be followed.\nFor the release and uptake of CO2 caused by direct land use change, the use of the most recent IPCC CO2 emission factors shall be used as referred to in the Commission Decision C(2010)3751, unless more accurate, specific data are available. Other emissions as a result of land use change (e.g. NO3 losses to water, emissions from biomass burning, soil erosion, etc.) should be measured or modelled for the particular case or using authoritative sources.\nSECTION 2:   PRACTICAL GUIDANCE ACCORDING TO PAS 2050:2011\nFor practical guidance on specific issues (e.g. in case previous land use is unknown), the application of PAS 2050:2011 (BSI 2011) is recommended (in coherence with the European Food Sustainable Consumption and Production Roundtable (Food SCP) and the published ENVIFOOD Protocol). The PAS 2050:2011 is supplemented by the PAS2050-1 (BSI 2012), for the assessment GHG emissions from the cradle-to-gate (from raw material extraction to manufacturing) stages of the life cycle of horticultural products. PAS 2050-1:2012 takes into account the emissions and removals involved in the cultivation of a horticultural crop product and supplements (not substitutes) PAS 2050:2011. A supplementary excel file is also provided by the British Standard Institution (BSI) for the PAS 2050-1:2012 calculations.\nPrevious LU category and production location\nFollowing PAS 2050:2011 (BSI 2011), three distinct situations (and respective guidelines) can be identified, depending on the availability of information about the location of production and the previous land use category:\n—\n“Country of production and previous LU are known: GHG emissions from LUC from a previous land use into the current one might be found in Annex C, from the PAS 2050:2011 (BSI 2011). For the emissions not listed in Annex C, the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories should be used” (BSI 2011).\n—\n“Country of production is known and previous LU is unknown: GHG emissions shall be the estimate of LUC average emissions for that crop in that country” (BSI 2011).\n—\n“Country of production and previous LU are unknown: GHG emissions shall be the weighted average LUC emissions of that specific commodity in the countries in which it is grown” (BSI 2011).\nGeneral GHG emissions and removals to be included in the assessment\nFollowing PAS 2050:2011 (BSI 2011) the emissions and removals to be included in the assessment are:\n—\nGases included in Annex A of the PAS 2050:2011 (BSI 2011);\nOBS: Some exceptions may apply for biogenic carbon emissions and removals related to food and animal feed products. For food and feed, emissions and removals arising from biogenic sources that become part of the product may be excluded. The exclusion shall not apply to:\n—\nemissions and removals of biogenic carbon used in the production of food and feed (e.g. in burning biomass for fuel) where that biogenic carbon does not become part of the product;\n—\nnon-CO2 emissions arising from degradation of waste food and feed and enteric fermentation;\n—\nany biogenic component in material that is part of the final product but is not intended to be ingested (e.g. packaging).”(BSI 2011, page 9).\n—\nFor methane (CH4) emissions resulting from waste combustion with energy recovery, refer to 8.2.2, page 22, PAS 2050:2011.\n(INFORMATIVE)\nAnnex VII\nExample of PEFCRs for intermediate paper products - Data Quality Requirements\nThe following table provides an example of data quality requirements and related data-quality level taken from existing PEFCRs for intermediate paper products.\nTable 13\nExample of data quality requirements for intermediate paper products\n (126)\nData quality elements\nRepresentativeness\nCompleteness\nMethodological Appropriateness Compliency and Consistency\nPrecision /uncertainty\nQuality level\nQuality rating\nDefinition\nTechnological\nGeographical\nTime-related:\nExcellent\n1\nMeets the criterion to a very high degree, without need for improvement.\nE.g.

The reason for diverging from the ISO terminology is to make the PEF Guide more accessible to its target audience, which also includes groups that do not necessarily have strong background knowledge of environmental assessment. The tables below provide such a mapping of diverging terms.\nTable 14\nMapping of key terms\nTerms used in ISO 14044:2006\nCorrespondent terms used in this PEF guide\nFunctional unit\nUnit of analysis\nLife cycle inventory analysis\nResource Use and Emissions Profile\nLife cycle impact assessment\nEnvironmental footprint impact assessment\nLife cycle interpretation\nEnvironmental footprint interpretation\nImpact category\nEnvironmental footprint impact category\nImpact category indicator\nEnvironmental footprint impact category indicator\nTable 15\nMapping of data quality criteria\nTerms used in ISO 14044:2006\nCorrespondent terms used in this PEF guide\nTime-related coverage\nTime-related representativeness\nGeographical coverage\nGeographical representativeness\nTechnology coverage\nTechnological representativeness\nPrecision\nParameter uncertainty\nCompleteness\nCompleteness\nConsistency\nMethodological Appropriateness and Consistency\nSources of the data\nCovered under “Resource Use and Emissions Profile”\nUncertainty of the information\nCovered under “Parameter uncertainty”\nAnnex IX\nPEF Guide and ILCD Handbook: major deviations\nWhere there are discrepancies between the PEF Guide and the ILCD Handbook, the PEF Guide takes precedence.\nThis annex points out the most important aspects of how this PEF Guide deviates from the ILCD Handbook, and provides a concise justification for these deviations. It should be noted, however, that the ILCD Handbook provides a starting point for the PEF developments. The ILCD Handbook may be further revised to bring it into line with the PEF Guide, and redundant sections that are addressed in the PEF Guide may be removed from the ILCD Handbook.\n1.\nTarget audience(s)\nAs opposed to the ILCD Handbook, the PEF Guide is aimed at people who have limited knowledge of life cycle assessment. It is therefore written in a more accessible manner.\n2.\nCompleteness check\nThe ILCD Handbook gives two options for checking completeness (1) completeness check at the level of each environmental impact and (2) completeness check at the level of the overall (i.e. aggregated) environmental impact. The PEF Guide considers completeness only at the level of each environmental impact. In fact, as the PEF Guide does not recommend any specific set of weighting factors, the overall (i.e. aggregated) environmental impact cannot be estimated.\n3.\nExtension of the goal definition\nThe PEF Guide is meant for use in specific applications, therefore extensions of the goal definition are not foreseen.\n4.\nScope definition includes “limitations”\nThe scope definition of PEF Guide shall also include specifications of the limitations of the study. In fact, based on experience gained with the ILCD Handbook, the limitation can be properly defined only when practitioners have information regarding all aspects related to the goal definition and the function of the analysis.\n5.\nReview procedure is defined in the goal definition\nThe review procedure is essential to improve the quality of a PEF study, therefore it needs to be defined in the first step of the process, i.e. in the goal definition.\n6.\nScreening step in place of the iterative approach\nThe PEF Guide recommends that a screening step be conducted to obtain an approximate estimation of each environmental impact for the default EF impact categories. This step is similar to the iterative approach recommended in the ILCD Handbook.\n7.\nData quality rating\nThe PEF Guide makes use of five rating levels for evaluating data quality (excellent, very good, good, fair, poor), compared to the three levels used in the ILCD Handbook. This will allow for the use of data with lower data quality levels in the study compared with those required by the ILCD Handbook. Also, the PEF Guide uses a semi-quantitative formula for assessing data quality, making it easier to achieve e.g. “good” data quality.\n8.\nMulti-functionality decision hierarchy\nThe PEF Guide provides a decision hierarchy for solving the multi-functionality of products which deviates from the approach endorsed by the ILCD Handbook. The PEF Guide also provides an equation for solving multi-functionality in recycling and energy recovery situations at the end-of-life stage.\n9.\nSensitivity analysis\nCarrying out sensitivity analysis of the results is an optional step in the PEF Guide. This is expected to reduce the workload for users of the PEF Guide.\nAnnex X\nComparison of the key requirements of the PEF Guide with other methods\nAlthough similar widely accepted product environmental accounting methods and guidance documents closely align on much of the methodological guidance they provide, there are some discrepancies and/or lack of clarity on a number of important decision points, which reduces the consistency and comparability of analytical outcomes. This annex provides a summary of selected key requirements of this PEF Guide and compares these with a number of existing methods. It is based on the document “Analysis of Existing Environmental Footprint Methodologies for Products and Organizations: Recommendations, Rationale, and Alignment”, that can be accessed via http://ec.europa.eu/environment/eussd/corporate_footprint.htm.

For example, for a “cradle-to-grave” EF analysis should include all activities from the extraction of raw materials through the processing, distribution, storage, use, and disposal or recycling stages.\n(27)  Product system – collection of unit processes with elementary and product flows, performing one or more defined functions, and which models the life cycle of a product (ISO 14040:2006).\n(28)  Comparative assertions are environmental claims regarding the superiority or equivalence of one product versus a competing product that performs the same function. (ISO 14040:2006)\n(29)  A product category is a group of products that can fulfil equivalent functions (ISO 14025:2006).\n(30)  If a process or facility provides more than one function, i.e. it delivers several goods and/or services (\"co-products\"), it is “multifunctional”. In these situations, all inputs and emissions linked to the process must be partitioned between the product of interest and the other co-products in a principled manner (see section 6.10 and Annex V).\n(31)  Product Category Rules (PCR) are a set of specific rules, requirements and guidelines for developing Type III environmental declarations for one or more product categories (ISO 14025:2006).\n(32)  An environmental aspect is defined as an element of an organisation’s activities or products that has or can have an impact on the environment.\n(33)  Life cycle assessment is the compilation and evaluation of the inputs, outputs and the potential environmental impacts of a product system throughout its life cycle (ISO 14040:2006)\n(34)  Data Quality refers to the characteristics of data that relate to their ability to satisfy stated requirements (ISO 14040:2006). Data quality covers various aspects, such as technological, geographical and time-related representativeness, as well as completeness and precision of the inventory data.\n(35)  Allocation is an approach to solving multi-functionality problems.

OEF studies are produced for the overarching purpose of seeking to reduce the environmental impacts associated with organisational activities, taking into account supply chain (1) activities (from extraction of raw materials, through production and use, to final waste management). The Organisations involved include companies, public administrative entities, non-profit organisations and other bodies. OEFs are complimentary to other instruments that focus on specific sites and thresholds.\nThis document provides guidance on how to calculate an OEF, as well as how to create sector-specific methodological requirements for use in Organisation Environmental Footprint Sector Rules (OEFSRs).\nContext\nThis work relates to one of the building blocks of the Europe 2020 Strategy – “Roadmap to a Resource Efficient Europe” (2). The document proposes ways to increase resource productivity and to decouple economic growth from both resource use and environmental impacts, taking a life cycle perspective (i.e. considering extraction of raw materials, production, use, final waste management and all necessary transport in an integrated approach). One of its aims is to: “Establish a common methodological approach to enable Member States and the private sector to assess, display and benchmark the environmental performance of products, services and companies based on a comprehensive assessment of environmental impacts over the life cycle (‧environmental footprint‧)”. In 2010, the European Council amongst others invited the Commission and Member States to optimise the use of methods such as Life-Cycle Analysis (LCA) of products, taking into account work done in the context of the ILCD (International Reference Life Cycle Data System) (3). The Product and Organisation Environmental Footprint project was initiated with the aim of developing a harmonised European methodology for environmental footprint studies that can accommodate a broader suite of relevant environmental performance criteria using a life cycle approach.\nA life-cycle approach takes into consideration the spectrum of resource flows and environmental interventions associated with a product or organisation from a supply-chain perspective. It includes all stages from raw material acquisition through processing, distribution, use, and end-of-life processes, and all relevant related environmental impacts, health effects, resource-related threats, burdens to society, and trade-offs. Such an approach is essential to effective management because important environmental effects may occur “upstream” or “downstream”, and hence may not be immediately evident. This approach is also essential for making transparent any potential trade-offs between different types of environmental impacts associated with specific policy and management decisions and to help avoid unintended shifting of burdens.\nObjectives and Target Audiences\nOEF studies may be used for a variety of purposes, including: benchmarking and performance tracking; least environmental-cost sourcing (i.e. supply chain management); mitigation activities; and participation in voluntary or mandatory programmes. To the extent possible, the OEF should also be applicable within the context of Eco-management and Audit Schemes (EMAS).\nThis document aims to provide detailed and comprehensive technical guidance on how to conduct an OEF study in any sector. It is primarily aimed at technical experts such as engineers and environmental managers who are to develop an OEF study. Strong expertise in life cycle assessment is not a prerequisite to using this Guide in order to conduct an OEF study.\nThis Guide is not intended to directly support comparisons or comparative assertions (i.e. environmental claims regarding the superiority or equivalence of one organisation a competing organisation providing the same products (based on ISO 14040:2006)). This will require the development of additional OEFSRs in complement to the more general guidance in order to further increase methodological harmonisation, specificity, relevance and reproducibility for a given sector. OEFSRs will furthermore facilitate focusing on the most important parameters, thereby also reducing the time, efforts and costs involved in completing an OEF study. In addition to general guidance and requirements for OEF studies, this document also specifies the requirements for the development of OEFSRs.\nProcess and Results\nEach requirement for OEF studies specified in this Guide has been chosen taking into consideration the recommendations of similar, widely accepted organisational environmental accounting methods and guidance documents. Specifically, the methodology guides considered were ISO 14064 (2006), ISO/WD TR 14069 (working draft, 2010), the ILCD Handbook (2011), the WRI/WBCSD Greenhouse Gas Protocol (2011a), Bilan Carbone® (version 5.0), DEFRA’s Guidance on how to measure and report your greenhouse gas emissions (2009), the Carbon Disclosure project for Water (2010) and the Global Reporting Initiative - GRI (version 3.0).\nThe outcome of this analysis is summarised in Annex IX. A more detailed description of the analysed methods and of the outcome of the analysis can be found in “Analysis of Existing Environmental Footprint Methodologies for Products and Organizations: Recommendations, Rationale, and Alignment”. (4) Although these documents align closely on much of the methodological guidance they provide, it is noteworthy that discrepancies and/or lack of clarity remain on a number of important decision points, which reduces the consistency and comparability of analytical outcomes. Whereas existing methods may provide several alternatives for a given methodological decision point, the intention of this OEF Guide is to provide additional guidance and (wherever feasible) to identify a single requirement for each decision point in order to support more consistent, robust and reproducible OEF studies. Thus, comparability is given priority over flexibility.\nTo the extent possible, this OEF Guide strives to align with existing or upcoming international methodological norms, including ISO 14069 (draft) and GHG Protocol Scope 3, as well as the Product Environmental Footprint Guide. Similarly, efforts have also been made to align insofar as possible with existing environmental management schemes (EMAS and ISO 14001). It should be noted, however, that in order to provide for multi-criteria environmental assessment at the organisational level using a life-cycle approach, the OEF Guide necessarily goes beyond existing guidance documents in important aspects.\nAs elaborated before, OEFSRs are a necessary extension of and complement to the more general guidance for OEF studies provided in this document (i.e. in terms of comparability between different OEF studies). As they are developed, OEFSRs will play an important role in increasing the reproducibility, quality, consistency, and relevance of OEF studies.\nRelationship to the Product Environmental Footprint Guide\nBoth the Product Environmental Footprint (PEF) (5) and the OEF provide a life cycle approach to quantifying environmental performance. Whereas the PEF method is specific to individual goods or services, the OEF method applies to organisational activities as a whole – in other words, to all activities associated with the goods and/or services the Organisation provides from a supply-chain perspective (from extraction of raw materials, through use, to final waste management). Organisation and Product Environmental Footprinting can therefore be viewed as complementary activities, each undertaken to support specific applications.\nCalculating the OEF does not require that all individual products of the Organisation be analysed. The OEF is calculated using aggregate data representing the flows of resources and wastes that cross the defined Organisational boundary. Once the OEF is calculated, however, it may be disaggregated to the product level using appropriate allocation keys. In theory, the sum of the PEFs of the goods/services provided over a certain reporting interval (e.g. one year) by an Organisation should be equal to its OEF for the same reporting interval (6). The methodologies have been purposely developed towards this end. Moreover, the OEF can help to identify areas of the Organisation’s Product Portfolio where environmental impacts are most significant and, hence, where detailed, individual product-level analyses may be desirable.\nTerminology: Shall, Should and May\nThis Guide uses precise terminology to indicate the requirements, the recommendations and permissible options available.\nThe term “shall” is used throughout this Guide to indicate what is required in order for an OEF study to be in conformance with this Guide.\nThe term “should” is used to indicate a recommendation, but not a requirement. Any deviation from a “should” requirement must be justified and made transparent.\nThe term “may” is used to indicate an option that is permissible.\nThis page is left intentionally blank.\n1.   GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS FOR ORGANISATION ENVIRONMENTAL FOOTPRINT STUDIES\n1.1   Approach and Applications\nThe Organisation Environmental Footprint (OEF) is a multi-criteria measure of the environmental performance of a goods/services-providing Organisation from a life cycle (7) perspective. This includes companies, public administrative entities, and other bodies. This document provides guidance on how to calculate an OEF, as well as how to create sector-specific methodological requirements for use in Organisation Environmental Footprint Sector Rules (OEFSRs). OEFSRs are a necessary extension of and complement to the more general guidance for OEF studies provided in this document. As they are developed, OEFSRs will play an important role in increasing the reproducibility, consistency, and relevance of OEF studies. OEFSRs will help focus on the most important parameters, thereby also possibly reducing the time, efforts, and costs involved in completing an OEF study.\nBased on a life cycle approach, the OEF is a method for modelling and quantifying the physical environmental impacts of the flows of material/energy and resulting emissions and waste (8) streams associated with Organisational activities from a supply-chain (9) perspective (from extraction of raw materials, through use, to final waste management). A life cycle approach takes into consideration the spectrum of resource flows and environmental interventions associated with a product or organisation from a supply-chain perspective. It includes all stages of the product’s life cycle, from raw material acquisition through processing, distribution, use, and end-of-life (EOL) processes, and all relevant related associated environmental impacts, health effects, resource-related threats, burdens to society, and trade-offs. This contrasts with the approach of focusing on site-level impacts only or on single environmental impacts in order to reduce the possibility of unintended burden shifting. Such burden shifting can, for example, involve the shifting of burdens from one life cycle stage in the supply chain to another, from one impact category to another, from one organisation to another, or from one country to another. The OEF is complementary to other assessments and instruments such as site-specific environmental impact assessments or chemical risk assessments.\nThe OEF is an environmental accounting model rather than a financial accounting model. Efforts have therefore been made to minimise the need for using financial information (for example, in defining Organisational boundaries) which may be poorly representative of the physical relationships pertinent to the systems modelled.\nEach requirement specified in this OEF Guide has been chosen taking into consideration the recommendations of similar, widely accepted corporate environmental accounting methods and guidance documents. Specifically, the methodology guides considered were:\n—\nISO 14064 (2006): Greenhouse gases – Part 1 and 3;\n—\nISO/WD TR 14069 (working draft, 2010): GHG – Quantification and reporting of GHG emissions for organizations;\n—\nThe ILCD (International Reference Life Cycle Data System) Handbook (2011);\n—\nThe Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard of the Greenhouse Gas Protocol (WRI/ WBCSD) (2011a);\n—\nBilan Carbone® (version 5.0);\n—\nDEFRA - Guidance on how to measure and report our greenhouse gas emissions (2009);\n—\nThe Carbon Disclosure Project for Water (2010);\n—\nThe Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) (version 3.0).\nThe outcome of this analysis is summarised in Annex IX. A more detailed description of the analysed methods and of the outcome of the analysis can be found in “Analysis of Existing Environmental Footprint Methodologies for Products and Organizations: Recommendations, Rationale, and Alignment (10)”. Whereas existing methods may provide several alternatives for a given methodological decision point, this OEF Guide intends to provide additional guidance and to identify (wherever feasible) a single requirement for each decision point to support more consistent, robust and reproducible OEF studies.\nThe key requirements for OEF studies (elaborated in detail throughout this Guide) are slightly different depending on the application (Table 1):\n—\nIn-house applications may include support to environmental management, identification of environmental hotspots, and environmental improvement and performance tracking, and may implicitly include cost saving opportunities;\n—\nExternal applications (e.g. communication to stakeholders or Business-to-Business (B2B) communication, relationships with public authorities or investors) cover a wide range of possibilities, including responding to investors’ information requests, marketing, benchmarking, and responding to requirements posed in environmental policies at European level or at the level of the individual Member States.\nTable 1\nKey requirements for OEF studies in relation to the intended application\nIntended applications\nGoal & Scope definition\nScreening exercise\nMeeting data quality requirements\nMulti-functionality hierarchy\nChoice of impact assessment methods\nClassification & Characterisation\nNormalisation\nWeighting\nInterpretation of OEF results\nReporting elements\nCritical review (1 person)\nCritical review panel (3 persons)\nRequires OEFSR\nIn-house\n(claiming to be in line with the OEF Guide)\nM\nR\nR\nM\nM\nM\nR\nO\nM\nO\nM\nO\nO\nExternal\nWithout comparisons/comparative assertions\nM\nR\nM\nM\nM\nM\nR\nO\nM\nM\nM\nR\nR\nWith comparisons/comparative assertions\nM\nR\nM\nM\nM\nM\nR\nO\nM\nM\n/\nM\nM\n“M”\n=\nmandatory\n“R”\n=\nrecommended (not mandatory)\n“O”\n=\noptional (not mandatory)\n“/”\n=\nnot applicable\nRequirements for OEF studies\nAn Organisation Environmental Footprint (OEF) study shall be based on a life-cycle approach.\n1.2   How to Use this Guide\nThis Guide provides the information necessary to conduct an OEF study. The material in the Guide is presented in a sequential manner, in the order of the methodological phases that must be completed in calculating an OEF. Each section begins with a general description of the methodological phase, along with an overview of necessary considerations and supporting examples. “Requirements” specify the methodological norms that shall/should be satisfied in order to achieve an OEF-compliant study. These are positioned in text boxes with single solid-line borders following the general description sections. “Tips” describe non-mandatory but recommended best practices. These are positioned in shaded text boxes, also with single solid-line borders. Where additional requirements for creating OEFSRs are specified, these are positioned in text boxes with double solid-line borders at the end of each respective section.\n1.3   Principles for Organisation Environmental Footprint Studies\nStrict adherence to a core suite of analytical principles is required in order to achieve the objective of consistent, robust and reproducible OEF studies. These principles are intended to provide overarching guidance in the application of the OEF method. They shall be considered with respect to each phase of OEF studies, from the articulation of study goals and definition of the scope of the study, through data collection, environmental impact assessment, reporting, and verification of study outcomes.\nRequirements for OEF studies\nUsers of this Guide shall observe the following principles in OEF studies:\n(1)\nRelevance\nAll methods and data collected and used for the purpose of quantifying the OEF shall be as relevant to the study as possible.\n(2)\nCompleteness\nQuantification of the OEF shall include attention to all environmentally significant (11) material/energy flows and other environmental interventions as required for adherence to the defined system boundaries, the data requirements, and the impact assessment methods employed.\n(3)\nConsistency\nStrict conformity with this Guide shall be observed in all steps of the OEF study so as to enhance internal consistency as well as comparability with similar analyses.\n(4)\nAccuracy\nAll reasonable efforts shall be taken to reduce uncertainties both in modelling and reporting of results.\n(5)\nTransparency\nOEF information shall be disclosed in such a way as to provide intended users with the necessary basis for decision making, and for stakeholders to assess its robustness and reliability.\nPrinciples for OEFSRs\n1.   Relationship with the OEF Guide\nThe methodological requirements set out for OEFSRs shall apply to OEF studies in addition to the requirements of the OEF Guide. Where the OEFSRs provide more specific requirements than this OEF Guide, the specific requirements of the OEFSR shall be fulfilled.\n2.   Involvement of selected interested parties\nThe process of developing OEFSRs shall be open and transparent and should include a consultation with selected interested parties. Reasonable efforts should be made to achieve a consensus throughout the process (adapted from ISO 14020:2000, 4.9.1, Principle 8). The OEFSRs shall be peer reviewed.\n3.   Striving for comparability\nThe results of OEFs that have been conducted in line with the OEF Guide and the relevant OEFSR document may be used to support the comparison of the environmental performance of organisations in the same sector on a life cycle basis, as well as to support comparative assertions (intended to be disclosed to the public). Therefore, comparability of the results is crucial. The information provided for this comparison shall be transparent in order to allow the user to understand the limitations of comparability inherent in the calculated result (adapted from ISO 14025 (12)).\n1.4   Phases of an Organisation Environmental Footprint Study\nA number of phases shall be completed in carrying out an OEF study in line with this Guide - i.e. Goal Definition, Scope Definition, Resource Use and Emissions Profile, Environmental Footprint Impact Assessment, and Environmental Footprint Interpretation and Reporting – see Figure 1.\nFigure 1\nPhases of an Organisation Environmental Footprint study\n2.   ROLE OF ORGANISATION ENVIRONMENTAL FOOTPRINT SECTOR RULES (OEFSRs)\n2.1   General\nIn addition to providing general guidance and requirements for OEF studies, this OEF Guide also specifies the requirements for developing OEFSRs. OEFSRs will play an important role in increasing the reproducibility, consistency (and therefore comparability between OEF calculations within organisations of the same sector), and relevance of OEF studies. OEFSRs will help focus on the most important parameters, thus also possibly reducing the time, efforts and costs involved in completing an OEF study.\nThe objective is to ensure that OEFSRs are developed according to the OEF Guide and that they provide the required further specifications to achieve comparability, increased reproducibility, consistency, relevance, focus and efficiency of OEF studies. OEFSRs should aim to focus OEF studies on those aspects and parameters that are most pertinent in determining the environmental performance of the sector. An OEFSR shall/should/may further specify requirements made in this OEF Guide and add new requirements where the more general OEF Guide gives several options.\nThis OEF Guide defines key areas to be covered in OEFSRs. These include, for example:\n—\nChoice and description of system boundaries (Organisational boundaries and OEF boundaries);\n—\nDefining the reporting interval and the time span of the use stage to be considered;\n—\nDefining relevant/irrelevant environmental aspects (13);\n—\nDescription of the information to be included in the use and EOL stages, if considered in the analysis;\n—\nHow to compile the Product (14) Portfolio , including key related reference flow(s) (15);\n—\nChoice of underlying data, indicating which data are to be directly collected (specific) and which may be generic (16), and providing guidance on possible data sources;\n—\nSpecific rules for solving the multi-functionality (17) issues of key processes/activities for the sector;\n—\nReview requirements;\n—\nReporting requirements.\nIf the OEF studies are not to be used for comparative assertions intended to be disclosed to the public, they may be carried out without using OEFSRs.\nRequirements for OEF studies\nIn the absence of OEFSRs for the reference sector, the key areas which would be covered by OEFSRs (as listed throughout this OEF Guide) shall be specified, justified and explicitly reported in the OEF study.\nAdditional requirements for OEFSRs\nOEFSRs should aim to focus OEF studies on those aspects and parameters which are most pertinent to determining the environmental performance of the sector.\nAn OEFSR shall/should/may further specify requirements made in this OEF Guide and add new requirements where the more general OEF Guide gives several options.\n2.2   Defining the Sector that is Subject to the Organisation Environmental Footprint Sector Rules\nThe sector shall be defined with reference to the characteristic sectorial Product Portfolio (18) using NACE codes (i.e. in line with the Nomenclature générale des Activités Economiques dans les Communautés Européennes NACE Rev. 2). NACE is a system for statistically classifying economic activities in Europe. One NACE code is assigned to each unit recorded in statistical business registers, according to its principal economic activity. The principal activity is the activity which contributes most to the added value of the unit. As NACE is derived from the United Nations’ International Standard Industrial Classification of All Economic Activities (ISIC), the two classification systems are very similar, but NACE is more detailed than ISIC.\nThe assignment of the NACE code is helped by the explanatory notes of NACE, decisions taken by the NACE management committee, correspondence tables and reference to Classification of Products by Activity (CPA). An activity as defined here “may consist of one simple process (for example weaving), but may also cover a whole range of sub-processes, each mentioned in different categories of the classification (for example, the manufacturing of a car consists of specific activities such as casting, forging, welding, assembling, painting, etc.). If the production process is organised as an integrated series of elementary activities within the same statistical unit, the whole combination is regarded as one activity” (19).\nNACE consists of a hierarchical structure as follows (20):\n1.\nHeadings identified by an alphabetical code (sections);\n2.\nHeadings identified by a two-digit numerical code (divisions);\n3.\nHeadings identified by a three-digit numerical code (groups);\n4.\nHeadings identified by a four-digit numerical code (classes).\nISIC and NACE have the same codes at the highest levels, but NACE is more detailed at the lower levels. As the NACE code in the context of this study applies to the sector level, at a minimum a 2-digit code (i.e. division level) shall be assigned (21). This complies with the ISIC coding system. For multi-sector companies, all identifiable NACE codes related to their Product Portfolio shall be assigned.\nExample:\nA company manufacturing t-shirts and trousers belongs to the sector of manufacturers of wearing apparel. The NACE (and ISIC) code of the sector representing manufacturers of wearing apparel is 14. If the company does include processes for finishing of the textiles (e.g. bleaching of jeans), it also belongs to the sector representing manufacturers of textiles. The NACE (and ISIC) code related to the sector representing manufacturers of textile is 13. Both NACE codes 13 and 14 shall therefore be assigned to the company.\nThe sector should be defined so that it accommodates all relevant organisations in that sector. However, it must also be specific enough to facilitate the formulation of appropriately representative and prescriptive OEFSRs above and beyond those specified in the OEF Guide. The OEFSRs are, therefore, defined primarily with reference to the activities characteristic of the sector, as represented in a typical Product Portfolio.\nTo identify the set of activities by which organisations may be grouped under an OEFSR, several criteria should be considered:\n—\nThe organisations should provide similar goods/services;\n—\nThe relevant environmental impacts related to the activities of the organisations can be described by a similar set of environmental footprint impact categories, methods, and other indicators;\n—\nThe organisations should have similar Organisational boundaries and source a sufficiently similar profile of product inputs (22).\nAdditional requirements for OEFSRs\nThe sector for which the OEFSR is to refer shall be defined using NACE codes. OEFSRs shall be based on at a minimum a two-digit code division of NACE codes (default option). However, OEFSRs may allow for (justified) deviations (e.g. allow for three-digits) if the complexity of the sector demands it. Where multiple production routes for similar Product Portfolios defined using alternative NACE codes are identifiable, the OEFSR shall accommodate all such NACE codes.\n3.   DEFINING THE GOAL(S) OF THE ORGANISATION ENVIRONMENTAL FOOTPRINT STUDY\nGoal definition is the first step of an OEF study, and sets the overall context for the study. The purpose of clearly articulating goals is to ensure that the analytical aims, methods, results and intended applications are optimally aligned, and that a shared vision is in place to guide the participants in the study.\nAn important element of the goal definition phase is to identify the intended applications of the study, and the associated necessary degree of analytical depth and rigor. In turn, this should be reflected in the defined study limitations (scope definition phase). For analyses geared towards e.g. least-environmental cost sourcing, product design, benchmarking or reporting, fully quantitative studies in conformance with the analytical requirements specified in this OEF Guide will be necessary. Combined approaches are also possible if only certain parts of the supply chain are subject to quantitative analysis and others to qualitative descriptions of potential environmental hotspots in a single OEF study (for example, a quantitative cradle-to-gate (23) analysis combined with qualitative descriptions of gate-to-grave (24) environmental considerations or with quantitative analyses of the use and EOL stages for selected representative product types).\nSeveral reasons for carrying out an OEF study are possible, such as a need to understand the most significant environmental impacts of an Organisation’s activities throughout its life cycle, to identify opportunities for reducing the environmental impacts focussing primarily on the identified ‘hotspots’, to support strategic decisions (e.g. on risk management in the supply chain), to address investors’ and other stakeholders’ enquiries regarding the Organisation’s environmental performance, corporate sustainability reporting, reporting to stakeholders, etc.\nExample: Environmental footprint of a company producing yeans and T-shirts: goal definition\nAspects\nDetail\nIntended application(s):\nCorporate sustainability reporting\nReasons for carrying out the study:\nDemonstrate commitment to and practice of continuous improvement\nTarget audience:\nCustomers\nComparisons or comparative assertions intended to be disclosed to the public:\nNo, it will be publically available but it is not intended to be used for comparisons or comparative assertions.\nCommissioner of the study:\nG Company Ltd.\nReview procedure:\nIndependent external reviewer, Mr. Y\nRequirements for OEF studies\nThe goal definition for an OEF study shall include:\n—\nIntended application(s);\n—\nReasons for carrying out the study and decision context;\n—\nTarget audience;\n—\nWhether for the purpose of comparisons and/or comparative assertions intended to be disclosed to the public;\n—\nCommissioner of the study;\n—\nReview Procedure (if applicable).\nAdditional requirements for OEFSRs\nThe OEFSR shall specify the review requirements for OEF studies.\n4.   DEFINING THE SCOPE OF THE ORGANISATION ENVIRONMENTAL FOOTPRINT STUDY\n4.1   General\nDefining the scope of the OEF study involves describing in detail the system to be evaluated along with the associated analytical specifications.\nRequirements for OEF studies\nThe scope definition for an OEF study shall be in line with the defined study goals and the requirements of the OEF Guide. It shall identify and clearly describe (see following sections for a more detailed description):\n—\nDefinition of the Organisation (unit of analysis (25)) and the Product Portfolio (suite and amount of goods/services provided over the reporting interval);\n—\nSystem boundaries (Organisational and OEF boundaries);\n—\nEnvironmental Footprint impact categories;\n—\nAssumptions and Limitations.\n4.2   Defining the Organisation (Unit of Analysis)\nThe Organisation is the reference unit for the analysis, and (along with the Product Portfolio) the basis for defining the Organisational boundaries. It is parallel to the concept of “functional unit” in a traditional Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) (26). In the most general sense, the overarching function of the Organisation, for the purpose of calculating the OEF, is the provision of goods and services over a specified reporting interval. The OEF study is intended to provide a measure of the potential environmental pressures related to the provision of products by the Organisation. Defining the Organisation with reference to the Product Portfolio therefore facilitates direct representation of the Organisation’s physical exchanges with the environment.\nRequirements for OEF studies\nThe Organisation (or clearly defined subset thereof subject to the OEF study) shall be defined according to the following:\n—\nThe name of the Organisation;\n—\nThe kinds of goods/services the Organisation produces (i.e. the sector);\n—\nLocations of operation (i.e. countries);\n—\nThe NACE code(s).\nExample:\nAspect\nDetail\nOrganisation:\nY Company Ltd.\nGoods/Services Sector:\ngarment manufacturer\nLocation(s):\nParis, Berlin, Milan\nNACE code(s):\n14\n4.3   Product Portfolio\nThe Product Portfolio refers to the amount and nature of goods and services provided by the Organisation over the reporting interval, which should be one year. It constitutes the basis for completing the Resource Use and Emissions Profile (inventory) for the Organisation, which equals the input and output (27) flows associated with the provision of the Organisation’s Product Portfolio as per the defined system boundaries for the study.\nThe OEF may be limited to a clearly defined subset of the Product Portfolio of the Organisation. This can, for example, be the case if the Product Portfolio of a retailer consists of products produced in-house (own brands) and products which are provided by the Organisation without any transformation. The Product Portfolio for the cradle-to-grave analysis could then be limited to the in-house products, while a cradle-to-gate or gate-to-gate analysis is made for the other products. Another typical example is an organisation that is operating in various sectors and decides to restrict its analysis to one sector.\nRequirements for OEF studies\nA Product Portfolio shall be defined for the Organisation that represents the amount and nature of goods and services (or clearly defined subset thereof) provided by the Organisation over the reporting interval in terms of “what” and “how much”. It shall be justified and reported if an OEF is limited to a subset of its Product Portfolio.\nThe reporting interval should be one year.\nFor modelling the use and EOL scenarios, information on “how well”, and “for how long” (28) with respect to product performance shall also be provided. The quantitative input and output data collected in support of the analysis (to be carried out in a later phase of the OEF study) shall be calculated in relation to the specified Product Portfolio.\nExample: Product Portfolio:\nAspect\nDetail\n[WHAT]\nT-shirts (average for size S, M, L) made from polyester, trousers (average for size S, M, L) made from polyester\n[HOW MUCH]\n40 000 T-shirts, 20 000 trousers\n[HOW WELL]\nWear once per week and use washing machine at 30 degrees for cleaning once weekly, the energy use of the washing machine equals 0,72 MJ/kg clothing and the water use 10 litres/kg clothing for one wash cycle. One T-shirt weighs 0,16 kg and one pair of trousers weighs 0,53 kg. This results in an energy use of 0,4968 MJ/week and a water consumption of 6,9 litres/week.\n[HOW LONG]\nuse stage of five years for both the T-shirts and the trousers\n[YEAR]\n2010\n[REPORTING INTERVAL]\none year\nAdditional requirements for OEFSRs\nThe OEFSR shall further specify how the Product Portfolio is defined, in particular with respect to “how well” and “for how long”. It shall also define the reporting interval when this differs from one year, and justify the chosen interval.\n4.4   System Boundaries for Organisation Environmental Footprint Studies\nOrganisational activities are ultimately embedded in networks of social, financial and physical relationships. It is therefore necessary to establish boundaries in order to formally define which of these relationships will be considered in the OEF, and which will be excluded. A key insight that has emerged from life cycle-based approaches to environmental accountancy is that resource use and emissions linked to processes upstream (i.e. goods and services purchased by the Organisation) or downstream (i.e. linked to the distribution, storage, use, and EOL of the goods/services the Organisation provides) can be key determinants of the overall environmental profile of the Organisation. Effective and efficient environmental management therefore requires attention to these upstream and downstream processes, and consideration of the extent to which they are or can be influenced by decision making at the organisational level.\nGiven the obviously important role that the choice of system boundaries will contribute to deciding the magnitude of the calculated OEF, these shall be established in a principled and consistent manner. The definition of the boundaries also directly determines the utility of the analytical outcomes for specific applications. For example, to generate results most suitable to informing environmental management of direct site-level impacts, Organisational boundaries related to the site are appropriate. To inform management of broader supply-chain impacts, system boundaries that encompass upstream and/or downstream processes are required. An OEF exercise that shows that the majority of environmental impacts occur upstream along the supply chain in association with specific processes provides the necessary basis for making improvements along the supply chain. An analysis that suggests that downstream impacts are most important may point towards opportunities for redesigning products or changing the composition of the Product Portfolio.\nRequirements for OEF studies\nThe system boundaries shall include both Organisational boundaries (in relation to the defined Organisation) and OEF boundaries (that specify which aspects of the supply chain are included in the analysis).\n4.4.1   Organisational Boundaries\nIn the interests of maximising the physical representativeness of the OEF model, it is most appropriate to define Organisational boundaries based on the Product Portfolio (29) as opposed to giving an economic definition. For this reason, Organisational boundaries of OEF studies are defined so as to encompass all facilities and associated processes that are fully or partially owned and/or operated by the Organisation and that directly contribute to the provision of the Product Portfolio (30). This corresponds to the “control” approach in that, in theory, the Organisation should be able to leverage direct access to specific data (31) for activities in which they have an operational or financial stake and should also be able to influence environmental management decisions for the facilities of concern based on the results of the OEF study. The activities and impacts linked to processes within the defined Organisational boundaries are considered “direct” activities and impacts.\nFor example, in the case of retailers, products produced by other organisations are not included in the Organisational boundaries of the retailer. The retailers’ boundaries are then limited to their capital goods and all processes/activities related to the retailing service. However, products produced or transformed by the retailer shall be included in the Organisational boundaries.\nAs some jointly owned/operated facilities may contribute to the provision both of the defined Product Portfolio of the organisation as well as of the Product Portfolio(s) of other organisations, it may be necessary to allocate inputs and outputs accordingly (see section 5.11).\nRequirements for OEF studies\nOrganisational boundaries for calculating the OEF shall encompass all of the facilities/activities that the Organisation owns and/or operates (whether partially or in full) that contribute to providing the Product Portfolio during the reporting interval.\nAll activities and processes which occur within the Organisational boundaries but which are not necessary for the functioning of the Organisation shall be included in the analysis but reported separately. Examples of such processes/activities are gardening activities, food served by the company in the canteen, etc.\nIn the case of retailers, products produced or transformed by the retailer shall be included in the Organisational boundaries.\nExample:\nFacility\nStatus\nDirectly contributes to Product Portfolio?\nIncluded in System Boundary\nTextile plant\nOperated/not owned\nYes\nYes\nTextile plant\nPart owned/operated\nYes\nYes\nFactory (sewing)\nOwned/operated\nYes\nYes\nBottle factory\nMinority share\nNo\nNo\nAdditional requirements for OEFSRs\nThe OEFSR shall specify the characteristic processes, activities and facilities of the sector of concern to be included in the Organisational boundaries.\nThe OEFSR shall specify the characteristic processes and activities which occur within the Organisational boundaries but which are not necessary for the functioning of the Organisation. These shall be included in the analysis and reported separately.\n4.4.2   Organisation Environmental Footprint Boundaries\nDepending on the intended application, OEF studies may require system boundaries that are broader than the Organisational boundaries. Towards this end, OEF boundaries shall be defined in terms of indirect activities and associated impacts. Indirect activities and impacts are those that occur upstream or downstream along the supply chains linked to organisational activities, but that fall outside of the defined Organisational boundaries.\nFigure 2 indicates the mandatory and optional processes/activities to be included in the OEF. For some organisations, downstream (indirect) activities may be excluded based on explicit justification. For example, organisations producing intermediate products (32) or products with an indeterminable fate for which the use stage is unknown (e.g. timber, sugar), the use stage may be excluded from the analysis. If retailers provide products produced by other organisations, the production processes shall be included as upstream processes.\nFigure 2\nOrganisational and OEF boundaries. Note: Any exclusion (e.g. downstream activities) shall be explicitly justified within the context of the study and the intended application\nEmployee transport can occur either within the Organisational boundary (e.g. when employees commute using cars owned or operated by the employer, or use public transport paid for by the employer) or be an indirect process (e.g. when employees commute by private cars or public transport paid for by the employee). To ensure comparability between OEF studies, employee transport shall be included in the analysis, even if these are indirect activities.\nAs products within one sector may have a different life span (as specified in the description of the Product Portfolio under the term “how long” (see section 4.3)), the time span to be considered for the assessment of the downstream processes/activities needs to be defined to ensure comparability and consistency among OEF studies. If the life span of the product is shorter than the defined time span to be considered, necessary replacements shall be taken into account. These replacements are necessary to fulfil the defined time span and thus do not relate to reuse.\nRequirements for OEF studies\nThe OEF boundaries shall be defined following general supply-chain logic. This shall include, at a minimum, site-level (direct) and upstream (indirect) activities associated with the Organisation’s Product Portfolio. The OEF boundaries shall by default include all supply-chain stages from raw material (33) acquisition through processing, production, distribution, storage, use and EOL treatment of the Product Portfolio (i.e. cradle-to-grave). All processes within the defined OEF boundaries shall be considered. Explicit justification shall be provided if downstream (indirect) activities are excluded (e.g. use stage of intermediate products or products with an undeterminable fate).\nEmployee transport shall be included in the analysis, even if these are indirect activities.\nIf retailers provide products produced by other organisations, the production processes shall be included as upstream processes.\nReplacements which are necessary to fulfil the defined time span (see OEFSRs in section 4.3) shall be taken into account. The number of replacements equals “time span/life span -1”. As this assumes an average situation, the number of replacements does not need to be an integer. The future production processes for these replacements shall be assumed to be identical to the processes of the reporting year. If a fixed time span is not relevant for a certain sector (see OEFSRs in section 4.3), the use stage shall cover the life span of the products in the Product Portfolio of the Organisation (without replacements).\nTip: The degree of robustness with which the full supply chain of the OEF can be assessed for an Organisation will depend strongly on the nature and variety of products the Organisation provides.\nIf the Organisation provides intermediate products and it is not feasible to establish robust end-use scenarios, modelling only direct and indirect upstream impacts may be preferred. The Organisation might also consider modelling the use and EOL stages for only a small, representative subset of products.\nIn all cases, system boundaries should be established and justified in relation to the defined goals and intended applications of the study.\nAdditional requirements for OEFSRs\nThe OEFSR shall specify the OEF boundary, including specification of the supply-chain stages to be included; and the direct (gate-to-gate) and indirect (upstream and downstream) processes/activities to be included in the OEF study. Any deviation from the default cradle-to-grave approach shall be explicitly specified and justified, e.g. exclusion of the unknown use stage of intermediate products. The OEFSR shall also include justification for exclusions of processes/activities.\nThe OEFSR shall specify the time span and scenarios to be considered for the downstream activities. If a fixed time span is not appropriate or relevant for a certain sector (e.g. some consumable products), the OEFSR shall specify and justify why this is the case.\n4.4.3   System Boundary Diagram\nA system boundary diagram is a schematic representation of the analysed system. It details which parts of the Organisation supply chain are included or excluded from the analysis. A system boundary diagram may be a useful tool in defining the system boundary and organising subsequent data collection activities and therefore it should be included in the scope definition.\nTip: It is not mandatory to prepare a system boundary diagram, but it is highly recommended. The system boundary diagram will help the Organisation to define and structure the analysis.\nRequirements for OEF studies\nA system boundary diagram should be included in the scope definition.\n4.4.4   How to Deal with Offsets in an OEF\nThe term “offset” is frequently used with reference to third-party greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation activities. Offsets are GHG reductions obtained somewhere other than the source of the emission, used to compensate for (i.e. offset) emissions, for example to meet a voluntary or mandatory GHG target or cap. Offsets are calculated relative to a baseline that represents a hypothetical scenario for what emissions would have been in the absence of the mitigation project that generates the offsets. Examples are carbon offset by the Clean Development Mechanism, carbon credits, and other offsets external to the system.\nRequirements for OEF studies\nOffsets shall not be included in an OEF study, but may be reported separately as “Additional Environmental Information.”\n4.5   Selecting Environmental Footprint Impact Categories and Assessment Methods\nEnvironmental footprint (EF) impact categories (34) refer to specific categories of environmental impacts (35) considered in an OEF study. These generally relate to resource use (e.g. fossil fuels and mineral ores) or emissions of environmentally damaging substances (e.g. GHGs or toxic chemicals), which may affect human health. Impact assessment models are used for quantifying the causal relationships between the material/energy inputs and emissions associated with Organisational activities (as inventoried in the Resource Use and Emissions Profile) and each EF impact category considered (see Figure 1). Each EF impact category refers to a stand-alone EF impact assessment model and EF impact category indicator (36).\nThe EF impact assessment models used in the OEF are mid-point (37) models because these are considered scientifically best established (38). Some impacts might seem to be left out of the EF impact assessment, but these are covered by mid-point indicators. For example, impacts on biodiversity (an end-point related to ecosystems) are not explicitly calculated for OEF studies, but are represented by several other mid-point indicators that affect biodiversity, predominantly ecotoxicity, eutrophication, acidification, land use, climate change and ozone depletion.\nThe purpose of the environmental footprint (EF) impact assessment (39) is to group and aggregate the inventoried Resource Use and Emissions Profile data according to the respective contributions to each EF impact category. This subsequently provides the necessary basis for interpretation of the OEF results relative to the goals of the study (for example, identification of supply chain “hotspots” and options for improvement). The selection of EF impact categories shall therefore be comprehensive as they cover all relevant environmental issues related to the activities of the Organisation.\nThis OEF Guide provides a default list of EF impact categories and related assessment models and indicators to be used in OEF studies (Table 2) (40). Further instructions on how to calculate these impacts are described in chapter 6. Chapter 6 also provides the data that are necessary to carry out the assessment.\nTable 2\nDefault EF impact categories with their respective EF impact category indicators and EF impact assessment models for OEF studies\nEF Impact Category\nEF Impact Assessment Model\nEF Impact Category Indicator\nSource\nClimate Change\nBern model - Global Warming Potentials (GWP) over a 100 year time horizon\nTonne CO2 equivalent\nIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, 2007\nOzone Depletion\nEDIP model based on ODPs of the WMO over an infinite time horizon\nkg CFC-11 equivalent (41)\nWMO, 1999\nEcotoxicity – fresh water (45)\nUSEtox model\nCTUe (Comparative Toxic Unit for ecosystems) (46)\nRosenbaum et al., 2008\nHuman Toxicity - cancer effects\nUSEtox model\nCTUh (Comparative Toxic Unit for humans) (47)\nRosenbaum et al., 2008\nHuman Toxicity – non-cancer effects\nUSEtox model\nCTUh (Comparative Toxic Unit for humans) (47)\nRosenbaum et al., 2008\nParticulate Matter/Respiratory Inorganics\nRiskPoll model\nkg PM2,5 equivalent (42)\nHumbert, 2009\nIonising Radiation – human health effects\nHuman Health effect model\nkg U235 equivalent (to air)\nDreicer et al., 1995\nPhotochemical Ozone Formation\nLOTOS-EUROS model\nkg NMVOC equivalent (43)\nVan Zelm et al., 2008 as applied in ReCiPe\nAcidification\nAccumulated Exceedance model\nmol H+ equivalent\nSeppälä et al., 2006; Posch et al, 2008\nEutrophication – terrestrial\nAccumulated Exceedance model\nmol N equivalent\nSeppälä et al., 2006; Posch et al, 2008\nEutrophication – aquatic\nEUTREND model\nfresh water: kg P equivalent\nmarine: kg N equivalent\nStruijs et al., 2009 as implemented in ReCiPe\nResource Depletion – water\nSwiss Ecoscarcity model\nm3 water use related to local scarcity of water (48)\nFrischknecht et al., 2008\nResource Depletion – mineral, fossil\nCML2002 model\nkg Sb equivalent (44)\nvan Oers et al., 2002\nLand Use\nSoil Organic Matter (SOM) model\nkg C (deficit)\nMilà i Canals et al., 2007\nDepending on the nature of Organisation activities and the intended applications of the OEF study, users of this OEF Guide may opt for narrowing the suite of EF impact categories. Such justifications for exclusion(s) shall be supported by appropriate documents. Examples of sources of supporting documents are (non-exhaustive list):\n—\nInternational consensus process;\n—\nIndependent external review (according to the requirements in chapter 9);\n—\nMulti-stakeholder process;\n—\nLCA studies which have been peer reviewed;\n—\nScreening step (see section 5.2).\nExample: Justification for exclusion of EF impact categories\nEF Impact Categories Excluded\nJustification\nParticulate Matter/Respiratory Inorganics\nExpert reviewer confirms that there are no significant impacts of Particulate Matter/Respiratory Inorganics based on the evidence provided.\nIonising Radiation\nPrevious sectorial studies (references) indicate no significant ionising radiation\nRequirements for OEF studies\nFor an OEF study, all of the specified default EF impact categories and associated specified EF impact assessment models and indicators (see Table 2) shall be applied. Any exclusion shall be explicitly documented, justified and reported in the OEF report and supported by appropriate documents. The influence of any exclusion on the final results, especially related to limitations in terms of comparability to other OEF studies, shall be reported and discussed in the interpretation phase. Such exclusions are subject to review.\nAdditional requirements for OEFSRs\nThe OEFSR shall specify and justify any exclusion of the default EF impact categories, especially related to aspects of comparability.\n4.6   Selecting Additional Environmental Information to be Included in the OEF\nRelevant potential environmental impacts of an organisation might go beyond the widely accepted life cycle-based EF impact assessment models. It is important to consider these environmental impacts whenever feasible. For example, biodiversity impacts due to land use changes may occur in association with a specific site or activity. This may require the application of additional EF impact categories beyond the default list provided in this OEF Guide, or even additional qualitative descriptions. Such additional methods are complementary to the default suite of EF impact categories. For example, a variety of developing initiatives and schemes (such as the Global Reporting Initiative (49)) provide models for organisations to report qualitatively on their local biodiversity impacts.\nOrganisations which are located close to the sea might make emissions directly to marine water instead of to fresh water. As the default set of EF impact categories only include ecotoxicity due to emissions to fresh water, it is important to consider such emissions direct to marine water too as Additional Environmental Information. This shall be done at inventory level because no impact assessment model is currently available for such emissions.\nIn addition to the communication of absolute values for each EF impact category considered, intensity-based metrics may also be necessary. This is, for example, the case for the management of improved environmental performance as well as for making comparisons or comparative assertions. Examples of intensity-based metrics are impacts per unit of product, per employee, per gross sales and per value-added.\nRequirements for OEF studies\nIf the default set of EF impact categories or the default EF impact assessment models do not properly cover the potential environmental impacts of the Organisation, all related relevant (qualitative/quantitative) environmental aspects shall be additionally included under Additional Environmental Information. Additional Environmental Information shall be reported separately from the default EF impact assessment results. These shall however not substitute the mandatory assessment models of the default EF impact categories. The supporting models of these additional categories with the corresponding indicators shall be clearly referenced and documented.\nAdditional Environmental Information shall be:\n—\nBased on information that is substantiated and has been reviewed or verified (in accordance with the requirements of ISO 14020 and Clause 5 of ISO 14021:1999);\n—\nSpecific, accurate and not misleading;\n—\nRelevant to the particular sector;\n—\nSubmitted to the review process;\n—\nClearly documented.\nEmissions directly to marine water shall be included in the Additional Environmental Information (at inventory level).\nIf Additional Environmental Information is used to support the interpretation phase of an OEF study, then all data needed to produce such information shall meet the same or equivalent quality requirements established for the data used to calculate the OEF results (see section 5.6 (50)).\nAdditional Environmental Information shall only be related to environmental issues. Information and instructions, e.g. organisation safety sheets that are unrelated to the environmental footprint of the Organisation, shall not be part of an OEF. Similarly, information related to legal requirements shall not be included.\nAdditional requirements for OEFSRs\nThe OEFSR shall specify:\nAny Additional Environmental Information that shall be included in the OEF study or that is recommended to be presented as being relevant to the sector of concern. Such additional information shall be reported separately from the default EF impact assessment results (see Table 2). All models and assumptions of this Additional Environmental Information shall be supported by adequate documentation, clearly documented and submitted to the review process. Such Additional Environmental Information may include (non-exhaustive list):\n—\nOther relevant environmental impact categories for the sector;\n—\nOther relevant approaches for conducting characterisation of the flows from the Resource Use and Emissions Profile, when characterisation factors (CFs) in the default method are not available for certain flows (e.g. groups of chemicals);\n—\nEnvironmental indicators or product responsibility indicators (e.g. EMAS core indicators or the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI));\n—\nLife cycle energy consumption by primary energy source, separately accounting for “renewable” energy use;\n—\nDirect energy consumption by primary energy source, separately accounting for “renewable” energy use;\n—\nFor gate-to-gate stages, number of IUCN Red List species and national conservation list species with habitats in areas affected by operations, by level of extinction risk;\n—\nDescription of significant impacts of activities and products on biodiversity in protected areas and areas of high biodiversity value outside protected areas;\n—\nTotal weight of waste by type and disposal method;\n—\nWeight of transported, imported, exported, or treated waste deemed hazardous under the terms of Annexes I, II, III, and VIII of the Basel Convention, and percentage of transported waste shipped internationally;\n—\nInformation from environmental impact assessments (EIA) and chemical risk assessments.\n—\nJustifications for inclusions/exclusions.\nThe OEFSRs shall furthermore define the appropriate unit for intensity-based metrics required for specific communication purposes.\n4.7   Assumptions/Limitations\nIn OEF studies, several limitations to carrying out the analysis may occur and therefore assumptions need to be made. For example, generic data (51) that do not completely represent the reality of the Organisation may be adapted for better representation.\nRequirements for OEF studies\nAll limitations and assumptions shall be transparently reported.\nAdditional requirements for OEFSRs\nThe OEFSR shall report sector-specific limitations and define the assumptions necessary to overcome such limitations.\n5.   COMPILING AND RECORDING THE RESOURCE USE AND EMISSIONS PROFILE (INVENTORY PHASE)\n5.1   General\nAn inventory (profile) of all material/energy resource inputs/outputs and emissions into air, water and soil shall be compiled as a basis for modelling the OEF. This is called the Resource Use and Emissions Profile, and is compiled in terms of the total of goods/services represented by the defined Product Portfolio of the Organisation. At the organisational level, this includes all inputs and outputs for owned and/or managed processes that contribute to the provision of the Product Portfolio within the Organisational boundary. At the analytical level, if upstream and downstream processes/flows are included in the OEF boundaries, this includes all processes/flows linked to all life-cycle stages of the Product Portfolio.\nIdeally, the Organisation’s activities should be described using facility- or product-specific data (i.e. modelling the exact life cycle depicting the supply chain, use, and EOL stages as appropriate). In practice, and as a general rule, for processes within the defined Organisational boundary, directly collected, facility-specific inventory data shall be used unless generic data are more representative or appropriate. For processes outside of the Organisational boundary, for which direct data access are not possible, generic data will typically be used. However, it is good practice to attempt to access directly collected data from suppliers when possible, in particular for environmentally significant processes. The use and collection requirements of specific and generic data are described in more detail in sections 5.7 and 5.8 respectively.\nGeneric data are data sourced from third-party life cycle inventory databases, government or industry association reports, statistical databases, peer-reviewed literature, or other sources. It is used when specific data are not available or relevant. All such data shall satisfy the quality requirements specified in this OEF Guide.\nThe Resource Use and Emissions Profile shall adopt the following classifications of the flows included:\n—\nElementary flows, which are (ISO 14040:2006, 3.12) “material or energy entering the system being studied that has been drawn from the environment without previous human transformation, or material or energy leaving the system being studied that is released into the environment without subsequent human transformation.” Elementary flows are e.g. resources taken from the nature or emissions into air, water, soil that are directly linked to the characterization factors of the EF impact categories;\n—\nNon-elementary (or complex) flows, which are all the remaining inputs (e.g. electricity, materials, transport processes) and outputs (e.g. waste, by-products) in a system that need further modelling efforts to be transformed into elementary flows.\nAll non-elementary flows in the Resource Use and Emissions Profile shall be transformed into elementary flows. For example, waste flows shall not only be reported as kg of household waste or hazardous waste, but shall also include emissions into water, air and soil due to the treatment of the solid waste. This is necessary for the comparability of OEF studies. The compilation of the Resource Use and Emissions Profile is therefore completed when all flows are elementary flows.\nTip: Documenting the data collection process is useful for improving the data quality over time, preparing for critical review (52), and revising future Organisation inventories to reflect changes in Organisational activities. To ensure that all of the relevant information is documented, it may be helpful to establish a data management plan early in the inventory process (see Annex II).\nThe Resource Use and Emissions Profile in an OEF study may be compiled following a 2-step procedure: screening step and completing step. This is illustrated in Figure 3. The first step is not mandatory but is highly recommended.\nFigure 3\nTwo-step procedure to compile the Resource Use and Emissions Profile (the screening step is highly recommended, but not mandatory)\nRequirements for OEF studies\nAll resource uses and emissions associated with the life cycle stages included in the defined system boundaries shall be included in the Resource Use and Emissions Profile. The flows shall be grouped into “elementary flows” and “non-elementary (i.e. complex) flows”. All non-elementary flows in the Resource Use and Emissions Profile shall then be transformed into elementary flows.\n5.2   Screening Step\nAn initial “screening-level” Resource Use and Emissions Profile and OEF Impact Assessment is highly recommended. This screening step helps to focus data-collection activities and data-quality priorities for completing the Resource Use and Emissions Profile.\nRequirements for OEF studies\nAn initial “screening-level” Resource Use and Emissions Profile should be undertaken and is highly recommended. If a screening step is conducted, readily available specific and/or generic data shall be used fulfilling the data quality requirements as defined in section 5.6. Any exclusion of supply-chain stages shall be explicitly justified and submitted to the review process, and their influence on the final results shall be discussed.\nFor supply-chain stages for which a quantitative EF impact assessment is not intended (for example, the use stage of intermediate products in a cradle-to-gate OEF), the screening step shall refer to existing literature and other sources in order to develop qualitative descriptions of potentially environmentally significant processes. Such qualitative descriptions shall be included in the Additional Environmental Information.\nIn developing qualitative descriptions of potential environmental impacts, the following information sources should be considered:\n—\nOEF and OEFSR-based studies of similar organisations;\n—\nProduct Environment Footprint and Product Environmental Footprint Category Rule-based studies for key products provided by the organisations;\n—\nPrevious, detailed studies of similar organisations;\n—\nEMAS sectorial reference documents, where these exist for the sector;\n—\nOrganisation environmental reporting rules from other initiatives/ schemes;\n—\nEnvironmental Impact of Products (EIPRO) and Environmental Improvement of Products (IMPRO) studies for products provided by the Organisation;\n—\nEnvironmental Key Performance Indicators for sectors, as reported by DEFRA (http://archive.defra.gov.uk/environment/business/reporting/pdf/envkpi‐guidelines.pdf);\n—\nOther peer-reviewed literature.\nAdditional requirements for OEFSRs\nThe OEFSR shall specify the processes to be included. The OEFSR shall also specify for which processes specific data are required, and for which the use of generic data is either permissible or required.\n5.3   Data Management Plan (Optional)\nWhile not required in the context of the OEF, a data management plan may be a valuable tool for managing data and for tracking the compilation of the Resource Use and Emissions Profile.\nThe data management plan can include:\n—\nA description of data collection procedures for:\n—\nProcesses/activities within the defined Organisational boundaries;\n—\nProcesses/activities outside (upstream or downstream) the defined Organisational boundaries but within the OEF boundaries;\n—\nData sources;\n—\nCalculation methodologies;\n—\nData transmission, storage and backup procedures;\n—\nQuality control and review procedures for data collection, input and handling activities, data documentation and emissions calculations.\nFor additional guidance on possible approaches to formulating a data management plan, see Annex II.\n5.4   Resource Use and Emissions Profile Data\nRequirements for OEF studies\nThe Resource Use and Emissions Profile shall be the documented input and output flows associated with all activities and processes of all life cycle stages within the defined OEF boundaries.\nThe following elements shall be considered for inclusion in the Resource Use and Emissions Profile (53):\n—\nDirect activities and impacts of sources owned and/or operated by the Organisation;\n—\nIndirectly attributable upstream activities;\n—\nIndirectly attributable downstream activities.\nLinear depreciation shall be used for the capital equipment. The expected service life of the capital goods shall be taken into account (and not the time to evolve to an economic book value of 0).\nAdditional requirements for OEFSRs\nThe OEFSR shall further specify sources, quality and review requirements for the data used in an OEF study.\nThe OEFSR should provide one or more examples for compiling the Resource Use and Emissions Profile, including specifications with respect to:\n—\nSubstance lists for activities/processes included;\n—\nUnits;\n—\nNomenclature for elementary flows.\nThese may apply to one or more supply-chain stages, processes or activities, for the purpose of ensuring standardised data collection and reporting. The OEFSR may specify more stringent data requirements for key upstream, gate-to-gate or downstream stages than those defined in this OEF Guide.\nFor modelling processes/activities within the defined Organisational boundary (i.e. gate-to-gate stage), the OEFSR shall also specify:\n—\nProcesses/activities included;\n—\nSpecifications for compiling data for key processes, including averaging data across facilities;\n—\nThe expected service life of the capital goods;\n—\nAny site-specific data required for reporting as “Additional Environmental Information”;\n—\nSpecific data-quality requirements, e.g. for measuring specific activity data.\nIf the OEFSR requires/allows deviations from the default cradle-to-grave system boundary (e.g. if the OEFSR prescribes using a cradle-to-gate boundary), the OEFSR shall specify how material/energy balances in the Resource Use and Emissions Profile shall be accounted for.\nFor the estimation of the service life of capital goods, the following sources should be used:\n—\nRelevant PEFCRs/OEFSRs;\n—\nRelevant PCRs;\n—\nValues used in European standards/ norms;\n—\nValues used in national standards/norms;\n—\nStatistical data;\n—\nOther literature sources regarding life span of capital goods.\n5.4.1   Direct Activities and Impacts\nThe direct impacts are impacts from sources that are owned and/or operated by the Organisation, i.e. from site-level activities, such as:\n—\nCapital equipment when built/produced by the Organisation (e.g. machinery used in production processes, buildings, office equipment, transport vehicles, transportation infrastructure). Linear depreciation shall be applied for capital equipment;\n—\nGeneration of energy resulting from combustion of fuels in stationary sources (e.g. boilers, furnaces, turbines);\n—\nPhysical or chemical processing (e.g. from manufacturing, processing, cleaning, etc.);\n—\nTransportation of materials, products and waste (resources and emissions from the combustion of fuels) in company-owned and/or operated vehicles, described in terms of mode of transport, vehicle type and distance;\n—\nEmployees commuting (resources and emissions from the combustion of fuels) using vehicles owned and/or operated by the Organisation, described in terms of mode of transport, vehicle type and distance;\n—\nBusiness travel (resources and emissions from the combustion of fuels) in vehicles owned and/or operated by the Organisation, described in terms of mode of transport, vehicle type, and distance;\n—\nClient and visitor transportation (resources and emissions from the combustion of fuels) in vehicles owned and/or operated by the Organisation, described in terms of mode of transport, vehicle type and distance;\n—\nTransportation from suppliers (resources and emissions from the combustion of fuels) in vehicles owned and/or operated by the Organisation, described in terms of mode of transport, vehicle type, distance and load;\n—\nDisposal and treatment of waste (composition, volume) when processed in facilities owned and/or operated by the Organisation;\n—\nEmissions from intentional or unintentional releases (54) (e.g. Hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) emissions during the use of air-conditioning equipment);\n—\nOther site-specific activities.\n5.4.2   Indirectly Attributable Upstream Activities\nThe indirect impacts of upstream activities refer to the use of materials, energy and emissions associated with goods/services sourced from upstream of the Organisational boundary in support of producing the Product Portfolio. These are resources and emissions from activities such as:\n—\nExtraction of raw materials needed for the production of the Product Portfolio;\n—\nExtraction, production and transportation of purchased (55) capital equipment (e.g. machinery used in production processes buildings, office equipment, transport vehicles, transportation infrastructure). Linear depreciation shall be applied for capital equipment;\n—\nExtraction, production and transportation of purchased electricity, steam and heating/cooling energy;\n—\nExtraction, production and transportation of purchased materials, fuels and other products;\n—\nGeneration of electricity consumed by upstream activities;\n—\nDisposal and treatment of waste generated by upstream activities;\n—\nDisposal and treatment of waste generated on site when processed in facilities not owned and/or operated by the Organisation;\n—\nTransportation of materials and products between suppliers and from suppliers in vehicles not owned and/or operated by the Organisation (mode of transport, vehicle type, distance);\n—\nEmployees commuting using vehicles not owned or operated by the Organisation (mode of transport, vehicle type, distance);\n—\nBusiness travel (resources and emissions from the combustion of fuels) in vehicles not owned and/or operated by the Organisation (mode of transport, vehicle type, distance);\n—\nClient and visitor transportation (resources and emissions from the combustion of fuels) in vehicles not owned and/or operated by the Organisation (mode of transport, vehicle type, distance);\n—\nAny other upstream process/activity.\n5.4.3   Indirectly Attributable Downstream Activities\nThe indirect impacts of downstream activities refer to the use of materials, energy and emissions associated with goods/services occurring downstream of the Organisational boundary in relation to the Product Portfolio. These are resources and emissions from activities such as:\n—\nTransportation and distribution of goods/services provided to the client, where means of transport are not owned and/or operated by the Organisation;\n—\nProcessing of goods/services provided;\n—\nUse of goods/services provided (see section 5.4.6 for more detailed specifications);\n—\nEOL treatment of goods/services provided (see section 5.4.7 for more detailed specifications);\n—\nAny other downstream process/activity.\n5.4.4   Additional Resource Use and Emissions Profile Requirements\nAccounting for Electricity Use (Including Use of Renewable Energy)\nThe electricity use from the grid consumed upstream or within the defined Organisational boundary shall be modelled as precisely as possible giving preference to supplier-specific data. If (part of) the electricity is renewable it is important that no double counting occurs.\nRequirements for OEF studies\nFor electricity from the grid consumed upstream or within the defined Organisational boundary, supplier-specific data shall be used if available. If supplier-specific data is not available, country-specific consumption-mix data shall be used of the country in which the life cycle stages occur. For electricity consumed during the use stage of products, the energy mix shall reflect ratios of sales between countries or regions. Where such data are not available, the average EU consumption mix, or otherwise most representative mix, shall be used.\nFor renewable electricity from the grid consumed upstream or within the defined Organisational boundary, it shall be guaranteed that the renewable electricity (and associated impacts) is not double counted. A statement of the supplier shall be included as an annex to the OEF report, guaranteeing that the electricity supplied is effectively generated using renewable sources and is not sold to any other organisation, for example, by providing a Guarantee of Origin for production of renewable electricity (56).\nAccounting for Renewable Energy Generation\nSome organisations may produce energy from renewable sources in excess of the amount consumed. If excess renewable energy produced within the defined Organisational boundary is provided to a third party (e.g. put into the electricity grid), it may only be credited to the Organisation if the credit has not already been taken into account in other schemes. Documentation (e.g. Guarantee of Origin for production of renewable electricity (56)) is required to explain whether or not the credit is considered in the calculation.\nRequirements for OEF studies\nCredits associated with renewable energy generated by the Organisation shall be calculated with respect to the corrected (i.e. by subtracting the externally provided amount of renewable energy) average country-specific consumption-mix data of the country to which the electricity is provided. Where such data is not available, the corrected average EU consumption mix, or otherwise most representative mix shall be used. If no data are available on the calculation of corrected mixes, the uncorrected average mixes shall be used. It shall be transparently reported which energy mixes are assumed for the calculation of the benefits and whether or not these have been corrected.\nAccounting for Temporary (Carbon) Storage and Delayed Emissions\nTemporary carbon storage happens when a product “reduces the GHGs in the atmosphere” or creates “negative emissions”, by removing and storing carbon for a limited amount of time.\nDelayed emissions are emissions that are released over time, e.g. through long use or final disposal phases, versus a single emission at time t.\nTo explain this with an example: if you have timber furniture with a life span of 120 years, you store carbon during the 120 years of the furniture and emissions due to its disposal or incineration at end of life are delayed with 120 years. CO2 is taken up for the production of the timber furniture, is stored for 120 years and is released when the furniture is disposed or incinerated at its end of life. The CO2 is stored for 120 years and the delayed CO2 emissions occur only after 120 years (at the end of the life span of the furniture) instead of now.\nRequirements for OEF studies\nCredits associated with temporary (carbon) storage or delayed emissions shall not be considered in the calculation of the default EF impact categories. However, these may be included as “Additional Environmental Information”. Moreover, these shall be reported as “Additional Environmental Information” if required by the OEFSRs.\nBiogenic Carbon Removals and Emissions\nCarbon is, for example, removed from the atmosphere due to the growth of trees (CF (57) of – 1 CO2 eq. for global warming), while it is released during the burning of wood (CF of + 1 CO2 eq. for global warming).\nRequirements for OEF studies\nRemovals and emissions for biogenic carbon sources shall be identified separately in the Resource Use and Emissions Profile (58).\nDirect Land Use Change (Impact on Climate Change): the impact of land use change on climate change results basically from a change in carbon stocks in land. Direct Land Use Change occurs as the results of a transformation from one land use type into another, which takes place in a unique land cover, possibly incurring changes in the carbon stock of that specific land, but not leading to a change in another system. For details, see Annex VI.\nIndirect Land Use Change (Impact on Climate Change): the impact of land use change on climate change results basically from a change in carbon stocks in land. Indirect Land Use Change occurs when a certain change in land use induces changes outside the OEF boundaries, i.e. in other land use types. As there is no agreed methodology on indirect land use change in the context of the Environmental Footprint, indirect land use change shall not be included in the greenhouse gas calculations in the OEF.\nRequirements for OEF studies\nGreenhouse gas emissions from direct land use change shall be allocated to products for (i) 20 years after the land use change occurred or (ii) a single harvest period from the extraction of the evaluated product (even if longer than 20 years) (59) and the longest period shall be chosen. For details see Annex VI. Greenhouse gas emissions from indirect land use change shall not be considered unless OEFSRs explicitly require to do so. In that case, indirect land use change shall be reported separately as Additional Environmental Information, but it shall not be included in the calculation of the greenhouse gas impact category.\n5.4.5   Modelling Transport Scenarios\nThe modelling of transport across the life cycle of the products provided by the Organisation requires that scenarios be defined. The following parameters shall/should (case specific, see below) be taken into account:\n1.\nTransport mode: the mode of transport shall be taken into account, e.g. by land (truck, rail, pipe), by water (boat, ferry, barge), or air (airplane);\n2.\nVehicle type and fuel consumption: the type of vehicle and the fuel consumption when fully loaded and empty shall be taken into account. An adjustment shall be applied to the consumption of a fully-loaded vehicle according to the load rate (example see below);\n3.\nLoad rate\n (60): environmental impacts are directly linked to the actual load rate, therefore the load rate shall be considered.\n4.\nNumber of empty returns: the number of empty returns should be taken into account when applicable, i.e. the ratio of the distance travelled to collect the next load after unloading the product to the distance travelled to transport the product. The kilometres travelled by the empty vehicle should also be allocated to the considered product. Specific values shall be developed by country and by type of transported product.\n5.\nTransport distance: transport distances shall be documented applying average transport distances specific to the context being considered.\n6.\nAllocation\n (61)\nof impacts from transport: where multiple goods are transported, it may be necessary to allocate a share of the transportation impacts to the Organisation based on the load-limiting factor. The following requirements apply (62):\n—\nGoods transport: time or distance AND mass or volume (or in specific cases: pieces/pallets) of the transported good\n(a)\nIf the maximum authorised weight is reached before the vehicle has reached its maximum physical load: at 100 % of its volume (high-density products), allocation shall be based on the mass of the transported products;\n(b)\nIf the vehicle is loaded at 100 % of the volume but it does not reach the authorised maximum weight (low-density products), allocation shall be based on the volume of the transported products;\n—\nPersonal transport: time or distance;\n—\nStaff business travel: time, distance or costs.\n7.\nFuel production: fuel production shall be taken into account. Default values for fuel production can be found e.g. in the European Reference Life Cycle Database (ELCD) (63);\n8.\nInfrastructure: transport infrastructure, in particular for road, rail and boat transport, should be taken into account.\n9.\nResources and tools: the amount and type of additional resources and tools needed for logistic operations such as cranes and transporters should be taken into account.\nRequirements for OEF studies\nTransport parameters that shall be taken into account are: transport type, vehicle type and fuel consumption, load rate, number of empty returns when applicable and relevant, transport distance, allocation for goods transport based on load-limiting factor (i.e. mass for high-density products and volume for low-density products) and fuel production.\nTransport parameters that should be taken into account are: transport infrastructure, additional resources and tools such as cranes and transporters, allocation for personal transport based on time or distance, allocation for business travel by staff based on time or distance or economic value.\nThe impacts due to transport shall be expressed in the default reference units, i.e. tkm for goods and person-km for passenger transport. Any deviation from these default reference units shall be reported and justified.\nThe environmental impact due to transport shall be calculated by multiplying the impact per reference unit for each of the vehicle types by a) for goods: the distance and load and b) for persons: the distance and number of persons based on the defined transport scenarios.\nAdditional requirements for OEFSRs\nThe OEFSRs shall specify transport, distribution and storage scenarios to be included in the OEF study, if any.\n5.4.6   Modelling Scenarios for the Use Stage\nThe use stage of the goods/services included in the Product Portfolio of the Organisation begins when the consumer or end user takes possession of the product and ends when the used product is discarded for transport to a recycling or waste-treatment facility. Use scenarios need to be defined. These should take into account published technical information, including:\n—\nPublished international standards that specify guidance and requirements for the development of scenarios for the use stage and scenarios for (i.e. estimation of) the service life of the product ;\n—\nPublished national guidelines that specify guidance for the development of scenarios for the use stage and scenarios for (i.e. estimation of) the service life of the product;\n—\nPublished industry guidelines that specify guidance for the development of scenarios for the use stage and scenarios for (i.e. estimation of) the service life of the product;\n—\nMarket surveys or other market data.\nThe use scenario also needs to reflect whether or not the use of analysed products might lead to changes in the systems in which they are used. For example, energy-using products might affect the energy needed for heating/cooling in a building, or the weight of a car battery might affect the fuel consumption of the car.\nNote: The manufacturer’s recommended method to be applied in the use stage (e.g. cooking in an oven at a specified temperature for a specified time) might provide a basis for determining the use stage of a product. The actual usage pattern may, however, differ from those recommended and should be used if available.\nRequirements for OEF studies\nIf downstream stages are to be included in the OEF, then use profiles (i.e. the related scenarios and assumed service life) shall be specified for representative goods/services for the sector. All relevant assumptions for the use stage shall be documented. Where no method for determining the use stage of products has been established in accordance with the techniques specified in this OEF Guide, the approach taken in determining the use stage of products shall be established by the Organisation carrying out the study. Documentation of methods and assumptions shall be provided. Relevant influences on other systems due to the use of the products shall be included.\nAdditional requirements for OEFSRs\nThe OEFSR shall specify:\n—\nThe use scenario(s) to be included in the study, if any;\n—\nThe time span to be considered for the use stage.\nPublished technical information should be taken into account for the definition of the use-stage scenarios. Definition of the use profile should also take into account use/consumption patterns, location, time (day/night, summer/winter, week/weekend), and assumed service life for the use stage of products. The actual usage pattern of the products should be used if available.\n5.4.7   Modelling End-of-Life Scenarios\n (64)\nThe EOL stage of the products included in the Product Portfolio of the Organisation begins when the used products are discarded by the user and ends when the products are returned to nature as a waste or enter other products’ life cycles (i.e. as a recycled input). Examples of EOL processes that shall be included in the OEF study are:\n—\nCollection and transport of EOL products and packages;\n—\nDismantling of components from EOL products;\n—\nShredding and sorting;\n—\nConversion into recycled material;\n—\nAvoided production due to recycling or reuse;\n—\nComposting or other organic waste treatment methods;\n—\nLittering;\n—\nIncineration and disposal of bottom ash;\n—\nLandfilling and landfill operation and maintenance;\n—\nTransport required to EOL treatment facilities.\nAs there is often no information on exactly what will happen at the EOL of a product, EOL scenarios are to be defined.\nRequirements for OEF studies\nWaste flows arising from processes included in the system boundaries shall be modelled to the level of elementary flows.\nAdditional requirements for OEFSRs\nThe OEFSR shall define the EOL scenario(s) to be included in the OEF study, if any. These scenarios shall be based on current (year of analysed time interval) practice, technology and data.\n5.5   Nomenclature for the Resource Use and Emissions Profile\nUsing considerably different nomenclature and other conventions make Resource Use and Emissions Profiles incompatible on different levels, thereby strongly limiting the combined use of Resource Use and Emissions Profiles datasets from different sources or an efficient, electronic exchange of data among practitioners. This also hampers a clear unambiguous understanding and review of OEF reports. It is therefore important to use the same nomenclature in all OEF studies.\nRequirements for OEF studies\nAll resource use and emissions associated with the life cycle stages included in the defined system boundaries shall be documented using the International Reference Life Cycle Data System (ILCD) nomenclature and properties (65). (Annex IV details the ILCD nomenclature rules and properties).\nIf nomenclature and properties for a given flow are not available in the ILCD, the practitioner shall create an appropriate nomenclature and document the flow properties.\n5.6   Data Quality Requirements\nData quality indicators address how well the data fit the given process/activity in the Resource Use and Emissions Profile. This section describes the data quality requirements and how the data quality shall be assessed. Six quality criteria are adopted for OEF studies, of which five relate to the data and one to the method. These are summarised in Table 3. The representativeness (technological, geographical and time-related) characterises to what degree the processes and products selected are depicting the system analysed. Once the processes and products are chosen which represent the system analysed, and the Resource Use and Emissions Profile of these processes and products are inventoried, the completeness criterion evaluates to what degree the Resource Use and Emissions Profile of these processes and products covers all the emissions and resources of these processes and products.\nBesides these criteria, three more aspects are included in the quality assessment, i.e. documentation (compliance with ILCD format), compliance with ILCD nomenclature, and review. The latter three are not included within the semi-quantitative assessment of the data quality as described in the subsequent paragraphs. These however shall be fulfilled.\nTable 3\nData quality criteria, documentation, nomenclature and review\nData\n—\nTechnological representativeness (66)\n—\nGeographical representativeness (67)\n—\nTime-related representativeness (68)\n—\nCompleteness\n—\nParameter uncertainty (69)\nMethod\n—\nMethodological Appropriateness and Consistency (70) (The requirements as defined in Table 6 shall apply until end of 2015.

For OEF studies (claiming to be in line with this OEF Guide) intended for in-house applications, the specified data quality requirements should be met (i.e., are recommended), but are not mandatory. Any deviations from the requirements shall be documented. Data quality requirements apply to both specific data and generic data.\nThe following 6 criteria shall be adopted for semi-quantitative assessment of data quality in OEF studies: technological representativeness, geographical representativeness, time-related representativeness, completeness, parameter uncertainty and methodological appropriateness.\nIn the optional screening step (if conducted) a minimum “fair” quality data rating is required for data contributing to at least 90 % of the impact estimated for each EF impact category, as assessed via qualitative expert judgement.\nIn the final Resource Use and Emissions Profile, for the processes and/or activities accounting for at least 70 % of contributions to each EF impact category, both specific and generic data shall achieve at least an overall “good quality” level (77). A semi-quantitative assessment of data quality shall be performed and reported for these processes. At least 2/3 of the remaining 30 % (i.e. 70 % to 90 %) shall be modelled with at least “fair quality” data, as assessed via qualitative expert judgement. Remaining data (used for approximation and filling identified gaps (beyond 90 % contribution to environmental impacts)) shall be based on best available information. This is summarised in Table 4.\nThe data quality requirements for technological, geographical and time related representativeness shall be subject to review as part of the OEF study. The data quality requirements related to completeness, methodological appropriateness & consistency, and parameter uncertainty shall be met by sourcing generic data exclusively from data sources complying with the requirements of this OEF Guide.\nWith respect to the data quality criterion “methodological appropriateness and consistency”, the requirements as defined in Table 6 shall apply until end 2015. From 2016 onwards, full compliance with the OEF methodology will be required.\nWith respect to the level at which assessment of data quality shall be conducted:\n—\nFor generic data: data quality shall be conducted at the level of the input flows, e.g. purchased paper used in a printing office;\n—\nFor specific data: data quality shall be conducted at the level of an individual process or aggregated processes, or at the level of individual input flows.\nAdditional requirements for OEFSRs\nThe OEFSR shall provide further guidance on data quality assessment scoring with respect to time-related, geographical and technological representativeness. The OEFSR shall for example specify which data quality score related to time representativeness should be assigned to a dataset representing a given year.\nThe OEFSR may specify additional criteria for the assessment of data quality (compared to the default criteria).\nThe OEFSR may specify more stringent data quality requirements regarding e.g.:\n—\nForeground processes (78)\n—\nBackground processes (both upstream and downstream stages);\n—\nKey supply chain processes/activities for the sector;\n—\nKey EF impact categories for the sector.\nExample for determining the data quality rating\nComponent\nAchieved quality level\nCorresponding quality rating\nTechnological representativeness (TeR)\ngood\n2\nGeographical representativeness (GR)\ngood\n2\nTime-related representativeness (TiR)\nfair\n3\nCompleteness (C)\ngood\n2\nParameter uncertainty (P)\ngood\n2\nMethodological appropriateness and consistency (M)\ngood\n2\nDQR = 2,2 corresponds to an overall “good quality”.\n5.7   Specific Data Collection\nSpecific data are data directly measured or collected representative of activities at a specific facility or set of facilities. The data should include all known inputs and outputs for the processes. Inputs are (for example) use of energy, water, materials, etc. Outputs are the products, co-products, emissions and waste. Emissions can be divided into three categories: emissions to air, to water and to soil. Specific data can be collected, measured or calculated using activity data and related emission factors. It should be noted that emission factors may be derived from generic data subject to the data quality requirements.\nData Collection - Measurements and Tailored Questionnaires\nThe most representative sources of data for specific processes are measurements directly performed on the process, or obtained from facility operators via interviews or questionnaires. The data may need scaling, aggregation or other forms of mathematical treatment to bring them in relation to the Product Portfolio.\nTypical specific data sources include:\n—\nProcess or plant level consumption data;\n—\nBills and stock/inventory-changes of consumables;\n—\nEmission declared/reported to authorities for legal purposes such as permits or fulfilling reporting requirements like according to the European Pollutant Release and Transfer Register (E-PRTR), or the predecessor European Pollutant Emission Register (EPER);\n—\nEmission measurements (concentrations plus corresponding off-gas and wastewater amounts);\n—\nComposition of waste and products;\n—\nProcurement and sale department(s)/unit(s).\nRequirements for OEF studies\nSpecific data (79) shall be obtained for all processes/activities within the defined Organisational boundary and for background processes/activities where appropriate (80). However, if generic data are more representative or appropriate than specific data (to be reported and justified) for foreground processes, generic data shall also be used for the foreground processes.\nAdditional requirements for OEFSRs\nThe OEFSR shall:\n1.\nSpecify for which processes specific data shall be collected;\n2.\nSpecify the requirements for the collection of specific data for each process/activity;\n3.\nDefine the data collection requirements for the following aspects for each site:\n—\nTarget stage(s) and the data collection coverage;\n—\nLocation of data collection (e.g. domestically, internationally, representative factories);\n—\nTerm of data collection (e.g. year, season, month, etc.);\n—\nWhen the location or term of data collection shall be limited to a certain range, provide a justification and show that the collected data will serve as sufficient samples.\nNote: The basic rule is that the location of data collection is all target areas and the term of data collection is one year or more.\n5.8   Generic data collection\nGeneric data refer to data that are not based on direct measurements or calculation for the respective specific process(es). Generic data can be either sector-specific, i.e. specific to the sector being considered for the OEF study, or multi-sector. Examples of generic data include:\n—\nData from literature or scientific papers;\n—\nIndustry-average life cycle data from life cycle inventory databases, industry association reports, government statistics, etc.\nSourcing generic data\nTo ensure comparability, generic data shall fulfil the data quality requirements specified in this OEF Guide. Generic data should where available be sourced from the data sources specified in this OEF Guide (see below).\nRemaining generic data should preferentially be sourced from:\n—\nDatabases provided by international governmental organisations (for example IEA, FAO, UNEP);\n—\nNational governmental LCI database projects (for data specific to the database host country);\n—\nNational governmental LCI database projects;\n—\nOther third-party LCI databases;\n—\nPeer-reviewed literature.\nPotential sources of generic data can be found in e.g. the Resource Directory of the European Platform on LCA (81). If the necessary data cannot be found in the above listed sources, other sources may be used.\nRequirements for OEF studies\nGeneric data should be used only for processes and activities outside the defined Organisational boundary or for providing emission factors for activity data describing foreground processes. Moreover, for those processes and activities within the Organisational boundaries which are better represented by generic data, generic data shall be used (see previous requirement). When available, sector-specific generic data shall be used instead of multi-sector generic data. All generic data shall fulfil the data quality requirements specified in this OEF Guide. The sources of the data used shall be clearly documented and reported in the OEF report.\nGeneric data (provided they fulfil the data quality requirements specified in this OEF Guide) should, where available, be sourced from:\n—\nData developed in line with the requirements for the relevant OEFSRs;\n—\nData developed in line with the requirements for OEF studies;\n—\nData developed in line with the requirements for Product Environmental Footprint studies;\n—\nInternational Reference Life Cycle Data System (ILCD) Data Network (giving preference to “ILCD-compliance” over “ILCD Data Network – entry level” datasets) (82);\n—\nEuropean Reference Life Cycle Database (ELCD) (81).\nAdditional requirements for OEFSRs\nThe OEFSR shall specify:\n—\nWhere the use of generic data is permitted as an approximation for a substance for which specific data are not available;\n—\nThe level of required similarities between the actual substance and the generic substance;\n—\nThe combination of more than one generic dataset, if necessary.\n5.9   Dealing with Remaining Data Gaps/Missing Data\nData gaps exist when there is no specific or generic data available that is sufficiently representative of the process/activity in question. For most processes/activities where data are missing, it should be possible to obtain sufficient information to provide a reasonable estimate of the missing data. Therefore, there should be few, if any, data gaps in the final Resource Use and Emissions Profile. Missing information can be of different types and have different characteristics, each requiring separate approaches to resolve.\nData gaps may exist when:\n—\nData do not exist for a specific input/output, or\n—\nData exist for a similar process but:\n—\nThe data have been generated in a different region;\n—\nThe data have been generated using a different technology;\n—\nThe data have been generated in a different time period.\nRequirements for OEF studies\nAny data gaps shall be filled using best available generic or extrapolated data (83). The contribution of such data (including gaps in generic data) shall not account for more than 10 % of the overall contribution to each EF impact category considered. This is reflected in the data quality requirements, according to which 10 % of the data can be chosen from the best available data (without any further data quality requirements).\nAdditional requirements for OEFSRs\nThe OEFSR shall address potential data gaps and provide detailed guidance for filling these gaps.\n5.10   Data Gathering Related to the Next Methodological Phases in an Organisation Environmental Footprint Study.\nFigure 4 focuses on the data collection step to be taken when developing an OEF study. The “shall/should/may” requirements are summarised for both specific and generic data. The figure moreover indicates the link between the data collection step and the development of the Resource Use and Emissions Profile and subsequent EF impact assessment.\nFigure 4\nRelationship between data collection, Resource Use and Emissions Profile and EF impact assessment\n5.11   Handling Multi-Functional Processes and Facilities\nIf a process or facility provides more than one function, i.e. it delivers several goods and/or services (\"co-products\"), it is “multifunctional”. In these situations, all inputs and emissions linked to the process must be partitioned between the product of interest and the other co-products in a principled manner. Similarly, where a jointly owned and/or operated facility produces multiple products, or when heat and electricity are simultaneously produced via co-generation, it may be necessary to partition related inputs and emissions among the products within the defined Product Portfolios of different organisations. However, in case a process contributes to multiple products of the Product Portfolio of an Organisation and the OEF study covers the full Product Portfolio of that Organisation, allocation between the products is not required.\nSystems involving multi-functionality of processes shall be modelled in accordance with the following decision hierarchy, with additional guidance at the sectorial level provided by OEFSRs if available. Figure 5 provides a decision tree for handling multi-functional processes.\n“Some outputs may be partly co-products and partly waste. In such cases, it is necessary to identify the ratio between co-products and waste since the inputs and outputs shall be allocated to the co-products part only.\nAllocation procedures shall be uniformly applied to similar inputs and outputs of the system under consideration.” (ISO 14044:2006, 14)\nDecision Hierarchy\nI)   Subdivision or system Expansion\nWherever possible, subdivision or system expansion should be used to avoid allocation. Subdivision refers to disaggregating multifunctional processes or facilities to isolate the input flows directly associated with each process or facility output. System expansion refers to expanding the system by including additional functions related to the co-products. It shall be investigated first whether the analysed process can be subdivided or expanded. Where subdivision is possible, inventory data should be collected only for those unit processes (84) directly attributable (85) to the goods/services of concern. Or if the system can be expanded, the additional functions shall be included in the analysis with results communicated for the expanded system as a whole rather than on an individual co-product level.\nII)   Allocation Based on a Relevant Underlying Physical Relationship\nWhere subdivision or system expansion cannot be applied, allocation should be applied: the inputs and outputs of the system should be partitioned between its different products or functions in a way that reflects relevant underlying physical relationships between them. (ISO 14044:2006, 14)\nAllocation based on a relevant underlying physical relationship refers to partitioning the input and output flows of a multi-functional process or facility in accordance with a relevant, quantifiable physical relationship between the process inputs and co-product outputs (for example, a physical property of the inputs and outputs that is relevant to the function provided by the co-product of interest). Allocation based on a physical relationship can be modelled using direct substitution if a product can be identified that is directly substituted (86).\nCan a direct substitution-effect be robustly modelled? This can be demonstrated by proving that (1) there is a direct, empirically demonstrable substitution effect, AND (2) the substituted product can be modelled and the resource use and emissions profile data subtracted in a directly representative manner:\n—\nIf yes (i.e. both conditions are verified), model the substitution effect.\nOr\nCan input/output flows be allocated based on some other relevant underlying physical relationship that relates the inputs and outputs to the function provided by the system? This can be demonstrated by proving that a relevant physical relationship can be defined by which to allocate the flows attributable to the provision of the defined function of the product system (87):\n—\nIf yes, allocate based on this physical relationship.\nIII)   Allocation Based on Some Other Relationship\nAllocation based on some other relationship may be possible. For example, economic allocation refers to allocating inputs and outputs associated with multi-functional processes to the co-product outputs in proportion to their relative market values. The market price of the co-functions should refer to the specific condition and point at which the co-products are produced. Allocation based on economic value shall only be applied when (I and II) are not possible. In any case, a clear justification for having discarded I and II and for having selected a certain allocation rule in step III shall be provided, to ensure the physical representativeness of the OEF results as far as possible.\nAllocation based on some other relationship can be approached in one of the following alternative ways:\nCan an indirect substitution (88) effect be identified? AND can the substituted product be modelled and the inventory subtracted in a reasonably representative manner?\n—\nIf yes (i.e. both conditions are verified), model the indirect substitution effect.\nOr\nCan the input/output flows be allocated between the products and functions on the basis of some other relationship (e.g. the relative economic value of the co-products)?\n—\nIf yes, allocate products and functions on the basis of the identified relationship\nDealing with multi-functionality of products is particularly challenging when recycling or energy recovery of one (or more) of these products is involved as the systems tend to get rather complex. Annex V provides an approach that shall be used to estimate the overall emissions associated to a certain process involving recycling and/or energy recovery. The equation described in Annex V shall be applied for EOL. These moreover also relate to waste flows generated within the system boundaries. The decision hierarchy described in this section also applies for product recycling.\nExamples of direct and indirect substitution\nDirect Substitution:\nDirect substitution may be modelled as a form of allocation based on an underlying physical relationship when a direct, empirically-demonstrable substitution effect can be identified. For example, when manure nitrogen is applied to agricultural land, directly substituting for an equivalent amount of the specific fertilizer nitrogen that the farmer would otherwise have applied, the animal husbandry system from which the manure is derived is credited for the displaced fertilizer production (taking into account differences in transportation, handling, and emissions).\nIndirect Substitution:\nIndirect substitution may be modelled as a form of “allocation based on some other relationship” when a co-product is assumed to displace a marginal market-equivalent product or an average market-equivalent product via market-mediated processes. For example, when animal manure is packaged and sold for use in home gardening, the animal husbandry system from which the manure is derived is credited for the market-average home gardening fertilizer that is assumed to have been displaced (taking into account differences in transportation, handling, and emissions).\nFigure 5\nDecision tree for handling multi-functional processes\nRequirements for OEF studies\nThe OEF multi-functionality decision hierarchy shall be applied for resolving all multi-functionality problems at both process and facility-level: (1) subdivision or system expansion; (2) allocation based on a relevant underlying physical relationship (including (a) direct substitution or (b) some relevant underlying physical relationship); (3) allocation based on some other relationship (including (a) indirect substation or (b) some other relevant underlying relationship).\nAll choices made in this context shall be reported and justified with respect to the overarching goal of ensuring physically representative, environmentally relevant results.\nIf co-products are partly co-products and partly waste, all inputs and outputs shall be allocated to the co-products only.\nAllocation procedures shall be uniformly applied to similar inputs and outputs.\nFor multi-functionality problems including recycling or energy recovery at EOL or for waste flows within the system boundaries, the equation described in Annex V shall be applied.\nAdditional requirements for OEFSRs\nThe OEFSR shall further specify multi-functionality solutions for application within the defined Organisational boundaries and, where appropriate, for upstream and downstream stages. If feasible/appropriate, the OEFSR may further provide specific substitution scenarios or factors to be used in case of allocation solutions. All such multi-functionality solutions specified in the OEFSR shall be clearly justified with reference to the OEF multi-functionality solution hierarchy.\nWhere sub-division is applied, the OEFSR shall specify which processes are to be sub-divided and according to what principles.\nWhere allocation by physical relationship is to be applied, the OEFSR shall specify the relevant underlying physical relationships to be considered, and establish the relevant allocation factors.\nWhere allocation by some other relationship is to be applied, the OEFSR shall specify the relationship and establish the relevant allocation factors. For example, in the case of economic allocation, the OEFSR shall specify the rules for determining the economic values of co-products.\nFor multi-functionality in EOL situations, the OEFSR shall specify how to calculate the different parts within the provided mandatory formula.\n6.   ORGANISATION ENVIRONMENTAL FOOTPRINT IMPACT ASSESSMENT\nOnce the Resource Use and Emissions Profile has been compiled, the EF impact assessment shall be undertaken to calculate the environmental footprint of the Organisation using the selected EF impact categories and models. EF impact assessment includes two mandatory and two optional steps. The EF Impact Assessment does not intend to replace other (regulatory) tools that have a different scope and objective such as (Environmental) Risk Assessment ((E)RA), site specific Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) or Health and Safety regulations at product level or related to safety at the workplace. Especially, the EF Impact Assessment has not the objective to predict if at any specific location at any specific time thresholds are exceeded and actual impacts occur. In contrast it describes the existing pressures on the environment. Thus, the EF Impact Assessment is complementary to other well-proven tools, adding the life cycle perspective.\n6.1   Classification and Characterisation (mandatory)\nRequirements for OEF studies\nThe EF impact assessment shall include:\n—\nClassification;\n—\nCharacterisation.\n6.1.1   Classification of Environmental Footprint Flows\nClassification requires assigning the material/energy inputs and outputs inventoried in the Resource Use and Emissions Profile to the relevant EF impact category. For example, during the classification phase, all inputs/outputs that result in greenhouse gas emissions are assigned to the Climate Change category. Similarly, those that result in emissions of ozone depleting substances are classified accordingly. In some cases, an input/output may contribute to more than one EF impact category (for example, chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) contribute to both Climate Change and Ozone Depletion).\nIt is important to express the data in terms of constituent substances for which characterisation factors (CFs) (see next section) are available. For example, data for a composite NPK fertiliser should be disaggregated and classified according to its N, P, and K fractions, because each constituent element will contribute to different EF impact categories.\nRequirements for OEF studies\nAll inputs/outputs inventoried during the compilation of the Resource Use and Emissions Profile shall be assigned to the EF impact categories to which they contribute (“classification”) using the classification scheme as provided at http://lct.jrc.ec.europa.eu/assessment/projects.\nAs part of the classification of the Resource Use and Emissions Profile, data should be expressed in terms of constituent substances for which CFs are available.\nIf the Resource Use and Emissions Profile data are drawn from existing public or commercial life cycle inventory databases - where classification has already been implemented - it shall be assured that the classification and linked EF impact assessment pathways correspond to the requirements of this OEF Guide.\nExample: classification step in the EF impact assessment\nClassification of data in the climate change impact category\nCO2\nYes\nCH4\nYes\nSO2\nNo\nNOx\nNo\nClassification of data in the acidification impact category\nCO2\nNo\nCH4\nNo\nSO2\nYes\nNOx\nYes\n6.1.2   Characterisation of Environmental Footprint Flows\nCharacterisation refers to the calculation of the magnitude of the contribution of each classified input/output to their respective EF impact categories, and aggregation of the contributions within each category. This is carried out by multiplying the values in the Resource Use and Emissions Profile by the relevant CFs for each EF impact category.\nThe CFs are substance- or resource- specific. They represent the impact intensity of a substance relative to a common reference substance for an EF impact category (impact category indicator). For example, in the case of calculating climate change impacts, all greenhouse gas emissions inventoried in the Resource Use and Emissions Profile are weighted in terms of their impact intensity relative to carbon dioxide, which is the reference substance for this category. This allows for the aggregation of impact potentials and expression in terms of a single equivalent substance (in this case, CO2-equivalents) for each EF impact category. For example, the CF expressed as global warming potential for methane equals 25 CO2 – equivalents and its impact on global warming is thus 25 times higher than of CO2 (i.e. CF of 1 CO2-equivalent).\nRequirements for OEF studies\nAll classified inputs/outputs in each EF impact category shall be assigned CFs representing the contribution per unit of input/output to the category, using the provided CFs (available online at http://lct.jrc.ec.europa.eu/assessment/projects). EF impact assessment results shall subsequently be calculated for each EF impact category by multiplying the amount of each input/output by its CF and summing the contributions of all inputs/outputs within each category in order to obtain a single measure expressed in terms of an appropriate reference unit.\nIf CFs from the default method are not available for certain flows (e.g. a group of chemicals) of the Resource Use and Emissions Profile, then other approaches may be used for characterising these flows. In such circumstances, this shall be reported under “Additional Environmental Information”. The characterisation models shall be scientifically and technically valid, and based upon distinct, identifiable environmental mechanisms (89) or reproducible empirical observations.\nExample: characterisation step in the EF Impact Assessment\nClimate Change:\nAmount (kg)\nCF\nCO2-equivalents (metric tonnes)\nCO2\n5 132\n×\n1\n=\n5,132 t CO2-eq.\nCH4\n8,2\n×\n25\n=\n0,205 t CO2-eq.\nSO2\n3,9\n×\n0\n=\n0 t CO2-eq.\nNO2\n26,8\n×\n0\n=\n0 t CO2-eq.\nTotal\n=\n5,337 t CO2-eq.\nAcidification:\nAmount (kg)\nCF\nMol H+ equivalents\nCO2\n5 132\n×\n0\n=\n0 Mol H+ eq.\nCH4\n8,2\n×\n0\n=\n0 Mol H+ eq.\nSO2\n3,9\n×\n1,31\n=\n5,109 Mol H+ eq.\nNO2\n26,8\n×\n0,74\n=\n19,832 Mol H+ eq.\nTotal\n=\n24,941 Mol H+ eq.\n6.2   Normalisation and Weighting (recommended/optional)\nFollowing the two mandatory steps of classification and characterisation, the EF impact assessment may be complemented with normalisation and weighting, which are recommended/optional steps.\n6.2.1   Normalisation of Environmental Footprint Impact Assessment Results (recommended)\nNormalisation is not a required but recommended step in which the EF impact assessment results are multiplied by normalisation factors in order to calculate and compare the magnitude of their contributions to the EF impact categories relative to a reference unit (typically the pressure related to that category caused by a whole country or an average citizen over one year). As a result, dimensionless normalised OEF results are obtained. These reflect the burdens attributable to a product relative to the reference unit, such as per capita for a given year and region. This allows the relevance of the contributions made by organisational processes/activities to be compared to the reference unit of the EF impact categories considered.\nNormalised OEF results do not, however, indicate the severity/relevance of the respective impacts, nor can they be aggregated across EF impact categories.\nRequirements for OEF studies\nNormalisation is not a required but recommended step for OEF studies. If it is applied, the normalised OEF results shall be reported under “Additional Environmental Information”, with all methods and assumptions documented. The normalised results shall not be aggregated as this implicitly applies weighting. Results of the EF impact assessment prior to normalisation shall be reported alongside the normalised results.\n6.2.2   Weighting of Environmental Footprint Impact Assessment Results (optional)\nWeighting is not a required but optional step that may support the interpretation and communication of the results of the analysis. In this step, (normalised) environmental footprint results are multiplied by a set of weighting factors which reflect the perceived relative importance of the EF impact categories considered. Weighted OEF results can then be compared to assess their relative importance. They can also be aggregated across EF impact categories to obtain several aggregated values or a single overall impact indicator.\nWeighting requires making value judgements as to the respective importance of the EF impact categories considered. These judgements may be based on expert opinion, cultural/political view points, or economic considerations. (90)\nRequirements for OEF studies\nWeighting is not a required but optional step for OEF studies. If weighting is applied, the results shall be reported as “Additional Environmental Information”, with all methods and assumption documented. Results of the EF impact assessment prior to weighting shall be reported alongside the weighted results.\nThe application of normalisation and weighting steps in OEF studies shall be consistent with the defined goals and scope of the study, including the intended applications. (91)\n7.   ORGANISATION ENVIRONMENTAL FOOTPRINT INTERPRETATION\n7.1   General\nInterpretation of the results of the OEF (92) study serves two purposes:\n—\nThe first is to ensure that the OEF model corresponds to the goals and quality requirements of the study. In this sense, OEF interpretation may inform iterative improvements of the OEF model until all goals and requirements are met;\n—\nThe second purpose is to derive robust conclusions and recommendations from the analysis, for example in support of environmental improvements.\nRequirements for OEF studies\nThe interpretation phase of an OEF study shall include the following steps: “assessment of the robustness of the OEF model”; “Identification of hotspots”; “estimation of uncertainty”; and “conclusions, limitations and recommendations”.\n7.2   Assessment of the Robustness of the Organisation Environmental Footprint Model\nThis shall include an assessment of the extent to which methodological choices influence the analytical outcomes. Tools that should be used to assess the robustness of the OEF model include:\n—\nCompleteness checks: assess the Resource Use and Emissions Profile data to ensure that it is complete relative to the defined goals, scope, system boundaries and quality criteria. This includes completeness of process coverage (i.e. all relevant processes at each supply chain stage considered have been included) and input/output coverage (i.e. material or energy inputs and emissions associated with each process have been included);\n—\nSensitivity checks: assess the extent to which the results are determined by specific methodological choices and the impact of implementing alternative choices where these are identifiable. It is useful to structure sensitivity checks for each phase of the OEF study, including goal and scope definition, the Resource Use and Emissions Profile, and the EF impact assessment;\n—\nConsistency checks: assess the extent to which assumptions, methods, and data quality considerations have been applied consistently throughout the OEF study.\nRequirements for OEF studies\nThe assessment of the robustness of the OEF model shall include an assessment of the extent to which methodological choices such as system boundaries, data sources, allocation choices and coverage of EF impact categories influence the results. These choices shall correspond to the requirements specified in this OEF Guide and shall be appropriate to the context. Tools that should be used to assess the robustness of the OEF model are completeness checks, sensitivity checks and consistency checks. Any issues flagged in this evaluation should be used to inform iterative improvements to the OEF study.\n7.3   Identification of Hotspots (Significant Issues)\nOnce it has been ensured that the OEF model (e.g. choice of system boundaries, data sources and allocation choices) is robust and conforms to all aspects defined in the goal and scope definition phases, the next step is to identify the main contributing elements to the OEF results. This step may also be referred to as “hotspot” or “weak point” analysis. Contributing elements may be specific elements of the Product Portfolio, life cycle stages, processes, or individual material/energy inputs/outputs associated with a given stage or process in the Organisation supply chain. These are identified by systematically reviewing the OEF study results. Graphical tools may be particularly useful in this context. Such analyses provide the necessary basis to identify improvement potentials associated with specific management interventions.\nRequirements for OEF studies\nOEF results shall be evaluated to assess the effect of supply-chain hotspots/weak points at the level of the input/output, process, and supply chain stage and to assess potential for improvements.\nAdditional requirements for OEFSR\nThe OEFSR shall identify the most relevant EF impact categories for the sector. Normalisation and weighting may be used to achieve such prioritisation.\n7.4   Estimation of Uncertainty\nEstimating the uncertainties of the final OEF results supports iterative improvement of OEF studies. It also helps the target audience to assess the robustness and applicability of the OEF study results.\nThere are two key sources of uncertainty in OEF studies:\n(1)\nStochastic uncertainties (both parameter and model) for “Resource Use and Emissions Profile” data\nIn practice, it may be difficult to access estimates of uncertainty for all data used in an OEF study. At a minimum, efforts to accurately characterise stochastic uncertainty and its impact on modelling outcomes should focus on those processes identified as environmentally significant in the EF impact assessment and interpretation phases.\n(2)\nChoice-related uncertainties\nChoices-related uncertainties arise from methodological choices including modelling principles, system boundaries, choice of EF impact assessment models, and other assumptions related to time, technology, geography, etc. These are not readily amenable to statistical description, but rather can only be characterised via scenario model assessments (e.g. modelling worst and best-case scenarios for significant processes) and sensitivity analyses.\nRequirements for OEF studies\nAt least a qualitative description of the uncertainties of the final OEF results shall be provided for both data and choice related uncertainties separately, in order to facilitate an overall appreciation of the uncertainties of the study results.\nAdditional requirements for OEFSRs\nThe OEFSR shall describe the uncertainties common to the sector and should identify the range in which results could be seen as not being significantly different in comparisons or comparative assertions.\nTIP: Quantitative uncertainty assessments may be calculated for variance associated with the “Resource Use and Emissions Profile” data using, for example, Monte Carlo simulations or other appropriate tools. The influence of choice-related uncertainties should be estimated at the upper and lower bounds through sensitivity analyses based on using scenario assessments. These should be clearly documented and reported.\n7.5   Conclusions, Recommendations and Limitations\nThe final aspect of the interpretation phase is to draw conclusions based on the results, answer the questions posed at the outset of the OEF study, and advance recommendations appropriate to the intended audience and context whilst explicitly taking into account any limitations to the robustness and applicability of the results. The OEF needs to be seen as complementary to other assessments and instruments such as site specific environmental impact assessments or chemical risk assessments.\nPotential improvements should be identified such as, for example, cleaner technology techniques, changes in product design, supply chain management, environmental management systems (e.g., Eco-Management and Audit Scheme (EMAS) or ISO 14001), or other systematic approaches.\nRequirements for OEF studies\nConclusions, recommendations and limitations shall be described in accordance with the defined goals and scope of the OEF study. OEF studies to support comparative assertions (93) intended to be disclosed to the public shall be based both on this OEF Guide AND related OEFSRs.\nAs required by ISO 14044:2006, for any comparative assertions intended to be disclosed to the public, it shall be carefully considered whether any differences in data quality and methodological choices used to model the compared organisations may influence the comparability of the outcomes. Any inconsistencies in defining system boundaries, inventory data quality, or EF impact assessment shall be considered and documented/reported.\nConclusions derived from the OEF study should include a summary of identified supply chain “hotspots” and the potential improvements associated with management interventions.\n8.

ORGANISATION ENVIRONMENTAL FOOTPRINT CRITICAL REVIEW\n9.1   General\n (96)\nA critical review is essential to ensuring the reliability of the OEF results and to improving the quality of the OEF study.\nRequirements for OEF studies\nAny OEF study intended for internal communication claiming to be in line with the OEF Guide and any OEF study for external communication shall be critically reviewed in order to ensure that:\n—\nThe methods used to carry out the OEF study are consistent with this OEF Guide;\n—\nThe methods used to carry out the OEF study are scientifically and technically valid;\n—\nThe data used are appropriate, reasonable and meet the defined data quality requirements;\n—\nThe interpretation of the results reflects the limitations identified;\n—\nThe study report is transparent, accurate and consistent.\n9.2   Review Type\nThe most suitable review type that provides the required minimum guarantee of quality assurance is an independent external review. The type of review conducted should be informed by the goals and intended applications of the OEF study.\nRequirements for OEF studies\nUnless otherwise specified in relevant policy instruments, any OEF study intended for external communication shall be critically reviewed by at least one independent and qualified external reviewer (or review team).

GLOSSARY\nAdditional Environmental Information – Environmental footprint impact categories and other environmental indicators that are calculated and communicated alongside OEF results.\nAcidification – EF impact category that addresses impacts due to acidifying substances in the environment. Emissions of NOx, NH3 and SOx lead to releases of hydrogen ions (H+) when the gases are mineralised. The protons contribute to the acidification of soils and water when they are released in areas where the buffering capacity is low, resulting in forest decline and lakes acidification.\nAllocation – An approach to solving multi-functionality problems. It refers to partitioning the input or output flows of a process, a product system or a facility between the system under study and one or more other systems” (based on ISO 14040:2006).\nAttributional - Refers to process-based modelling intended to provide a static representation of average conditions, excluding market-mediated effects.\nAverage Data – Refers to a production-weighted average of specific data.\nBackground Process – Refers to those processes of the Organisations supply chain for which no direct access to information is possible. For example, most of the upstream supply-chain processes and generally all processes further downstream will be considered part of the background process.\nBusiness-to-Business (B2B) – Describes transactions between businesses, such as between a manufacturer and a wholesaler, or between a wholesaler and a retailer.\nBusiness-to-Consumers (B2C) – Describes transactions between business and consumers, such as between retailers and consumers. According to ISO 14025:2006, a consumer is defined as “an individual member of the general public purchasing or using goods, property or services for private purposes”.\nCharacterisation - Calculation of the magnitude of the contribution of each classified input/output to their respective EF impact categories, and aggregation of contributions within each category. This requires a linear multiplication of the inventory data with characterisation factors for each substance and EF impact category of concern. For example, with respect to the EF impact category “climate change”, CO2 is chosen as the reference substance and Tonne CO2-equivalents as the reference unit.\nCharacterisation factor – Factor derived from a characterisation model which is applied to convert an assigned Resource Use and Emissions Profile result to the common unit of the EF category indicator. (based on ISO 14040:2006)\nClassification - Assigning the material/energy inputs and outputs inventoried in the Resource and Emissions Profile to EF impact categories according to each substance’s potential to contribute to each of the EF impact categories considered.\nCo-function – Any of two or more functions resulting from the same unit process or product system.\nComparative Assertion – An environmental claim regarding the superiority or equivalence of an organisation versus a competing organisation providing the same products, based on the results of an OEF study and supporting OEFSRs. (based on ISO 14040:2006).\nComparison – A comparison (graphically or otherwise) of two or more organisations regarding the results of their OEF, taking into account the OEFSRs, not including a comparative assertion.\nCo-product – Any of two or more products resulting from the same unit process or product system. (ISO 14044:2006)\nCradle to Cradle - A specific kind of cradle-to-grave, where the end-of-life disposal step for the product is a recycling process.\nCradle to Gate - A partial Organisation supply chain, from the extraction of raw materials (cradle) up to the manufacturer’s “gate”. The distribution, storage, use stage and end-of-life stage of the supply chain are omitted.\nCradle to Grave - An Organisation supply chain that includes raw material extraction, processing, distribution, storage, use, and disposal or recycling stages. All relevant inputs and outputs are considered for all of the stages of the life cycle.\nCritical review – Process intended to ensure consistency between an OEF study and the principles and requirements of this OEF Guide and related OEFSRs (if available). (based on ISO 14040:2006)\nData Quality - Characteristics of data that relate to their ability to satisfy stated requirements. (ISO 14040:2006) Data quality covers various aspects, such as technological, geographical and time-related representativeness, as well as completeness and precision of the inventory data.\nDelayed emissions - Emissions that are released over time, e.g. through long use or final disposal phases, versus a single emission at time t.\nDirect Land Use Changes (dLUC) – The transformations from one land use type into another which takes place in a unique land area, possibly incurring changes in the carbon stock of that specific land, and does not drive to a change in another system.\nDirectly attributable – Refers to a process, activity or impact occurring within the defined Organisational Boundary.\nDownstream – Occurring along a product supply chain after exiting the Organisational Boundary.\nEcological footprint - Refers to “the area of productive land and water ecosystems required to produce the resources that the population consumes and assimilate the wastes that the population produces, wherever on Earth the land and water is located” (Wackernagel and Rees 1996). The environmental footprint according to this OEF Guide is not equal to the ecological footprint of Wackernagel and Rees: the main differences are highlighted in annex X of the PEF Guide. (EC-JRC-IES, 2012)\nEcotoxicity – EF impact category that addresses the toxic impacts on an ecosystem, which damage individual species and change the structure and function of the ecosystem. Ecotoxicity is a result of a variety of different toxicological mechanisms caused by the release of substances with a direct effect on the health of the ecosystem.\nElementary flows - In the Resource Use and Emissions Profile, elementary flows include (ISO 14040, p.3) “material or energy entering the system being studied that has been drawn from the environment without previous human transformation, or material or energy leaving the system being studied that is released into the environment without subsequent human transformation.” Elementary flows include, for example, resources taken from nature or emissions into air, water, soil that are directly linked to the characterisation factors of the EF impact categories.\nEnvironmental aspect - An element of an Organisation’s activities or products that has or can have an impact on the environment (including human health). (EMAS regulation)\nEnvironmental Footprint (EF) impact assessment - Phase of the OEF analysis aimed at understanding and evaluating the magnitude and significance of the potential environmental impacts for a system throughout the life cycle (ISO 14044:2006). The EF impact assessment methods provide impact characterisation factors for elementary flows in order to aggregate the impact to obtain a limited number of midpoint and/or damage indicators.\nEnvironmental Footprint (EF) Impact Assessment Method – Protocol for quantitative translation of Resource Use and Emissions Profile data into contributions to an environmental impact of concern.\nEnvironmental Footprint (EF) Impact Category – Class of resource use or environmental impact to which the Resource Use and Emissions Profile data are related.\nEnvironmental Footprint (EF) impact Category indicatory - Quantifiable representation of an EF impact category. (based on ISO 14044:2006)\nEnvironmental impact - Any change to the environment, whether adverse or beneficial, that wholly or partially result from an Organisation’s activities or products. [EMAS regulation]\nEnvironmental mechanism – System of physical, chemical and biological processes for a given EF impact category linking the Resource Use and Emissions Profile results to EF category indicators. (based on ISO 14040:2006)\nEnvironmentally significant – Any process or activity accounting for at least 90 % of contributions to each EF impact category considered.\nEutrophication - Nutrients (mainly nitrogen and phosphorus) from sewage outfalls and fertilised farmland accelerate the growth of algae and other vegetation in water. The degradation of organic material consumes oxygen resulting in oxygen deficiency and, in some cases, fish death. Eutrophication translates the quantity of emission of substances into a common measure expressed as the oxygen required for the degradation of dead biomass.\nExtrapolated Data – Refers to data from a given process that is used to represent a similar process for which data is not available, on the assumption that it is reasonably representative.\nFlow diagram – Schematic representation of the modelled system (foreground systems and links to background system), and all major inputs and outputs.\nForeground Process – Refers to those processes of the Organisation life cycle for which direct access to information is available. For example, the producer’s site and other processes operated by the Organisation or contractors (e.g. goods transport, head-office services, etc.) belong to the foreground system.\nGate to Gate – a partial Organisation supply chain that includes only the processes within a specific Organisation or site.\nGate to Grave – a partial Organisation supply chain that includes only the processes within a specific Organisation or site and the processes occurring along the supply chain such as distribution, storage, use, and disposal or recycling stages.\nGeneric Data – Refers to data that is not directly collected, measured, or estimated, but rather sourced from a third-party life cycle inventory database or other source that complies with the data quality requirements of the OEF Guide. Synonymous with “secondary data.”\nExample: An organisation operating a facility that purchases acetylsalicylic acid from a number of regional firms on a least-cost basis as an input to their production process sources generic data from a life cycle inventory database to represent average acetylsalicylic acid production conditions in the region of interest.\nGlobal Warming Potential – Capacity of a greenhouse gas to influence radiative forcing, expressed in terms of a reference substance (for example, CO2-equivalent units) and specified time horizon (e.g. GWP 20, GWP 100, GWP 500, for 20, 100, and 500 years respectively). It relates to the capacity to influence changes in the global, average surface-air temperature and subsequent change in various climate parameters and their effects, such as storm frequency and intensity, rainfall intensity and frequency of flooding, etc.\nHuman Toxicity –cancer – EF impact category that accounts for the adverse health effects on human beings caused by the intake of toxic substances through inhalation of air, food/water ingestion, penetration through the skin inso far as they are related to cancer.\nHuman Toxicity- non cancer – EF impact category that accounts for the adverse health effects on human beings caused by the intake of toxic substances through inhalation of air, food/water ingestion, penetration through the skin inso far as they are related to non-cancer effects that are not caused by particulate matter/respiratory inorganics or ionising radiation.\nIndirect Land Use Changes (iLUC) - Occur when a demand for a certain land use leads to changes outside the system boundaries, i.e. in other land use type. These indirect effects can be mainly assessed by means of economic modelling of the demand for land or by modelling the relocation of activities on a global scale. The main drawbacks of such models are their reliance on trends, which might not reflect future developments. They are commonly used as the basis for political decisions.\nIndirectly attributable – Refers to a process, activity or impact occurring outside of the defined Organisational boundary but within the defined OEF boundary (i.e. upstream or downstream).\nInput – Product, material or energy flow that enters a unit process. Products and materials include raw materials, intermediate products and co-products. (ISO 14040:2006)\nIntermediate product – Output from a unit process that is input to other unit processes that require further transformation within the system (ISO 14040:2006)\nIonising Radiation, human health – EF impact category that accounts for the adverse health effects on human health caused by radioactive releases.\nLand Use – EF impact category related to use (occupation) and conversion (transformation) of land area by activities such as agriculture, roads, housing, mining, etc. Land occupation considers the effects of the land use, the amount of area involved and the duration of its occupation (changes in quality multiplied by area and duration). Land transformation considers the extent of changes in land properties and the area affected (changes in quality multiplied by the area).\nLife cycle – Consecutive and interlinked stages of a product system, from raw material acquisition or generation from natural resources to final disposal. (ISO 14040:2006)\nLife Cycle Approach - Takes into consideration the spectrum of resource flows and environmental interventions associated with a product or organisation from a supply chain perspective, including all stages from raw material acquisition through processing, distribution, use, and end-of-life processes, and all relevant related environmental impacts (instead of focusing on a single issue).\nLife cycle assessment (LCA) – Compilation and evaluation of the inputs, outputs and the potential environmental impacts of a product system throughout its life cycle (ISO 14040:2006)\nLife-Cycle Impact Assessment (LCIA) – Phase of life cycle assessment that aims at understanding and evaluating the magnitude and significance of the potential environmental impacts for a system throughout the life cycle (ISO 14040:2006). The LCIA methods used provide impact characterisation factors for elementary flows in order to aggregate the impact to obtain a limited number of midpoint and/or damage indicators.\nLoad rate - Ratio of actual load to the full load or capacity (e.g. mass or volume) that a vehicle carries per trip.\nMulti-functionality - If a process or facility provides more than one function, i.e. it delivers several goods and/or services (\"co-products\"), it is “multi-functional”. In these situations, all inputs and emissions linked to the process must be partitioned between the product of interest and the other co-products in a principled manner. Similarly, where a jointly owned and/or operated facility produces multiple products, it may be necessary to partition related inputs and emissions among the products within the defined Product Portfolios of different organisations. Organisations undertaking an OEF study may therefore have to address multi-functionality problems both at the product and facility level.\nNon-elementary (or complex) flows – Remaining inputs and outputs which are not elementary flows and need further modelling efforts to be transformed into elementary flows. Examples of non-elementary inputs are electricity, materials, transport processes and examples of non-elementary outputs are waste and by-products.\nNormalisation – After the characterisation step, normalisation is an optional (but recommended) step in which the EF impact assessment results are multiplied by normalisation factors that represent the overall inventory of a reference unit (e.g., a whole country or an average citizen). Normalised EF impact assessment results express the relative shares of the impacts of the analysed system in terms of the total contributions to each impact category per reference unit. When displaying the normalised EF impact assessment results of the different impact topics next to each other, it becomes evident which EF impact categories are affected most and least by the analysed system. Normalised EF impact assessment results reflect only the contribution of the analysed system to the total impact potential, not the severity/relevance of the respective total impact. Normalised results are dimensionless, but not additive.\nOrganisation Environmental Footprint Sector Rules (OEFSRs) – Are sector-specific, life cycle based rules that complement general methodological guidance for OEF studies by providing further specification at the sectorial level. OFCRs can help shifting the focus of the OEF study towards those aspects and parameters that matter the most, and hence contribute to increased relevance, reproducibility and consistency.\nOutput – Product, material or energy flow that leaves a unit process. Products and materials include raw materials, intermediate products, co-products and releases. (ISO 14040:2006)\nOzone Depletion - EF impact category that accounts for the degradation of stratospheric ozone due to emissions of ozone depleting substances, for example long-lived chlorine and bromine-containing gases (e.g. CFCs, HCFCs, Halons).\nParticulate Matter/Respiratory Inorganics – EF impact category that accounts for the adverse health effects on human health caused by emissions of Particulate Matter (PM) and its precursors (NOx, SOx, NH3)\nPhotochemical Ozone Formation – EF impact category that accounts for the formation of ozone at the ground level of the troposphere caused by photochemical oxidation of Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) and carbon monoxide (CO) in the presence of nitrogen oxides (NOx) and sunlight. High concentrations of ground-level tropospheric ozone damage vegetation, human respiratory tracts and manmade materials through reaction with organic materials.\nProduct - Any goods or service. (ISO 14040:2006)\nProduct category - Group of products that can fulfil equivalent functions. (ISO 14025:2006)\nProduct Environmental Footprint Category Rules (PEFCRs) – Are product-type-specific, life cycle based rules that complement general methodological guidance for Product Environmental Footprint studies by providing further specification at the level of a specific product category. PEFCRs can help to shift the focus of the Product Environmental Footprint study towards those aspects and parameters that matter the most, and hence contribute to increased relevance, reproducibility and consistency.\nProduct flow – Products entering from or leaving to another product system. (ISO 14040:2006)\nProduct system – Collection of unit processes with elementary and product flows, performing one or more defined functions, and which models the life cycle of a product (ISO 14040:2006)\nRaw material – Primary or secondary material that is used to produce a product (ISO 14040:2006)\nReference flow – Measure of the outputs from processes in a given system required to fulfil the function expressed by the unit of analysis. (based on ISO 14040:2006)\nReleases – Emissions to air and discharges to water and soil. (ISO 14040:2006)\nResource Depletion – EF impact category that addresses use of natural resources, either renewable or non-renewable, biotic or abiotic.\nResource Use and Emissions Profile – Refers to the inventory of data collected to represent the inputs and outputs associated with each stage of the Organisation supply chain being studied. The compilation of the Resource Use and Emissions Profile is completed when non-elementary (i.e. complex) flows are transformed into elementary flows.\nResource Use and Emissions Profile results – Outcome of a Resource Use and Emissions Profile that catalogues the flows crossing the OEF boundary and provides the starting point for the EF impact assessment.\nSensitivity analysis – Systematic procedures for estimating the effects of the choices made regarding methods and data on the outcome of an OEF study. (based on ISO 14040: 2006)\nSoil Organic Matter (SOM) – Is the measure of the content of organic material in soil. This derives from plants and animals and comprises all of the organic matter in the soil exclusive of the matter that has not decayed.\nSpecific Data – Refers to directly measured or collected data representative of activities at a specific facility or set of facilities. Synonymous with “primary data.”\nExample: A pharmaceutical organisation compiles data from internal inventory records to represent the material and energy inputs and emissions from a factory producing acetylsalicylic acid.\nSubdivision - Subdivision refers to disaggregating multifunctional processes or facilities to isolate the input flows directly associated with each process or facility output. The process is investigated to see whether the it can be subdivided. Where subdivision is possible, inventory data should be collected only for those unit processes directly attributable to the products/services of concern.\nSystem Boundary – Definition of aspects included or excluded from the study. For example, for a “cradle-to-grave” environmental footprint analysis, the system boundary should include all activities from the extraction of raw materials through the processing, manufacturing, use, repair and maintenance processes as well as transport, waste treatment and other purchased services such as e.g. cleaning and legal services, marketing, production and decommissioning of capital goods, operation of premises such as retail, storage, administration offices, staff commuting, business travel, and end-of-life processes.\nSystem Boundary diagram - Schematic representation of the analysed system. It details which parts of the Organisation supply chain are included or excluded from the analysis.\nTemporary carbon storage happens when a product “reduces the GHGs in the atmosphere” or creates “negative emissions”, by removing and storing carbon for a limited amount of time\nUncertainty analysis– Procedure to assess the uncertainty introduced into the results of a PEF study due to data variability and choice-related uncertainty.\nUnit of analysis - The unit of analysis defines the qualitative and quantitative aspects of the function(s) and/or service(s) provided by the Organisation being evaluated; the unit of analysis definition answers the questions “what?”, “how much?”, “how well?”, and “for how long?”.\nUnit process – Smallest element considered in the Resource Use and Emissions Profile for which input and output data are quantified. (based on ISO 14040:2006)\nUpstream – Occurring along the supply chain of purchased goods/services prior to entering the Organisational Boundary.\nWaste – Substances or objects which the holder intends or is required to dispose of. (ISO 14040:2006)\nWeighting - Weighting is an additional, but not mandatory, step that may support the interpretation and communication of the results of the analysis. (Normalised) OEF results are multiplied by a set of weighting factors, which reflect the perceived relative importance of the impact categories considered. Weighted environmental footprint results can be directly compared across impact categories, and also summed across impact categories to obtain a single-value overall impact indicator. Weighting requires making value judgements as to the respective importance of the EF impact categories considered. These judgements may be based on expert opinion, social science methods, cultural/political view points, or economic considerations.\n12.   REFERENCES\n—\nADEME (2007).

The mandatory requirements for the OEF and the additional requirements for the development of OEFSRs are summarised in table 9, in column 3 and 4 respectively. The requirements relate to different criteria which are mentioned in the second column and which are further elaborated in separate chapters and sections (as indicated in the first column).\nTable 9\nSummary of key mandatory requirements for OEF studies and additional requirements for developing OEFSRs\nChapter/section\nCriteria\nOrganisation Environmental Footprint (OEF) Requirements\nAdditional requirements for Developing Organisation Environmental Footprint Sector Rule (OEFSRs)\n1.1\nGeneral Approach\nAn OEF study shall be based on a life cycle approach.\n1.3\nPrinciples\nUsers of this Guide shall observe the following principles in OEF studies:\n1.\nRelevance;\n2.\nCompleteness;\n3.\nConsistency;\n4.\nAccuracy;\n5.\nTransparency.\nPrinciples for OEFSRs:\n1.\nRelationship with the OEF Guide;\n2.\nInvolvement of selected interested parties;\n3.\nStriving for comparability.\n2.1\nRole of OEFSRs\nIn the absence of OEFSRs for the reference sector, the key areas which would be covered in OEFSRs (as listed throughout this OEF Guide) shall be specified, justified and explicitly reported in the OEF study.\nOEFSRs should aim to focus OEF studies on those aspects and parameters which are most pertinent in determining the environmental performance of the sector.\nAn OEFSR shall/should/may further specify requirements made in this OEF Guide and add new requirements where the more general OEF Guide gives several options.\n2.2\nDefining the Sector\nOEFSRs shall be based on at a minimum a two-digit code division of NACE codes (default option). However, OEFSRs may allow for (justified) deviations (e.g. allow for three-digits) if the complexity of the sector demands it. Where multiple production routes for similar Product Portfolios defined using alternative NACE codes are identifiable, the OEFSR shall accommodate all such NACE codes.\n3\nGoal Definition\nThe goal definition for an OEF study shall include:\n—\nIntended application(s);\n—\nReasons for carrying out the study and decision context;\n—\nTarget audience;\n—\nWhether for the purpose of comparisons and/or comparative assertions intended to be disclosed to the public;\n—\nCommissioner of the study;\n—\nReview Procedure (if applicable).\nThe OEFSR shall specify the review requirements for OEF studies.\n4\nScope Definition\nThe scope definition for an OEF study shall be in line with the defined study goals and the requirements of the OEF Guide. It shall identify and clearly describe (see following sections for a more detailed description):\n—\nDefinition of the Organisation (unit of analysis (103)) and the Product Portfolio (suite and amount of goods/services provided over the reporting interval);\n—\nSystem boundaries (Organisational and OEF boundaries);\n—\nEF impact categories;\n—\nAssumptions and limitations.\n4.2\nDefining the Organisation (unit of analysis)\nThe Organisation (or clearly defined subset thereof subject to the OEF study) shall be defined according to the following:\n—\nThe name of the Organisation;\n—\nThe kinds of goods/services the Organisation produces (i.e. the sector);\n—\nLocations of operation (i.e. countries);\n—\nThe NACE code(s).\n4.3\nProduct Portfolio\nA Product Portfolio shall be defined for the Organisation that represents the amount and nature of goods and services (or clearly defined subset thereof) provided by the Organisation over the reporting interval in terms of “what” and “how much”. It shall be justified and reported if an OEF is limited to a subset of its Product Portfolio. For modelling the use and EOL scenarios, information on “how well”, and “for how long” with respect to product performance shall also be provided. The quantitative input and output data collected in support of the analysis (to be carried out in a later phase of the OEF study) shall be calculated in relation to the specified Product Portfolio.\nThe OEFSR shall further specify how the Product Portfolio is defined, in particular with respect to “how well” and “for how long.” It shall also define the reporting interval when this differs from one year, and justify the chosen interval.\n4.4\nSystem Boundaries\nThe system boundaries shall include both Organisational boundaries (in relation to the defined Organisation) and OEF boundaries (that specify which aspects of the supply chain are included in the analysis).\n4.4.1\nOrganisational Boundaries\nOrganisational boundaries for calculating the OEF shall encompass all of the facilities/activities that the Organisation owns and/or operates (whether partially or in full) that contribute to providing the Product Portfolio during the reporting interval.\nAll activities and processes which occur within the Organisational boundaries but which are not necessary for the functioning of the Organisation shall be included in the analysis but reported separately. Examples of such processes/activities are gardening activities, food served by the company in the canteen, etc.\nIn the case of retailers, products produced or transformed by the retailer shall be included in the Organisational boundaries.\nThe OEFSR shall specify the characteristic processes, activities and facilities of the sector of concern to be included in the Organisational boundaries.\nThe OEFSR shall specify the characteristic processes and activities which occur within the Organisational boundaries but which are not necessary for the functioning of the Organisation. These shall be included in the analysis and reported separately.\n4.4.2\nOrganisation Environmental Footprint Boundaries\nThe OEF boundaries shall be defined following general supply-chain logic. This shall include, at a minimum, site-level (direct) and upstream (indirect) activities associated with the Organisation’s Product Portfolio. The OEF boundaries shall by default include all supply chain stages from raw material acquisition through processing production, distribution, storage, use and EOL treatment of the Product Portfolio (i.e. cradle-to-grave). All processes within the defined OEF boundaries shall be considered. Explicit justification shall be provided if downstream (indirect) activities are excluded (e.g. use stage of intermediate products or products with an undeterminable fate).\nEmployee transport shall be included in the analysis, even if these are indirect activities.\nIf retailers provide products produced by other organisations, the production processes shall be included as upstream processes.\nReplacements which are necessary to fulfil the defined time span (see OEFSRs in section 4.3) shall be taken into account. The number of replacements equals “time span/life span -1”. As this assumes an average situation, the number of replacements does not need to be an integer. The future production processes for these replacements shall be assumed to be identical to the processes of the reporting year. If a fixed time span is not relevant for a certain sector (see OEFSRs in section 4.3), the use stage shall cover the life span of the products in the Product Portfolio of the Organisation (without replacements).\nThe OEFSR shall specify the OEF boundary, including specification of the supply chain stages to be included; and the direct (gate-to-gate) and indirect (upstream and downstream) processes/activities to be included in the OEF study. Any deviation from the default cradle-to-grave approach shall be explicitly specified and justified. The OEFSR shall also include justification for exclusions of processes/activities.\nThe OEFSR shall specify the time span and scenarios to be considered for the downstream activities. If a fixed time span is not appropriate or relevant for a certain sector (e.g. some consumable products), the OEFSR shall specify and justify why this is the case.\n4.4.4\nOffsets\nOffsets shall not be included in an OEF study.\n4.5\nSelection of EF Impact Categories\nFor an OEF study, all of the specified default EF impact categories and associated specified EF impact assessment models and indicators (see Table 2) shall be applied. Any exclusion shall be explicitly documented, justified and reported in the OEF report and supported by appropriate documents. The influence of any exclusion on the final results, especially related to limitations in terms of comparability to other OEF studies, shall be reported and discussed in the interpretation phase. Such exclusions are subject to review.\nThe OEFSR shall specify and justify any exclusion of the default EF impact categories, especially related to aspects of comparability.\n4.6\nSelecting Additional Environmental Information\nIf the default set of EF impact categories or the default EF impact assessment models do not properly cover the potential environmental impacts of the Organisation, all related relevant (qualitative/quantitative) environmental aspects shall be additionally included under Additional Environmental Information. Additional Environmental Information shall be reported separately from the default EF impact assessment results. These shall however not substitute the mandatory assessment models of the default EF impact categories. The supporting models of these additional categories with the corresponding indicators shall be clearly referenced and documented.\nAdditional relevant environmental shall be:\n—\nBased on information that is substantiated and has been reviewed or verified (in accordance with the requirements of ISO 14020 and Clause 5 of ISO 14021:1999);\n—\nSpecific, accurate and not misleading;\n—\nRelevant to the particular sector;\n—\nSubmitted to the review process;\n—\nClearly documented.\nEmissions directly to marine water shall be included in the Additional Environmental Information (at inventory level).\nIf Additional Environmental Information is used to support the interpretation phase of an OEF study, then all data needed to produce such information shall meet the same or equivalent quality requirements established for the data used to calculate the OEF results.\nAdditional Environmental Information shall only be related to environmental issues. Information and instructions, e.g. organisation safety sheets that are unrelated to the environmental footprint of the Organisation shall not be part of an OEF. Similarly, information related to legal requirements shall not be included.\nThe OEFSR shall specify :\n—\nAny Additional Environmental Information that shall be included in the OEF study. Such additional information shall be reported separately from the default EF impact assessment results (see Table 2). All models and assumptions of this Additional Environmental Information shall be supported by adequate documentation, clearly documented and submitted to the review process. Such Additional Environmental Information may include (non-exhaustive list)\n—\nOther relevant environmental impact categories for the sector;\n—\nOther relevant approaches for conducting characterisation of the flows from the Resource Use and Emissions Profile, when characterisation factors (CFs) in the default method are not available for certain flows (e.g. groups of chemicals);\n—\nEnvironmental indicators or Product responsibility indicators (e.g. EMAS core indicators or the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI));\n—\nLife cycle energy consumption by primary energy source, separately accounting for “renewable” energy use;\n—\nDirect energy consumption by primary energy source, separately accounting for “renewable” energy use;\n—\nFor gate-to-gate stages, number of IUCN Red List species and national conservation listspecies with habitats in areas affected by operations, by level of extinction risk;\n—\nDescription of significant impacts of activities and products on biodiversity in protected areas and areas of high biodiversity value outside protected areas;\n—\nTotal weight of waste by type and disposal method;\n—\nWeight of transported, imported, exported, or treated waste deemed hazardous under the terms of Annexes I, II, III, and VIII of the Basel Convention, and percentage of transported waste shipped internationally;\n—\nInformation from environmental impact assessments (EIA) and chemical risk assessments.\n—\njustifications for inclusions/exclusions.\nThe OEFSRs shall furthermore define the appropriate unit for intensity-based metrics, required for specific communication purposes.\n4.7\nAssumptions/limitations\nAll limitations and assumptions shall be transparently reported.\nThe OEFSR shall report sector specific limitations and define the assumptions necessary to overcome such limitations.\n5\nResource Use and Emissions Profile\nAll resource use and emissions associated with the life cycle stages included in the defined system boundaries shall be included in the Resource Use and Emissions Profile. This flows shall be grouped into “elementary flows” and “non-elementary (i.e. complex) flows”. All non-elementary flows in the Resource Use and Emissions Profile shall then be transformed into elementary flows.\n5.2\nResource Use and Emissions Profile – screening step\nIf a screening step is conducted (highly recommended), readily available specific and/or generic data shall be used, fulfilling the data quality requirements as defined in section 5.6. Any exclusion of supply chain stages shall explicitly be justified and submitted to the review process, and their influence on the final results shall be discussed.\nFor supply chain stages for which a quantitative EF impact assessment is not intended, the screening step shall refer to existing literature and other sources in order to develop qualitative descriptions of potentially environmentally significant processes. Such qualitative descriptions shall be included in the Additional Environmental Information.\nThe OEFSR shall specify the processes to be included. The OEFSR shall also specify for which processes specific data are required, and for which the use of generic data is either permissible or required.\n5.4\nResource Use and Emissions Profile - data\nThe Resource Use and Emissions Profile shall be the documented input and output flows associated with all activities and processes within the defined OEF boundaries.\nThe following elements shall be considered for inclusion in the Resource Use and Emissions Profile:\n—\nDirect activities and impacts of sources owned and/or operated by the Organisation;\n—\nIndirectly attributable upstream activities;\n—\nIndirectly attributable downstream activities.\nLinear depreciation shall be used for capital equipment. The expected service life of the capital goods shall be taken into account (and not the time to evolve to an economic book value of 0).\nThe OEFSR shall further specify sources, quality and review requirements for the data used in an OEF study.\nThe OEFSR should provide one or more examples for compiling the Resource Use and Emissions Profile, including specifications with respect to:\n—\nSubstance lists for activities/processes included;\n—\nUnits;\n—\nNomenclature for elementary flows.\nThese may apply to one or more supply-chain stages, processes or activities, for the purpose of ensuring standardised data collection and reporting. The OEFSR may specify more stringent data requirements for key upstream, gate-to-gate or downstream stages than those defined in this OEF Guide.\nFor modelling processes/activities within the defined Organisational boundary (i.e. gate-to-gate stage), the OEFSR shall also specify:\n—\nProcesses/activities included;\n—\nSpecifications for compiling data for key processes, including averaging data across facilities;\n—\nThe expected service life of the capital goods;\n—\nAny site-specific data required for reporting as “Additional Environmental Information”;\n—\nSpecific data quality requirements, e.g. for measuring specific activity data.\nIf the OEFSR requires/allows deviations from the default cradle-to-grave system boundary (e.g. if the OEFSR prescribes using cradle-to-gate boundary), the OEFSR shall specify how material/energy balances in the Resource Use and Emissions Profile shall be accounted for.\n5.4.4\nAccounting for electricity use (including use of renewable energy)\nFor electricity from the grid consumed upstream or within the defined Organisational boundary, supplier-specific data shall be used if available. If supplier-specific data is not available, country-specific consumption-mix data shall be used of the country in which the life cycle stages occur. For electricity consumed during the use stage of products, the energy mix shall reflect ratios of sales between countries or regions. Where such data are not available, the average EU consumption mix, or otherwise most representative mix, shall be used.\nFor renewable electricity from the grid consumed upstream or within the defined Organisational boundary, it shall be guaranteed that the renewable electricity (and associated impacts) is not double counted. A statement of the supplier shall be included as annex to the OEF report, guaranteeing that the electricity supplied is effectively generated using renewable sources and is not sold to any other organisation.\n5.4.4\nBiogenic carbon emissions\nRemovals and emissions for biogenic carbon sources shall be identified separately in the Resource Use and Emissions Profile.\n5.4.4\nRenewable energy generation\nCredits associated with renewable energy generated by the Organisation shall be calculated with respect to the corrected (i.e. by subtracting the externally provided amount of renewable energy) average country-specific consumption-mix data of the country to which the electricity is provided. Where such data is not available, the corrected average EU consumption mix, or otherwise most representative mix shall be used. If no data are available on the calculation of corrected mixes, the uncorrected average mixes shall be used. It shall be transparently reported which energy mixes are assumed for the calculation of the benefits and whether or not these have been corrected.\n5.4.4\nTemporary (carbon)storage and delayed emissions\nCredits associated with temporary (carbon) storage or delayed emissions shall not be considered in the calculation of the default EF impact categories. These shall be reported in the Additional Environmental Information if required by the OEFSRs.\n5.4.4\nDirect land use change (impact for climate change)\nGreenhouse gas emissions from direct land use change shall be allocated to products for (i) 20 years after the land use change occurred or (ii) a single harvest period from the extraction of the evaluated product (even if longer than 20 years) and the longest period shall be chosen. For details see annex VI.\n5.4.4\nIndirect land use change (impact for climate change)\nGreenhouse gas emissions from indirect land use change shall not be considered unless OEFSRs explicitly require to do so. In that case, indirect land use change shall be reported separately as Additional Environmental Information, but it shall not be included in the calculation of the greenhouse gas impact category.\n5.4.5\nModelling transport scenarios\nTransport parameters that shall be taken into account are: transport type, vehicle type and fuel consumption, load rate, number of empty returns when applicable and relevant, transport distance, allocation for goods transport based on load-limiting factor (i.e. mass for high-density products and volume for low-density products) and fuel production.\nThe impacts due to transport shall be expressed in the default reference units, i.e. tkm for goods and person-km for passenger transport. Any deviation from these default reference units shall be reported and justified.\nThe environmental impact due to transport shall be calculated by multiplying the impact per reference unit for each of the vehicle types by a) for goods: the distance and load and b) for persons: the distance and number of persons based on the defined transport scenarios.\nThe OEFSR shall specify transport, distribution and storage scenarios to be included in the study, if any.\n5.4.6\nModelling use stage scenarios\nIf downstream stages are to be included in the OEF, then use profiles (i.e. the related scenarios and assumed service life) shall be specified for representative goods/services for the sector. All relevant assumptions for the use stage shall be documented. Where no method for determining the use stage of products has been established in accordance with the techniques specified in this Guide, the approach taken in determining the use stage of products shall be established by the Organisation carrying out the study. Documentation of methods and assumptions shall be provided. Relevant influences on other systems due to the use of the products shall be included.\nThe OEFSR shall specify:\n—\nThe use scenario(s) to be included in the study, if any;\n—\nThe time span to be considered for the use stage.\nPublished technical information should be taken into account for the definition of the use-stage scenarios. Definition of the use profile should also take into account use/consumption patterns, location, time (day/night, summer/winter, week/weekend), and assumed service life for the use stage of products. The actual usage pattern of the products should be used if available.\n5.4.7\nModelling EOL scenarios\nWaste flows arising from processes included in the system boundaries shall be modelled to the level of elementary flows.\nThe OEFSR shall define the EOL scenario(s) to be included in the OEF study, if any. These scenarios shall be based on current (year of analysed time interval) practice, technology and data.\n5.5\nNomenclature\nAll resource use and emissions associated with the life cycle stages included in the defined system boundaries shall be documented using the International Reference Life Cycle Data system (ILCD) nomenclature and properties. If nomenclature and properties for a given flow are not available in the ILCD, the practitioner shall create an appropriate nomenclature and document the flow properties.\n5.6\nData quality requirements\nData quality requirements shall be met by an OEF study intended for external communication. Data quality requirements apply to both specific data and generic data.\nThe following six criteria shall be adopted for semi-quantitative assessment of data quality in OEF studies:\n—\nTechnological representativeness;\n—\nGeographical representativeness;\n—\nTime-related representativeness;\n—\nCompleteness;\n—\nParameter uncertainty;\n—\nMethodological appropriateness and consistency.\nIn the optional screening step (if conducted) a minimum “fair” quality data rating is required for data contributing to at least 90 % of the impact estimated for each EF impact category, as assessed via qualitative expert judgement.\nIn the final Resource Use and Emissions Profile, for the processes and/or activities accounting for at least 70 % of contributions to each EF impact category, both specific and generic data shall achieve at least an overall “good quality” level. A semi-quantitative assessment of data quality shall be performed and reported for these processes. At least 2/3 of the remaining 30 % (i.e. 70 % to 90 %) shall be modelled with at least “fair quality” data, as assessed via qualitative expert judgement. Remaining data (used for approximation and filling identified gaps (beyond 90 % contribution to environmental impacts)) shall be based on best available information.\nThe data quality requirements for technological, geographical and time related representativeness shall be subject to review as part of the OEF study. The data quality requirements related to completeness, methodological appropriateness and consistency, and parameter uncertainty shall be met by sourcing generic data exclusively from data sources complying with the requirements of the OEF Guide.\nWith respect to the data quality criterion “methodological appropriateness and consistency”, the requirements as defined in Table 6 shall apply until end 2015. From 2016 onwards, full compliance with the OEF methodology will be required.\nWith respect to the level at which assessment of data quality shall be conducted:\n—\nFor generic data, at the level of the input flows;\n—\nFor specific data, at the level of an individual process or aggregated processes, or at the level on individual input flows.\nThe OEFSR shall provide further guidance on data quality assessment scoring with respect to time-related, geographical and technological representativeness. The OEFSR shall for example specify which data quality score related to time representativeness should be assigned to a dataset representing a given year.\nThe OEFSR may specify additional criteria for the assessment of data quality (compared to the default criteria).\nThe OEFSR may specify more stringent data quality requirements regarding e.g.:\n—\nForeground processes;\n—\nBackground processes (both upstream and downstream stages);\n—\nKey supply chain processes/activities for the sector;\n—\nKey EF impact categories for the sector.\n5.7\nSpecific Data Collection\nSpecific data shall be obtained for all foreground processes/activities and for background processes/activities, where appropriate. However, if generic data are more representative or appropriate than specific data (to be reported and justified) for foreground processes, generic data shall also be used for the foreground processes.\nThe OEFSRs shall specify:\n1.\nFor which processes specific data shall be collected;\n2.\nThe requirements for collection of specific data for each process/activity;\n3.\nThe data collection requirements for the following aspects for each site:\n—\nTarget stage(s) and the data collection coverage;\n—\nLocation of data collection (e.g. domestically, internationally, representative factories);\n—\nTerm of data collection (e.g. year, season, month, etc.);\n—\nWhen the location or term of data collection shall be limited to a certain range, provide a justification and show that the collected data will serve as sufficient samples.\nNote: The basic rule is that the location of data collection is all target areas and the term of data collection is one year or more.\n5.8\nGeneric Data Collection\nWhen available, sector-specific generic data shall be used instead of multi-sector generic data.\nAll generic data shall fulfil the data quality requirements specified.\nThe sources of the data used shall be clearly documented and reported in the OEF report.\nThe OEFSR shall specify:\n—\nWhere the use of generic data is permitted as an approximation for a substance for which specific data are not available;\n—\nThe level of required similarities between the actual substance and the generic substance;\n—\nThe combination of more than one generic dataset, if necessary.\n5.9\nData Gaps\nAny data gaps shall be filled using best available generic or extrapolated data (104). The contribution of such data (including gaps in generic data) shall not account for more than 10 % of the overall contribution to each EF impact category considered. This is reflected in the data quality requirements, according to which 10 % of the data can be chosen from the best available data (without any further data quality requirements).\nThe OEFSR shall specify potential data gaps and provide detailed guidance for filling data gaps.\n5.11\nHandling Multi-functionality\nThe OEF multi-functionality decision hierarchy shall be applied for resolving all multi-functionality problems at both process and facility-level: (1) subdivision or system expansion; (2) allocation based on a relevant underlying physical relationship (including (a) direct substitution or (b) some relevant underlying physical relationship); (3) allocation based on some other relationship (including (a) indirect substation or (b) some other relevant underlying relationship).\nAll choices made in this context shall be reported and justified with respect to the overarching goal of ensuring physically representative, environmentally relevant results.\nIf co-products are partly co-products and partly waste, all inputs and outputs shall be allocated to the co-products only.\nAllocation procedures shall be uniformly applied to similar inputs and outputs.\nFor multi-functionality problems including recycling or energy recovery at EOL or for waste flows within the system boundaries, the equation described in Annex V shall be applied.\nThe OEFSR shall further specify multi-functionality solutions for application within the defined Organisational boundaries and, where appropriate, for upstream and downstream stages. If feasible/appropriate, the OEFSR may further provide specific substitution scenarios or factors to be used in case of allocation solutions. All such multi-functionality solutions specified in the OEFSR shall be clearly justified with reference to the OEF multi-functionality solution hierarchy.\nWhere sub-division is applied, the OEFSR shall specify which processes are to be sub-divided and according to what principles.\nWhere allocation by physical relationship is to be applied, the OEFSR shall specify the relevant underlying physical relationship to be considered and establish the relevant allocation factors.\nWhere allocation by some other relationship is to be applied, the OEFSR shall specify the relationship and establish the relevant allocation factors. For example, in the case of economic allocation, the OEFSR shall specify the rules for determining the economic values of co-products.\nFor multi-functionality in EOL situations, the OEFSR shall specify how to calculate the different parts within the provided mandatory formula.\n6\nEnvironmental Footprint Impact Assessment\nThe EF impact assessment shall include:\n—\nClassification;\n—\nCharacterisation.\n6.1.1\nClassification\nAll inputs/outputs inventoried during the compilation of the Resource Use and Emissions Profile shall be assigned to the EF impact categories to which they contribute (“classification”) using the classification scheme as provided at http://lct.jrc.ec.europa.eu/assessment/projects.\nIf the Resource Use and Emissions Profile data are drawn from existing public or commercial life cycle inventory databases - where classification has already been implemented - it shall be assured that the classification and linked EF impact assessment pathways correspond to the requirements of this OEF Guide.\n6.1.2\nCharacterisation\nAll classified inputs/outputs in each EF impact category shall be assigned CFs representing the contribution per unit of input/output to the category, using the provided CFs (available online at http://lct.jrc.ec.europa.eu/assessment/projects). EF impact assessment results shall subsequently be calculated for each EF impact category by multiplying the amount of each input/output by its CF and summing contributions of all inputs/outputs within each category in order to obtain a single measure expressed in terms of an appropriate reference unit.\nIf CFs from the default methods are not available for certain flows (e.g. a group of chemicals) of the Resource Use and Emissions Profile, then otherapproaches may be used for characterising these flows. In such circumstances, this shall be reported under “Additional Environmental Information”. The characterisation models shall be scientifically and technically valid, and based upon distinct, identifiable environmental mechanisms or reproducible empirical observations.\n6.2.1\nNormalisation (if applied)\nNormalisation is not a required but recommended step for OEF studies. If it is applied, the normalised OEF results shall be reported under “Additional Environmental Information”, with all methods and assumptions documented. The normalised results shall not be aggregated as this implicitly applies weighting. Results of the EF impact assessment prior to normalisation shall be reported alongside the normalised results.\n6.2.2\nWeighting ( if applied)\nWeighting is not a required but optional step for OEF studies. If weighting is applied, the weighted results shall be reported as “Additional Environmental Information”, with all methods and assumption documented. Results of the EF impact assessment prior to weighting shall be reported alongside weighted results.\nThe application of normalisation and weighting steps in OEF studies shall be consistent with the defined goals and scope of the study, including the intended applications.\n7\nInterpretation of results\nThe interpretation phase of an OEF study shall include the following steps: assessment of the robustness of the OEF model; identification of hotspots; estimation of uncertainty; and conclusions, limitations and recommendations.\n7.2\nModel robustness\nThe assessment of the robustness of the OEF model shall include an assessment of the extent to which methodological choices such as system boundaries, data sources, allocation choices and coverage of EF impact categories influence the results. These choices shall correspond to the requirements specified in this Guide and shall be appropriate to the context.\n7.3\nHotspots\nOEF results shall be evaluated to assess supply-chain hotspots/weak points at the level of the input/output, process, and supply chain stage and to assess potential for improvements.\nThe OEFSR shall identify the most relevant EF impact categories for the sector. Normalisation and weighting may be used to achieve such prioritisation.\n7.4\nEstimation of Uncertainty\nAt least a qualitative description of the uncertainties of the final OEF results shall be provided for both data and choice related uncertainties separately, in order to facilitate an overall appreciation of the uncertainties of the study results.\nThe OEFSR shall describe the uncertainties common to the sector and should identify the range in which results could be seen as not being significantly different in comparisons or comparative assertions.\n7.5\nConclusions, Recommendations, and Limitations\nConclusions, recommendations and limitations shall be described in accordance with the defined goals and scope of the OEF study. OEF studies to support comparative assertions intended to be disclosed to the public shall be based both on this OEF Guide and related OEFSRs.\nAs required by ISO 14044:2006, for any comparative assertions intended to be disclosed to the public it shall be carefully considered whether any differences in data quality and methodological choices used to model the compared organisations may influence the comparability of the outcomes. Any inconsistencies in defining system boundaries, inventory data quality, or EF impact assessment shall be considered and documented/reported.\n8\nReporting\nAny OEF study intended for external communications shall include an OEF study report, which shall provide a relevant, comprehensive, consistent, accurate, and transparent account of the study and of the calculated environmental impacts associated with the Organisation. The reported information shall also provide a robust basis for assessing, tracking, and seeking to improve the environmental performance of the Organisation over time. The OEF report shall include, at a minimum, a Summary, a Main Report, and an Annex. These shall contain all the reporting elements specified in this OEF Guide (section 8.2).\nThe OEFSR shall specify and justify any deviations from the default reporting requirements and any additional reporting requirements and/or differentiate reporting requirements that depend on, for example, the type of applications of the OEF study and the type of organisation being assessed.\nThe OEFSRs shall specify whether the OEF results shall be reported separately for each of the selected life cycle stages.\n9.1\nReview\nAny OEF study intended for internal communication claiming to be in line with the OEF Guide and any OEF study for external communication shall be critically reviewed in order to ensure that:\n—\nThe methods used to carry out the OEF study are consistent with this OEF Guide;\n—\nThe methods used to carry out the OEF study are scientifically and technically valid;\n—\nThe data used are appropriate, reasonable and meet the defined quality requirements;\n—\nThe interpretation of the results reflects the limitations identified;\n—\nThe study report is transparent, accurate and consistent.\n9.2\nReview Type\nUnless otherwise specified in relevant policy instruments, any OEF study intended for external communication shall be critically reviewed by at least one independent and qualified external reviewer (or review team). An OEF study to support a comparative assertion intended to be disclosed to the public shall be based on relevant OEFSRs and critically reviewed by at least three independent qualified external reviewers. Any OEF study intended for internal communication claiming to be in line with the OEF Guide shall be critically reviewed by at least one independent and qualified external reviewer (or review team)\nThe OEFSR shall specify the review requirements for OEF studies to be used for comparative assertions intended to be disclosed to the public (e.g. whether a review by at least three independent qualified external reviewers is sufficient).\n9.3\nReviewer Qualifications\nA critical review of the OEF study shall be conducted as per the requirements of the intended application. Unless otherwise specified, the minimum necessary score to qualify as a reviewer or a review team is six points, including at least one point for each of the three mandatory criteria (i.e. verification and audit practice, EF or LCA methodology and practice, and knowledge of technologies or other activities relevant to the OEF study). Score points per criteria shall be achieved by individuals, while score points may be summed across criteria at the team level. Reviewers or reviewer teams shall provide a self-declaration of their qualifications, stating how many points they achieved for each criterion and the total points achieved. This self-declaration shall be part of the mandatory annex of the OEF report.\n(INFORMATIVE)\nAnnex II\nData Management Plan (Adapted from GHG Protocol Initiative\n (105))\nIf a data management plan is developed, the following steps should be undertaken and documented.\n1.\nEstablish an Organisation accounting quality person/team\n. This person/team should be responsible for implementing and maintaining the data management plan, continually improving the quality of organisation inventories, and coordinating internal data exchanges and any external interactions (such as with relevant organisation accounting programs and reviewers).\n2.\nDevelop Data Management Plan and Checklist\n. Development of the data management plan should begin before any data are collected to ensure that all relevant information about the inventory is documented as it proceeds. The plan should evolve over time as data collection and processes are refined. In the plan, the quality criteria and any evaluation/scoring systems are to be defined. The data management plan checklist outlines what components should be included in a data management plan and can be used as a guide for creating a plan or for pulling together existing documents to constitute the plan.\n3.\nPerform data quality checks\n. Checks should be applied to all aspects of the inventory process, focusing on data quality, data handling, documentation, and calculation procedures. The defined quality criteria and scoring systems form the basis for the data quality checks.\n4.\nReview of Organisation inventory and reports\n. Selected independent external reviewers should review the study – ideally from the beginning.\n5.\nEstablish formal feedback loops to improve data collection, handling and documentation processes\n. Feedback loops are needed to improve the quality of the organisation inventory over time and to correct any errors or inconsistencies identified in the review process.\n6.\nEstablish reporting, documentation and archiving procedures\n. Establish record-keeping processes for which and how data should be stored; what information should be reported as part of internal and external inventory reports; and what should be documented to support data collection and calculation methodologies. The process may also involve aligning or developing relevant database systems for record keeping.\nThe data management plan is likely to be an evolving document that is updated as data sources change, data handling procedures are refined, calculation methodologies improve, organisation inventory responsibilities change within an organisation, or the business objectives of the organisation inventory change.\n(INFORMATIVE)\nAnnex III\nData Collection Check-list\nA data collection check-list is useful for organising data collection activities and results while compiling the Resource Use and Emissions Profile. The following non-exhaustive check-list may be used as a starting point for data collection and organisation of a data collection template:\n—\nIntroduction to the OEF study, including an overview of the objectives of data collection and the template/questionnaire employed;\n—\nInformation on the entity(ies) or person(s) responsible for measurement and data collection procedures;\n—\nDescription of the site where data are to be collected (for example, maximum and normal operation capacity, annual productive output, location, number of employees, etc.);\n—\nDate/year of data collection;\n—\nDescription of the Organisation;\n—\nProduct Portfolio description;\n—\nOverall flow diagrams (106) for owned/operated facilities within the defined Organisational boundaries;\n—\nInput and outputs per facility;\n—\nData quality info (technological representativeness, geographical representativeness, time-related representativeness, completeness and parameter uncertainty).\nExample: Simplified data collection check-list\nTechnical overview\nFigure 6\nProcess overview diagram for the production stage at a T-shirt company\nList of processes within the system boundary: fibre production, spinning, twisting, texturising, weaving, pre-treatment, dyeing, printing, coating and finishing.\nCollection of unit process Resource Use and Emissions Profile data\nProcess name: finishing process\nProcess diagram: finishing refers to processes performed on yarn or fabric after weaving or knitting to improve the look and, performance, of the finished textile product\nIn Figure 7 the flow diagram is presented for a facility within the defined Organisational boundary.\nFigure 7\nFlow diagram for a facility within the defined Organisational boundary\nTotal Inputs to Facility\nCode\nName\nAmount\nUnit\nTotal Outputs from Facility\nCode\nName\nAmount\nUnit\nExample of Resource Use and Emissions Profile for a facility (selected substances)\n (107)\nParameter\nUnit\nAmount\nEnergy consumption (non-elementary)\nGJ\n115,5\nElectricity (elementary)\nGJ\n34,6\nFossil Fuel (elementary)\nGJ\n76\nNatural gas (elementary)\nMg\n0,59\nNatural gas, feedstock (elementary)\nMg\n0,16\nCrude oil (elementary)\nMg\n0,57\nCrude oil, feedstock (elementary)\nMg\n0,48\nCoal (elementary)\nMg\n0,66\nCoal, feedstock (elementary)\nMg\n0,21\nLPG (elementary)\nMg\n0,02\nHydro power (elementary)\nGJ\n5,2\nWater (elementary)\nMg\n12 400\nEmissions to air (elementary flows)\nCO2\nMg\n5,132\nCH4\nMg\n8,2\nSO2\nMg\n3,9\nNox\nMg\n26,8\nCH\nMg\n25,8\nCO\nMg\n28\nEmissions to water (elementary flows)\nCOD Mn\nMg\n13,3\nBOD\nMg\n5,7\nTot-P\nMg\n0,052\nTot-N\nMg\n0,002\nProduct Outputs (non-elementary flows)\nPants\n#\n20 000\nT-shirts\n#\n15 000\nAnnex IV\nIdentifying Appropriate Nomenclature and Properties for Specific Flows\nThe principal target audience for this Annex are experienced Environmental Footprint practitioners and reviewers. This Annex is based on the “International Reference Life Cycle Data System (ILCD) Handbook - Nomenclature and other conventions”. (EC – JRC – IES, 2010f). If further information and background is required on nomenclature and naming conventions, please refer to the afore mentioned document, which is available at: http://lct.jrc.ec.europa.eu/ .\nDifferent groups often use considerably different nomenclature and other conventions. As a consequence, Resource Use and Emissions Profiles (for Life Cycle Assessment practitioners: Life Cycle Inventory (LCI) datasets) are incompatible on different levels, thereby strongly limiting the combined use of Resource Use and Emissions Profiles datasets from different sources or an efficient, electronic exchange of data among practitioners. This also hampers a clear unambiguous understanding and review of OEF reports.\nThe purpose of this Annex is to support data collection, documentation and use for Resource Use and Emissions Profiles in OEF studies by providing a common nomenclature and provisions on related topics. The document also forms the basis for a common reference elementary flow list for use in OEF studies.\nThis supports efficient OEF work and data exchange among different tools and databases.\nThe goal is to guide data collection, naming, and documentation in such a way that the data:\n—\nAre meaningful, precise and useful for further EF impact assessments and interpretation and reporting;\n—\nCan be compiled and provided in a cost-efficient way ;\n—\nAre comprehensive and do not overlap;\n—\nCan be efficiently exchanged among practitioners who have different databases and software systems, thereby reducing the likelihood of errors.\nThis nomenclature and other conventions focus on elementary flows, flow properties and the related units, and give suggestions for the naming of process datasets, product and waste flows, for better compatibility among different database systems. Basic recommendations and requirements are also given on the classification of source and contact datasets.\nTable 10 lists the ILCD Handbook rules that are required in OEF studies.

This is modelled in the same manner as recycling;\n—\nIf relevant/applicable, can accommodate downcycling, i.e. any differences in quality between the secondary (i.e. recycled or reused) material and the primary (i.e. virgin) material;\n—\nIf relevant/applicable, can accommodate energy recovery;\n—\nAllocates the impacts and benefits due to recycling equally between the producer using recycled material and the producer producing a recycled product: 50/50 allocation split. (110)\nThe quantitative figures for the relevant parameters involved need to be gathered in order to use the formula provided below to estimate the overall RUaEP per unit of analysis. Whenever feasible, this should be determined based on data associated with the actual processes involved. However, this may not always be possible / feasible and data may have to be found elsewhere (please note that the explanation provided hereafter for each term of the formula contains a recommendation on how/where to find missing data).\nThe RUaEP per unit of analysis (111) is calculated with the following formula:\nThe abovementioned formula can be divided into 5 blocks:\nThese are interpreted as follows (the different parameters are explained in detail hereafter):\n—\nrepresents the RUaEP from virgin material acquisition and pre-processing.\n—\nrepresents the RUaEP associated to the recycled material input and is proportional to the fraction of material input that has been recycled in a previous system.\n—\nrepresents the RUaEP from the recycling (or re-use) process from which the credit from avoided virgin material input (accounting for any eventual downcycling) are subtracted.\n—\nrepresents the RUaEP arising from the energy recovery process from which the avoided emissions arising from the substituted energy source have been subtracted.\n—\nrepresents the net RUaEP from the disposal of the fraction of material that has not been recycled (or re-used) at End-of-Life or handed over to an energy recovery process.\nWhere:\n—   EV= specific emissions and resources consumed (per unit of analysis) arising from virgin material (i.e. virgin material acquisition and pre-processing). If this information is not available, generic data should be used which should be sourced according to the sources of generic data listed in section 5.8.\n—   E*V= specific emissions and resources consumed (per unit of analysis) arising from virgin material (acquisition and pre-processing) assumed to be substituted by recyclable materials:\nIf only closed loop recycling takes place: E*V = EV;\nIf only open loop recycling takes place: E*V = E’V represents the input of virgin material that refers to the actual virgin material substituted through open loop recycling. If this information is not available, assumptions should be made as to what virgin material is substituted, or average data should be used which should be sourced according to the sources of generic data listed in section 5.8. If no other relevant information is available it could be assumed that E’V = EV as if closed loop recycling had taken place.\n—   Erecycled= specific emissions and resources consumed (per unit of analysis) arising from the recycling (112) (or re-use) process of the recycled (or re-used) material, including collection, sorting and transportation processes. If this information is not available, generic data should be used which should be sourced according to the sources of generic data listed in section 5.8.\n—   ErecyclingEoL= specific emissions and resources consumed (per unit of analysis) arising from the recycling process at the End-of-Life stage, including collection, sorting and transportation processes. If this information is not available, generic data should be used which should be sourced according to the sources of generic data listed in section 5.8.\nNote: in closed loop recycling situations Erecycled = ErecyclingEoL and E*V = EV\n—   ED= specific emissions and resources consumed (per unit of analysis) arising from disposal of waste material at the EoL of the analysed product (e.g. landfill, incineration, pyrolysis). If this information is not available, generic data should be used which should be sourced according to the sources of generic data listed in section 5.8.\n—   E*D= specific emissions and resources consumed (per unit of analysis) arising from disposal of waste material (e.g. landfilling, incineration, pyrolysis) at the EoL of the material where the recycled content is taken from. If this information is not available, generic data should be used which should be sourced according to the sources of generic data listed in section 5.8.\nIf only closed-loop recycling takes place: E*D = ED\nIf only open-loop recycling takes place: E*D = E’D represents the disposal of the material where the recycled content is taken from. If this information is not available, assumptions should be made as how this material would have been disposed if it was not recycled. If no relevant information is available it could be assumed that E’D = ED, as if closed-loop recycling had taken place.\n—   EER= specific emissions and resources consumed (per unit of analysis) arising from the energy recovery process. If this information is not available, generic data should be used which should be sourced according to the sources of generic data listed in section 5.8.\n—   ESE,heat and ESE,elec= specific emissions and resources consumed (per unit of analysis) that would have arisen from the substituted energy source, heat and electricity respectively. If this information is not available, generic data should be used which should be sourced according to the sources of generic data listed in section 5.8.\n—   R1 [dimensionless]= “recycled (or re-used) content of material”, is the proportion of material in the input to the production that has been recycled in a previous system (0=<R1<=1). If this information is not available, comprehensive and regularly updated statistical information on recycling rates and other relevant parameters can be obtained from suppliers such as Eurostat (113).\n—   R2 [dimensionless]= “recycling (or reuse) fraction of material”, is the proportion of the material in the product that will be recycled (or re-used) in a subsequent system. R2 shall therefore take into account the inefficiencies in the collection and recycling (or re-use) processes (0=<R2=<1). If this information is not available, comprehensive and regularly updated statistical information on recycling rates and other relevant parameters can be obtained from suppliers such as Eurostat (83).\n—   R3 [dimensionless]= the proportion of material in the product that is used for energy recovery (e.g. incineration with energy recovery) at EoL (0=<R3=<1). If this information is not available, comprehensive and regularly updated statistical information on recycling rates and other relevant parameters can be obtained from suppliers such as Eurostat (83).\n—   LHV= Lower Heating Value [e.g. MJ/kg] of the material in the product that is used for energy recovery. This should be determined with an appropriate laboratory method. If this is not possible or feasible, generic data should be used (see, for example, the “ELCD Reference elementary flows” (114), and the ELCD database under EoL treatment / Energy recycling (115)).\n—   XER,heat and XER,elec [dimensionless]= the efficiency of the energy recovery process (0<XER<1) for both heat and electricity, i.e. the ratio between the energy content of output (e.g. output of heat or electricity) and the energy content of the material in the product that is used for energy recovery. XER shall therefore take into account the inefficiencies of the energy recovery process (0=<XER<1). If this information is not available, generic data should be used (see, for example EoL treatment / Energy recycling in the ELCD database).\n—   Qs= quality of the secondary material, i.e. the quality of the recycled (or re-used) material (see note below).\n—   Qp= quality of the primary material, i.e. the quality of the virgin material (see note below).\nNote: Qs/Qp is a dimensionless ratio taken as an approximation for any differences in quality between the secondary material and the primary material (“downcycling”). Following the EF multi-functionality hierarchy (see section 5.11), the possibility of identifying a relevant, underlying physical relationship as a basis for the quality correction ratio will be assessed (the limiting factor shall be determining). If this is not possible, some other relationship shall be used, for example, economic value. In this case, the prices of primary versus secondary materials are assumed to serve as a proxy for quality. In such a situation, Qs/Qp would correspond to the ratio between the market price of the secondary material (Qs) and the market price of the primary material (Qp). Market prices of primary and secondary materials can be found in online sources (116). The quality aspects to be considered for the primary and secondary material shall be specified in the OEFSR.\nAnnex VI\nGuidance on accounting for Direct Land Use Change Emissions Relevant for Climate Change\nThis Annex gives guidance on the accounting of greenhouse gas emissions related to direct land use change contributing to climate change.\nThe impact on climate is a result of biogenic CO2 emissions and removals, caused by carbon stock change, and biogenic and non-biogenic CO2, N2O and CH4 emissions (e.g. biomass burning). Biogenic emissions include those resulting from the burning (combustion) or degradation of biogenic materials, wastewater treatment and biological sources in soil and water (including CO2, CH4 and N2O), while biogenic removals correspond to the uptake of CO2 during photosynthesis. Non-biogenic emissions correspond to all emissions resulting from non-biogenic sources, such as fossil-based materials, while non-biogenic removals correspond to the CO2 that is removed from atmosphere by a non-biogenic source (WRI and WBCSD 2011b).\nChanges in land use might be classified as being direct or indirect:\nDirect Land Use Changes (dLUC) occur as the results of a transformation from one land use type into another, which takes place in a unique land cover, possibly incurring changes in the carbon stock of that specific land, but not leading to a change in another system.\nIndirect Land Use Changes (iLUC) occur when a certain transformation in land use induces changes outside the system boundaries, i.e. in other land use types.\nFigure 8 shows the schematic representation of both direct and indirect land use changes related to biofuel production.\nFigure 8\nSchematic representation of direct and indirect land use changes (adapted from (CE Delft 2010))\nThe remaining of this annex focuses on direct land use changes as the OEF does only require to consider this and does not allow to consider indirect land use (see section 5.4.4)\nSECTION 1:   REFERENCES FOR THE CALCULATIONS OF DIRECT LAND USE CHANGE EMISSIONS\nThe Commission Decision C(2010)3751 provides guidelines for the calculation of land carbon stocks for the reference land use and the actual land use. The Decision provides values for carbon stock for four different land use categories: cropland, perennial crops, grassland and forest land. For land use changes in these categories, the Commission Decision C(2010)3751 guidelines shall be followed. However, for emissions from the conversion to other land use categories such as wetlands, settlements and other land uses (e.g. bare soil, rock and ice), not included in the Decision, the IPCC 2006 Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories (IPCC, 2006) shall be followed.\nFor the release and uptake of CO2 caused by direct land use change, the use of the most recent IPCC CO2 emission factors shall be used as referred to in the Commission Decision C(2010)3751, unless more accurate, specific data are available. Other emissions as a result of land use change (e.g. NO3- losses to water, emissions from biomass burning, soil erosion, etc.) should be measured or modelled for the particular case or using authoritative sources.\nSECTION 2:   PRACTICAL GUIDANCE ACCORDING TO PAS 2050:2011\nFor practical guidance on specific issues (e.g. in case previous land use is unknown), the application of PAS 2050:2011 (BSI 2011) is recommended (in coherence with the European Food Sustainable Consumption and Production Roundtable (Food SCP) and the published ENVIFOOD Protocol). The PAS 2050:2011 is supplemented by the PAS2050-1 (BSI 2012), for the assessment of GHG emissions from the cradle-to-gate (from raw material extraction to manufacturing) stages of the life cycle of horticultural products. PAS 2050-1:2012 takes into account the emissions and removals involved in the cultivation of a horticultural crop product and supplements (not substitutes) PAS 2050:2011. A supplementary excel file is also provided by the British Standard Institution (BSI) for the PAS 2050-1:2012 calculations.\nPrevious LU category and production location\nFollowing PAS 2050:2011 (BSI 2011), three distinct situations (and respective guidelines) can be identified, depending on the availability of information about the location of production and the previous land use category:\n—\n“Country of production and previous LU are known: GHG emissions from LUC from a previous land use into the current one might be found in Annex C, from the PAS 2050:2011 (BSI 2011). For the emissions not listed in Annex C, the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories should be used” (BSI 2011).\n—\n“Country of production is known and previous LU is unknown: GHG emissions shall be the estimate of LUC average emissions for that crop in that country” (BSI 2011).\n—\n“Country of production and previous LU are unknown: GHG emissions shall be the weighted average LUC emissions of that specific commodity in the countries in which it is grown” (BSI 2011).\nGeneral GHG emissions and removals to be included in the assessment\nFollowing PAS 2050:2011 (BSI 2011) the emissions and removals to be included in the assessment are:\n—\nGases included in Annex A of the PAS 2050:2011 (BSI 2011);\nOBS: Some exceptions may apply for biogenic carbon emissions and removals related to food and animal feed products. For food and feed, emissions and removals arising from biogenic sources that become part of the product may be excluded. The exclusion shall not apply to:\n—\nemissions and removals of biogenic carbon used in the production of food and feed (e.g. in burning biomass for fuel) where that biogenic carbon does not become part of the product;\n—\nnon-CO2 emissions arising from degradation of waste food and feed and enteric fermentation;\nany biogenic component in material that is part of the final product but is not intended to be ingested (e.g. packaging).” (BSI 2011, page 9).\n—\nFor methane (CH4) emissions resulting from waste combustion with energy recovery, refer to 8.2.2, page 22, PAS 2050:2011.\nAnnex VII\nMapping of Terminology Used in this OEF Guide with ISO Terminology\nThis Annex provides a mapping of the key terms used in this OEF Guide with the corresponding terms used under ISO 14044:2006. The reason for diverging from the ISO terminology is to make the OEF Guide more accessible to its target audience, which also includes groups that do not necessarily have strong background knowledge of environmental assessment. The tables below provide such a mapping of diverging terms.\nTable 12\nMapping of key terms\nTerms used in ISO 14044:2006\nCorrespondent terms used in this OEF Guide\nFunctional unit\nUnit of analysis\nLife cycle inventory analysis\nResource Use and Emissions Profile\nLife cycle impact assessment\nEnvironmental footprint impact assessment\nLife cycle interpretation\nEnvironmental footprint interpretation\nImpact category\nEnvironmental footprint impact category\nImpact category indicator\nEnvironmental footprint impact category indicator\nTable 13\nMapping of data quality criteria\nTerms used in ISO 14044:2006\nCorrespondent terms used in this OEF Guide\nTime-related coverage\nTime-related representativeness\nGeographical coverage\nGeographical representativeness\nTechnology coverage\nTechnological representativeness\nPrecision\nParameter uncertainty\nCompleteness\nCompleteness\nConsistency\nMethodological Appropriateness and Consistency\nSources of the data\nCovered under “Resource Use and Emissions Profile”\nUncertainty of the information\nCovered under “Parameter uncertainty”\nAnnex VIII\nOEF Guide and ILCD handbook: Major Deviations\nThis annex points out the most important aspects of how this OEF Guide deviates from the ILCD Handbook, and provides a concise justification for these deviations.\n1.\nTarget audience(s):\nAs opposed to the ILCD Handbook, the OEF Guide is aimed at people who have limited knowledge of life cycle assessment. It is therefore written in a more accessible manner.\n2.\nCompleteness check:\nThe ILCD Handbook gives two options for checking completeness: (1) completeness check at the level of each environmental impact and (2) completeness check at the level of the overall (i.e. aggregated) environmental impact. The OEF Guide considers completeness only at the level of each environmental impact. In fact, as the OEF Guide does not recommend any specific set of weighting factors, the overall (i.e. aggregated) environmental impact cannot be estimated.\n3.\nExtension of the goal definition\nThe OEF Guide is meant for use in specific applications, therefore extensions of the goal definition are not foreseen.\n4.\nScope definition includes “limitations”\nThe scope definition of the OEF Guide shall also include specifications of the limitations of the study. In fact, based on experience gained with the ILCD Handbook, the limitation can be properly defined only when practitioners have information regarding all aspects related to the goal definition and the function of analysis.\n5.\nReview procedure is defined in the goal definition:\nThe review procedure is essential to improve the quality of an OEF study, therefore it needs to be defined in the first step of the process, i.e. the goal definition.\n6.\nScreening step instead of iterative approach\nThe OEF Guide recommends that a screening step be conducted to obtain an approximate estimation of each environmental impact for the default EF impact categories. This step is similar to the iterative approach in the ILCD Handbook.\n7.\nData quality rating\nThe OEF Guide makes use of five rating-levels for evaluating the data quality (excellent, very good, good, fair, poor), compared to the three levels used in the ILCD Handbook. This will allow for the use of data with lower data quality levels in the OEF study compare with those required by the ILCD Handbook. Also, the OEF Guide uses a semi-quantitative formula for assessing data quality, making it easier to achieve e.g. “good” data quality.\n8.\nMulti functionality decision hierarchy\nThe OEF Guide provides a decision hierarchy for solving multi-functionality of products/organisations which deviates from the approach endorsed by the ILCD Handbook. The OEF Guide also provides an equation for solving multi-functionality in recycling and energy recovery situations at the end-of-life stage.\n9.\nSensitivity analysis\nCarrying out sensitivity analysis of the results is an optional step in the OEF Guide. This is expected to reduce the workload for users of the OEF Guide.\nAnnex IX\nComparison of Organisation Environmental Footprint Key Requirements with Other Methods\nAlthough similar widely accepted corporate environmental accounting methods and guidance documents align closely on much of the methodological guidance they provide, it is noteworthy that discrepancies and/or lack of clarity remains on a number of important decision points, which reduces the consistency and comparability of analytical outcomes. This annex provides a summary of selected key requirements of this OEF Guide and compares these with a number of existing methods. It is based on the document “Analysis of Existing Environmental Footprint Methodologies for Products and Organizations: Recommendations, Rationale, and Alignment”, that can be accessed via http://ec.europa.eu/environment/eussd/corporate_footprint.htm.

However, the term “supply chain” was preferred here to avoid the economic connotation of “value chain”.\n(10)  European Commission - Joint Research Centre - Institute for Environment and Sustainability (2011b). Analysis of Existing Environmental Footprint Methodologies for Products and Organizations: Recommendations, Rationale, and Alignment. http://ec.europa.eu/environment/eussd/corporate_footprint.htm\n(11)  Environmentally significant is the adjective used to describe any process or activity that accounts for at least 90 % of contributions to each environmental footprint impact category (see glossary for definition) considered.\n(12)  ISO. (2006a). ISO 14025. Environmental labels and declarations - Type III environmental declarations - Principles and procedures. International Organization for Standardization, Geneva.\n(13)  An environmental aspect is an element of an organisation’s activities or products that has or can have an impact on the environment (including human health).\n(14)  A product is any goods or service (ISO 14040:2006).\n(15)  The reference flow is a measure of the outputs from processes in a given system required to fulfil the function expressed by the unit of analysis (based on ISO 14040:2006).\n(16)  Generic Data – Refers to data that are not directly collected, measured, or estimated, but rather sourced from a third-party life-cycle inventory database or other source that complies with the data quality requirements of the OEF Guide. Synonymous with “secondary data.”\n(17)  If a process or facility provides more than one function, i.e. it delivers several goods and/or services (\"co-products\"), it is “multi-functional”. In these situations, all inputs and emissions linked to the process must be partitioned between the product of interest and the other co-products in a principled manner. Similarly, where a jointly owned and/or operated facility produces multiple products, it may be necessary to partition related inputs and emissions among the products within the defined Product Portfolios of different organisations. Organisations undertaking an OEF study may therefore have to address multi-functionality problems both at the product and facility level (see section 5.11 and Annex V).\n(18)  Suite and amount of goods/services provided over the reporting interval.\n(19)  (NACE Rev. 2 2008, page 15)\n(20)  (NACE Rev. 2 2008, page 15) http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/portal/page/portal/product_details/publication?p_product_code=KS-RA-07-015\n(21)  The alphabetical section code does not appear in the digit code according to NACE and is therefore not relevant here.\n(22)  Input – Product, material or energy flow that enters a unit process. Products and materials include raw materials, intermediate products and co-products. (ISO 14040:2006)\n(23)  A partial Organisation supply chain: from the extraction of raw materials (cradle) up to the manufacturer’s “gate”. The distribution, storage, use and EOL stages of the supply chain are omitted.\n(24)  A partial Organisation supply chain that includes only the processes within a specific organisation or site and the processes occurring along the supply chain such as distribution, storage, use, and disposal or recycling stages.\n(25)  The unit of analysis defines the qualitative and quantitative aspects of the function(s) and/or service(s) that the Organisation being evaluated provides; the unit of analysis definition answers the questions “what?”, “how much?”, “how well?”, and “for how long?”.\n(26)  Life cycle assessment – compilation and evaluation of the inputs, outputs and the potential environmental impacts of a product system throughout its life cycle (ISO 14040:2006)\n(27)  Output flows are product, material or energy flows that leave a unit process. Products and materials include raw materials, intermediate products, co-products and releases (ISO 14040:2006).\n(28)  “How well” and “for how long” are important characteristics which will determine the environmental footprint of the downstream processes occurring during the time span of the use stage.\n(29)  Three approaches to defining Organisational boundaries can be distinguished. First is the equity share approach, where Organisational boundaries encompass all activities in which there is an ownership share. Second is the financial control approach, where organisations include within their defined boundaries only those activities over which they have financial control. Third is the operational control approach, where only those activities over which an organisation has operational control are included in the defined boundaries.\n(30)  The “control” approach is preferred to the “equity share” approach because it is better suited to environmental performance measurement and management, as explicitly recognised in existing guidance documents such as ISO 14069 and the GHG Protocol, Moreover, an inclusive interpretation of the control approach (i.e. defining Organisational boundaries taking into account both financial and operational control) is identified as necessary to ensuring maximally representative models that will support differentiation in the context of possible mandatory applications.\n(31)  Specific data refer to directly measured or collected data that is representative of activities at a specific facility or set of facilities. Synonymous with “primary data.”\n(32)  Intermediate product – Output from a unit process that is input to other unit processes that require further transformation within the system (ISO 14040:2006).\n(33)  Raw material – primary or secondary material that is used to produce a product (ISO 14040:2006).\n(34)  The term “EF impact category” is used throughout this Guide instead of the term “impact category” used in ISO 14044:2006.\n(35)  Environmental impacts according to this Guide include effects on human health and resources.\n(36)  The term “EF impact category indicator” is used throughout this Guide instead of the term “impact category indicator” used in ISO 14044:2006.\n(37)  A differentiation can be made between “mid-point” and “end-point” impact assessment methods. Mid-point methods assess the impacts earlier in the cause-effect chain. For example, midpoint methods express global warming as CO2-equivalents while endpoint methods express it - for example - as Disability Adjusted Life Years (years of loss of (quality of) life due to illness or death due to climate change).\n(38)  European Commission - Joint Research Centre - Institute for Environment and Sustainability (2011a).

ISBN 978-92-79-17451-3, doi: 10.278/33030. Publications Office of the European Union, Luxembourg.\n(39)  The term “EF impact assessment” is used throughout this Guide instead of the term “life cycle impact assessment” used in ISO 14044:2006. It is the phase of the OEF analysis aimed at understanding and evaluating the magnitude and significance of the potential environmental impacts for a system throughout the life cycle [based on ISO 14044:2006]. The employed EF impact assessment methods provide impact characterisation factors for elementary flows in order to aggregate the impact to obtain a limited number of midpoint and/or damage indicators.\n(40)  For further information on specific EF impact assessment categories and models, reference is made to the ILCD Handbook “Framework and requirements for LCIA models and indicators”; “Analysis of existing environmental assessment methodologies for use in LCA” and “Recommendations for life cycle impact assessment in the European context.” (European Commission – JRC – IES 2010c, 2010e, 2011a).

It refers to partitioning the input flows of a process, a product system or facility between the system under study and one or more other systems (based on ISO 14040:2006).\n(62)  For more information on the consideration of transport-related aspects, see the International Reference Life Cycle Data System (ILCD) Handbook: General Guide for Life Cycle Assessment – detailed guidance, section 7.9.3.\n(63)  http://lca.jrc.ec.europa.eu/lcainfohub/datasetArea.vm\n(64)  This section builds upon the Greenhouse Gas Protocol Product Life Cycle Accounting and Reporting Standard, 2011 – Section 7.3.1.\n(65)  European Commission - Joint Research Centre - Institute for Environment and Sustainability (2010f).

From 2016 onwards, full compliance with the OEF methodology will be required and can then be assumed to be of very good quality in order to calculate the DQR in formula 1 (i.e., M = 1).\n(73)  Refers to those processes of the organisation’s supply chain for which no direct access to information is possible. For example, most of the upstream supply-chain processes and generally all processes further downstream will be considered part of the background system.\n(74)  Case specific means that the representativeness of data can differ depending on the organization. The OEFSR shall define the criteria for representativeness.\n(75)  Attributional - refers to process-based modelling intended to provide a static representation of average conditions.\n(76)  This means that not all data in the set shall achieve a ranking of “good quality\" for the dataset to achieve an overall “good quality” rating. Rather, two may be ranked as \"fair\". If more than two are ranked as “fair” or one is ranked as “poor” and one as “fair”, the overall data quality of the dataset is downgraded to the next quality class, “fair”.\n(77)  The 70 % threshold is chosen to balance the goal of achieving a robust assessment with the need to keep it feasible and accessible.\n(78)  Foreground processes refer to those processes of the Organisation life cycle for which direct access to information is available. For example, the producer’s site and other processes operated by the organisation or contractors (e.g. goods transport, head-office services, etc.) belong to the foreground system.\n(79)  Including average data representing multiple sites. Average data refer to production weighted average of specific data.\n(80)  A definition of “foreground” and “background” processes is provided in the Glossary section.\n(81)  http://lca.jrc.ec.europa.eu/lcainfohub/datasetArea.vm\n(82)  http://lct.jrc.ec.europa.eu/assessment/data\n(83)  Extrapolated data refer to data from a given process that are used to represent a similar process for which data are not available, on the assumption that it is reasonably representative.\n(84)  A unit process is the smallest element considered in the Resource Use and Emissions Profile for which input and output data are quantified. (based on ISO 14040:2006)\n(85)  Directly attributable refers to a process, activity or impact occurring within the defined Organisational boundary.\n(86)  See below for an example of direct substitution.\n(87)  A product system is the collection of unit processes with elementary and product flows, performing one or more defined functions, and which models the life cycle of a product (ISO 14040:2006)\n(88)  Indirect substitution occurs when a product is substituted but you don’t know by which products exactly.\n(89)  An environmental mechanism is defined as a system of physical, chemical and biological processes for a given EF impact category linking the Resource Use and Emissions Profile results to EF category indicators. (based on ISO 14040:2006)\n(90)  For more information on existing weighting approaches in Life Cycle Impact Assessment, please refer to the reports developed by the JRC and CML entitled “Background review of existing weighting approaches in LCIA” and “Evaluation of weighting methods for measuring the EU-27 overall environmental impact”. These are available online at http://lct.jrc.ec.europa.eu/assessment/publications\n(91)  It should be noted that ISO 14040 (ISO 2006b) and 14044 (ISO 2006c) do not permit the use of weighting in support of comparative assertions disclosed to the public.\n(92)  The term “environmental footprint interpretation” is used throughout this OEF Guide instead of the term “life cycle interpretation” used in ISO 14044:2006. A mapping of the terminology used in this OEF Guide with ISO terminology is included in annex VII.\n(93)  Comparative assertions are an environmental claim regarding the superiority or equivalence of an organisation versus a competing organisation providing the same products, based on the results of an OEF study and supporting OEFSRs. (based on ISO 14040:2006).\n(94)  The Main Report, as defined here, is insofar as possible in line with ISO 14044:2006 requirements on reporting for studies which do not contain comparative assertions to be disclosed to the public.\n(95)  Sensitivity analyses are systematic procedures for estimating the effects of the choices made regarding methods and data on the outcome of an OEF study.

The qualification of knowledge about technologies or other activities is assigned according to the classification of NACE codes (Regulation (EC) No 1893/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 December 2006 establishing the statistical classification of economic activities NACE Revision 2). Equivalent classifications of other international organisations can also be used.

Scope 1 relates to the direct emissions (i.e., emissions from sources that are owned or controlled by the reporting Organisation). Scope 2 emissions are indirect emissions (i.e., emissions that are a consequence of the activities of the reporting Organisation, but occur at sources owned or controlled by another organisation) from the generation of purchased energy consumed by the Organisation and scope 3 emissions are all other indirect emissions that occur in the Organisation’s value chain.

They also benefit society by increasing consumer satisfaction, fostering innovation and creating sustainable employment. A more resource-efficient EU economy could generate 2.8 million jobs by 2020.\nWorldwide, the market for green products and services is estimated at €4.2 trillion. Yet although the EU has a one-fifth share of that market, green products still only make up a small fraction of its internal market.\nBuilding the Single Market for Green Products\nThis initiative aims to boost the free circulation of green products across the EU by removing potential barriers, notably the lack of a common definition of green products and organisations. A further barrier is the high cost to business of complying with numerous different labelling and verification schemes.\nHere, the European Commission introduces two methods to remove the ambiguity - not to mention consumer scepticism - often associated with so-called green products. Developed in Europe over the last decade, the Product Environmental Footprint (PEF) and Organisation Environmental Footprint (OEF) are designed to improve the measurement and communication of the environmental performance of green products.\nCompared to existing methods, PEF and OEF offer several advantages. Among these are the clear identification of the potential environmental impact requiring assessment in a comprehensive Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), as well as various data quality requirements.\nBoth methods are accompanied by Category Rules (CR), allowing easier comparison of products or sectors by focusing on just three or four environmental impacts. For example, the PEFCR might be used to create one representative detergent. Manufacturers could then measure the environmental performance of newly developed detergents against that.\nBetter communication\nIn addition to these two methods, the Commission recommends the following principles be used when communicating the environmental performance of products and organisations:\nTransparency\nAvailability and accessibiliy\nReliability\nCompleteness\nComparabilility\nClarity\nThe Commission will test and validate these two methods over three years, whilst developing environmental benchmarks for each one. It will also look at alternative methods. The Commission will then assess the success of using PEF and OEF, plus related benchmarks, with a view to developing environmental performance tools or standards.\nRELATED ACTS\nCommunication from the European Commission of 20 September 2011 to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions: Roadmap to a Resource Efficient Europe [COM(2011)571 final - not published in the Official Journal]\nCommission Recommendation 2013/179/EU on the use of common methods to measure and communicate the life cycle environmental performance of products and organisations [Official Journal L 124 of 4.5.2013]\nLast updated: 05.02.2014", "tags": ["research method", "environmental impact", "product life", "EU Member State", "disclosure of information", "type of business"], "subjects": ["Environment"], "split": "train", "reference_annotations": {"32013H0179_p2": {"text": "European Parliament and the Council of the European Union (2009): directive 2009/28/ec of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 April 2009 on the promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources and amending and subsequently repealing directive 2001/77/ec directive 2003/30/ec, Official Journal of the European Union, Brussels.", "triples": [" directive 2009/28/ec,  amending,  directive 2001/77/ec", " directive 2009/28/ec,  amending,  directive 2003/30/ec", " directive 2009/28/ec,  repealing,  directive 2001/77/ec", " directive 2009/28/ec,  repealing,  directive 2003/30/ec"]}, "32013H0179_p3": {"text": "(72)  European Union 2009: directive 2009/28/ec OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND COUNCIL of 23 April 2009 on the promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources and amending and subsequently repealing directive 2001/77/ec directive 2003/30/ec (OJ L 140, 5.6.2009, p. 16).", "triples": [" directive 2009/28/ec,  amending,  directive 2001/77/ec", " directive 2009/28/ec,  amending,  directive 2003/30/ec", " directive 2009/28/ec,  repealing,  directive 2001/77/ec", " directive 2009/28/ec,  repealing,  directive 2003/30/ec"]}, "32013H0179_p5": {"text": "European Parliament and the Council of the European Union (2009). directive 2009/28/ec of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 April 2009 on the promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources and amending and subsequently repealing directive 2001/77/ec directive 2003/30/ec, Official Journal of the European Union, Brussels.", "triples": [" directive 2009/28/ec,  amending,  directive 2001/77/ec", " directive 2009/28/ec,  amending,  directive 2003/30/ec", " directive 2009/28/ec,  repealing,  directive 2001/77/ec", " directive 2009/28/ec,  repealing,  directive 2003/30/ec"]}, "32013H0179_p6": {"text": "European Union (2009). directive 2009/28/ec OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND COUNCIL of 23 April 2009 on the promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources and amending and subsequently repealing directive 2001/77/ec directive 2003/30/ec, Official Journal of the European Union.", "triples": [" directive 2009/28/ec,  amending,  directive 2001/77/ec", " directive 2009/28/ec,  amending,  directive 2003/30/ec", " directive 2009/28/ec,  repealing,  directive 2003/30/ec", " directive 2009/28/ec,  repealing,  directive 2001/77/ec"]}, "32013H0179_p7": {"text": "(56)  European Union 2009: directive 2009/28/ec of the European Parliament and Council of 23 April 2009 on the promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources and amending and subsequently repealing directive 2001/77/ec directive 2003/30/ec (OJ L 140, 5.6.2009, p. 16).", "triples": [" directive 2009/28/ec,  amending,  directive 2001/77/ec", " directive 2009/28/ec,  amending,  directive 2003/30/ec", " directive 2009/28/ec,  repealing,  directive 2001/77/ec", " directive 2009/28/ec,  repealing,  directive 2003/30/ec"]}}, "summary_annotations": {}}
