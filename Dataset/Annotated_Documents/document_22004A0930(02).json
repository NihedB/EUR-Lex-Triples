customs matters to include cooperation on container security and related matters \r\rTHE EUROPEAN COMMUNITY AND THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,\r\rHaving regard to the provisions of the Agreement

,\r\rWhereas:\r\r(1) Acknowledging that US Customs and Border Protection is, as of  1 March 2003 , the successor to the United States Customs Service under the CMAA. \r\r(2) Recalling that the Contracting Parties may by mutual consent decide to expand areas of cooperation under the CMAA pursuant to Article 3. \r\r(3) Recalling that, under Article 22 of the CMAA, the JCCC consists of

United States of America and of the European Community. \r\r(6) Being convinced that this cooperation can be further improved by, among other things, intensifying the exchange of relevant information and best practices among the US Customs and Border Protection, the European Commission and the customs authorities of Member States of the European Community in order to ensure that general customs controls of international trade take due account of security concerns. \r\r(7) Acknowledging the importance of extending this cooperation to all modes of international transport and all kinds of goods, initially putting priority on sea-container transport. \r\r(8) Recognising the high volume of two-way sea-container and other modes of trade between the European Community and the United States of America, and the important role of both the European Community and the United States of America as transport hubs for containers coming from many countries. \r\r(9) Recognising that global sea containers are imported into, transhipped through, or transiting the United States of America and the European Community. \r\r(10) Being convinced that there is a need to deter, prevent, and interdict

need to increase security for the European Community and the United States of America and at the same time facilitate legitimate trade. \r\r(12) Noting the importance of developing, to the extent practicable, reciprocal systems for securing and facilitating legitimate trade with due regard to threat assessments. \r\r(13) Recognising that substantially greater security of legitimate trade can be achieved through a system where the customs authority of the importing country works collaboratively with customs authorities involved in earlier parts of the supply chain to use timely information and inspection technology to target and screen high-risk containers before they are shipped from their ports or places of loading or transhipment. \r\r(14) Supporting the objectives of the Container

quickly as possible for all ports within the European Community where the exchange of sea-container traffic with the United States of America is more than de minimis and where certain minimum requirements are met and where adequate inspection technology exists, \r\rHAVE AGREED ON THE FOLLOWING:\r\rArticle 1\r\rTo intensify and broaden customs cooperation under the CMAA to improve the

a first priority to enhance the identification and security screening of all high-risk sea-container shipments;\r\r3. establishing minimum standards, to the greatest extent practicable, for risk-management techniques and related requirements and programs; and\r\r4. coordinating positions, to the greatest extent practicable, in any multilateral fora where issues related to container

It aims to improve cargo security on a reciprocal basis for both parties whilst ensuring equal treatment of US and EU ports and operators. It also sets out a work programme for the implementation of the following measures: the development of standards for risk management techniques;information required to identify high-risk shipments imported by the parties;industry partnership programmes.\nThe external coordination of customs control standards with the United States is also necessary to guarantee supply-chain security and ensure the continued flow of legitimate trade in containers. The customs authorities of the importing country work together with the customs authorities involved in earlier parts of the supply chain. This is to use timely information and inspection technology to target and screen high-risk containers before they are shipped from their ports or places of loading or transhipment in the respective countries. It is essential to ensure that EU ports can participate in the CSI on the basis of uniform principles. The adoption of comparable standards should also be promoted in US ports.\nTo broaden and intensify customs cooperation between the parties, a consultation procedure has been put in place. EU countries that negotiate arrangements with the United States in the fields governed by the extended CMAA must consult the European Commission and the other EU countries beforehand as well as share information and ensure that the agreed arrangements comply with the EU treaties and policies and the extended CMAA. If the Commission considers that an arrangement, which an EU country wishes to include in cooperation with the United States, does not comply, it informs the country concerned. Similarly, that country is informed when a subject has to be dealt with under the extended CMAA.\nThe EU–US Joint Customs Cooperation Committee is mandated with finding an appropriate form and content for documents and measures with a view to continuing to implement intensified and broadened customs cooperation under the agreement.\nThe agreement sets up a working group composed of representatives of the US customs authorities assisted by interested EU countries. It reports regularly to the Joint Customs Cooperation Committee, the US Customs and Border Protection and the Commission. It has the task of examining and making recommendations in areas such as: defining minimum standards and recommending methods by which those standards may be met;identifying and broadening the application of best practice for security controls of international trade, especially those developed under CSI;establishing standards for the information required to identify and monitor high-risk shipments imported into, transhipped through, or transiting the United States and the EU;improving and establishing standards for targeting and screening such high-risk shipments and developing minimum standards for inspection technologies and screening methodologies;improving and establishing standards for industry partnership programmes to improve supply-chain security and facilitate legitimate trade;identifying any regulatory or legislative changes necessary to implement its recommendations;considering the type of documents and measures to further implement intensified and broadened customs cooperation on the issues set out in the annex to the agreement.\nIn 2004, the EU and the United States adopted, via the Joint Customs Cooperation Committee, recommendations on strengthening the security of the maritime transport of containers under the agreement.\nDATE OF ENTRY INTO FORCE\n              \nThe agreement entered into force on 28 April 2004.\nBACKGROUND\n              \nFor more information, see:\nInternational Customs Cooperation and Mutual Administrative Assistance Agreements (European Commission).\nMAIN DOCUMENTS\n            \nCouncil Decision 2004/634/EC of 30 March 2004 concerning the conclusion of the agreement between the European Community and the United States of America on intensifying and broadening the agreement on customs cooperation and mutual assistance in customs matters to include cooperation on container security and related matters (OJ L 304, 30.9.2004, pp. 32-33)\nAgreement between the European Community and the United States of America on intensifying and broadening the agreement on customs cooperation and mutual assistance in customs matters to include cooperation on container security and related matters (OJ L 304, 30.9.2004, pp. 34-37)\nRELATED DOCUMENTS\n            \nCouncil Decision 97/541/EC of 21 May 1997 concerning the conclusion of the agreement between the European Community and the United States of America on customs cooperation and mutual assistance in customs matters (OJ L 222, 12.8.1997, p. 16)\nAgreement between the European Community and the United States of America on customs cooperation and mutual assistance in customs matters (OJ L 222, 12.8.1997, pp. 17-24)\nlast update 01.04.2020", "tags": ["container", "transport safety", "cooperation agreement (EU)", "customs cooperation", "United States"], "subjects": ["Cooperation", "Commercial policy", "External relations"], "split": "train", "reference_annotations": {}, "summary_annotations": {}}
