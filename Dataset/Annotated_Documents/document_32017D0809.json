UNSCR 1540 (2004) established binding obligations for all States which aimed to prevent and deter non-State actors from obtaining access to such weapons and weapon-related material. It also called upon States to present the Committee of the Security Council established by UNSCR 1540 (2004) (the ‘1540 Committee’) with a report on steps which they have taken or intend to take to implement UNSCR 1540 (2004).\n(4)\nOn 27 April 2006 the UN Security Council adopted Resolution 1673 (2006) and decided that the 1540 Committee was to intensify its efforts to promote the full implementation of UNSCR 1540 (2004) through programmes of work, outreach, assistance, dialogue and cooperation. It also invited the 1540 Committee to explore with States and international, regional and sub-regional organisations the possibility of sharing experience and lessons learned, and the availability of programmes which might facilitate the implementation of UNSCR 1540 (2004).\n(5)\nOn 20 April 2011 the UN Security Council adopted Resolution 1977 (2011) and decided to extend the mandate of the 1540 Committee for a period of 10 years until 25 April 2021. It also decided that the 1540 Committee was to continue to intensify its efforts to promote the full implementation by all States of UNSCR 1540 (2004), to engage actively in matching offers and requests for assistance, through such means as visits at the invitation of the State concerned, assistance templates, action plans or other information submitted to the 1540 Committee and to conduct a comprehensive review on the status of implementation of UNSCR 1540 (2004) before December 2016.\n(6)\nOn 15 December 2016 the Security Council unanimously adopted Resolution 2325 (2016) and thereby endorsed the outcome of the comprehensive review process of UNSCR 1540 (2004) conducted during 2016. It called on all States to strengthen national measures in implementing UNSCR 1540 (2004) and called for greater assistance for building State capability in that regard, including through voluntary contributions, as well as for greater cooperation among stakeholders, civil society and academia.\n(7)\nThe implementation of Council Joint Action 2006/419/CFSP (1), Council Joint Action 2008/368/CFSP (2) and Council Decision 2013/391/CFSP (3) contributed to diminishing significantly the number of non-reporting States and the number of States which did not submit additional information required by the 1540 Committee following their submission of incomplete reports.\n(8)\nThe UN Office for Disarmament Affairs (UNODA), which is responsible for providing the 1540 Committee and its Group of Experts with substantive and logistical support, should be entrusted with the technical implementation of the projects to be carried out under this Decision.\n(9)\nThis Decision should be implemented in accordance with the Financial and Administrative Framework Agreement concluded by the Commission with the UN concerning the management of financial contributions by the Union to programmes or projects administered by the UN,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\nArticle 1\n1.

OBJECTIVE\nThe overall objective of this Decision is to promote the implementation of UNSCRs 1540 (2004) and 1977 (2011), within the framework of the implementation of the EU strategy against proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, through specific measures with the following aims: to enhance the relevant national and regional efforts and capabilities primarily through capacity-building and assistance facilitation; to contribute to the practical implementation of specific recommendations of both the 2009 comprehensive review on the status of implementation of UNSCR 1540 (2004) and the outcome of the comprehensive review conducted during 2016, in particular in the areas of technical assistance, international cooperation and raising public awareness.\n2.   MEASURES\n2.1.   Objectives of the measures\n—\nTo support country-specific and regional implementation activities, including the development of voluntary national implementation action plans or roadmaps for the implementation of key requirements of UNSCR 1540 (2004), training for national experts, strengthening regional/sub-regional coordination efforts and other activities designed to promote a sustained national and sub-regional implementation process;\n—\nTo promote and support universality of reporting as called for by UNSCR 1540 (2004);\n—\nTo strengthen the role of industry and civil society in implementing UNSCR 1540 (2004);\n—\nTo raise awareness amongst policy-makers and representatives from industry and civil society regarding the importance of the implementation of UNSCR 1540 (2004);\n—\nTo enhance sub-regional, regional and international cooperation regarding the implementation of UNSCR 1540 (2004) with due regard to the role played by the 1540 Committee and its Group of Experts, as well as to the Committee's programme of work;\n—\nTo contribute to achieving greater synergies in the efforts of international stakeholders in the implementation of UNSCR 1540 (2004), in particular in the OSCE region.\n2.2.   Description of the measures\n(a)\nUNODA, acting in close liaison with the 1540 Committee, will respond to up to seven assistance requests from States, giving priority to States from the OSCE region, the African region as well as the Gulf and Middle East region. The assistance provided will be designed to enable States to take additional, practical steps to implement the obligations of UNCSR 1540 (2004) at national level, thereby responding to assistance requests by States to the 1540 Committee. Such assistance will complement the matchmaking function of the 1540 Committee, but not include the provision or procurement of technical equipment.\n(b)\nUNODA will support efforts to achieve universality of reporting. While UNSCR 1540 (2004) calls upon States to present a first report no later than six months from the adoption of the Resolution to the 1540 Committee on steps they have taken or intend to take to implement that Resolution, there are still a number of non-reporting States. In that context, UNODA will support through its Regional Centre in Africa (UNREC) and its Regional Centre in Asia and the Pacific (UNRCPD), and in close association with the African Union and relevant regional European Union Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear Risk Mitigation Centres of Excellence (the ‘EU CBRN Centres of Excellence’), up to five national or regional activities specifically targeted at non-reporting States.\n(c)\nFurthermore, UNODA will support three regional/sub-regional training courses for national points of contact nominated by States with a view to coordinating national implementation of UNSCR 1540 (2004) and assisting in the development of a network of points of contact as well as improving their communication with the 1540 Committee.\n(d)\nUNODA will subcontract, among other activities, to the OSCE Secretariat a study on how to promote further synergies in the efforts of relevant international stakeholders involved in the implementation of UNSCR 1540 (2004) in the OSCE region.\n(e)\nUNODA will support up to three UNSCR 1540 (2004) regional industry conferences. Since 2012, the Government of Germany, with the support of the EU outreach programme for dual-use items and UNODA, hosted four conferences in the city of Wiesbaden for stakeholders from industry and civil society in order to encourage industry and private-sector engagement in the implementation of UNSCR 1540 (2004). One of the outcomes of the fourth such conference, held in November 2015 in cooperation with the 1540 Committee, its Group of Experts and UNODA, was a common understanding to strengthen the regional approach, i.e. to carry out similar conferences in locations including Asia, Latin America and the OSCE region. Future regional conferences for stakeholders from industry should be complementary to the work under the relevant Union programmes, e.g. the EU CBRN Centres of Excellence and/or the EU P2P Export Control Programme for dual-use items.\n(f)\nUNODA will organise or support workshops for representatives of civil society, academia and industry aimed at the practical implementation of the 2016 comprehensive review of the status of the implementation of UNSCR 1540 (2004). In that context, UNODA will support the participation of national officials of States requesting assistance in training courses and other capacity-building activities.\nAs appropriate, UNODA will seek synergies with the activities of other actors involved in the implementation of UNSCR 1540 (2004), the regional EU CBRN Centres of Excellence as well as other Union-sponsored programmes in this field.\n2.3.   Results of the measures\nImproved implementation of UNSCR 1540 (2004) through additional steps to be undertaken by States towards its full implementation; development of effective and realistic national action plans or road maps for the implementation of the key requirements of that resolution; enhanced regional and sub-regional coordinated approaches to the implementation of UNSCR 1540 (2004); and the establishment of effective partnerships between participating States and assistance providers.\nA higher number of first reports from States that have yet to submit their first national report on the implementation of UNSCR 1540 (2004).\nGreater involvement of representatives of industry and civil society in international, regional and national UNSCR 1540 (2004) implementation efforts.\nEnhanced public awareness of the importance of full implementation of UNSCR 1540 (2004) and the results of the 2009 and 2016 comprehensive reviews.\n3.   PARTNERS FOR THE MEASURES\nUNODA, acting in close liaison with the 1540 Committee, will continue developing effective partnerships with relevant regional organisations, in particular the OSCE, the African Union and the League of Arab States, as well as with the EU CBRN Centres of Excellence, which benefit from financial support from the European Commission and are implemented jointly by the Joint Research Centre (JRC) and the UN Interregional Crime and Justice Research Institute (UNICRI).\nWith regard to projects in the OSCE region, UNODA shall conclude an agreement with the OSCE regarding the transfer of funds required for the implementation of such projects, thereby making full use of the Memorandum of Understanding on joint implementation of projects on non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction that UNODA and the OSCE Secretariat concluded in 2011.\nUNODA will also maintain its cooperation with other international organisations and agencies, including the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), the World Health Organization (WHO), the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE), to ensure effective synergies and avoid duplication.\n4.   INTERACTION WITH UNION EFFORTS\nBased on the regular feedback from UNODA on its activities, the Union may decide to complement those efforts through targeted diplomatic action aimed at raising awareness regarding the implementation of national action plans and the submission of national reports.\n5.   BENEFICIARIES OF THE MEASURES\n—\nStates, government officials;\n—\n1540 Committee and other UN entities;\n—\nInternational, regional and sub-regional organisations;\n—\nGovernments and organisations providing and receiving technical assistance under UNSCR 1540 (2004);\n—\nCivil society and industry.\n6.   VENUE\nUNODA will select potential venues for the meetings, workshops and other events. The criteria used for choosing the venues will include the willingness and commitment of a relevant State in a particular region to host the event. Specific locations of country visits or country-specific activities will depend on invitations from interested States and, as appropriate, on decisions of the 1540 Committee in accordance with the Committee's programme of work.\n7.   DURATION\nThe total estimated duration of the project is 36 months.", "summary": "Weapons of mass destruction: combating proliferation\nWeapons of mass destruction: combating proliferation\nSUMMARY OF:\nDecision (CFSP) 2017/809 on the implementation of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1540 (2004) on the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery\nWHAT IS THE AIM OF THE DECISION?\n              \nIn accordance with the EU’s 2003 strategy against proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, the decision supports the implementation of the United Nations Security Council Resolution 1540. It follows on from similar decisions adopted in 2006, in 2008 and in 2013.\nThe EU strategy is designed to prevent, deter, halt and, if possible, eliminate weapons of mass destruction (WMD) programmes worldwide. Since its inception in 2003, the basic principles of the strategy have included:\nStrengthening international non-proliferation mechanisms and working to improve systems for verifying violations of rules laid down in multilateral treaties.\nPromoting a regionally and internationally stable environment, by strengthening programmes to promote disarmament and incorporating the non-proliferation objective in all EU political, diplomatic and economic activities.\nWorking closely with key partners like the USA, Russia or NATO and assisting non-EU countries.\nKEY POINTS\n              \nThe Council continuously monitors the strategy, receiving progress reports every 6 months.\nThe strategy is implemented through projects and activities such as:\nsupport for the Hague Code of Conduct, a set of rules against ballistic missiles (Decision 2014/913/CFSP)\nsupport for the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (Decision 2015/259/CFSP)\na European network of independent non-proliferation think tanks (Decision 2010/430/CFSP)\nsupport for World Health Organisation biosafety/security activities (Decision 2013/668/CFSP).\nIn 2008, the EU adopted new lines for action on WMD proliferation. These were designed to make the 2003 strategy more effective by, for instance, raising awareness in scientific, academic and financial institutions and developing measures to prevent the transfer of knowledge about WMDs to the wrong parties. They reiterate the importance of the 2003 strategy and the principles that determine EU action (effective multilateralism, prevention and international cooperation) and their role in helping implement the United Nations Security Council Resolution 1540.\nUN Security Council Resolution 1540 obliges its signatories to refrain from supporting by any means non-state actors* from:\ndeveloping,\nacquiring,\nmanufacturing,\npossessing,\ntransporting,\ntransferring or using\nnuclear, chemical or biological weapons and their delivery systems.\nIn 2011, the Security Council adopted UN Resolution 1977, which reaffirms that the proliferation of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons and their means of delivery constitutes a threat to international peace and security. It extends until 2021 the mandate of the 1540 Committee, a committee whose role is to engage actively with states and relevant international, regional and subregional organisations to promote the sharing of experience, lessons learned and effective practices, in the areas covered by UNSCR 1540.\nThe decision cites the EU’s support, in line with its WMD strategy, for the objective of fostering the role of the UN Security Council and enhancing its expertise in addressing the challenges of proliferation. In practical terms, this support consists of sub-regional workshops, country visits, meetings, events, training and public relations efforts. The UN Office for Disarmament Affairs is responsible for the technical implementation of the projects, in cooperation with the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe, the African Union, the Organisation of American States and the League of Arab States, as appropriate.\nBACKGROUND\n              \nFor more information, see:\nEU measures to combat WMD proliferation (European External Action Service).\nKEY TERMS\n              \nNon-state actors: an individual or organisation with significant political influence but is not allied to any particular country or state.\nMAIN DOCUMENT\n            \nCouncil Decision (CFSP) 2017/809 of 11 May 2017 in support of the implementation of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1540 (2004) on the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery (OJ L 121, 12.5.2017, pp. 39-44)\nRELATED DOCUMENTS\n            \nCouncil Decision (CFSP) 2015/259 of 17 February 2015 in support of activities of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) in the framework of the implementation of the EU Strategy against Proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction (OJ L 43, 18.2.2015, pp. 14-28)\nCouncil Decision 2014/913/CFSP of 15 December 2014 in support of the Hague Code of Conduct and ballistic missile non-proliferation in the framework of the implementation of the EU Strategy against Proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction (OJ L 360, 17.12.2014, pp. 44-52)\nCouncil Decision 2013/668/CFSP of 18 November 2013 in support of World Health Organisation activities in the area of biosafety and biosecurity in the framework of the European Union Strategy against the proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction (OJ L 310, 20.11.2013, pp. 13-19)\nCouncil Decision 2013/391/CFSP of 22 July 2013 in support of the practical implementation of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1540 (2004) on non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery (OJ L 198, 23.7.2013, pp. 40-44)\nSuccessive amendments to Decision 2013/391/CFSP have been incorporated into the original document.
