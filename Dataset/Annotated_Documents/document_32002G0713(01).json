The Council also undertook to carry on drawing up such a framework with a view to adoption by the Council (Education/Youth) of 30 May 2002.(4) The Council (Education/Youth) has already adopted various Resolutions regarding youth participation(1), social inclusion of young people(2), promoting young people's initiative, enterprise and creativity(3), and the added value of voluntary activity for young people in the context of the development of Community action on youth(4), as well as the declaration on combating racism and xenophobia on the Internet by intensifying work with young people.(5) By Decision No 1031/2000/EC of 13 April 2000, the European Parliament and the Council adopted the \"Youth\" Community action programme(5), on the basis of Article 149 of the Treaty, implemented by the Commission, in order to allow young people to acquire knowledge, skills and competencies which may be one of the foundations of their future development, and to exercise responsible citizenship so as to become an active part of society.(6) The Laeken Declaration, annexed to the conclusions of the European Council of 14-15 December 2001, states that one of the basic challenges facing the European Union is \"how to bring citizens, and primarily the young, closer to the European design and the European institutions\",RECALL THAT:1.

The OMC will be applied with a flexible approach in a manner suited to the youth field, with due regard for the competencies of the Member States and the principle of subsidiarity.3. The principles of equality between men and women as set out in Article 2 and Article 3(2) and of non-discrimination as set out in Articles 12 and 13 of the Treaty must be taken into account in any proposed initiative coming within the framework of European cooperation in the youth field.4. Young people, whether organised or not, as well as youth associations as representatives of youth, should be associated with the cooperation framework both at the European and national level.5. Candidate countries should be associated with the framework of European cooperation in the youth field through whatever means are deemed appropriate.6. INVITE THE COMMISSION AND THE MEMBER STATES, EACH WITHIN THEIR OWN AREAS OF COMPETENCE, as regards the OMC and the horizontal consideration of the Youth dimension in other policies and initiatives relevant to youth, to see, where appropriate, that those policies and initiatives that affect the young people both at national and at European level, take into consideration matters such as the needs, the situation, the living conditions and the expectations of youth.CONCERNING THE APPLICATION OF THE OMC:7.

This resolution follows on from this White Paper by setting the priorities and the timetable for the European Union’s (EU) work up until 2004 in the field of \"youth\".\nFor cooperation based on the open method of coordination\nIn the updated cooperation framework, based in particular on the open method of coordination, the Council is proposing four priority themes:\nencouraging young people’s participation in the exercise of active citizenship and civil society. This means supporting the work of youth associations and other forms of active participation in order to improve young people’s participation and social cohesion. The exchange of good practices is essential here;\nenhancing the information addressed to young people\n and existing information services for young people (successive reports deal with participation and information together);\npromoting voluntary activities among young people\n. Making it easier for young people to find voluntary work so as to develop their sense of responsibility and citizenship and their active participation in society. Public authorities, businesses and civil society are called on to recognise the value of voluntary work so as to improve young people’s opportunities on the labour market;\nencouraging greater understanding and knowledge of youth\n. This comprises, in particular, the compilation of studies on youth matters and the networking of research structures.\nOn the basis of these four priorities, the Commission will be sending targeted questionnaires to EU countries from July 2002 onwards. EU countries’ answers should be based on consultation with young people, youth associations and, where applicable, national youth councils or similar organisations. The Commission will then draw up reports in order to identify good practices of common interest for EU countries and proposals for common objectives to be adopted by the Council.\nFor their part, EU countries are called on to implement the measures they judge appropriate in order to achieve the common objectives set by the Council.\nTaking greater account of the \"youth\" dimension in other policies\nThe Council calls on the Commission and EU countries to give the \"youth\" dimension greater priority in other policies and programmes. The Council, in cooperation with the Commission, reserves the right to add to the priority areas stated in the White Paper (education and lifelong learning, mobility, employment and social integration, combating racism and xenophobia and other priorities).\nUPDATED FRAMEWORK FOR COOPERATION\nThe new framework for cooperation is updated by the resolution adopted by the Council on 24 November 2005. This framework for cooperation comprises three strands:\nPromoting active citizenship among young people\nThe open method of coordination in the field of youth allows EU countries to cooperate with a view to sharing best practice on participation by young people, information for young people, voluntary activities and a greater knowledge of the field of youth, while respecting the areas of responsibility set out in the Treaties.\nThe European Pact for Youth\nThe European Pact highlights youth issues in key areas of the Lisbon partnership for growth and jobs, particularly in relation to young people’s access to the labour market, development of their creativity and the acquisition of entrepreneurial skills. The European Pact also highlights skills acquired through high-quality, relevant education, training and mobility experiences in the formal as well as the non-formal sector, and reconciliation of working life and family life.\nIncorporating a youth dimension\nIncorporating a youth dimension in other European policies will concern in particular anti-discrimination, healthy lifestyles, including sport, and research on youth issues.\nRELATED ACTS\nCommunication from the Commission to the Council of 25 October 2004 – Follow-up to the White Paper on a New Impetus for European Youth: evaluation of activities conducted in the framework of European cooperation in the youth field [COM(2004) 694 final – Not published in the Official Journal].\nLast updated: 26.11.2010", "tags": ["information", "young person", "social participation", "education policy", "action programme", "voluntary work", "cooperation policy", "evaluation method"], "subjects": ["Education, vocational training and youth"], "split": "train", "reference_annotations": {}, "summary_annotations": {}}
