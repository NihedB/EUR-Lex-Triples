{"celex_id": "32014L0047", "reference": "29.4.2014\nEN\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\nL 127/134\nDIRECTIVE 2014/47/EU OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL\nof 3 April 2014\non the technical roadside inspection of the roadworthiness of commercial vehicles circulating in the Union and repealing Directive 2000/30/EC\n(Text with EEA relevance)\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 91 thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee (1),\nAfter consulting the Committee of the Regions,\nActing in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure (2),\nWhereas:\n(1)\nIn its White Paper of 28 March 2011 entitled ‘Roadmap to a Single European Transport Area — Towards a competitive and resource efficient transport system’, the Commission set out a ‘zero-vision’ objective whereby the Union should move close to zero fatalities in road transport by 2050. With a view to attaining that objective, vehicle technology is expected to contribute greatly to the improvement of the safety record of road transport.\n(2)\nIn its Communication entitled ‘Towards a European road safety area: policy orientations on road safety 2011-2020’, the Commission proposed a further halving of the overall number of road fatalities in the Union by 2020, starting from 2010. With a view to attaining that goal, the Commission set out seven strategic objectives, and identified actions for safer vehicles, a strategy to reduce the number of injuries and measures to improve the safety of vulnerable road users, in particular motorcyclists.\n(3)\nRoadworthiness testing is a part of a wider regime designed to ensure that vehicles are kept in a safe and environmentally acceptable condition during their use. That regime should cover periodic roadworthiness testing of vehicles and technical roadside inspection of vehicles used for commercial road transport activities, as well as providing for a vehicle registration procedure allowing for the suspension of a vehicle’s authorisation to be used in road traffic where the vehicle constitutes an immediate risk to road safety. Periodic testing should be the main tool to ensure roadworthiness. Roadside inspections of commercial vehicles should merely be complementary to periodic testing.\n(4)\nA number of technical standards and requirements in respect of vehicle safety and environmental characteristics have been adopted within the Union. It is necessary to ensure, through a regime of unexpected technical roadside inspections, that vehicles remain roadworthy.\n(5)\nTechnical roadside inspections are a crucial element for the achievement of a continuous high level of roadworthiness of commercial vehicles throughout their use. Such inspections contribute not only to road safety and a reduction of vehicle emissions but also to avoiding unfair competition in road transport due to acceptance of different inspection levels as between the Member States.\n(6)\nRegulation (EC) No 1071/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council (3) established the European Register of Road Transport Undertakings (ERRU). ERRU allows national electronic registers of transport undertakings to be interconnected throughout the Union, in compliance with the Union rules on the protection of personal data. The use of that system, operated by the competent authority of each Member State, facilitates cooperation among Member States.\n(7)\nThis Directive should apply to certain commercial vehicles with a design speed exceeding 25 km/h of the categories defined in Directive 2007/46/EC of the European Parliament and the Council (4). It should not, however, prevent the Member States from carrying out technical roadside inspections on vehicles not covered by this Directive or checking other aspects of road transport, in particular those relating to driving and resting time or the transport of dangerous goods.\n(8)\nWheeled tractors with a maximum design speed exceeding 40 km/h are increasingly used to replace trucks in local transport activities and for commercial road haulage purposes. Their risk potential is comparable to that of trucks, and vehicles in that category, which are used mainly on public roads, should therefore be treated in the same way as trucks when it comes to technical roadside inspections.\n(9)\nReports on the implementation of Directive 2000/30/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (5) clearly show the importance of technical roadside inspections. During the period from 2009 to 2010, more than 350 000 vehicles subject to technical roadside inspections throughout the Union were reported to be in a condition requiring their immobilisation. Those reports also show very significant differences between the results of inspections carried out in different Member States. During the period from 2009 to 2010, the rate of detection for certain deficiencies ranged from 2,1 % of all vehicles inspected in one Member State to 48,3 % in another. Finally, those reports show the significant differences in the number of technical roadside inspections performed as between Member States. In order to arrive at a more balanced approach, Member States should commit to carrying out an appropriate number of inspections, proportionate to the number of commercial vehicles registered and/or operating on their territory.\n(10)\nVans, such as N1 vehicles, and their trailers are not subject to the same road safety requirements at Union level as heavy duty vehicles such as those relating to driving time, training for professional drivers or the installation of speed limitation devices. Although N1 vehicles do not fall within the scope of this Directive, Member States should take such vehicles into account in their overall road safety and roadside inspection strategies.\n(11)\nIn order to avoid unnecessary administrative burdens and costs, and to improve the efficiency of inspections, it should be possible for competent national authorities to select, as a priority, vehicles operated by undertakings not complying with road safety and environmental standards, while vehicles which are operated by responsible and safety-minded operators and properly maintained should be rewarded with less frequent inspections. The selection of vehicles for roadside inspection based on the risk profile of their operators could prove to be a useful tool for the purposes of checking high-risk undertakings more closely and more often.\n(12)\nRoadside inspections should be supported by the use of a risk rating system. Regulation (EC) No 1071/2009 requires Member States to extend the risk classification system established under Directive 2006/22/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (6), as regards implementation of the rules on driving time and resting-periods, to cover other specified areas relating to road transport, including the roadworthiness of commercial vehicles. Consequently, the information concerning the number and severity of deficiencies found in vehicles should be introduced into the risk rating system established under Article 9 of Directive 2006/22/EC. It should be possible for Member States to decide on the appropriate technical and administrative arrangements for the operation of risk rating systems. The effectiveness and harmonisation of risk rating systems throughout the Union should be further analysed.\n(13)\nThe holder of the registration certificate and, where applicable, the operator of the vehicle should be responsible for keeping the vehicle in a roadworthy condition.\n(14)\nInspectors, when performing technical roadside inspections, should act independently, and their judgement should not be affected by conflicts of interest, including those of an economic or personal nature, in particular as regards the driver, the operator or the holder of the registration certificate, that could have any influence on the impartiality and objectivity of their decisions. There should therefore be no direct correlation between the reward of inspectors and the results of technical roadside inspections. This should not prevent a Member State from authorising private bodies to perform both more detailed technical roadside inspections and vehicle repairs, even on the same vehicle.\n(15)\nTechnical roadside inspections should consist of initial and, where necessary, more detailed inspections. In both cases they should cover relevant parts and systems of vehicles. In order to achieve harmonisation of more detailed inspections at Union level, recommended test methods and examples of deficiencies and their categorisation according to their severity should be introduced for each test item.\n(16)\nSecuring of cargo is crucial for road safety. Cargo should therefore be secured in such a way as to cope with accelerations occurring during the use of the vehicle on road. For the sake of practicality, the mass-forces resulting from such accelerations should be used as limit values based on European standards. Personnel involved in checking whether cargo is adequately secured should be appropriately trained.\n(17)\nAll parties involved in the logistics process, including packers, loaders, transport companies, operators and drivers, have a role to play in ensuring that cargo is properly packed and loaded on a suitable vehicle.\n(18)\nIn several Member States, reports of technical roadside inspections are drawn up by electronic means. In such cases, a copy of the inspection report should be provided to the driver. All the data and information gathered during technical roadside inspections should be transferred to a common database of the Member State concerned, so that the data can be easily processed and the relevant information can be transferred without any additional administrative burden.\n(19)\nIn order to reduce the administrative burden on inspection authorities, reports of initial technical roadside inspections, including on vehicles registered in third countries, should contain only essential information recording that a check took place on a particular vehicle and the outcome of that check. A detailed report should be required only where a more detailed inspection takes place following an initial inspection.\n(20)\nThe Commission should examine the possibility of combining the report form contained in Annex IV with other reports.\n(21)\nThe use of mobile inspection units reduces the delay and costs for operators as more detailed inspections can be performed directly at the roadside. The closest practicable testing centres and designated roadside inspection facilities may also be used to carry out more detailed inspections.\n(22)\nPersonnel conducting technical roadside inspections should be appropriately trained or qualified, including for the purpose of carrying out visual inspections in an efficient manner. Inspectors performing more detailed technical roadside inspections should have at least the same skills and fulfil the same requirements as those performing roadworthiness tests in accordance with Directive 2014/45/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council (7). Member States should require inspectors carrying out inspections in designated roadside inspection facilities or using mobile inspection units to fulfil these or equivalent requirements approved by the competent authority.\n(23)\nIn order to mitigate the costs arising from the use of technical equipment for a more detailed roadside inspection, Member States should be able to require a payment where deficiencies have been found. The amount of that payment should be reasonable and proportionate.\n(24)\nCooperation and exchange of best practices between Member States is crucial in order to achieve a more harmonised system of technical roadside inspections throughout the Union. Consequently, Member States should work more closely together, also during operational activities, where possible. Such cooperation should include the periodical organisation of concerted technical roadside inspections.\n(25)\nIn order to ensure the efficient exchange of information between Member States, there should be, within each Member State, a contact point for liaising with other relevant competent authorities. That contact point should also compile relevant statistics. Furthermore, Member States should apply a coherent national enforcement strategy on their territory and should be able to designate a body to coordinate its implementation. The competent authorities in each Member State should designate procedures setting out time limits and the contents of the information to be forwarded.\n(26)\nWhen designating contact points, constitutional provisions and the resulting level of competencies should be respected.\n(27)\nIn order to allow the roadside inspection regime implemented in the Union to be monitored, Member States should communicate to the Commission, before 31 March 2021 and before 31 March every two years thereafter, the results of the technical roadside inspections performed. The Commission should report the data collected to the European Parliament and to the Council.\n(28)\nIn order to minimise the time loss for undertakings and drivers and to increase the overall efficiency of roadside checks, the performance of technical roadside inspections, along with inspections to check compliance with social legislation in the field of road transport, in particular Regulation (EC) No 561/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council (8), Directive 2006/22/EC and Council Regulation (EEC) No 3821/85 (9), should be encouraged.\n(29)\nMember States should lay down rules on penalties applicable to infringements of the provisions of this Directive and should ensure that they are implemented. Those penalties should be effective, proportionate, dissuasive and non-discriminatory. Member States should, in particular, include appropriate measures to address a failure by a driver or operator to cooperate with the inspector and for the unauthorised use of a vehicle with dangerous deficiencies.\n(30)\nIn order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of this Directive, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission. Those powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council (10).\n(31)\nThe Commission should not adopt implementing acts concerning the procedures for the notification of vehicles with major or dangerous deficiencies to the contact points of the Member States of registration, as well as those laying down the data format for the communication to the Commission of the information collected by the Member States concerning vehicles inspected, where the Committee established pursuant to this Directive delivers no opinion on the draft implementing act presented by the Commission.\n(32)\nIn order to update Article 2(1) and Annex IV point 6 as appropriate, without affecting the scope of this Directive, to update point 2 of Annex II in respect of methods, and to adapt point 2 of Annex II in respect of the list of test items, methods, reasons for failure and assessment of deficiencies, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union should be delegated to the Commission. It is of particular importance that the Commission carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level. The Commission, when preparing and drawing up delegated acts, should ensure simultaneous, timely and appropriate transmission of relevant documents to the European Parliament and to the Council.\n(33)\nSince the objective of this Directive, namely to improve road safety by laying down minimum common requirements and harmonised rules concerning technical roadside inspections of vehicles circulating within the Union, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States but can rather, by reason of the scale of the action, be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Directive does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve that objective.\n(34)\nThis Directive respects fundamental rights and observes the principles recognised by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union as referred to in Article 6 of the Treaty on European Union.\n(35)\nThis Directive develops the existing regime of technical roadside inspections, updates the technical requirements of Directive 2000/30/EC and integrates the rules contained in Commission Recommendation 2010/379/EU (11). As a result, Directive 2000/30/EC should be repealed,\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:\nCHAPTER I\nSUBJECT MATTER, DEFINITIONS AND SCOPE\nArticle 1\nSubject matter\nIn order to improve road safety and the environment, this Directive establishes minimum requirements for a regime of technical roadside inspections of the roadworthiness of commercial vehicles circulating within the territory of the Member States.\nArticle 2\nScope\n1.   This Directive shall apply to commercial vehicles with a design speed exceeding 25 km/h of the following categories, as defined in Directive 2003/37/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (12) and Directive 2007/46/EC:\n(a)\nmotor vehicles designed and constructed primarily for the carriage of persons and their luggage comprising more than eight seating positions in addition to the driver’s seating position — vehicle categories M2 and M3;\n(b)\nmotor vehicles designed and constructed primarily for the carriage of goods and having a maximum mass exceeding 3,5 tonnes — vehicle categories N2 and N3;\n(c)\ntrailers designed and constructed for the carriage of goods or persons, as well as for the accommodation of persons, having a maximum mass exceeding 3,5 tonnes — vehicle categories O3 and O4;\n(d)\nwheeled tractors of category T5, the use of which mainly takes place on public roads for commercial road haulage purposes, with a maximum design speed exceeding 40 km/h.\n2.   This Directive does not affect the right of Member States to carry out technical roadside inspections on vehicles not covered by this Directive, such as light commercial vehicles of category N1 having a maximum mass not exceeding 3,5 tonnes, and to check other aspects of road transport and safety, or to carry out inspections in places other than public roads. Nothing in this Directive prevents a Member State from limiting the use of a particular type of vehicle to certain parts of its road network for reasons of road safety.\nArticle 3\nDefinitions\nThe following definitions shall only apply for the purposes of this Directive:\n(1)\n‘vehicle’ means any not rail-borne motor vehicle or its trailer;\n(2)\n‘motor vehicle’ means any power-driven vehicle on wheels which is moved by its own means with a maximum design speed exceeding 25 km/h;\n(3)\n‘trailer’ means any non-self propelled vehicle on wheels which is designed and constructed to be towed by a motor vehicle;\n(4)\n‘semi-trailer’ means any trailer designed to be coupled to a motor vehicle in such a way that part of it rests on the motor vehicle and a substantial part of its mass and the mass of its load is borne by the motor vehicle;\n(5)\n‘cargo’ means all goods that would normally be placed in or on the part of the vehicle designed to carry a load and that are not permanently fixed to the vehicle, including objects within load carriers such as crates, swap bodies or containers on vehicles;\n(6)\n‘commercial vehicle’ means a motor vehicle and its trailer or semi-trailer used primarily for the transport of goods or passengers for commercial purposes, such as transport for hire and reward or own-account transport, or for other professional purposes;\n(7)\n‘vehicle registered in a Member State’ means a vehicle which is registered or put into service in a Member State;\n(8)\n‘holder of a registration certificate’ means the legal or natural person in whose name the vehicle is registered;\n(9)\n‘undertaking’ means an undertaking as defined in point 4 of Article 2 of Regulation (EC) No 1071/2009;\n(10)\n‘technical roadside inspection’ means an unexpected technical inspection of the roadworthiness of a commercial vehicle carried out by the competent authorities of a Member State or under their direct supervision;\n(11)\n‘public road’ means a road that is of general public utility, such as a local, regional or national road, highway, expressway or motorway;\n(12)\n‘roadworthiness test’ means an inspection in accordance with point (9) of Article 3 of Directive 2014/45/EU;\n(13)\n‘roadworthiness certificate’ means a roadworthiness test report issued by the competent authority or a testing centre containing the result of the roadworthiness test;\n(14)\n‘competent authority’ means an authority or public body entrusted by a Member State with responsibility for managing the system of technical roadside inspections, including, where appropriate, the carrying-out of such inspections;\n(15)\n‘inspector’ means a person authorised by a Member State or by its competent authority to carry out initial and/or more detailed technical roadside inspections;\n(16)\n‘deficiencies’ mean technical defects and other instances of non-compliance found during a technical roadside inspection;\n(17)\n‘concerted roadside inspection’ means a technical roadside inspection undertaken jointly by the competent authorities of two or more Member States;\n(18)\n‘operator’ means a natural or legal person operating the vehicle as its owner or authorised to operate the vehicle by its owner;\n(19)\n‘mobile inspection unit’ means a transportable system of test equipment needed to carry out more detailed technical roadside inspections, staffed by inspectors who are competent to carry out more detailed roadside inspection;\n(20)\n‘designated roadside inspection facility’ means a fixed area for the performance of initial and/or more detailed technical roadside inspections which may also be equipped with permanently installed test equipment.\nCHAPTER II\nTECHNICAL ROADSIDE INSPECTION SYSTEM AND GENERAL OBLIGATIONS\nArticle 4\nRoadside inspection system\nThe technical roadside inspection system shall include initial technical roadside inspections as referred to in Article 10(1) and more detailed technical roadside inspections as referred to in Article 10(2).\nArticle 5\nPercentage of vehicles to be inspected\n1.   For vehicles referred to in points (a), (b) and (c) of Article 2(1), the total number of initial technical roadside inspections in the Union shall, in every calendar year, correspond to at least 5 % of the total number of these vehicles that are registered in the Member States.\n2.   Each Member State shall make efforts to carry out an appropriate number of initial technical roadside inspections, proportionate to the total number of such vehicles that are registered in its territory.\n3.   Information on vehicles inspected shall be communicated to the Commission in accordance with Article 20(1).\nArticle 6\nRisk rating system\nFor vehicles referred to in points (a), (b) and (c) of Article 2(1), Member States shall ensure that the information concerning the number and severity of deficiencies set out in Annex II and, where applicable, Annex III found on vehicles operated by individual undertakings is introduced into the risk rating system established under Article 9 of Directive 2006/22/EC. For the attribution of a risk profile to an undertaking, Member States may use the criteria set out in Annex I. That information shall be used to check undertakings with a high risk rating more closely and more often. The risk rating system shall be operated by the competent authorities of the Member States.\nFor the purpose of implementing the first subparagraph, the Member State of registration shall use the information received from other Member States pursuant to Article 18(1).\nMember States may allow additional voluntary roadworthiness tests. Information on compliance with roadworthiness requirements obtained from voluntary tests may be taken into account in order to improve the risk profile of an undertaking.\nArticle 7\nResponsibilities\n1.   Member States shall require that the roadworthiness certificate corresponding to the most recent periodic roadworthiness test or a copy thereof or, in the case of an electronically produced roadworthiness certificate, a certified or original printout of that certificate, and the report of the most recent technical roadside inspection, be kept on board the vehicle when they are available. Member States may allow their authorities to accept electronic evidence of such inspections when information in that regard is accessible.\n2.   Member States shall require undertakings and drivers of a vehicle subject to a technical roadside inspection to cooperate with the inspectors and to provide access to the vehicle, its parts and all relevant documentation for the purposes of the inspection.\n3.   Member States shall ensure that the responsibilities of undertakings for keeping their vehicles in a safe and roadworthy condition are defined, without prejudice to the responsibilities of the drivers of those vehicles.\nArticle 8\nInspectors\n1.   When selecting a vehicle for a technical roadside inspection and when carrying out that inspection, inspectors shall refrain from any discrimination on grounds of the nationality of the driver or of the country of registration or entry into service of the vehicle.\n2.   When carrying out a technical roadside inspection, the inspector shall be free from any conflict of interest that could have any influence on the impartiality and objectivity of his decision.\n3.   The reward of inspectors shall not be directly related to the results of initial or more detailed technical roadside inspections.\n4.   More detailed technical roadside inspections shall be carried out by inspectors who fulfil the minimum competence and training requirements laid down in Article 13 and in Annex IV to Directive 2014/45/EU. Member States may provide that inspectors carrying out inspections in designated roadside inspection facilities or using mobile inspection units are to fulfil those requirements or equivalent requirements approved by the competent authority.\nCHAPTER III\nINSPECTION PROCEDURES\nArticle 9\nSelection of vehicles for initial technical roadside inspection\nWhen identifying vehicles to be subject to an initial technical roadside inspection, inspectors may select, as a priority, vehicles operated by undertakings with a high-risk profile as referred to in Directive 2006/22/EC. Vehicles may also be selected randomly for inspection, or where there is a suspicion that the vehicle presents a risk to road safety or to the environment.\nArticle 10\nContents and methods of technical roadside inspections\n1.   Member States shall ensure that vehicles selected in accordance with Article 9 are subject to an initial technical roadside inspection.\nIn each initial technical roadside inspection of a vehicle, the inspector:\n(a)\nshall check the latest roadworthiness certificate and technical roadside inspection report, where available, kept on board, or electronic evidence thereof in accordance with Article 7(1);\n(b)\nshall carry out a visual assessment of the technical condition of the vehicle;\n(c)\nmay carry out a visual assessment of the securing of the vehicle’s cargo in accordance with Article 13;\n(d)\nmay carry out technical checks by any method deemed appropriate. Such technical checks may be carried out in order to substantiate a decision to submit the vehicle to a more detailed technical roadside inspection, or to request that the deficiencies be rectified without delay in accordance with Article 14(1).\nThe inspector shall verify whether any deficiencies indicated in the previous technical roadside inspection report have been rectified.\n2.   On the basis of the outcome of the initial inspection, the inspector shall decide whether the vehicle or its trailer should be subject to a more detailed roadside inspection.\n3.   A more detailed technical roadside inspection shall cover those items listed in Annex II that are considered necessary and relevant, taking into account in particular the safety of the brakes, tyres, wheels, chassis and nuisance, and the recommended methods applicable to the testing of those items.\n4.   Where the roadworthiness certificate or a roadside inspection report demonstrates that an inspection of one of the items listed in Annex II has been carried out in the course of the preceding three months, the inspector shall not check that item, except where such a check is justified on the grounds of an obvious deficiency.\nArticle 11\nInspection facilities\n1.   A more detailed technical roadside inspection shall be carried out using a mobile inspection unit or a designated roadside inspection facility, or in a testing centre as referred to in Directive 2014/45/EU.\n2.   Where a more detailed inspection is to be carried out in a testing centre or designated roadside inspection facility, it shall be carried out as soon as possible in one of the closest practicable centres or facilities.\n3.   Mobile inspection units and designated roadside inspection facilities shall include appropriate equipment for carrying out a more detailed technical roadside inspection, including the equipment necessary to assess the condition of the brakes and brake efficiency, steering, suspension and nuisance of the vehicle as required. Where mobile inspection units or designated roadside inspection facilities do not include the equipment required to check an item indicated in an initial inspection, the vehicle shall be directed to a testing centre or facility where a detailed check of that item can be performed.\nArticle 12\nAssessment of deficiencies\n1.   For each item to be inspected, Annex II provides a list of possible deficiencies and their level of severity to be used during technical roadside inspections.\n2.   Deficiencies found during technical roadside inspections of vehicles shall be categorised in one of the following groups:\n(a)\nminor deficiencies having no significant effect on the safety of the vehicle or impact on the environment, and other minor non-compliances,\n(b)\nmajor deficiencies that may prejudice the safety of the vehicle or have an impact on the environment or put other road users at risk, or other more significant non-compliances;\n(c)\ndangerous deficiencies constituting a direct and immediate risk to road safety or having an impact on the environment.\n3.   A vehicle having deficiencies falling into more than one of the deficiency groups referred to in paragraph 2 shall be classified in the group corresponding to the more serious deficiency. A vehicle showing several deficiencies within the same inspection areas as defined in the scope of the technical roadside inspection referred to in point 1 of Annex II may be classified in the next most serious deficiency group if it is considered that the combined effect of those deficiencies results in a higher risk to road safety.\nArticle 13\nInspection of cargo securing\n1.   During a roadside inspection a vehicle may be subject to an inspection of its cargo securing in accordance with Annex III, in order to ensure that the cargo is secured in such a way that it does not interfere with safe driving, or pose a threat to life, health, property or the environment. Checks may be carried out to verify that during all kinds of operation of the vehicle, including emergency situations or uphill starting manoeuvres:\n—\nloads can only minimally change their position relative to each other, against walls or surfaces of the vehicle, and\n—\nloads cannot leave the cargo space or move outside the loading surface.\n2.   Without prejudice to the requirements applicable to transport of certain categories of goods, such as those covered by the European Agreement concerning the International Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Road (ADR) (13), cargo securing and inspection of the securing of cargo may be carried out in accordance with the principles and, where appropriate, the standards laid down in Section I of Annex III. The latest version of the standards laid down in point 5 of Section I of Annex III may be used.\n3.   The follow-up procedures referred to in Article 14 may also apply in the case of major or dangerous deficiencies related to cargo securing.\n4.   Member States shall provide that personnel involved in cargo securing checks are to be appropriately trained for that purpose.\nArticle 14\nFollow-up in the case of major or dangerous deficiencies\n1.   Without prejudice to Article 14(3), Member States shall provide that any major or dangerous deficiency revealed by an initial or more detailed inspection is to be rectified before the vehicle is further used on public roads.\n2.   The inspector may decide that the vehicle is to be subject to a full roadworthiness test within a specified time limit if it is registered in the Member State where the technical roadside inspection has been carried out. If the vehicle is registered in another Member State, the competent authority may request the competent authority of that other Member State, via the contact points referred to in Article 17, to carry out a new roadworthiness test of the vehicle following the procedure laid down in Article 18(2). Where major or dangerous deficiencies are found in a vehicle registered outside the Union, Member States may decide to inform the competent authority of the country of registration of the vehicle.\n3.   In the case of any deficiencies which require prompt or immediate rectification due to any direct and immediate risk to road safety, the Member State or the competent authority concerned shall provide that the use of the vehicle in question is to be restricted or prohibited until those deficiencies have been rectified. The use of such a vehicle may be permitted in order to enable it to reach one of the closest workshops where those deficiencies can be rectified, on condition that the dangerous deficiencies in question have been fixed in such a way as to allow it to reach that workshop and that there is no immediate risk to the safety of its occupants or other road users. In the case of deficiencies that do not require immediate rectification, the Member State or the competent authority concerned may decide on the conditions and a reasonable timespan under which the vehicle may be used before the deficiencies are rectified.\nWhere the vehicle cannot be fixed in such a way to allow it to reach the workshop, the vehicle may be brought to an available location where it can be repaired.\nArticle 15\nInspection fees\nWhere deficiencies have been found following a more detailed inspection, Member States may require the payment of a reasonable and proportionate fee that should be linked to the cost of carrying out that inspection.\nArticle 16\nInspection report and databases on technical roadside inspections\n1.   For each initial technical roadside inspection carried out, the following information shall be communicated to the competent authority:\n(a)\ncountry of registration of the vehicle;\n(b)\ncategory of the vehicle;\n(c)\noutcome of the initial technical roadside inspection.\n2.   On completion of a more detailed inspection, the inspector shall draw up a report in accordance with Annex IV. Member States shall ensure that the driver of the vehicle is provided with a copy of the inspection report.\n3.   The inspector shall communicate to the competent authority the results of the more detailed technical roadside inspection within a reasonable time following that inspection. The competent authority shall keep that information in accordance with the applicable legislation on data protection for not less than 36 months from the date of its receipt.\nCHAPTER IV\nCOOPERATION AND EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION\nArticle 17\nDesignation of a contact point\n1.   Member States shall designate a contact point which shall:\n—\nensure coordination with contact points designated by other Member States as regards actions taken under Article 18;\n—\nforward the data referred to in Article 20 to the Commission;\n—\nensure, where appropriate, any other exchange of information with, and the provision of assistance to, the contact points of other Member States.\n2.   Member States shall forward to the Commission the names and contact details of their national contact point by 20 May 2015, and shall inform it without delay of any changes thereto. The Commission shall draw up a list of all contact points and forward it to the Member States.\nArticle 18\nCooperation between Member States\n1.   In cases where major or dangerous deficiencies, or deficiencies resulting in a restriction or prohibition on the use the vehicle, are found in a vehicle not registered in the Member State of inspection, the contact point shall notify the results of the inspection to the contact point of the Member State of registration of the vehicle. That notification shall contain the elements of the roadside inspection report as set out in Annex IV and shall be communicated preferably through the national electronic register referred to in Article 16 of Regulation (EC) No 1071/2009. The Commission shall adopt detailed rules concerning the procedures for the notification of vehicles with major or dangerous deficiencies to the contact point of the Member State of registration in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 23(2).\n2.   In cases where major or dangerous deficiencies are found in a vehicle, the contact point of the Member State in which the vehicle has been inspected may request the competent authority of the Member State in which the vehicle is registered, via the contact point of the latter Member State, to take appropriate follow-up action, such as submitting the vehicle to a further roadworthiness test as provided for in Article 14.\nArticle 19\nConcerted technical roadside inspections\nOn a yearly basis, Member States shall regularly undertake concerted roadside inspection activities. Member States may combine those activities with those provided for by Article 5 of Directive 2006/22/EC.\nArticle 20\nCommunication of information to the Commission\n1.   Before 31 March 2021 and before 31 March every two years thereafter, Member States shall communicate to the Commission, by electronic means, the data collected relating to the previous two calendar years and concerning the vehicles inspected in their territory.

For heavy-duty diesels, this means waiting for at least 10 seconds after the release of the throttle.\n2.\nTo initiate each free acceleration cycle, the throttle pedal must be fully depressed quickly and continuously (in less than one second) but not violently, so as to obtain maximum delivery from the injection pump.\n3.\nDuring each free acceleration cycle, the engine shall reach cut-off speed or, for vehicles with automatic transmissions, the speed specified by the manufacturer or, if this data is not available, then two thirds of the cut-off speed, before the throttle is released. This could be checked, for instance, by monitoring engine speed or by allowing a sufficient time to elapse between initial throttle depression and release, which in the case of vehicles of categories M2, M3, N2 and N3, should be at least two seconds.\n4.\nVehicles shall only be failed if the arithmetic means of at least the last three free acceleration cycles are in excess of the limit value. This may be calculated by ignoring any measurement that departs significantly from the measured mean, or the result of any other statistical calculation that takes account of the scattering of the measurements. Member States may limit the number of test cycles.\n5.\nTo avoid unnecessary testing, Member States may fail vehicles which have measured values significantly in excess of the limit values after fewer than three free acceleration cycles or after the purging cycles.

Inspection of the Securing of Cargo\n1.   Classification of deficiencies\nDeficiencies shall be classified in one of the following deficiency groups:\n—\nMinor deficiency: a minor deficiency exists when the load has been properly secured but a safety advice might be appropriate.\n—\nMajor deficiency: a major deficiency exists when the load has not been sufficiently secured and a significant shifting or overturning of the load or parts thereof is possible.\n—\nDangerous deficiency: a dangerous deficiency exists when traffic safety is directly endangered due to a risk of loss of cargo or parts thereof or a hazard deriving directly from the cargo or an immediate endangering of persons\nWhere several deficiencies are present, the transport is classified in the highest deficiency group. If, in the event that there are several deficiencies, as the effects based on the combination of those deficiencies are expected to reinforce one another, the transport shall be classified in the next higher deficiency level.\n2.   Methods of inspection\nThe method of inspection is a visual assessment of the proper use of appropriate measures in the amount necessary to secure cargo and/or measurement of tension forces, calculation of securing efficiency and checking of certificates where appropriate.\n3.   Assessment of deficiencies\nTable 1 sets out rules that may be applied during a cargo securing inspection to determine whether the condition of the transport is acceptable.\nThe categorisation of the deficiencies shall be determined on the basis of the classifications set out in Section 1 of this chapter, on a case-by-case basis.\nThe values stated in Table 1 are of an indicative nature and should be seen as a guideline for determining the category of a given deficiency in light of the specific circumstances — depending in particular on the nature of the cargo and the discretion of the inspector.\nIn the case of a transport falling within the scope of Council Directive 95/50/EC (1), more specific requirements may apply.\nTable 1\nItem\nDeficiencies\nDeficiencies assessment\nMinor\nMajor\nDangerous\nA\nTransport packaging does not allow proper load securing.\nAt discretion of inspector\nB\nOne or more load units are not properly positioned.\nAt discretion of inspector\nC\nThe vehicle is not suitable for the loaded cargo (deficiency other than those listed under item 10).\nAt discretion of inspector\nD\nObvious defects of the vehicle superstructure (deficiency other than those listed under item 10).\nAt discretion of inspector\n10\nSuitability of the vehicle\n10.1.\nFront wall (if used for the securing of cargo)\n10.1.1.\nPart-weakening rust damage or deformations\nx\nPart cracked risking the integrity of the cargo compartment\nx\n10.1.2.\nInsufficient strength (certificate or label if applicable)\nx\nInsufficient height relevant to cargo carried\nx\n10.2.\nBoard walls (if used for the securing of cargo)\n10.2.1.\nPart-weakening rust damage, deformations, insufficient condition of hinges or catches\nx\nPart cracked;

It sets out minimum requirements and harmonised rules for the technical roadside inspection of these vehicles within the European Union (EU).\nACT\nDirective 2014/47/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 3 April 2014 on the technical roadside inspection of the roadworthiness of commercial vehicles circulating in the Union and repealing Directive 2000/30/EC.\nSUMMARY\nWHAT DOES THIS DIRECTIVE DO?\nThis Directive seeks to improve road safety and to reduce the negative environmental impacts of commercial vehicles. It sets out minimum requirements and harmonised rules for the technical roadside inspection of these vehicles within the European Union (EU).\nThis law was adopted alongside revised rules on vehicle registration documents and a new Directive on periodic roadworthiness tests for vehicles.\nScope\nThe law covers buses and coaches (categories M2 & M3), trucks (N2 & N3) and trailers of over 3,5 tonnes (O3 & O4), as well as tractors used for commercial road haulage and capable of over 40 km/h (T5).\nEU countries may also carry out inspections on vehicles not covered by this law, such as light commercial vehicles, or carry out inspections in places other than public roads.\nInspections\nThese comprise initial and, where necessary, more detailed inspections focusing in particular on brakes, tyres, wheels and chassis, as well as nuisances (noise, exhaust emissions, etc.). The rate of inspections is expected to be proportionate to the number of vehicles registered in each EU country. The aim is for at least 5 % of all commercial vehicles registered in the EU to be inspected each year.\nInspectors\nInspectors must not discriminate on grounds of the nationality of the driver or of the country of registration when selecting a vehicle for inspection. They must be free from any conflict of interest that might compromise their impartiality, and remuneration must not be dependent on the outcome of their inspections.\nDrivers' responsibilities\nDrivers are required to carry on the vehicle its most recent roadworthiness certificate, as well as the most recent roadside inspection report, if available. Drivers must also cooperate with inspectors and give them access to the vehicle, its parts and documentation.\nRisk-rating system\nFrom 2019, EU countries must use risk-rating systems enabling inspectors to identify transport companies with a high risk profile so that they may be checked more closely and frequently.\nSecuring of cargo\nThe law includes principles for inspections and applicable standards for cargo securing, as well as for the assessment of defects.\nDefects\nDefects are classified as minor, major or dangerous. Any major or dangerous deficiency revealed by an inspection must be rectified before the vehicle is further used on public roads.\nInformation exchange\nEU countries will each designate a contact point to ensure information exchanges and assist the contact points of other EU countries. Countries are also expected to regularly participate in concerted roadside inspection activities with neighbouring EU states.\nWHEN DOES THE DIRECTIVE APPLY?\nThis law applies from 20.5.2018.\nREFERENCES\nAct\nEntry into force\nDeadline for transposition in the Member States\nOfficial Journal\nDirective 2014/47/EU\n19.5.2014\n20.5.2017\nOJ L 127, 29.4.2014, p. 134-218\nCorrigendum\n-\n-\nOJ L 197, 4.7.2014, p. 87-87\nRELATED ACTS\nDirective 2014/45/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 3 April 2014 on periodic roadworthiness tests for motor vehicles and their trailers and repealing Directive 2009/40/EC (OJ L 127, 29.04.2014, p. 51-128).\nDirective 2014/46/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 3 April 2014 amending Council Directive 1999/37/EC on the registration documents for vehicles (OJ L 127, 29.4.2014, p. 129-133).\nLast updated: 23.09.2014", "tags": ["environmental protection", "roadworthiness tests", "technical regulations", "road safety", "motor vehicle", "commercial vehicle"], "subjects": ["Transport", "Approximation of laws"], "split": "train", "reference_annotations": {"32014L0047_p1": {"text": "directive 2014/47/eu OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL---of 3 April 2014---on the technical roadside inspection of the roadworthiness of commercial vehicles circulating in the Union and repealing directive 2000/30/ec", "triples": [" directive 2014/47/eu,  repealing,  directive 2000/30/ec"]}, "32014L0047_p2": {"text": "(3)  regulation 1071/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 October 2009 establishing common rules concerning the conditions to be complied with to pursue the occupation of road transport operator and repealing Council directive 96/26/ec (OJ L 300, 14.11.2009, p. 51).", "triples": [" regulation 1071/2009,  repealing,  directive 96/26/ec"]}, "32014L0047_p3": {"text": "(6)  directive 2006/22/ec of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 March 2006 on minimum conditions for the implementation of Council regulation 3820/85 regulation 3821/85 concerning social legislation relating to road transport activities and repealing Council directive 88/599/eec (OJ L 102, 11.4.2006, p. 35).", "triples": [" regulation 3821/85,  repealing,  directive 88/599/eec"]}, "32014L0047_p4": {"text": "(7)  directive 2014/45/eu of the European Parliament and of the Council of 3 April 2014 on periodic roadworthiness tests for motor vehicles and their trailers and repealing directive 2009/40/ec (see page 51 of this Official Journal).", "triples": [" directive 2014/45/eu,  repealing,  directive 2009/40/ec"]}, "32014L0047_p5": {"text": "(8)  regulation 561/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 March 2006 on the harmonisation of certain social legislation relating to road transport and amending Council regulation 3821/85 regulation 2135/98 and repealing Council regulation 3820/85 (OJ L 102, 11.4.2006, p. 1).", "triples": [" regulation 561/2006,  amending,  regulation 3821/85", " regulation 561/2006,  amending,  regulation 2135/98", " regulation 561/2006,  repealing,  regulation 3820/85"]}, "32014L0047_p6": {"text": "(12)  directive 2003/37/ec of the European Parliament and the Council of 26 May 2003 on type-approval of agricultural or forestry tractors, their trailers and interchangeable towed machinery, together with their systems, components and separate technical units and repealing directive 74/150/eec (OJ L 171, 9.7.2003, p. 1).", "triples": [" directive 2003/37/ec,  repealing,  directive 74/150/eec"]}, "32014L0047_p7": {"text": "(13)  Transposed by directive 2008/68/ec of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 September 2008 on the inland transport of dangerous goods (OJ L 260, 30.9.2008, p. 13), as amended by, inter alia, Commission directive 2012/45/eu (OJ L 332, 4.12.2012, p. 18).", "triples": [" directive 2012/45/eu,  amended,  directive 2008/68/ec"]}}, "summary_annotations": {"32014L0047_p1": {"text": "directive 2014/47/eu of the European Parliament and of the Council of 3 April 2014 on the technical roadside inspection of the roadworthiness of commercial vehicles circulating in the Union and repealing directive 2000/30/ec.", "triples": [" directive 2014/47/eu,  repealing,  directive 2000/30/ec"]}, "32014L0047_p2": {"text": "directive 2014/45/eu of the European Parliament and of the Council of 3 April 2014 on periodic roadworthiness tests for motor vehicles and their trailers and repealing directive 2009/40/ec (OJ L 127, 29.04.2014, p. 51-128).", "triples": [" directive 2014/45/eu,  repealing,  directive 2009/40/ec"]}, "32014L0047_p3": {"text": "directive 2014/46/eu of the European Parliament and of the Council of 3 April 2014 amending Council directive 1999/37/ec on the registration documents for vehicles (OJ L 127, 29.4.2014, p. 129-133).", "triples": [" directive 2014/46/eu,  amending,  directive 1999/37/ec"]}}}
