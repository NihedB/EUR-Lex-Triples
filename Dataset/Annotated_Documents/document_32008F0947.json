{"celex_id": "32008F0947", "reference": "16.12.2008\nEN\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\nL 337/102\nCOUNCIL FRAMEWORK DECISION 2008/947/JHA\nof 27 November 2008\non the application of the principle of mutual recognition to judgments and probation decisions with a view to the supervision of probation measures and alternative sanctions\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on European Union, and in particular Article 31(1)(a) and (c) and Article 34(2)(b) thereof,\nHaving regard to the initiative of the Federal Republic of Germany and of the French Republic (1),\nHaving regard to the Opinion of the European Parliament (2),\nWhereas:\n(1)\nThe European Union has set itself the objective of developing an area of freedom, security and justice. This presupposes that there is an understanding of freedom, security and justice on the part of the Member States which is identical in its essential elements and based on the principles of freedom, democracy, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, as well as the rule of law.\n(2)\nThe aim of police and judicial cooperation in the European Union is to provide a high degree of security for all citizens. One of the cornerstones for this is the principle of mutual recognition of judicial decisions, established in the conclusions of the European Council meeting in Tampere on 15 and 16 October 1999 and reaffirmed in the Hague Programme of 4 and 5 November 2004 for strengthening freedom, security and justice in the European Union (3). In the programme of measures of 29 November 2000 adopted for the purpose of implementing the principle of mutual recognition of decisions in criminal matters, the Council pronounced itself in favour of cooperation in the area of suspended sentences and parole.\n(3)\nCouncil Framework Decision 2008/909/JHA of 27 November 2008 on the application of the principle of mutual recognition to judgments in criminal matters imposing custodial sentences or measures involving deprivation of liberty for the purpose of their enforcement in the European Union (4) concerns the mutual recognition and enforcement of custodial sentences or measures involving deprivation of liberty. Further common rules are required, in particular where a non-custodial sentence involving the supervision of probation measures or alternative sanctions has been imposed in respect of a person who does not have his lawful and ordinary residence in the State of conviction.\n(4)\nThe Council of Europe Convention of 30 November 1964 on the Supervision of Conditionally Sentenced or Conditionally Released Offenders has been ratified by only 12 Member States, with, in some cases, numerous reservations. The present Framework Decision provides for a more effective instrument because it is based on the principle of mutual recognition and all Member States participate.\n(5)\nThis Framework Decision respects fundamental rights and adheres to the principles recognised in Article 6 of the Treaty on European Union, which are also expressed in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, especially in Chapter VI thereof. No provision of this Framework Decision should be interpreted as prohibiting refusal to recognise a judgment and/or supervise a probation measure or alternative sanction if there are objective reasons to believe that the probation measure or alternative sanction was imposed to punish a person because of his or her sex, race, religion, ethnic origin, nationality, language, political opinions or sexual orientation or that this person might be disadvantaged for one of these reasons.\n(6)\nThis Framework Decision should not prevent any Member State from applying its constitutional rules relating to entitlement to due process, freedom of association, freedom of the press, freedom of expression in other media and freedom of religion.\n(7)\nThe provisions of this Framework Decision should be applied in conformity with the right of the Union’s citizens to move and reside freely within the territory of the Member States, pursuant to Article 18 of the Treaty establishing the European Community.\n(8)\nThe aim of mutual recognition and supervision of suspended sentences, conditional sentences, alternative sanctions and decisions on conditional release is to enhance the prospects of the sentenced person’s being reintegrated into society, by enabling that person to preserve family, linguistic, cultural and other ties, but also to improve monitoring of compliance with probation measures and alternative sanctions, with a view to preventing recidivism, thus paying due regard to the protection of victims and the general public.\n(9)\nThere are several types of probation measures and alternative sanctions which are common among the Member States and which all Member States are in principle willing to supervise. The supervision of these types of measures and sanctions should be obligatory, subject to certain exceptions provided for in this Framework Decision. Member States may declare that, in addition, they are willing to supervise other types of probation measures and/or other types of alternative sanctions.\n(10)\nThe probation measures and alternative sanctions that are, in principle, obligatory to supervise include, inter alia, orders relating to behaviour (such as an obligation to stop the consumption of alcohol), residence (such as an obligation to change residence for reasons of domestic violence), education and training (such as an obligation to follow a ‘safe-driving course’), leisure activities (such as an obligation to cease playing or attending a certain sport) and limitations on or modalities of carrying out a professional activity (such as an obligation to seek a professional activity in a different working environment; this obligation does not include the supervision of compliance with any professional disqualifications imposed on the person as part of the sanction).\n(11)\nWhere appropriate, electronic monitoring could be used with a view to supervising probation measures or alternative sanctions, in accordance with national law and procedures.\n(12)\nThe Member State where the person concerned is sentenced may forward a judgment and, where applicable, a probation decision to the Member State where the sentenced person is lawfully and ordinarily resident with a view to the recognition thereof and to the supervision of probation measures or alternative sanctions contained therein.\n(13)\nThe decision on whether to forward the judgment and, where applicable, the probation decision to another Member State should be taken in each individual case by the competent authority of the issuing Member State, taking into account, inter alia, the declarations made in accordance with Articles 5(4), 10(4) and 14(3).\n(14)\nThe judgment and, where applicable, the probation decision may also be forwarded to a Member State other than that where the sentenced person is residing, if the competent authority of that executing State, taking account of any conditions set out in the relevant declaration made by that State in accordance with this Framework Decision, consents to such forwarding. In particular, consent may be given, with a view to social rehabilitation, where the sentenced person, without losing his/her right of residence, intends to move to another Member State because he/she is granted an employment contract, if he/she is a family member of a lawful and ordinary resident person of that Member State, or if he/she intends to follow a study or training in that Member State, in accordance with Community law.\n(15)\nMember States should apply their own national law and procedures for the recognition of a judgment and, where applicable, a probation decision. In the case of a conditional sentence or alternative sanction where the judgment does not contain a custodial sentence or measure involving deprivation of liberty to be enforced in case of non-compliance with the obligations or instructions concerned, this could imply that having made the relevant declaration in accordance with this Framework Decision, Member States, when deciding to recognise, agree to supervise the probation measures or alternative sanctions concerned and to assume no other responsibility than just for taking the subsequent decisions consisting of the modification of obligations or instructions contained in the probation measure or alternative sanction, or modification of the duration of the probation period. Consequently, the recognition has, in such cases, no further effect than to enable the executing State to take those types of subsequent decisions.\n(16)\nA Member State may refuse to recognise a judgment and, where applicable, a probation decision, if the judgment concerned was issued against a person who has not been found guilty, such as in the case of a mentally ill person, and the judgment or, where applicable, the probation decision provides for medical/therapeutic treatment which the executing State cannot supervise in respect of such persons under its national law.\n(17)\nThe ground for refusal relating to territoriality should be applied only in exceptional cases and with a view to cooperating to the greatest extent possible under the provisions of this Framework Decision, while taking into account of the objectives thereof. Any decision to apply this ground for refusal should be based on a case-by-case analysis and on consultations between the competent authorities of the issuing and executing States.\n(18)\nIf the probation measures or alternative sanctions include community service, then the executing State should be entitled to refuse to recognise the judgment and, where applicable, the probation decision if the community service would normally be completed in less than six months.\n(19)\nThe form of the certificate is drafted in such a way so that essential elements of the judgment and, where applicable, of the probation decision are comprised in the certificate, which should be translated into the official language or one of the official languages of the executing State. The certificate should assist the competent authorities in the executing State in taking decisions under this Framework Decision, including decisions on recognition and assumption of responsibility for supervision of probation measures and alternative sanctions, decisions on adaptation of probation measures and alternative sanctions, and subsequent decisions in case, notably, of non-compliance with a probation measure or alternative sanction.\n(20)\nIn view of the principle of mutual recognition, on which this Framework Decision is based, issuing and executing Member States should promote direct contact between their competent authorities in the application of this Framework Decision.\n(21)\nAll Member States should ensure that sentenced persons, in respect of whom decisions under this Framework Decision are taken, are subject to a set of legal rights and remedies in accordance with their national law, regardless of whether the competent authorities designated to take decisions under this Framework Decision are of a judicial or a non-judicial nature.\n(22)\nAll subsequent decisions relating to a suspended sentence, a conditional sentence or an alternative sanction which result in the imposition of a custodial sentence or measure involving deprivation of liberty should be taken by a judicial authority.\n(23)\nSince all Member States have ratified the Council of Europe Convention of 28 January 1981 for the Protection of Individuals with regard to Automatic Processing of Personal Data, personal data processed when implementing this Framework Decision should be protected in accordance with the principles laid down in that Convention.\n(24)\nSince the objectives of this Framework Decision, namely facilitating the social rehabilitation of sentenced persons, improving the protection of victims and of the general public, and facilitating the application of suitable probation measures and alternative sanctions in case of offenders who do not live in the State of conviction, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States themselves in view of the cross-border nature of the situations involved and can therefore, by reason of the scale of the action, be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as defined in Article 5 of the Treaty establishing the European Community as applied by the second paragraph of Article 2 of the Treaty on European Union. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty establishing the European Community, this Framework Decision does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS FRAMEWORK DECISION:\nArticle 1\nObjectives and scope\n1.   This Framework Decision aims at facilitating the social rehabilitation of sentenced persons, improving the protection of victims and of the general public, and facilitating the application of suitable probation measures and alternative sanctions, in case of offenders who do not live in the State of conviction. With a view to achieving these objectives, this Framework Decision lays down rules according to which a Member State, other than the Member State in which the person concerned has been sentenced, recognises judgments and, where applicable, probation decisions and supervises probation measures imposed on the basis of a judgment, or alternative sanctions contained in such a judgment, and takes all other decisions relating to that judgment, unless otherwise provided for in this Framework Decision.\n2.   This Framework Decision shall apply only to:\n(a)\nthe recognition of judgments and, where applicable, probation decisions;\n(b)\nthe transfer of responsibility for the supervision of probation measures and alternative sanctions;\n(c)\nall other decisions related to those under (a) and (b);\nas described and provided for in this Framework Decision.\n3.   This Framework Decision shall not apply to:\n(a)\nthe execution of judgments in criminal matters imposing custodial sentences or measures involving deprivation of liberty which fall within the scope of Framework Decision 2008/909/JHA;\n(b)\nrecognition and execution of financial penalties and confiscation orders which fall within the scope of Council Framework Decision 2005/214/JHA of 24 February 2005 on the application of the principle of mutual recognition to financial penalties (5) and Council Framework Decision 2006/783/JHA of 6 October 2006 on the application of the principle of mutual recognition to confiscation orders (6).\n4.   This Framework Decision shall not have the effect of modifying the obligation to respect fundamental rights and fundamental legal principles as enshrined in Article 6 of the Treaty on European Union.\nArticle 2\nDefinitions\nFor the purposes of this Framework Decision:\n1.\n‘judgment’ shall mean a final decision or order of a court of the issuing State, establishing that a natural person has committed a criminal offence and imposing:\n(a)\na custodial sentence or measure involving deprivation of liberty, if a conditional release has been granted on the basis of that judgment or by a subsequent probation decision;\n(b)\na suspended sentence;\n(c)\na conditional sentence;\n(d)\nan alternative sanction;\n2.\n‘suspended sentence’ shall mean a custodial sentence or measure involving deprivation of liberty, the execution of which is conditionally suspended, wholly or in part, when the sentence is passed by imposing one or more probation measures. Such probation measures may be included in the judgment itself or determined in a separate probation decision taken by a competent authority;\n3.\n‘conditional sentence’ shall mean a judgment in which the imposition of a sentence has been conditionally deferred by imposing one or more probation measures or in which one or more probation measures are imposed instead of a custodial sentence or measure involving deprivation of liberty. Such probation measures may be included in the judgment itself or determined in a separate probation decision taken by a competent authority;\n4.\n‘alternative sanction’ shall mean a sanction, other than a custodial sentence, a measure involving deprivation of liberty or a financial penalty, imposing an obligation or instruction;\n5.\n‘probation decision’ shall mean a judgment or a final decision of a competent authority of the issuing State taken on the basis of such judgment:\n(a)\ngranting a conditional release; or\n(b)\nimposing probation measures;\n6.\n‘conditional release’ shall mean a final decision of a competent authority or stemming from the national law on the early release of a sentenced person after part of the custodial sentence or measure involving deprivation of liberty has been served by imposing one or more probation measures;\n7.\n‘probation measures’ shall mean obligations and instructions imposed by a competent authority on a natural person, in accordance with the national law of the issuing State, in connection with a suspended sentence, a conditional sentence or a conditional release;\n8.\n‘issuing State’ shall mean the Member State in which a judgment is delivered;\n9.\n‘executing State’ shall mean the Member State in which the probation measures and alternative sanctions are supervised following a decision in accordance with Article 8.\nArticle 3\nDesignation of competent authorities\n1.   Each Member State shall inform the General Secretariat of the Council which authority or authorities, under its national law, are competent to act according to this Framework Decision in the situation where that Member State is the issuing State or the executing State.\n2.   Member States may designate non-judicial authorities as the competent authorities for taking decisions under this Framework Decision, provided that such authorities have competence for taking decisions of a similar nature under their national law and procedures.\n3.   If a decision under Article 14(1)(b) or (c) is taken by a competent authority other than a court, the Member States shall ensure that, upon request of the person concerned, such decision may be reviewed by a court or by another independent court-like body.\n4.   The General Secretariat of the Council shall make the information received available to all Member States and to the Commission.\nArticle 4\nTypes of probation measures and alternative sanctions\n1.   This Framework Decision shall apply to the following probation measures or alternative sanctions:\n(a)\nan obligation for the sentenced person to inform a specific authority of any change of residence or working place;\n(b)\nan obligation not to enter certain localities, places or defined areas in the issuing or executing State;\n(c)\nan obligation containing limitations on leaving the territory of the executing State;\n(d)\ninstructions relating to behaviour, residence, education and training, leisure activities, or containing limitations on or modalities of carrying out a professional activity;\n(e)\nan obligation to report at specified times to a specific authority;\n(f)\nan obligation to avoid contact with specific persons;\n(g)\nan obligation to avoid contact with specific objects, which have been used or are likely to be used by the sentenced person with a view to committing a criminal offence;\n(h)\nan obligation to compensate financially for the prejudice caused by the offence and/or an obligation to provide proof of compliance with such an obligation;\n(i)\nan obligation to carry out community service;\n(j)\nan obligation to cooperate with a probation officer or with a representative of a social service having responsibilities in respect of sentenced persons;\n(k)\nan obligation to undergo therapeutic treatment or treatment for addiction.\n2.   Each Member State shall notify the General Secretariat of the Council, when implementing this Framework Decision, which probation measures and alternative sanctions, apart from those referred to in paragraph 1, it is prepared to supervise. The General Secretariat of the Council shall make the information received available to all Member States and to the Commission.\nArticle 5\nCriteria for forwarding a judgment and, where applicable, a probation decision\n1.   The competent authority of the issuing State may forward a judgment and, where applicable, a probation decision to the competent authority of the Member State in which the sentenced person is lawfully and ordinarily residing, in cases where the sentenced person has returned or wants to return to that State.\n2.   The competent authority of the issuing State may, upon request of the sentenced person, forward the judgment and, where applicable, the probation decision to a competent authority of a Member State other than the Member State in which the sentenced person is lawfully and ordinarily residing, on condition that this latter authority has consented to such forwarding.\n3.   When implementing this Framework Decision, Member States shall determine under which conditions their competent authorities may consent to the forwarding of a judgment and, where applicable, a probation decision under paragraph 2.\n4.   Each Member State shall make a declaration to the General Secretariat of the Council of the determination made under paragraph 3. Member States may modify such a declaration at any time. The General Secretariat shall make the information received available to all Member States and to the Commission.\nArticle 6\nProcedure for forwarding a judgment and, where applicable, a probation decision\n1.   When, in application of Article 5(1) or (2), the competent authority of the issuing State forwards a judgment and, where applicable, a probation decision to another Member State, it shall ensure that it is accompanied by a certificate, the standard form for which is set out in Annex I.\n2.   The judgment and, where applicable, the probation decision, together with the certificate referred to in paragraph 1, shall be forwarded by the competent authority of the issuing State directly to the competent authority of the executing State by any means which leaves a written record under conditions allowing the executing State to establish their authenticity. The original of the judgment and, where applicable, the probation decision, or certified copies thereof, as well as the original of the certificate, shall be sent to the competent authority of the executing State if it so requires. All official communications shall also be made directly between the said competent authorities.\n3.   The certificate referred to in paragraph 1 shall be signed and its content certified as accurate by the competent authority of the issuing State.\n4.   Apart from the measures and sanctions referred to in Article 4(1), the certificate referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article shall include only such measures or sanctions as notified by the executing State in accordance with Article 4(2).\n5.   The competent authority of the issuing State shall forward the judgment and, where applicable, the probation decision, together with the certificate referred to in paragraph 1 only to one executing State at any one time.\n6.   If the competent authority of the executing State is not known to the competent authority of the issuing State, the latter shall make all necessary inquiries, including via the contact points of the European Judicial Network created by Council Joint Action 98/428/JHA (7), in order to obtain the information from the executing State.\n7.   When an authority of the executing State which receives a judgment and, where applicable, a probation decision, together with the certificate referred to in paragraph 1, has no competence to recognise it and take the ensuing necessary measures for the supervision of the probation measure or alternative sanction, it shall, ex officio, forward it to the competent authority and shall without delay inform the competent authority of the issuing State accordingly by any means which leaves a written record.\nArticle 7\nConsequences for the issuing State\n1.   Once the competent authority of the executing State has recognised the judgment and, where applicable, the probation decision forwarded to it and has informed the competent authority of the issuing State of such recognition, the issuing State shall no longer have competence in relation to the supervision of the probation measures or alternative sanctions imposed, nor to take subsequent measures referred to in Article 14(1).\n2.   The competence referred to in paragraph 1 shall revert to the issuing State:\n(a)\nas soon as its competent authority has notified withdrawal of the certificate referred to in Article 6(1), pursuant to Article 9(4), to the competent authority of the executing State;\n(b)\nin cases referred to in Article 14(3) in combination with 14(5); and\n(c)\nin cases referred to in Article 20.\nArticle 8\nDecision of the executing State\n1.   The competent authority of the executing State shall recognise the judgment and, where applicable, the probation decision forwarded in accordance with Article 5 and following the procedure laid down in Article 6 and shall without delay take all necessary measures for the supervision of the probation measures or alternative sanctions, unless it decides to invoke one of the grounds for refusing recognition and supervision referred to in Article 11.\n2.   The competent authority of the executing State may postpone the decision on recognition of the judgment and, where applicable, the probation decision in the situation where the certificate referred to in Article 6(1) is incomplete or obviously does not correspond to the judgment or, where applicable, the probation decision, until such reasonable deadline set for the certificate to be completed or corrected.\nArticle 9\nAdaptation of the probation measures or alternative sanctions\n1.   If the nature or duration of the relevant probation measure or alternative sanction, or the duration of the probation period, are incompatible with the law of the executing State, the competent authority of that State may adapt them in line with the nature and duration of the probation measures and alternative sanctions, or duration of the probation period, which apply, under the law of the executing State, to equivalent offences. The adapted probation measure, alternative sanction or duration of the probation period shall correspond as far as possible to that imposed in the issuing State.\n2.   Where the probation measure, the alternative sanction or the probation period has been adapted because its duration exceeds the maximum duration provided for under the law of the executing State, the duration of the adapted probation measure, alternative sanction or probation period shall not be below the maximum duration provided for equivalent offences under the law of the executing State.\n3.   The adapted probation measure, alternative sanction or probation period shall not be more severe or longer than the probation measure, alternative sanction or probation period which was originally imposed.\n4.   Following receipt of the information referred to in Articles 16(2) or 18(5), the competent authority of the issuing State may decide to withdraw the certificate referred to in Article 6(1) provided that supervision in the executing State has not yet begun. In such cases, the decision shall be taken and communicated as soon as possible and within ten days of the receipt of the information.\nArticle 10\nDouble criminality\n1.   The following offences, if they are punishable in the issuing State by a custodial sentence or a measure involving deprivation of liberty for a maximum period of at least three years, and as they are defined by the law of the issuing State, shall, under the terms of this Framework Decision and without verification of the double criminality of the act, give rise to recognition of the judgment and, where applicable, the probation decision and to supervision of probation measures and alternative sanctions:\n—\nparticipation in a criminal organisation,\n—\nterrorism,\n—\ntrafficking in human beings,\n—\nsexual exploitation of children and child pornography,\n—\nillicit trafficking in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances,\n—\nillicit trafficking in weapons, munitions and explosives,\n—\ncorruption,\n—\nfraud, including that affecting the financial interests of the European Communities within the meaning of the Convention of 26 July 1995 on the protection of the European Communities’ financial interests (8),\n—\nlaundering of the proceeds of crime,\n—\ncounterfeiting currency, including of the euro,\n—\ncomputer-related crime,\n—\nenvironmental crime, including illicit trafficking in endangered animal species and in endangered plant species and varieties,\n—\nfacilitation of unauthorised entry and residence,\n—\nmurder, grievous bodily injury,\n—\nillicit trade in human organs and tissue,\n—\nkidnapping, illegal restraint and hostage-taking,\n—\nracism and xenophobia,\n—\norganised or armed robbery,\n—\nillicit trafficking in cultural goods, including antiques and works of art,\n—\nswindling,\n—\nracketeering and extortion,\n—\ncounterfeiting and piracy of products,\n—\nforgery of administrative documents and trafficking therein,\n—\nforgery of means of payment,\n—\nillicit trafficking in hormonal substances and other growth promoters,\n—\nillicit trafficking in nuclear or radioactive materials,\n—\ntrafficking in stolen vehicles,\n—\nrape,\n—\narson,\n—\ncrimes within the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court,\n—\nunlawful seizure of aircraft/ships,\n—\nsabotage.\n2.   The Council may decide to add other categories of offences to the list provided for in paragraph 1 of this Article at any time, acting unanimously after consultation of the European Parliament under the conditions laid down in Article 39(1) of the Treaty on European Union. The Council shall examine, in the light of the report submitted to it pursuant to Article 26(1) of this Framework Decision, whether the list should be extended or amended.\n3.   For offences other than those covered by paragraph 1, the executing State may make the recognition of the judgment and, where applicable, the probation decision and the supervision of probation measures and of alternative sanctions subject to the condition that the judgment relates to acts which also constitute an offence under the law of the executing State, whatever its constituent elements or however it is described.\n4.   Each Member State may, on the adoption of this Framework Decision or later, by a declaration notified to the General Secretariat of the Council, declare that it will not apply paragraph 1. Any such declaration may be withdrawn at any time. Such declarations or withdrawals of declarations shall be published in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nArticle 11\nGrounds for refusing recognition and supervision\n1.   The competent authority of the executing State may refuse to recognise the judgment or, where applicable, the probation decision and to assume responsibility for supervising probation measures or alternative sanctions if:\n(a)\nthe certificate referred to in Article 6(1) is incomplete or manifestly does not correspond to the judgment or to the probation decision and has not been completed or corrected within a reasonable period set by the competent authority of the executing State;\n(b)\nthe criteria set forth in Articles 5(1), 5(2) or 6(4) are not met;\n(c)\nrecognition of the judgment and assumption of responsibility for supervising probation measures or alternative sanctions would be contrary to the principle of ne bis in idem;\n(d)\nin a case referred to in Article 10(3) and, where the executing State has made a declaration under Article 10(4), in a case referred to in Article 10(1), the judgment relates to acts which would not constitute an offence under the law of the executing State. However, in relation to taxes or duties, customs and exchange, execution of the judgment or, where applicable, the probation decision may not be refused on the grounds that the law of the executing State does not impose the same kind of tax or duty or does not contain the same type of rules as regards taxes or duties, customs and exchange regulations as the law of the issuing State;\n(e)\nthe enforcement of the sentence is statute-barred according to the law of the executing State and relates to an act which falls within its competence according to that law;\n(f)\nthere is immunity under the law of the executing State, which makes it impossible to supervise probation measures or alternative sanctions;\n(g)\nunder the law of the executing State, the sentenced person cannot, owing to his or her age, be held criminally liable for the acts in respect of which the judgment was issued;\n(h)\nthe judgment was rendered in absentia, unless the certificate states that the person was summoned personally or informed via a representative competent according to the national law of the issuing State of the time and place of the proceedings which resulted in the judgment being rendered in absentia, or that the person has indicated to a competent authority that he or she does not contest the case;\n(i)\nthe judgment or, where applicable, the probation decision provides for medical/therapeutic treatment which, notwithstanding Article 9, the executing State is unable to supervise in view of its legal or health-care system;\n(j)\nthe probation measure or alternative sanction is of less than six months’ duration; or\n(k)\nthe judgment relates to criminal offences which under the law of the executing State are regarded as having been committed wholly or for a major or essential part within its territory, or in a place equivalent to its territory.\n2.   Any decision under paragraph 1(k) in relation to offences committed partly within the territory of the executing State, or in a place equivalent to its territory, shall be taken by the competent authority of the executing State only in exceptional circumstances and on a case-by case basis, having regard to the specific circumstances of the case, and in particular to whether a major or essential part of the conduct in question has taken place in the issuing State.\n3.   In the cases referred to in paragraph 1(a), (b), (c), (h), (i), (j) and (k), before deciding not to recognise the judgment or, where applicable, the probation decision and to assume responsibility for supervising probation measures and alternative sanctions, the competent authority of the executing State shall communicate, by appropriate means, with the competent authority of the issuing State and shall, as necessary, ask it to supply all additional information required without delay.\n4.   Where the competent authority of the executing State has decided to invoke a ground for refusal referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article, in particular the grounds referred to under paragraph 1(d) or (k), it may nevertheless, in agreement with the competent authority of the issuing State, decide to supervise the probation measures or alternative sanctions that are imposed in the judgment and, where applicable, the probation decision forwarded to it, without assuming the responsibility for taking any of the decisions referred to in Article 14(1)(a), (b) and (c).\nArticle 12\nTime limit\n1.   The competent authority of the executing State shall decide as soon as possible, and within 60 days of receipt of the judgment and, where applicable, the probation decision, together with the certificate referred to in Article 6(1), whether or not to recognise the judgment and, where applicable, the probation decision and assume responsibility for supervising the probation measures or alternative sanctions. It shall immediately inform the competent authority of the issuing State, by any means which leaves a written record, of its decision.\n2.   When in exceptional circumstances it is not possible for the competent authority of the executing State to comply with the time limit provided for in paragraph 1, it shall immediately inform the competent authority of the issuing State by any means, giving the reasons for the delay and indicating the estimated time needed for the final decision to be taken.\nArticle 13\nGoverning law\n1.   The supervision and application of probation measures and alternative sanctions shall be governed by the law of the executing State.\n2.   The competent authority of the executing State may supervise an obligation as referred to in Article 4(1)(h) by requiring the sentenced person to provide proof of compliance with an obligation to compensate for the prejudice caused by the offence.\nArticle 14\nJurisdiction to take all subsequent decisions and governing law\n1.   The competent authority of the executing State shall have jurisdiction to take all subsequent decisions relating to a suspended sentence, conditional release, conditional sentence and alternative sanction, in particular in case of non-compliance with a probation measure or alternative sanction or if the sentenced person commits a new criminal offence.\nSuch subsequent decisions include notably:\n(a)\nthe modification of obligations or instructions contained in the probation measure or alternative sanction, or the modification of the duration of the probation period;\n(b)\nthe revocation of the suspension of the execution of the judgment or the revocation of the decision on conditional release; and\n(c)\nthe imposition of a custodial sentence or measure involving deprivation of liberty in case of an alternative sanction or conditional sentence.\n2.   The law of the executing State shall apply to decisions taken pursuant to paragraph 1 and to all subsequent consequences of the judgment including, where applicable, the enforcement and, if necessary, the adaptation of the custodial sentence or measure involving deprivation of liberty.\n3.   Each Member State may, at the time of adoption of this Framework Decision or at a later stage, declare that as an executing State it will refuse to assume the responsibility provided for in paragraph 1(b) and (c) in cases or categories of cases to be specified by that Member State, in particular:\n(a)\nin cases relating to an alternative sanction, where the judgment does not contain a custodial sentence or measure involving deprivation of liberty to be enforced in case of non-compliance with the obligations or instructions concerned;\n(b)\nin cases relating to a conditional sentence;\n(c)\nin cases where the judgment relates to acts which do not constitute an offence under the law of the executing State, whatever its constituent elements or however it is described.\n4.   When a Member State makes use of any of the possibilities referred to in paragraph 3, the competent authority of the executing State shall transfer jurisdiction back to the competent authority of the issuing State in case of non-compliance with a probation measure or alternative sanction if the competent authority of the executing State is of the view that a subsequent decision as referred to in paragraph 1(b) or (c) needs to be taken.\n5.   In the cases referred to in paragraph 3 of this Article, the obligation to recognise the judgment and, where applicable, the probation decision, as well as the obligation to take without delay all necessary measures for the supervision of the probation measures or alternative sanctions, as referred to in Article 8(1), shall not be affected.\n6.

It seeks to:\nincrease the chances of the social reintegration of those who are sentenced by ensuring the follow-up in the EU country in which they are established of the measures imposed;\nimprove the protection of victims;\nfacilitate the application of probation measures and alternative sanctions if the offender does not live in the country of conviction.\nKEY POINTS\nProbation measures and alternative sanctions\nThe framework decision lists a number of measures that each EU country must be able to supervise (such as the need to report to the executing authority, to repair damage caused, to not visit certain places, to avoid contact with people or objects, to perform community service, etc.).\nProcedures, deadlines and grounds for refusal\nThe judgment (or the probation decision), accompanied by a certificate, is transmitted directly by the competent authority of the country of issue to that of the country of execution.\nThe execution country must decide, 60 days after receipt of the judgment or the probation measures and certificate, whether it recognises the judgment or the probation measures and whether it takes responsibility for monitoring its execution; the framework decision lists some reasons why a country may refuse to recognise a judgment.\nThe law of the executing country applies to the supervision and application of probation measures and alternative sanctions.\nThe competent authority of the country of execution:\nmay adapt the measures when, because of their nature or their duration, they are incompatible with its national legislation. It must inform the issuing authority of any proposed adaptation and ensure that measures are as consistent as possible with those imposed by the issuing country;\nis responsible for taking any subsequent decision in connection with the supervision and enforcement of the sentence: the modification of obligations, any extension of the probationary period and the revocation of the suspension.\nIn a report published in 2014, the Commission called on EU countries that have not already done so to rapidly take the necessary measures to implement this framework decision.\nWHEN DOES THE FRAMEWORK DECISION APPLY?\n                     \nThe framework decision was to be implemented no later than 6 December 2011.\nBACKGROUND\n                     \nEach year, tens of thousands of EU citizens are prosecuted for alleged criminal offences or convicted in another EU country. Mutual recognition of judgments is the cornerstone of judicial cooperation in criminal matters within the EU.\nREFERENCES\nAct\nEntry into force\nDeadline for transposition in the Member States\nOfficial Journal\nFramework Decision 2008/947/JHA\n16.12.2008\n6.12.2011\nOJ L 337, 16.12.2008, pp. 102-122\nAmending act(s)\nEntry into force\nDeadline for transposition in the Member States\nOfficial Journal\nFramework Decision 2009/299/JHA\n28.3.2009\n28.3.2011\nOJ L 81, 27.3.2009, pp. 24-36\nRELATED ACTS\n                  \nReport from the Commission to the European Parliament and the Council on the implementation by the Member States of the Framework Decisions 2008/909/JHA, 2008/947/JHA and 2009/829/JHA on the mutual recognition of judicial decisions on custodial sentences or measures involving deprivation of liberty, on probation decisions and alternative sanctions and on supervision measures as an alternative to provisional detention (COM(2014) 57 final of 5 February 2014 - not published in the Official Journal).\nlast update 03.03.2015", "tags": ["criminal procedure", "alternative sentence", "conditional discharge", "fundamental rights", "judicial cooperation in criminal matters in the EU", "police cooperation", "equal treatment"], "subjects": ["Justice and home affairs"], "split": "train", "reference_annotations": {}, "summary_annotations": {}}
