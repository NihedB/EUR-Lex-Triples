{"celex_id": "32020L0262", "reference": "27.2.2020\nEN\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\nL 58/4\nCOUNCIL DIRECTIVE (EU) 2020/262\nof 19 December 2019\nlaying down the general arrangements for excise duty\n(recast)\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 113 thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European Parliament (1),\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee (2),\nActing in accordance with a special legislative procedure,\nWhereas:\n(1)\nCouncil Directive 2008/118/EC (3) has been substantially amended several times. Since further amendments are to be made, that Directive should be recast in the interests of clarity.\n(2)\nConditions for charging excise duty on goods covered by Directive 2008/118/EC need to remain harmonised in order to ensure the proper functioning of the internal market.\n(3)\nIt is appropriate to specify the excise goods to which this Directive applies and to refer for that purpose to Council Directives 92/83/EEC (4), 92/84/EEC (5), 2003/96/EC (6) and 2011/64/EU (7).\n(4)\nExcise goods may be subject to other indirect taxes for specific purposes. In such cases, however, and in order not to jeopardise the useful effect of Union rules relating to indirect taxes, Member States should comply with certain essential elements of those rules.\n(5)\nIn order to ensure free movement, taxation of goods other than excise goods should not give rise to formalities connected with the crossing of frontiers.\n(6)\nIt is necessary to ensure the application of formalities when excise goods are moving between the territories which are defined as being part of the customs territory of the Union but which are excluded from the scope of this Directive and territories to which this Directive does apply.\n(7)\nSince it remains necessary for the proper functioning of the internal market that the concept, and conditions for chargeability, of excise duty be the same in all Member States, it is necessary to make clear at Union level when excise goods are released for consumption and who is liable to pay the excise duty.\n(8)\nSince excise duty is a tax on the consumption of goods, duty should not be charged in respect of excise goods which, under certain circumstances, have been totally destroyed or are irretrievably lost.\n(9)\nIn addition to total destruction or irretrievable loss of goods, partial losses may occur due to the nature of the goods. Except under duly justified circumstances, no duty should be charged for those partial losses insofar as they do not exceed the pre‐established common partial loss thresholds.\n(10)\nIn case of unintentional excess of goods discovered during a movement under a duty suspension movement, Member States should be able to permit the excess goods to be introduced in a tax warehouse under duty suspension.\n(11)\nIn order to ensure uniform treatment of partial losses throughout the Union, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) should be delegated to the Commission in respect of determining the common partial loss thresholds. When determining these partial loss thresholds, the Commission should take into account in particular aspects related to the physical and chemical characteristics of the goods (such as nature of excise goods, especially energy products (volatility), the ambient temperature during movement, the distance of movement or time consumed during movement). It is of particular importance that the Commission carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level, and that those consultations be conducted in accordance with the principles laid down in the Interinstitutional Agreement of 13 April 2016 on Better Law-Making (8). In particular, to ensure equal participation in the preparation of delegated acts, the European Parliament and the Council receive all documents at the same time as Member States’ experts, and their experts systematically have access to meetings of Commission expert groups dealing with the preparation of delegated acts.\n(12)\nArrangements for the collection and reimbursement of duty have an impact on the proper functioning of the internal market and should therefore follow non‐discriminatory criteria.\n(13)\nIn the event of an irregularity during movements of excise goods under a duty suspension arrangement, excise duty should be due in the Member State in the territory of which the irregularity leading to a release for consumption has been committed or, if it is not possible to establish where the irregularity has been committed, it should be due in the Member State where the irregularity has been detected. Where excise goods do not arrive at their destination and no irregularity has been detected, the irregularity shall be deemed to have occurred in the Member State of dispatch.\n(14)\nIn addition to the cases of reimbursement provided for in this Directive, Member States should, where the purpose of this Directive so requires, reimburse excise duty paid on excise goods released for consumption.\n(15)\nThe rules and conditions for the deliveries which are exempt from the payment of excise duty should remain harmonised. For the exempted deliveries to organisations situated in other Member States, use should be made of an exemption certificate.\n(16)\nIn order to ensure uniform conditions regarding the form of the exemption certificate, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission. Those powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council (9).\n(17)\nThe situations in which tax-free sales to travellers leaving the territory of the Union are allowed should be clearly determined with a view to avoiding evasion and abuse. Since persons travelling over land can move more frequently and more freely as compared to persons travelling by boat or aircraft, the risk of non-respect of the duty and tax free import allowances by the traveller and consequently the control burden for the customs authorities is substantially higher in the case of travel over land. It is therefore appropriate to provide that excise duty-free sales at land borders should not be allowed.\n(18)\nSince checks need to be carried out in production and storage facilities in order to ensure that the duty is collected, it is necessary to retain a system of warehouses, subject to authorisation by the competent authorities, for the purpose of facilitating such checks. It should be understood that holding or storing of excise goods implies physical possession of these goods.\n(19)\nIt is also necessary to lay down requirements to be complied with by authorised warehousekeepers and economic operators without authorised warehousekeeper status.\n(20)\nIt should be possible for excise goods, prior to their release for consumption, to move within the Union under suspension of excise duty. Such movement should be allowed from a tax warehouse to various destinations, in particular another tax warehouse but also to places equivalent for the purposes of this Directive.\n(21)\nThe movement of excise goods under suspension of duty should also be allowed from their place of importation to those destinations and accordingly provision should be made with regard to the status of the person allowed to dispatch, but not allowed to hold or store, the goods from that place of importation.\n(22)\nIn order to ensure the proper application of the provision concerning the end of the movement of excise goods under suspension, it should be clarified that the movement ends when the consignee is in a position to know precisely what quantity of goods he has actually received. The unloading and entering into the accounts may be used as evidence for the end of the movement.\n(23)\nIn order to allow the use of the external transit procedure following the export procedure, the customs office of exit should become a possible destination of a movement under excise duty suspension. The moment when the duty suspension arrangement ends in that case should be specified. It should be specified that the competent authorities in the Member State of export should complete the report of export on the basis of the confirmation of exit which the customs office of exit sends to the customs office of export at the start of the external transit procedure. In order to allow the external transit procedure to take over the responsibilities for the excise goods under this Directive, Article 189 of Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/2446 (10) has been amended by Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2018/1063 (11). Consequently, Union excise goods should also be allowed to be placed under the external transit procedure.\n(24)\nIn order to enable the competent authorities to ensure consistency between the electronic administrative document and the customs declaration at importation when excise goods released for free circulation are moved from the place of importation under duty suspension, information on the consignor and the consignee and a proof that imported goods will be dispatched from the Member State of importation to another Member State should be provided by the person who declares the excise goods for importation to the competent authorities in the Member State of importation.\n(25)\nIn order to safeguard the payment of excise duty in a case of non-discharge of the excise movement, Member States should require a guarantee, which should be lodged by the authorised warehousekeeper of dispatch or the registered consignor or, if the Member State of dispatch so allows, by another person involved in the movement, under the conditions set by the Member States.\n(26)\nSeveral Member States already grant a guarantee waiver for the movement of energy products by fixed pipelines as that type of movement presents a very low fiscal risk. In order to harmonise the requirements for the provision of a guarantee in such cases, it is appropriate to waive the guarantee requirement for movements of energy products by fixed pipelines in all Member States.\n(27)\nIn order to ensure a speedy completion of the necessary formalities and facilitate the supervision of movements of excise goods moved under suspension of excise duty, it is appropriate to use the computerised system under Decision (EU) 2020/263 of the European Parliament and of the Council (12) for the exchange of electronic administrative documents between the persons and competent authorities concerned (‘the computerised system’).\n(28)\nIn order to ensure that the documents used in the context of movement of excise goods under a duty suspension arrangement are readily understandable in all Member States and can be processed by the computerised system, including when the computerised system is not available, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the TFEU should be delegated to the Commission in respect of laying down the structure and content of those documents.\n(29)\nIn order to ensure uniform conditions for the completion, presentation and submission of documents used in the context of movement of excise goods under a duty suspension arrangement, including when the computerised system is not available, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission. Those powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011.\n(30)\nIt is appropriate to lay down the procedure by which economic operators inform the competent authorities of the Member States of dispatch and destination of consignments of excise goods. Due regard should be had to the situation of certain consignees not connected to the computerised system but who may receive excise goods moving under suspension of duty.\n(31)\nIn order to ensure the proper functioning of the rules relating to movement under suspension of excise duty, the conditions for the start of the movement as well as the end, and the discharge of responsibilities, should be clarified.\n(32)\nIn order to enable the competent authorities to ensure consistency between the electronic administrative document and the customs declaration for export in cases where excise goods are moved under duty suspension before being taken out of the territory of the Union, the person who declares the excise goods for export should inform the competent authorities in the Member State of export of the unique administrative reference code.\n(33)\nIn order to enable the Member State of dispatch to take appropriate action, the competent authority in the Member State of export should inform the competent authority in the Member State of dispatch of any irregularities that occur during the export or of the fact that the goods are no longer to be taken out of the territory of the Union.\n(34)\nIn order to enable the consignor to assign a new destination to the excise goods, the Member State of dispatch should inform the consignor that the goods are no longer to be taken out of the territory of the Union.\n(35)\nIn order to improve the possibility of carrying out controls during a movement of excise goods, the person accompanying the excise goods, or where there is no accompanying person, the transporter or carrier, should be able to present the unique administrative reference code, in any form, to the competent authorities to allow them to retrieve details of the excise goods.\n(36)\nIt is necessary to determine the procedures to be used in a case in which the computerised system is not available.\n(37)\nIn order to align the procedures under this Directive with those provided for in Article 335(4) of Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2015/2447 (13), and in order to simplify the recognition of alternative evidence of exit in the Member State of dispatch, a minimum list of standard alternative evidence of exit, proving that the goods have been taken out of the territory of the Union, should be established.\n(38)\nMember States should be allowed to provide for a special arrangement for the movement of excise goods under suspension of duty which takes place entirely within their territory, or conclude bilateral or multilateral agreements with other Member States to allow simplification. Member States that are not party to bilateral or multilateral agreements should not be obliged to accept special arrangement made under such an agreement.\n(39)\nIt is appropriate to clarify the taxation and procedural rules relating to the movement of goods on which excise duty has already been paid in a Member State without changing their general structure.\n(40)\nWhere excise goods are acquired by private individuals for their own use, and transported from the territory of one Member State to the territory of another Member State by them, excise duty should be paid in the Member State in which the excise goods are acquired, in accordance with the principle governing the internal market.\n(41)\nExcise duty levels for tobacco products and alcoholic beverages applied by Member States vary due to a number of factors, such as fiscal and public health policy and such divergences in some cases are significant. In this context, Member States should be able to contain risks, which are facilitating tax fraud, avoidance or abuse, threatening or undermining public policy or protection of health and life of humans. Therefore Member States should be able to take appropriate and proportionate measures enabling them to determine whether excise goods transported from the territory of one Member State to the territory of another Member State by a private individual were acquired by that private individual for his or her own use.\n(42)\nIn cases where, following their release for consumption in a Member State, excise goods are delivered for commercial purposes in another Member State, it is necessary to establish that excise duty is due in the second Member State. For those purposes, it is necessary, in particular, to define the concept of ‘delivered for commercial purposes’.\n(43)\nThe computerised system, which is currently used for the movement of excise goods under duty suspension, should be extended to the movement of excise goods which have been released for consumption in the territory of one Member State and are moved to the territory of another Member State in order to be delivered there for commercial purposes. The use of that computerised system will simplify the monitoring of such movements and ensure the proper functioning of the internal market.\n(44)\nWhere excise goods are released for consumption in the territory of one Member State and are moved to the territory of another Member State to be delivered there for commercial purposes, it is appropriate to clarify who is liable to pay the duty and when the duty is chargeable.\n(45)\nTo avoid unnecessary investment, the computerisation of the movement of excise goods which are released for consumption in the territory of one Member State and are moved to the territory of another Member State in order to be delivered there for commercial purposes should be set up reusing as much of the existing arrangements for movements under duty suspension as possible. For that purpose and in order to facilitate such movements the guarantee provisions for those movements should be aligned to the guarantee provisions for movements under excise duty suspension in order to widen the choice of guarantors.\n(46)\nIn order to facilitate the existing registration of economic operators dealing with the duty suspension arrangements, it is necessary to give a tax warehouse and a registered consignor the possibility, after having notified the competent authorities of the Member State of dispatch, to act as a certified consignor for excise goods which are released for consumption in the territory of one Member State and are moved to the territory of another Member State in order to be delivered there for commercial purposes. At the same time a tax warehouse or a registered consignee should be able to act as a certified consignee for those excise goods.\n(47)\nIt is necessary to determine the procedures to be used where the computerised system is not available and a fallback document is to be used.\n(48)\nMember States should be allowed to provide for a special arrangement for the movement of excise goods which are released for consumption in the territory of one Member State and are moved to the territory of another Member State in order to be delivered there for commercial purposes on the basis of bilateral or multilateral agreements with other Member States to allow simplification. Member States that are not party to bilateral or multilateral agreements should not be obliged to accept special arrangement made under such an agreement.\n(49)\nIn order to ensure that the documents used in the context of movement of excise goods considered to be delivered for commercial purposes are readily understandable in all Member States and can be processed by the computerised system, including when the computerised system is not available, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the TFEU should be delegated to the Commission in respect of laying down the structure and content of those documents.\n(50)\nIn order to ensure uniform conditions for the completion, presentation and submission of documents used in the context of movement of excise goods considered to be delivered for commercial purposes, including when the computerised system is not available, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission. Those powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011.\n(51)\nWhere excise goods are acquired by persons who are not authorised warehousekeepers or registered consignees and who do not carry out an independent economic activity, and those goods are dispatched or transported by a consignor who carries out an independent economic activity or who dispatches or transports the goods on his or her own behalf, excise duty should be paid in the Member State of destination. Provision should be made for a procedure to be followed by the consignor for payment of the excise duty. In order to ensure the payment in the Member State of destination, the consignor or his or her tax representative should register his or her identity and guarantee payment of the excise duty with the competent office specifically designated under the conditions laid down by the Member State of destination. In order to facilitate those arrangements, the consignor should be able to choose whether to use a tax representative to comply with requirements of registration and payment of guarantee. If neither the consignor nor the tax representative fulfils these requirements, the consignee should be held liable to pay the excise duties in the Member State of destination.\n(52)\nIn order to avoid conflicts of interest between Member States and double taxation in cases in which excise goods already released for consumption in the territory of one Member State move within the Union, provision should be made for situations in which excise goods, following their release for consumption, are subject to irregularities.\n(53)\nMember States should be able to provide that goods released for consumption carry tax markings or national identification marks. The use of those markings or marks should not place any obstacle in the way of intra-Union trade. Since the use of those markings or marks should not give rise to a double taxation burden, it should be made clear that any amount paid or guaranteed to obtain such markings or marks is to be reimbursed, remitted or released by the Member State which issued the marks if excise duty has become chargeable and has been collected in another Member State. However, in order to prevent any abuse, Member States which issued such markings or marks should be able to make reimbursement, remission or release conditional on the presentation of evidence that they have been removed or destroyed.\n(54)\nApplication of the normal requirements relating to the movement and monitoring of excise goods could put a disproportionate administrative burden on small wine producers. Therefore, Member States should be able to exempt those producers from certain requirements.\n(55)\nAccount should be taken of the fact that, with regard to excise goods used as stores for boats and aircraft, no suitable common approach has yet been found.\n(56)\nWith respect to excise goods used for the construction and maintenance of cross border bridges between Member States, those Member States should be allowed to adopt measures derogating from the normal rules and procedures applying to excise goods moving from the territory of one Member State to the territory of another Member State, in order to reduce the administrative burden.\n(57)\nIn order to allow a period of adjustment to the electronic control system for the movement of goods, Member States should be able to benefit from a transitional period during which such movement may continue to be carried out subject to the formalities laid down by Directive 2008/118/EC.\n(58)\nSince the objective of this Directive, namely ensuring common arrangements in relation to certain aspects of excise duty, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States but can rather, by reason of its scale and effects, be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Directive does not go beyond what is necessary to achieve that objective.\n(59)\nThe obligation to transpose this Directive into national law should be confined to those provisions which represent a substantive amendment as compared to the earlier Directive. The obligation to transpose the provisions which are unchanged arises under the earlier Directive.\n(60)\nThis Directive should be without prejudice to the obligations of the Member States relating to the time-limits for the transposition into national law and the date of application of the Directives set out in Annex I, Part B,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:\nCHAPTER I\nGeneral provisions\nArticle 1\nSubject matter\n1.   This Directive lays down general arrangements for excise duty which is levied directly or indirectly on the consumption of the following goods (‘excise goods’):\n(a)\nenergy products and electricity covered by Directive 2003/96/EC;\n(b)\nalcohol and alcoholic beverages covered by Directives 92/83/EEC and 92/84/EEC;\n(c)\nmanufactured tobacco covered by Directive 2011/64/EU.\n2.   Member States may levy other indirect taxes on excise goods for specific purposes, provided that those taxes comply with the Union tax rules applicable to excise duty or value added tax as far as determination of the tax base, calculation of the tax, chargeability and monitoring of the tax are concerned, but not including the provisions on exemptions.\n3.   Member States may levy taxes on:\n(a)\nproducts other than excise goods;\n(b)\nthe supply of services, including those relating to excise goods, which cannot be characterised as turnover taxes.\nHowever, the levying of such taxes may not, in trade between Member States, give rise to formalities connected with the crossing of frontiers.\nArticle 2\nApplication of the Union Customs Code to excise goods\n1.   The formalities laid down by the Union customs provisions for the entry of goods into the customs territory of the Union shall apply mutatis mutandis to the entry of excise goods into the territory of the Union from one of the territories referred to in Article 4(2).\n2.   The formalities laid down by the Union customs provisions for the exit of goods from the customs territory of the Union shall apply mutatis mutandis to the exit of excise goods from the territory of the Union to one of the territories referred to in Article 4(2).\n3.   By way of derogation from paragraphs 1 and 2, Finland shall be authorised, for movements of excise goods between the territory of that Member State and the territories referred to in point (c) of Article 4(2), to apply the same procedures as those applied for such movements within the territory of that Member State.\n4.   Articles 14 to 46 shall not apply to excise goods that have the customs status of non‐Union goods as defined in point (24) of Article 5 of Regulation (EU) No 952/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council (14).\nArticle 3\nDefinitions\nFor the purpose of this Directive, the following definitions apply:\n(1)\n‘authorised warehousekeeper’ means a natural or legal person authorised by the competent authorities of a Member State, in the course of the business of that person, to produce, process, hold, store, receive or dispatch excise goods under a duty suspension arrangement in a tax warehouse;\n(2)\n‘territory of a Member State’ means the territory of a Member State to which the Treaties are applicable, in accordance with Articles 349 and 355 of the TFEU, with the exception of third territories;\n(3)\n‘territory of the Union’ means the territories of the Member States;\n(4)\n‘third territories’ means the territories referred to in Article 4(2) and (3);\n(5)\n‘third countries’ means any State or territory to which the Treaties are not applicable;\n(6)\n‘duty suspension arrangement’ means a tax arrangement applied to the production, processing, holding, storage or movement of excise goods whereby excise duty is suspended;\n(7)\n‘importation’ means the release of goods for free circulation in accordance with Article 201 of Regulation (EU) No 952/2013;\n(8)\n‘irregular entry’ means an entry of goods into the territory of the Union, which have not been placed under release for free circulation in accordance with Article 201 of Regulation (EU) No 952/2013 and for which a customs debt under Article 79(1) of that Regulation has been incurred, or would have been incurred if the goods had been subject to customs duty;\n(9)\n‘registered consignee’ means a natural or legal person authorised by the competent authorities of the Member State of destination to receive, in the course of the business of that person and under the conditions fixed by those authorities, excise goods moving under a duty suspension arrangement from the territory of another Member State;\n(10)\n‘registered consignor’ means a natural or legal person authorised by the competent authorities of the Member State of importation, to only dispatch excise goods under a duty suspension arrangement upon their release for free circulation in accordance with Article 201 of Regulation (EU) No 952/2013 in the course of the business of that person and under the conditions fixed by those authorities;\n(11)\n‘tax warehouse’ means a place where excise goods are produced, processed, held, stored, received or dispatched under duty suspension arrangements by an authorised warehousekeeper in the course of the business of that person, subject to certain conditions laid down by the competent authorities of the Member State where the tax warehouse is located;\n(12)\n‘certified consignor’ means a natural or legal person registered with the competent authorities of the Member State of dispatch in order to dispatch excise goods, in the course of the business of that person, that have been released for consumption in the territory of one Member State and then moved to the territory of another Member State;\n(13)\n‘certified consignee’ means a natural or legal person registered with the competent authorities of the Member State of destination in order to receive excise goods, in the course of the business of that person, that have been released for consumption in the territory of one Member State and then moved to the territory of another Member State;\n(14)\n‘Member State of destination’ means the Member State to which excise goods are to be delivered or used in accordance with the provisions of this Directive;\n(15)\n‘remission’ means the waiving of the obligation to pay an amount of excise duty that has not been paid;\n(16)\n‘reimbursement’ means the refunding of an amount of excise duty that has been paid.\nArticle 4\nTerritorial application\n1.

The provisions of this Directive shall not prevent Greece from maintaining the specific status granted to Mount Athos as guaranteed by Article 105 of the Greek Constitution.\nArticle 5\nSpecial territorial status\n1.   In view of the conventions and treaties concluded with France, Italy, Cyprus and the United Kingdom respectively, the Principality of Monaco, San Marino, the United Kingdom Sovereign Base Areas of Akrotiri and Dhekelia, and the Isle of Man shall not be regarded, for the purposes of this Directive, as third countries.\n2.   Member States shall take the measures necessary to ensure that movements of excise goods originating in or intended for:\n(a)\nthe Principality of Monaco are treated as movements originating in or intended for France;\n(b)\nSan Marino are treated as movements originating in or intended for Italy;\n(c)\nUnited Kingdom Sovereign Base Areas of Akrotiri and Dhekelia are treated as movements originating in or intended for Cyprus;\n(d)\nthe Isle of Man are treated as movements originating in or intended for the United Kingdom.\n3.   Member States shall take the measures necessary to ensure that movements of excise goods originating in or intended for Jungholz and Mittelberg (Kleines Walsertal) are treated as movements originating in or intended for Germany.\nCHAPTER II\nGeneral procedural provisions\nSection 1\nTaxable event, chargeability, irregularities during a movement under duty suspension\nArticle 6\nTaxable event, time and place of chargeability, destruction and irretrievable losses\n1.   Excise goods shall be subject to excise duty at the time of:\n(a)\ntheir production, including, where applicable, their extraction, within the territory of the Union;\n(b)\ntheir importation or their irregular entry into the territory of the Union.\n2.   Excise duty shall become chargeable at the time, and in the Member State, of release for consumption.\n3.   For the purposes of this Directive, ‘release for consumption’ means any of the following:\n(a)\nthe departure of excise goods, including irregular departure, from a duty suspension arrangement;\n(b)\nthe holding or storage of excise goods, including cases of irregularity, outside a duty suspension arrangement where excise duty has not been levied pursuant to the applicable provisions of Union law and national legislation;\n(c)\nthe production, including processing, of excise goods and irregular production or processing, outside a duty suspension arrangement;\n(d)\nthe importation of excise goods, unless the excise goods are placed, immediately upon importation, under a duty suspension arrangement, or the irregular entry of excise goods, unless the customs debt was extinguished under points (e), (f), (g) or (k) of Article 124(1) of Regulation (EU) No 952/2013. If the customs debt was extinguished according to the point (e) of Article 124(1) of Regulation (EU) No 952/2013, Member States may provide in their national law for a penalty taking into account the amount of excise debt which would have been incurred.\n4.   The time of departure from a duty suspension arrangement as referred to in point (a) of paragraph 3 shall be deemed to be:\n(a)\nthe time of receipt of the excise goods by the registered consignee in the situations referred to in point (a)(ii) of Article 16(1);\n(b)\nthe time of receipt of the excise goods by the consignee in the situations referred to in point (a)(iv) of Article 16(1);\n(c)\nthe time of receipt of the excise goods at the place of direct delivery in the situations referred to in Article 16(4).\n5.   The total destruction or irretrievable loss, total or partial, of excise goods under a duty suspension arrangement, as a result of unforeseeable circumstances or force majeure, or as a consequence of an authorisation to destroy the goods by the competent authorities of the Member State, shall not be considered a release for consumption.\n6.   For the purposes of this Directive, goods shall be considered totally destroyed or irretrievably lost when they are rendered unusable as excise goods.\n7.   Partial loss due to the nature of the goods that occurs during a duty suspension movement between the Member States shall not be considered a release for consumption in so far as the amount of loss falls below the common partial loss threshold for those excise goods, unless a Member State has reasonable cause to suspect fraud or irregularity. That part of a partial loss which exceeds the common partial loss threshold for those excise goods shall be treated as a release for consumption.\n8.   A Member State may lay down its own rules for the treatment of partial losses under duty suspension arrangement not covered by paragraph 7.\n9.

Where an irregularity has been detected during a movement of excise goods under Article 33(1) or Article 44(1), in the territory of a Member State other than the territory of the Member State in which they were released for consumption, and it is not possible to determine where the irregularity occurred, the irregularity shall be deemed to have occurred and the excise duty shall be chargeable in the Member State where the irregularity was detected.\nHowever, if, before the expiry of a period of three years from the date on which the excise goods were acquired, it is ascertained in the territory of which Member State the irregularity actually occurred, the provisions of paragraph 1 shall apply.\n3.   The excise duty shall be due from the person who guaranteed payment thereof in accordance with point (a) of Article 35(2) or point (a) of Article 44(4) and from any person who participated in the irregularity. Where several persons are liable for payment of the same excise duty, they shall be jointly and severally liable for such debt.\nThe competent authorities of the Member State in which the excise goods were released for consumption shall, upon request, reimburse or remit the excise duty where it was levied in the Member State where the irregularity occurred or was detected.

(from 2023)\nGeneral arrangements for excise duty (from 2023)\nSUMMARY OF:\nDirective (EU) 2020/262 laying down the general arrangements for excise duty\nWHAT IS THE AIM OF THE DIRECTIVE?\n              \nThe directive lays down excise duties on the following goods:\nenergy products and electricity covered by Directive 2003/96/EC (see summary);\nalcohol and alcohol beverages covered by Directives 92/83/EEC (see summary) and 92/84/EEC;\nmanufactured tobacco covered by Directive 2011/64/EU (see summary).\nIt allows European Union (EU) Member States to levy:\nother indirect taxes for specific purposes on goods liable for excise duty, provided these respect EU rules;\ntaxes on products other than excise goods and on certain services.\nKEY POINTS\n              \nThe directive:\napplies to the territory of the EU and Northern Ireland on the basis of the Northern Ireland Protocol to the UK Withdrawal Agreement;\nconfirms that the following are not treated as non-EU countries under excise goods movement rules: Monaco,San Marino,the UK sovereign bases of Akrotiri and Dhekelia in Cyprus,the Isle of Man,Jungholz and Mittelberg (Kleines Walsertal);\ndoes not apply to the following territories which are part of the EU customs union: the Canary Islands,French overseas territories,the Åland Islands,the Channel Islands,the Island of Heligoland,the territory of Büsingen,Ceuta,Melilla,Livigno.\nThe directive sets out the general rules that apply when goods are under a duty suspension arrangement.\nA ‘duty suspension arrangement’ is a tax arrangement applied to the production, processing, holding, storage and movement of excise goods whereby excise duty is suspended.\nExcise goods are subject to duty when any of the following occur in the EU: production or extraction;importation, legally or illegally.\nExcise duty becomes chargeable at the time that, and in the Member State where, excise goods are released for consumption.\nThe directive lays down the general rules that apply when excise goods, after being released for consumption in one Member State, are moved to another Member State for commercial purposes. In such cases, excise goods may only be moved from a certified consignor* to a certified consignee*.\nGoods released for consumption means: the departure of excise goods from a duty suspension arrangement;the holding or storage of excise goods outside a duty suspension arrangement where excise duty has not been levied pursuant to the applicable provisions of EU law and national legislation;the production, including processing, of excise goods outside a duty suspension arrangement;the importation of excise goods, unless the excise goods are placed, immediately upon importation, under a duty suspension arrangement.\nPersons liable to pay the duty are: authorised warehouse keepers*, who must meet certain conditions to be recognised;registered consignees*;any other person releasing the goods.\nThe duty applied is the one in force in the Member State when the goods are released for consumption.\nEach Member State determines its own rules on the production, processing, holding and storage of excise goods.\nProduction, processing, holding and storage of excise goods, when the duty has not been paid, takes place in a tax warehouse.\nExcise goods are exempt from duty and must be accompanied by an exemption certificate when used for:\ndiplomatic and consular purposes;\ninternational organisations;\nEU or NATO Member States’ armed forces, except in their own jurisdiction;\nUK armed forces stationed in Cyprus;\nconsumption under an agreement with a non-EU country or international organisation.\nPassengers travelling to a non-EU country by air or sea do not pay duty on excise goods purchased on board or in tax-free shops for personal use.\nRules on the movement of excise goods under suspension of duty* provide the following.\nThey allow the goods to be moved from a tax warehouse, or from where they are imported, to another warehouse, a registered consignee or EU exit point.\nThey require: a unique excise number identifying the registered consignor* or consignee;a valid EU-wide guarantee from the dispatching authorised warehouse keeper or registered consignor to cover any risks (except for energy products moved by fixed pipeline);a covering electronic administrative document or fallback document containing the same data if the computerised system is unavailable.\nThey provide special arrangements, and allow consignments to be split into two or more parts, for energy products transported by sea or inland waterway.\nThey specify the start and end of a movement period and the formalities at destination.\nThey offer simplified procedures for goods being moved solely within one Member State or on a frequent and regular basis between two or more Member States.\nRegistered consignees:\nmay not produce, process, hold, store or dispatch goods under a duty suspension arrangement;\nmust: guarantee payment of duty before dispatching the goods,enter the goods into their accounts on arrival,agree to checks to ensure receipt of the goods.\nRules on private individuals transporting excise goods for their own use from one Member State to another stipulate the following.\nThe duty is paid where the goods are bought.\nMember States determine ‘own use’ against tests such as: the individual’s commercial status;the place where the goods are held or type of transport used;the documentation relating to, or the nature or quantity of, the goods.\nNational authorities may lay down quantity guide levels as a form of evidence, but these may not be lower than: tobacco: 800 cigarettes, 400 cigarillos, 200 cigars, 1 kg smoking tobacco;alcohol: 10 l spirits, 20 l intermediate products, 90 l wine, 110 l beer.\nThe rules on excise goods released for consumption in one Member State and transported commercially to another Member State are as follows.\nDuty is paid in the country of destination.\nThe certified consignee: is liable for the duty;provides a guarantee covering possible non-payment before the goods are dispatched;agrees to any checks;reports within 5 days of receiving the goods.\nAn electronic simplified administrative document, or fallback document containing the same data, must accompany the delivery.\nSimplified procedures may be used for excise goods moving between two or more Member States.\nCross-border distance selling rules require duty to be paid in the destination country.\nExcise duty is:\nnot chargeable if goods sent to another Member State are totally destroyed or irretrievably lost due to unforeseeable circumstances, force majeure or by order of that Member State;\nchargeable, for goods sent from one Member State to another, in the Member State where an irregularity occurs.\nMember States may:\nrequire excise goods to carry tax markings or national identification marks for fiscal reasons;\nexempt small wine producers, who produce less than 1,000 hl a year, from many of the movement and monitoring rules and requirements;\nmaintain national rules on boat and aircraft stores until EU measures are adopted;\napply special arrangements for goods used in the construction or maintenance of a cross-border bridge.\nThe European Commission submits a report to the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union every 5 years – the first at the latest 3 years after the application of the directive – on the implementation of the legislation.\nThe directive empowers the Commission to adopt:\ndelegated acts to establish the common partial loss thresholds due to the nature of the goods, the structure and content of the electronic administrative document and fallback document and those of the electronic simplified administrative document and fallback document;\nimplementing acts to lay down the rules and procedures for exchanging the electronic administrative document and fallback document, the electronic simplified administrative document and fallback document, and for establishing the form to be used for the exemption certificate.\nThe directive:\nrepeals and replaces Directive 2008/118/EC (see summary) and Directive 2010/12/EU from 13 February 2023;\nis closely linked to Decision (EU) 2020/263 on computerising the movement and surveillance of excise goods.\nFROM WHEN DOES THE DIRECTIVE APPLY?\n              \nIt applies from 13 February 2023.\nDirective (EU) 2020/262 revises and replaces Directive 2008/118/EC. Member States are required to transpose several articles into national legislation by 31 December 2021, while the rest of the articles apply from 13 February 2023.\nBACKGROUND\nThe directive modernises the existing framework for excise goods by improving the conditions for fair competition in the single market and reducing the administrative burden on businesses. It aligns EU excise and customs procedures.\nRevenue from excise taxes goes entirely to the country in which they are paid. Since 1992, the EU has had common rules in place to ensure excise duties are applied in the same way and to the same products.\nFor further information, see: Excise duties on alcohol, tobacco and energy (European Commission).\nKEY TERMS\n              \nCertified consignor.
