The common requirements should cater for identical processes within the competent authorities across the different aviation domains. They should not prevent, however, the application of slightly different processes if and where necessary or beneficial, for example in the case of separate overseeing entities for aerodromes and air operations. The safety objective of these requirements should remain unaffected by the different ways of technical compliance.\n(7)\nWith regard to obstacle management in the aerodrome surroundings as well as to other activities taking place outside the aerodrome’s boundary, each Member State may designate different authorities and other entities in charge of monitoring, assessment and mitigation risks. The aim of this Regulation is not to change current allocation of tasks within the Member State. However, a seamless organisation of the competences regarding the safeguarding of aerodrome surroundings and the monitoring and mitigating of risk caused by human activities should be ensured in each Member State. It should therefore be ensured that authorities which are entrusted with responsibilities of safeguarding the surrounding of aerodromes have the adequate competencies to fulfil their obligations.\n(8)\nSpecific services referred to in subpart B of Annex IV (Part ADR.OPS) should be provided at an aerodrome. In some cases these services are not directly provided by the aerodrome operator, but by another organisation or State entity, or combination of both. In such cases the aerodrome operator, being responsible for the operation of the aerodrome, should have arrangements and interfaces with these organisations or entities in place to ensure the provision of services according to the requirements stated in Annex IV. When such arrangements and interfaces are in place the aerodrome operator should be considered as having discharged their responsibility and should not be understood to be directly responsible or liable for any non-compliances by another entity involved in the arrangement, provided that it has complied with all applicable requirements and obligations laid down in this Regulation relevant to its responsibility under the arrangement.\n(9)\nRegulation (EC) No 216/2008 only concerns aerodrome certificates to be issued by Competent Authorities in so far as safety aspects are concerned. Therefore, non-safety related aspects of existing national aerodrome certificates remain unaffected.\n(10)\nThe measures provided for in this Regulation are based on the Opinion issued by the Agency in accordance with Article 17(2)(b) and Article 19(1) of Regulation (EC) No 216/2008.\n(11)\nThe measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee established by Article 65 of Regulation (EC) No 216/2008,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nArticle 1\nSubject matter and scope\n1.

In such cases, the competent authorities must compile the evidence that those conditions are met in a deviation acceptance and action document (DAAD) which must be attached to the certificate. The competent authority must specify the period of validity of the DAAD and can amend, suspend or withdraw the DAAD in the event that the conditions are no longer met.\nAerodrome surroundings\nMember States must ensure:\nthat consultations take place on safety impacts of proposed constructions: within the limits of the obstacle limitation* and obstacle protection* surfaces, as well as other surfaces associated with the aerodrome,beyond the limits of the obstacle limitation and obstacle protection surfaces, as well as other surfaces associated with the aerodrome and which exceed the height set by Member States;\nthat they coordinate the safeguarding of aerodromes located near borders with other Member States;\nthat consultations are conducted with regard to human activities and land use such as: developments which may create obstacle-induced turbulence that could be hazardous to aircraft operations,the use of hazardous, confusing and misleading lights,the use of highly reflective surfaces which may cause dazzling,activities that may interfere with the performance of aeronautical communications, navigation and surveillance systems.\nWildlife hazard management\nMember States must:\nhave procedures for recording and reporting wildlife strikes to aircraft;\ncollect information from aircraft operators, aerodrome personnel and other sources on the presence of wildlife constituting a potential hazard to aircraft operations;\nensure wildlife hazards are evaluated on an ongoing basis by competent personnel.\nThey must also collect and forward wildlife strike reports to the ICAO for inclusion in the ICAO Bird Strike Information System.\nAmendments to Regulation (EU) No 139/2014\nRegulation (EU) 2018/401 amends Annex I to the regulation with regard to the classification of runways.\nA delegated act, Delegated Regulation (EU) 2020/1234, amends the regulation setting out a dedicated set of additional requirements related to aerodromes and to providing AMS, as a subpart of aerodrome operations. It amends Annex II to the regulation to give to the competent authority of the Member State where the AMS is provided, the powers to receive and register the declarations of capability submitted by organisations responsible for providing AMS.It aligns the requirements for organisations responsible for providing AMS with those that apply to aerodrome operators — in particular with the requirements for safety management, operational procedures and personnel.It sets out requirements for managing safety-related interfaces between the aerodrome operator, the organisations responsible for providing AMS and the air traffic service provider with regard to operations on the apron. To ensure the safety of operations on an apron, the aerodrome operator is given responsibility for allocating responsibilities to other organisations.\nDelegated Regulation (EU) 2020/2148 amends Regulation (EU) No 139/2014 as regards runway safety and aeronautical data. To ensure the safety levels of aerodrome operations, it introduces data quality requirements similar to those applicable to air traffic management (ATM)/air navigation service (ANS) providers, to be completed at the operations level.\nFROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?\nRegulation (EU) No 139/2014 has applied since 6 March 2014.\nDelegated Regulation (EU) 2020/1234 applies from 20 March 2022.\nBACKGROUND\n              \nFor more information, see:\nAerodromes (European Commission)\nAerodromes (EASA).\nKEY TERMS\n              \nAerodrome.
