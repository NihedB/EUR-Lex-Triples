{"celex_id": "32012R0528", "reference": "27.6.2012\nEN\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\nL 167/1\nREGULATION (EU) No 528/2012 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL\nof 22 May 2012\nconcerning the making available on the market and use of biocidal products\n(Text with EEA relevance)\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 114 thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European Commission,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee (1),\nActing in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure (2),\nWhereas:\n(1)\nBiocidal products are necessary for the control of organisms that are harmful to human or animal health and for the control of organisms that cause damage to natural or manufactured materials. However, biocidal products can pose risks to humans, animals and the environment due to their intrinsic properties and associated use patterns.\n(2)\nBiocidal products should neither be made available on the market nor used unless authorised in accordance with this Regulation. Treated articles should not be placed on the market unless all active substances contained in the biocidal products with which they were treated or which they incorporate are approved in accordance with this Regulation.\n(3)\nThe purpose of this Regulation is to improve the free movement of biocidal products within the Union while ensuring a high level of protection of both human and animal health and the environment. Particular attention should be paid to the protection of vulnerable groups, such as pregnant women and children. This Regulation should be underpinned by the precautionary principle to ensure that the manufacturing and making available on the market of active substances and biocidal products do not result in harmful effects on human or animal health or unacceptable effects on the environment. With a view to removing, as far as possible, obstacles to trade in biocidal products, rules should be laid down for the approval of active substances and the making available on the market and use of biocidal products, including rules on the mutual recognition of authorisations and on parallel trade.\n(4)\nTo ensure a high level of protection for human health, animal health and the environment, this Regulation should apply without prejudice to Union legislation on safety in the workplace and environmental and consumer protection.\n(5)\nRules concerning the making available on the market of biocidal products within the Community were established by Directive 98/8/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (3). It is necessary to adapt those rules in the light of experience and in particular the report on the first seven years of the implementation submitted by the Commission to the European Parliament and the Council, which analyses problems with and weaknesses of that Directive.\n(6)\nTaking into account the main changes that should be made to the existing rules, a regulation is the appropriate legal instrument to replace Directive 98/8/EC to lay down clear, detailed and directly applicable rules. Moreover, a regulation ensures that legal requirements are implemented at the same time and in a harmonised manner throughout the Union.\n(7)\nA distinction should be drawn between existing active substances which were on the market in biocidal products on the transposition date set in Directive 98/8/EC and new active substances which were not yet on the market in biocidal products on that date. During the ongoing review of existing active substances, Member States should continue to allow biocidal products containing such substances to be made available on the market according to their national rules until a decision is taken on approval of those active substances. Following such a decision Member States, or, where appropriate, the Commission, should grant, cancel or modify authorisations as appropriate. New active substances should be reviewed before biocidal products containing them are placed on the market, so as to ensure that new products that are placed on the market comply with the requirements of this Regulation. However, to encourage the development of new active substances, the evaluation procedure for new active substances should not prevent Member States or the Commission from authorising, for a limited period of time, biocidal products containing an active substance before it is approved, provided that a full dossier has been submitted and it is believed that the active substance and the biocidal product satisfy the conditions set out in this Regulation.\n(8)\nTo ensure the equal treatment of persons placing active substances on the market, they should be required to hold a dossier, or have a letter of access to a dossier, or to relevant data in a dossier, for each of the active substances they manufacture or import for use in biocidal products. Biocidal products containing active substances for which the relevant person does not comply with that obligation should no longer be made available on the market. In such cases, there should be appropriate phase-out periods for disposal and use of existing stocks of biocidal products.\n(9)\nThis Regulation should apply to biocidal products that, in the form in which they are supplied to the user, consist of, contain or generate one or more active substances.\n(10)\nIn order to ensure legal certainty, it is necessary to establish a Union list of active substances approved for use in biocidal products. A procedure should be laid down for assessing whether or not an active substance can be entered in that list. The information that interested parties should submit in support of an application for approval of an active substance and its inclusion in the list should be specified.\n(11)\nThis Regulation applies without prejudice to Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 December 2006 concerning the Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH) and establishing a European Chemicals Agency (4). Under certain conditions, biocidal active substances are exempt from the relevant provisions of that Regulation.\n(12)\nWith a view to achieving a high level of protection of human health, animal health and the environment, active substances with the worst hazard profiles should not be approved for use in biocidal products except in specific situations. These should include situations when approval is justified because of the negligible risk from exposure to the substance, human health, animal health or environmental reasons or the disproportionate negative impact for society of non-approval. When deciding if such active substances may be approved, the availability of suitable and sufficient alternative substances or technologies should also be taken into account.\n(13)\nThe active substances in the Union list should be regularly examined to take account of developments in science and technology. Where there are significant indications that an active substance used in biocidal products or treated articles does not meet the requirements of this Regulation, the Commission should be able to review the approval of the active substance.\n(14)\nActive substances should be designated as candidates for substitution if they have certain intrinsic hazardous properties. In order to allow for a regular examination of substances identified as candidates for substitution, the approval period for those substances should not, even in the case of renewal, exceed seven years.\n(15)\nIn the course of granting or renewing the authorisation of a biocidal product that contains an active substance that is a candidate for substitution, it should be possible to compare the biocidal product with other authorised biocidal products, non-chemical means of control and prevention methods with regard to risks they pose and benefits from their use. As a result of such a comparative assessment, a biocidal product containing active substances identified as candidates for substitution should be prohibited or restricted where it is demonstrated that other authorised biocidal products or non-chemical control or prevention methods that present a significantly lower overall risk for human health, animal health and the environment, are sufficiently effective and present no other significant economic or practical disadvantages. Appropriate phase-out periods should be provided for in such cases.\n(16)\nIn order to avoid unnecessary administrative and financial burdens for industry and competent authorities, a full in-depth evaluation of an application to renew the approval of an active substance or the authorisation of a biocidal product should be carried out only if the competent authority that was responsible for the initial evaluation decides that this is necessary on the basis of the available information.\n(17)\nThere is a need to ensure effective coordination and management of the technical, scientific and administrative aspects of this Regulation at Union level. The European Chemicals Agency set up under Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 (‘the Agency’) should carry out specified tasks with regard to the evaluation of active substances as well as the Union authorisation of certain categories of biocidal products and related tasks. Consequently, a Biocidal Products Committee should be established within the Agency to carry out certain tasks conferred on the Agency by this Regulation.\n(18)\nCertain biocidal products and treated articles as defined in the Regulation are also regulated by other Union legislation. It is therefore necessary to draw clear borderlines in order to ensure legal certainty. A list of product-types covered by this Regulation with an indicative set of descriptions within each type should be set out in an Annex to this Regulation.\n(19)\nBiocidal products intended to be used not only for the purposes of this Regulation, but also in connection with medical devices, such as disinfectants used to disinfect surfaces in hospitals and medical devices, may pose risks other than those with which this Regulation is concerned. Therefore, such biocidal products should comply, in addition to the requirements laid down in this Regulation, with the relevant essential requirements set out in Annex I to Council Directive 90/385/EEC of 20 June 1990 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to active implantable medical devices (5), Council Directive 93/42/EEC of 14 June 1993 concerning medical devices (6) and Directive 98/79/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 October 1998 on in vitro diagnostic medical devices (7).\n(20)\nWhere a product has a biocidal function that is inherent to its cosmetic function, or where that biocidal function is considered to be a secondary claim of a cosmetic product and is therefore regulated under Regulation (EC) No 1223/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 30 November 2009 on cosmetic products (8), that function and the product should remain outside the scope of this Regulation.\n(21)\nThe safety of food and feed is subject to Union legislation, in particular Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 28 January 2002 laying down the general principles and requirements of food law, establishing the European Food Safety Authority and laying down procedures in matters of food safety (9). Therefore, the present Regulation should not apply to food and feed used as repellents or attractants.\n(22)\nProcessing aids are covered by existing Union legislation, in particular Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 September 2003 on additives for use in animal nutrition (10) and Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 December 2008 on food additives (11). Therefore, it is appropriate to exclude them from the scope of this Regulation.\n(23)\nAs products used for the preservation of food or feed by the control of harmful organisms, previously covered by product-type 20, are covered by Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003 and Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008, it is not appropriate to maintain that product-type.\n(24)\nAs the International Convention for the Control and Management of Ships’ Ballast Water and Sediments provides for an effective assessment of the risks posed by ballast water management systems, the final approval and subsequent type-approval of such systems should be considered equivalent to the product authorisation required under this Regulation.\n(25)\nTo avoid possible negative effects on the environment, biocidal products that can no longer lawfully be made available on the market should be dealt with in accordance with Union legislation on waste, in particular Directive 2008/98/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 19 November 2008 on waste (12), as well as national legislation implementing that legislation.\n(26)\nTo facilitate the making available on the market throughout the Union of certain biocidal products with similar conditions of use in all Member States, it is appropriate to provide for Union authorisation of those products. In order to allow some time for the Agency to build up the necessary capacity and to gain experience with this procedure, the possibility to apply for Union authorisation should be extended through a step-wise approach to further categories of biocidal products with similar conditions of use in all Member States.\n(27)\nThe Commission should review experience with the provisions on Union authorisations and report to the European Parliament and the Council by 31 December 2017, accompanying its report with proposals for changes if appropriate.\n(28)\nTo ensure that only biocidal products that comply with the relevant provisions of this Regulation are made available on the market, biocidal products should be subject to authorisation either by competent authorities for making available on the market and use within the territory of a Member State or part of it, or by the Commission for making available on the market and use within the Union.\n(29)\nTo encourage the use of products with a more favourable environmental or human or animal health profile, it is appropriate to provide for simplified authorisation procedures for such biocidal products. Once authorised in at least one Member State, those products should be allowed to be made available on the market in all Member States without the need for mutual recognition, under certain conditions.\n(30)\nTo identify biocidal products which are eligible for simplified authorisation procedures, it is appropriate to establish a specific list of the active substances that those products may contain. That list should, initially, contain substances identified as presenting a low risk under Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 or Directive 98/8/EC, substances identified as food additives, pheromones and other substances considered to have low toxicity, such as weak acids, alcohols and vegetable oils used in cosmetics and food.\n(31)\nIt is necessary to provide common principles for the evaluation and authorisation of biocidal products to ensure a harmonised approach by competent authorities.\n(32)\nTo evaluate the risks that would arise from proposed uses of biocidal products, it is appropriate that applicants submit dossiers which contain the necessary information. Defining a data set for active substances and for biocidal products in which they are contained is necessary so as to assist both applicants seeking authorisation and competent authorities carrying out an evaluation to decide on authorisation.\n(33)\nIn the light of the diversity of both active substances and biocidal products not subject to the simplified authorisation procedure, the data and test requirements should suit the individual circumstances and allow an overall risk assessment. Therefore, an applicant should be able to request the adaptation of the data requirements, as appropriate, including the waiving of data requirements which are not necessary or are impossible to submit in view of the nature or the proposed uses of the product. Applicants should provide appropriate technical and scientific justification to support their requests.\n(34)\nIn order to help applicants, and in particular small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), to comply with the requirements of this Regulation, Member States should provide advice, for example by establishing helpdesks. This advice should be in addition to the operational guidance documents and other advice and assistance provided by the Agency.\n(35)\nIn particular, to ensure that applicants can effectively exercise the right to request the adaptation of data requirements, Member States should provide advice on this possibility and the grounds on which such requests could be made.\n(36)\nTo facilitate access to the market it should be possible to authorise a group of biocidal products as a biocidal product family. Biocidal products within a biocidal product family should have similar uses and the same active substances. Variations in the composition or the replacement of non-active substances should be specified, but may not adversely affect the level of risk or significantly reduce the efficacy of the products.\n(37)\nWhen authorising biocidal products it is necessary to ensure that, when properly used for the purpose intended, they are sufficiently effective and have no unacceptable effect on the target organisms such as resistance, or, in the case of vertebrates, unnecessary suffering and pain. Furthermore, they may not have, in the light of current scientific and technical knowledge, any unacceptable effect on human health, animal health or on the environment. Where appropriate, maximum residue limits for food and feed should be established with respect to active substances contained in a biocidal product to protect human and animal health. When these requirements are not met, biocidal products shall not be authorised unless their authorisation is justified because of the disproportionate negative impact for society of not authorising them when compared to the risks arising from their use.\n(38)\nWhere possible, the presence of harmful organisms should be avoided by means of suitable precautionary steps, such as proper warehousing of goods, compliance with relevant hygiene standards and immediate disposal of waste. As far as possible, biocidal products that pose lower risks for humans, animals and the environment should be used whenever they provide an effective remedy, and biocidal products that are intended to harm, kill or destroy animals that are capable of experiencing pain and distress should be used only as a last resort.\n(39)\nSome authorised biocidal products may present certain risks if used by the general public. It is therefore appropriate to provide that certain biocidal products should not generally be authorised for making available on the market for use by the general public.\n(40)\nTo avoid duplication of the evaluation procedures and to ensure free movement of biocidal products within the Union, procedures should be established to ensure that product authorisations granted in one Member State are recognised in other Member States.\n(41)\nTo enable closer cooperation between Member States in the evaluation of biocidal products and to facilitate biocidal products’ market access, it should be possible to launch the mutual recognition procedure when applying for the first national authorisation.\n(42)\nIt is appropriate to lay down procedures for the mutual recognition of national authorisations and, in particular, to resolve any disagreements without undue delay. If a competent authority refuses mutual recognition of an authorisation or proposes to restrict it, a coordination group should try to reach an agreement on the action to be taken. If the coordination group does not succeed in finding an agreement within a specified time limit, the Commission should be empowered to take a decision. In case of technical or scientific questions, the Commission may consult the Agency before preparing its decision.\n(43)\nHowever, considerations related to public policy or public security, environmental and human and animal health protection, the protection of national treasures and the absence of the target organisms might justify, following agreement with the applicant, Member States’ refusal to grant an authorisation or decision to adjust the terms and conditions of the authorisation to be granted. If no agreement with the applicant can be found, the Commission should be empowered to take a decision.\n(44)\nThe use of biocidal products of certain product-types might give rise to animal welfare concerns. Therefore, Member States should be allowed to derogate from the principle of mutual recognition for biocidal products falling under such product-types, in so far as such derogations are justified and do not jeopardise the purpose of this Regulation regarding an appropriate level of protection of the internal market.\n(45)\nIn order to facilitate the functioning of the authorisation and mutual recognition procedures, it is appropriate to establish a system for the mutual exchange of information. To accomplish this, a Register for Biocidal Products should be established. Member States, the Commission and the Agency should use this Register to make available to each other the particulars and scientific documentation submitted in connection with applications for authorisation of biocidal products.\n(46)\nIf the use of a biocidal product is in the interests of a Member State, but there is no applicant interested in making available on the market such a product in the Member State, official or scientific bodies should be able to apply for an authorisation. If they are granted an authorisation, they should have the same rights and obligations as any other authorisation holder.\n(47)\nTo take account of scientific and technical developments as well as the needs of authorisation holders, it is appropriate to specify under which conditions authorisations can be cancelled, reviewed or amended. The notification and exchange of information which may affect authorisations is also necessary to enable competent authorities and the Commission to take appropriate action.\n(48)\nIn the event of an unforeseen danger threatening public health or the environment which cannot be contained by other means, it should be possible for Member States to permit, for a limited period of time, the making available on the market of biocidal products which do not comply with the requirements of this Regulation.\n(49)\nTo encourage research and development in active substances and biocidal products, it is necessary to establish rules concerning the making available on the market and use of unauthorised biocidal products and non-approved active substances for the purposes of research and development.\n(50)\nIn view of the benefits for the internal market and for the consumer, it is desirable to establish harmonised rules for parallel trade in identical biocidal products authorised in different Member States.\n(51)\nTo determine, where necessary, the similarity of active substances, it is appropriate to lay down rules concerning technical equivalence.\n(52)\nTo protect human health, animal health and the environment, and to avoid discrimination between treated articles originating in the Union and treated articles imported from third countries, all treated articles placed on the internal market should contain only approved active substances.\n(53)\nTo enable consumers to make informed choices, to facilitate enforcement and to provide an overview of their use, treated articles should be appropriately labelled.\n(54)\nApplicants that have invested in supporting the approval of an active substance or the authorisation of a biocidal product in accordance with this Regulation or Directive 98/8/EC should be able to recover part of their investment by receiving equitable compensation whenever use of proprietary information which they submitted in support of such approval or authorisation is made for the benefit of subsequent applicants.\n(55)\nWith a view to ensuring that all proprietary information submitted in support of the approval of an active substance or the authorisation of a biocidal product is protected from the moment of its submission and to prevent situations where some information is without protection, the data protection periods should also apply to information submitted for the purposes of Directive 98/8/EC.\n(56)\nTo encourage the development of new active substances and biocidal products containing them, it is necessary to provide for a period of protection with respect to the proprietary information submitted in support of the approval of such active substances or the authorisation of biocidal products containing them which is longer than the period of protection for information concerning existing active substances and biocidal products containing them.\n(57)\nIt is essential to minimise the number of tests on animals and for testing with biocidal products, or active substances contained in biocidal products, to be carried out only when the purpose and use of a product so requires. Applicants should share, and not duplicate, studies on vertebrates in exchange for equitable compensation. In the absence of an agreement on sharing of studies on vertebrates between the data owner and the prospective applicant, the Agency should allow the use of the studies by the prospective applicant without prejudice to any decision on compensation made by national courts. Competent authorities and the Agency should have access to the contact details of the owners of such studies via a Union register so as to inform prospective applicants.\n(58)\nA level playing field should be established as quickly as possible on the market for existing active substances, taking into account the objectives of reducing unnecessary tests and costs to the minimum, in particular for SMEs, of avoiding the establishment of monopolies, of sustaining free competition between economic operators and of equitable compensation of the costs borne by data owners.\n(59)\nThe generation of information by alternative means not involving tests on animals which are equivalent to prescribed tests and test methods should also be encouraged. In addition, the adaptation of data requirements should be used to prevent unnecessary costs related to testing.\n(60)\nTo ensure that the requirements laid down with respect to the safety and quality of authorised biocidal products are satisfied when they are made available on the market, Member States should take measures for appropriate control and inspection arrangements and manufacturers should maintain a suitable and proportionate quality control system. To this end, it may be appropriate for Member States to take action together.\n(61)\nEffective communication of information on risks resulting from biocidal products and risk management measures is an essential part of the system established by this Regulation. While facilitating access to information, competent authorities, the Agency and the Commission should respect the principle of confidentiality and avoid any disclosure of information which could be harmful to the commercial interests of the person concerned, except where it is necessary for the protection of human health, safety or the environment or for other reasons of overriding public interest.\n(62)\nTo increase the efficiency of monitoring and control, and to provide information relevant for addressing the risks of biocidal products, authorisation holders should keep records of the products they place on the market.\n(63)\nIt is necessary to specify that provisions concerning the Agency laid down in Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 should apply accordingly in the context of biocidal active substances and products. Where separate provisions need to be made with respect to the tasks and functioning of the Agency under this Regulation, they should be specified in this Regulation.\n(64)\nThe costs of the procedures associated with the operation of this Regulation need to be recovered from those making biocidal products available on the market and those seeking to do so in addition to those supporting the approval of active substances. To promote the smooth operation of the internal market, it is appropriate to establish certain common principles applicable both to fees payable to the Agency and to Member States’ competent authorities, including the need to take into account, as appropriate, the specific needs of SMEs.\n(65)\nIt is necessary to provide for the possibility of an appeal against certain decisions of the Agency. The Board of Appeal set up within the Agency by Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 should also process appeals against decisions adopted by the Agency under this Regulation.\n(66)\nThere is scientific uncertainty about the safety of nanomaterials for human health, animal health and the environment. In order to ensure a high level of consumer protection, free movement of goods and legal certainty for manufacturers, it is necessary to develop a uniform definition for nanomaterials, if possible based on the work of appropriate international forums and to specify that the approval of an active substance does not include the nanomaterial form unless explicitly mentioned. The Commission should regularly review the provisions on nanomaterials in the light of scientific progress.\n(67)\nTo ensure a smooth transition, it is appropriate to provide for a deferred application of this Regulation and to provide for specific measures concerning the assessment of applications for the approval of active substances and authorisation of biocidal products submitted before the application of this Regulation.\n(68)\nThe Agency should take over the coordination and facilitation tasks for new submissions for approval of active substances as of the date of applicability of this Regulation. However, in view of the high number of historical dossiers it is appropriate to allow some time for the Agency to prepare for the new tasks related to dossiers submitted under Directive 98/8/EC.\n(69)\nTo respect the legitimate expectations of companies with respect to the placing on the market and use of low-risk biocidal products covered by Directive 98/8/EC, those companies should be allowed to make such products available on the market if they comply with the rules on the registration of low-risk biocidal products under that Directive. However, this Regulation should apply after the expiry of the first registration.\n(70)\nTaking into consideration that some products were not covered by Community legislation on biocidal products, it is appropriate to provide for transitional periods for such products and treated articles.\n(71)\nThis Regulation should take account, as appropriate, of other work programmes concerned with the review or authorisation of substances and products, or relevant international Conventions. In particular, it should contribute to the fulfilment of the Strategic Approach to International Chemicals Management adopted on 6 February 2006 in Dubai.\n(72)\nIn order to supplement or amend this Regulation, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union should be delegated to the Commission in respect of certain non-essential elements of this Regulation. It is of particular importance that the Commission carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level. The Commission, when preparing and drawing up delegated acts, should ensure a simultaneous, timely and appropriate transmission of relevant documents to the European Parliament and to the Council.\n(73)\nThe Commission should adopt immediately applicable delegated acts where, in duly justified cases relating to the restriction of an active substance in Annex I or to the removal of an active substance from that Annex, imperative grounds of urgency so require.\n(74)\nIn order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of this Regulation, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission. Those powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 February 2011 laying down the rules and general principles concerning mechanisms for control by the Member States of the Commission’s exercise of implementing powers (13).\n(75)\nThe Commission should adopt immediately applicable implementing acts where, in duly justified cases relating to the approval of an active substance or to the cancelling of an approval, imperative grounds of urgency so require.\n(76)\nSince the objective of this Regulation, namely, to improve the functioning of the internal market for biocidal products, whilst ensuring a high level of protection of both human and animal health and the environment cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States, and can therefore, by reason of its scale and effects, be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve that objective,\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nCHAPTER I\nSCOPE AND DEFINITIONS\nArticle 1\nPurpose and subject matter\n1.   The purpose of this Regulation is to improve the functioning of the internal market through the harmonisation of the rules on the making available on the market and the use of biocidal products, whilst ensuring a high level of protection of both human and animal health and the environment. The provisions of this Regulation are underpinned by the precautionary principle, the aim of which is to safeguard the health of humans, the health of animals and the environment. Particular attention shall be paid to the protection of vulnerable groups.\n2.   This Regulation lays down rules for:\n(a)\nthe establishment at Union level of a list of active substances which may be used in biocidal products;\n(b)\nthe authorisation of biocidal products;\n(c)\nthe mutual recognition of authorisations within the Union;\n(d)\nthe making available on the market and the use of biocidal products within one or more Member States or the Union;\n(e)\nthe placing on the market of treated articles.\nArticle 2\nScope\n1.

An appeal may be brought, in accordance with Article 77, against decisions of the Agency under paragraph 3 of this Article.\nArticle 14\nEvaluation of applications for renewal\n1.   On the basis of an assessment of the available information and the need to review the conclusions of the initial evaluation of the application for approval or, as appropriate, the previous renewal, the evaluating competent authority shall, within 90 days of the Agency accepting an application in accordance with Article 13(3), decide whether, in the light of current scientific knowledge, a full evaluation of the application for renewal is necessary taking account of all product-types for which renewal is requested.\n2.   Where the evaluating competent authority decides that a full evaluation of the application is necessary, the evaluation shall be carried out in accordance with paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 of Article 8.\nWhere the evaluating competent authority decides that a full evaluation of the application is not necessary, it shall, within 180 days of the Agency accepting the application in accordance with Article 13(3), prepare and submit to the Agency a recommendation on the renewal of the approval of the active substance. It shall provide the applicant with a copy of its recommendation.\nThe evaluating competent authority shall, as soon as possible after the Agency has accepted an application, notify the applicant of the fees payable under Article 80(2). The evaluating competent authority shall reject the application if the applicant fails to pay the fees within 30 days of the notification and shall inform the applicant accordingly.\n3.   Within 270 days of receipt of a recommendation from the evaluating competent authority, if it has carried out a full evaluation of the application, or 90 days otherwise, the Agency shall prepare and submit to the Commission an opinion on renewal of the approval of the active substance.\n4.   The Commission shall, on receipt of the opinion of the Agency, adopt:\n(a)\nan implementing regulation providing that the approval of an active substance is renewed for one or more product-types, and under which conditions; or\n(b)\nan implementing decision that the approval of an active substance is not renewed.\nThose implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 82(3).\nArticle 9(2) shall apply.\n5.   Where, for reasons beyond the control of the applicant, the approval of the active substance is likely to expire before a decision has been taken on its renewal, the Commission shall, by means of implementing acts, adopt a decision postponing the expiry date of approval for a period sufficient to enable it to examine the application. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the advisory procedure referred to in Article 82(2).\n6.   Where the Commission decides not to renew or decides to amend the approval of an active substance for one or more product-types, the Member States or, in the case of a Union authorisation, the Commission shall cancel or, where appropriate, amend the authorisations of biocidal products of the product-type(s) concerned containing that active substance. Articles 48 and 52 shall apply accordingly.\nArticle 15\nReview of approval of an active substance\n1.   The Commission may review the approval of an active substance for one or more product-types at any time where there are significant indications that the conditions laid down in Article 4(1) or, where applicable, the conditions set out in Article 5(2) are no longer met. The Commission may also review the approval of an active substance for one or more product-types at the request of a Member State if there are indications that the use of the active substance in biocidal products or treated articles raises significant concerns about the safety of such biocidal products or treated articles. The Commission shall make publicly available the information that it is carrying out a review and shall provide an opportunity for applicant to submit comments. The Commission shall take due account of those comments in its review.\nWhere those indications are confirmed, the Commission shall adopt an implementing Regulation amending the conditions of approval of an active substance or cancelling its approval. That implementing Regulation shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 82(3). Article 9(2) shall apply. The Commission shall inform the initial applicants for the approval accordingly.\nOn duly justified imperative grounds of urgency the Commission shall adopt immediately applicable implementing acts in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 82(4).\n2.   The Commission may consult the Agency on any questions of a scientific or technical nature related to the review of approval of an active substance. The Agency shall, within 270 days of the request, prepare an opinion and submit it to the Commission.\n3.   Where the Commission decides to cancel or amend the approval of an active substance for one or more product-types, the Member States or, in the case of a Union authorisation, the Commission shall cancel or, where appropriate, amend the authorisations of biocidal products of the product-type(s) concerned containing that active substance. Articles 48 and 52 shall apply accordingly.\nArticle 16\nImplementing measures\nThe Commission may adopt, by means of implementing acts, detailed measures for the implementation of Articles 12 to 15, further specifying the procedures for the renewal and review of the approval of an active substance. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 82(3).\nCHAPTER IV\nGENERAL PRINCIPLES CONCERNING THE AUTHORISATION OF BIOCIDAL PRODUCTS\nArticle 17\nMaking available on the market and use of biocidal products\n1.   Biocidal products shall not be made available on the market or used unless authorised in accordance with this Regulation.\n2.   Applications for authorisation shall be made by, or on behalf of, the prospective authorisation holder.\nApplications for national authorisation in a Member State shall be submitted to the competent authority of that Member State (‘the receiving competent authority’).\nApplications for Union authorisation shall be submitted to the Agency.\n3.   An authorisation may be granted for a single biocidal product or a biocidal product family.\n4.   An authorisation shall be granted for a maximum period of 10 years.\n5.   Biocidal products shall be used in compliance with the terms and conditions of the authorisation stipulated in accordance with Article 22(1) and the labelling and packaging requirements laid down in Article 69.\nProper use shall involve the rational application of a combination of physical, biological, chemical or other measures as appropriate, whereby the use of biocidal products is limited to the minimum necessary and appropriate precautionary steps are taken.\nMember States shall take necessary measures to provide the public with appropriate information about the benefits and risks associated with biocidal products and ways of minimising their use.\n6.   The authorisation holder shall notify each competent authority that has granted a national authorisation for a biocidal product family of each product within the biocidal product family at least 30 days before placing it on the market, except where a particular product is explicitly identified in the authorisation or the variation in composition concerns only pigments, perfumes and dyes within the permitted variations. The notification shall indicate the exact composition, trade name and suffix to the authorisation number. In the case of a Union authorisation, the authorisation holder shall notify the Agency and the Commission.\n7.   The Commission shall, by means of an implementing act, specify procedures for the authorisation of the same biocidal products by the same or different enterprises under the same terms and conditions. That implementing act shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 82(3).\nArticle 18\nMeasures geared to the sustainable use of biocidal products\nBy 18 July 2015 the Commission shall, on the basis of experience gained with the application of this Regulation, submit to the European Parliament and the Council a report on how this Regulation is contributing to the sustainable use of biocidal products, including on the need to introduce additional measures, in particular for professional users, to reduce the risks posed to human health, animal health and the environment by biocidal products. That report shall, inter alia, examine:\n(a)\nthe promotion of best practices as a means of reducing the use of biocidal products to a minimum;\n(b)\nthe most effective approaches for monitoring the use of biocidal products;\n(c)\nthe development and application of integrated pest management principles with respect to the use of biocidal products;\n(d)\nthe risks posed by the use of biocidal products in specific areas such as schools, workplaces, kindergartens, public spaces, geriatric care centres or in the vicinity of surface water or groundwater and whether additional measures are needed to address those risks;\n(e)\nthe role that improved performance of the equipment used for applying biocidal products could play in sustainable use.\nOn basis of that report, the Commission shall, if appropriate, submit a proposal for adoption in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure.\nArticle 19\nConditions for granting an authorisation\n1.   A biocidal product other than those eligible for the simplified authorisation procedure in accordance with Article 25 shall be authorised provided the following conditions are met:\n(a)\nthe active substances are approved for the relevant product-type and any conditions specified for those active substances are met;\n(b)\nit is established, according to the common principles for the evaluation of dossiers for biocidal products laid down in Annex VI, that the biocidal product, when used as authorised and having regard to the factors referred to in paragraph 2 of this Article, fulfils the following criteria:\n(i)\nthe biocidal product is sufficiently effective;\n(ii)\nthe biocidal product has no unacceptable effects on the target organisms, in particular unacceptable resistance or cross-resistance or unnecessary suffering and pain for vertebrates;\n(iii)\nthe biocidal product has no immediate or delayed unacceptable effects itself, or as a result of its residues, on the health of humans, including that of vulnerable groups, or animals, directly or through drinking water, food, feed, air, or through other indirect effects;\n(iv)\nthe biocidal product has no unacceptable effects itself, or as a result of its residues, on the environment, having particular regard to the following considerations:\n—\nthe fate and distribution of the biocidal product in the environment,\n—\ncontamination of surface waters (including estuarial and seawater), groundwater and drinking water, air and soil, taking into account locations distant from its use following long-range environmental transportation,\n—\nthe impact of the biocidal product on non-target organisms,\n—\nthe impact of the biocidal product on biodiversity and the ecosystem;\n(c)\nthe chemical identity, quantity and technical equivalence of active substances in the biocidal product and, where appropriate, any toxicologically or ecotoxicologically significant and relevant impurities and non-active substances, and its residues of toxicological or environmental significance, which result from uses to be authorised, can be determined according to the relevant requirements in Annexes II and III;\n(d)\nthe physical and chemical properties of the biocidal product have been determined and deemed acceptable for the purposes of the appropriate use and transport of the product;\n(e)\nwhere appropriate, maximum residue limits for food and feed have been established with respect to active substances contained in a biocidal product in accordance with Council Regulation (EEC) No 315/93 of 8 February 1993 laying down Community procedures for contaminants in food (42), Regulation (EC) No 1935/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 October 2004 on materials and articles intended to come into contact with food (43), Regulation (EC) No 396/2005 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 February 2005 on maximum residue levels of pesticides in or on food and feed of plant and animal origin (44), Regulation (EC) No 470/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 May 2009 laying down Community procedures for the establishment of residue limits of pharmacologically active substances in foodstuffs of animal origin (45) or Directive 2002/32/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 7 May 2002 on undesirable substances in animal feed (46);\n(f)\nwhere nanomaterials are used in that product, the risk to human health, animal health and the environment has been assessed separately.\n2.   The evaluation of whether a biocidal product fulfils the criteria set out in point (b) of paragraph 1 shall take into account the following factors:\n(a)\nrealistic worst case conditions under which the biocidal product may be used;\n(b)\nthe way in which treated articles treated with the biocidal product or containing the biocidal product may be used;\n(c)\nthe consequences of use and disposal of the biocidal product;\n(d)\ncumulative effects;\n(e)\nsynergistic effects.\n3.   A biocidal product shall only be authorised for uses for which relevant information has been submitted in accordance with Article 20.\n4.   A biocidal product shall not be authorised for making available on the market for use by the general public where:\n(a)\nit meets the criteria according to Directive 1999/45/EC for classification as:\n—\ntoxic or very toxic,\n—\na category 1 or 2 carcinogen,\n—\na category 1 or 2 mutagen, or\n—\ntoxic for reproduction category 1 or 2;\n(b)\nit meets the criteria according to Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008 for classification as:\n—\nacute oral toxicity category 1 or 2 or 3,\n—\nacute dermal toxicity category 1 or 2 or 3,\n—\nacute inhalation toxicity (gases and dust/mist) category 1 or 2 or 3,\n—\nacute inhalation toxicity (vapours) category 1 or 2,\n—\na category 1A or 1B carcinogen,\n—\na category 1A or 1B mutagen, or\n—\ntoxic for reproduction category 1A or 1B;\n(c)\nit meets the criteria for being PBT or vPvB in accordance with Annex XIII to Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006;\n(d)\nit has endocrine-disrupting properties; or\n(e)\nit has developmental neurotoxic or immunotoxic effects.\n5.   Notwithstanding paragraphs 1 and 4, a biocidal product may be authorised when the conditions laid down in paragraph 1(b)(iii) and (iv) are not fully met, or may be authorised for making available on the market for use by the general public when the criteria referred to in paragraph 4(c) are met, where not authorising the biocidal product would result in disproportionate negative impacts for society when compared to the risks to human health, animal health or the environment arising from the use of the biocidal product under the conditions laid down in the authorisation.\nThe use of a biocidal product authorised pursuant to this paragraph shall be subject to appropriate risk mitigation measures to ensure that exposure of humans and the environment to that biocidal product is minimised. The use of a biocidal product authorised pursuant to this paragraph shall be restricted to Member States in which the condition of the first subparagraph is met.\n6.   In the case of a biocidal product family, a reduction in the percentage of one or more active substances may be allowed, and/or a variation in percentage of one or more non-active substances, and/or the replacement of one or more non-active substances by other specified substances presenting the same or lower risk. The classification, hazard and precautionary statements for each product within the biocidal product family shall be the same (with the exception of a biocidal product family comprising a concentrate for professional use and ready-for-use products obtained through dilution of that concentrate).\nA biocidal product family shall be authorised only if all the biocidal products within it, taking into account the permitted variations referred to in the first subparagraph, are expected to comply with the conditions set out in paragraph 1.\n7.   Where appropriate, the prospective authorisation holder or its representative shall apply for the establishment of maximum residue limits with respect to active substances contained in a biocidal product in accordance with Regulation (EEC) No 315/93, Regulation (EC) No 1935/2004, Regulation (EC) No 396/2005, Regulation (EC) No 470/2009 or Directive 2002/32/EC.\n8.   Where, for active substances covered by Article 10(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 470/2009, no maximum residue limit has been established in accordance with Article 9 of that Regulation at the time of the approval of the active substance, or where a limit established in accordance with Article 9 of that Regulation needs to be amended, the maximum residue limit shall be established or amended in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 10(1)(b) of that Regulation.\n9.   Where a biocidal product is intended for direct application to the external parts of the human body (epidermis, hair system, nails, lips and external genital organs), or to the teeth and the mucous membranes of the oral cavity, it shall not contain any non-active substance that may not be included in a cosmetic product pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 1223/2009.\nArticle 20\nRequirements for applications for authorisation\n1.   The applicant for an authorisation shall submit the following documents together with the application:\n(a)\nfor biocidal products other than biocidal products meeting the conditions laid down in Article 25:\n(i)\na dossier or letter of access for the biocidal product satisfying the requirements set out in Annex III;\n(ii)\na summary of the biocidal product characteristics including the information referred to in points (a), (b) and (e) to (q) of Article 22(2), as applicable;\n(iii)\na dossier or a letter of access for the biocidal product satisfying the requirements set out in Annex II for each active substance in the biocidal product;\n(b)\nfor biocidal products that the applicant considers meet the conditions laid down in Article 25:\n(i)\na summary of the biocidal product characteristics as referred to in point (a)(ii) of this paragraph;\n(ii)\nefficacy data; and\n(iii)\nany other relevant information in support of the conclusion that the biocidal product meets the conditions laid down in Article 25.\n2.   The receiving competent authority may require that applications for national authorisation be submitted in one or more of the official languages of the Member State where that competent authority is situated.\n3.   For applications for Union authorisations submitted under Article 43, the applicant shall submit the summary of the biocidal product characteristics referred to in point (ii) of paragraph (1)(a) of this Article in one of the official languages of the Union accepted by the evaluating competent authority at the time of application and in all official languages of the Union before the authorisation of the biocidal product.\nArticle 21\nWaiving of data requirements\n1.   By way of derogation from Article 20, the applicant need not provide data required under that Article where any of the following applies:\n(a)\nthe data are not necessary owing to the exposure associated with the proposed uses;\n(b)\nit is not scientifically necessary to supply the data; or\n(c)\nit is not technically possible to generate the data.\n2.   The applicant may propose to adapt the data requirements of Article 20 in accordance with Annex IV. The justification for the proposed adaptations to the data requirements shall be clearly stated in the application with reference to the specific rules in Annex IV.\n3.   In order to ensure the harmonised application of paragraph 1(a) of this Article, the Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 83 specifying criteria for defining when the exposure associated with the proposed uses would justify adapting the data requirements of Article 20.\nArticle 22\nContent of authorisation\n1.   An authorisation shall stipulate the terms and conditions relating to the making available on the market and use of the single biocidal product or the biocidal product family and include a summary of the biocidal product characteristics.\n2.   Without prejudice to Articles 66 and 67, the summary of the biocidal product characteristics for a single biocidal product or, in the case of a biocidal product family, the biocidal products within that biocidal product family, shall include the following information:\n(a)\ntrade name of the biocidal product;\n(b)\nname and address of the authorisation holder;\n(c)\ndate of the authorisation and its date of expiry;\n(d)\nauthorisation number of the biocidal product, together with, in the case of a biocidal product family, the suffixes to apply to individual biocidal products within the biocidal product family;\n(e)\nqualitative and quantitative composition in terms of the active substances and non-active substances, knowledge of which is essential for proper use of biocidal products; and in the case of a biocidal product family, the quantitative composition shall indicate a minimum and maximum percentage for each active and non-active substance, where the minimum percentage indicated for certain substances may be 0 %;\n(f)\nmanufacturers of the biocidal product (names and addresses including location of manufacturing sites);\n(g)\nmanufacturers of the active substances (names and addresses including location of manufacturing sites);\n(h)\ntype of formulation of the biocidal product;\n(i)\nhazard and precautionary statements;\n(j)\nproduct-type and, where relevant, an exact description of the authorised use;\n(k)\ntarget harmful organisms;\n(l)\napplication doses and instructions for use;\n(m)\ncategories of users;\n(n)\nparticulars of likely direct or indirect adverse effects and first aid instructions and emergency measures to protect the environment;\n(o)\ninstructions for safe disposal of the product and its packaging;\n(p)\nconditions of storage and shelf-life of the biocidal product under normal conditions of storage;\n(q)\nwhere relevant, other information about the biocidal product.\nArticle 23\nComparative assessment of biocidal products\n1.   The receiving competent authority or, in the case of an evaluation of an application for a Union authorisation, the evaluating competent authority, shall perform a comparative assessment as part of the evaluation of an application for authorisation or for renewal of authorisation of a biocidal product containing an active substance that is a candidate for substitution in accordance with Article 10(1).\n2.   The results of the comparative assessment shall be forwarded, without delay, to the competent authorities of other Member States and the Agency and, in the case of evaluation of an application for a Union authorisation, also to the Commission.\n3.   The receiving competent authority or, in the case of a decision on an application for a Union authorisation, the Commission shall prohibit or restrict the making available on the market or the use of a biocidal product containing an active substance that is a candidate for substitution where the comparative assessment in accordance with Annex VI (‘comparative assessment’) demonstrates that both of the following criteria are met:\n(a)\nfor the uses specified in the application, another authorised biocidal product or a non-chemical control or prevention method already exists which presents a significantly lower overall risk for human health, animal health and the environment, is sufficiently effective and presents no other significant economic or practical disadvantages;\n(b)\nthe chemical diversity of the active substances is adequate to minimise the occurrence of resistance in the target harmful organism.\n4.   By way of derogation from paragraph 1, a biocidal product containing an active substance that is a candidate for substitution may be authorised for a period of up to four years without comparative assessment in exceptional cases where it is necessary to acquire experience first through using that product in practice.\n5.   Where the comparative assessment involves a question which, by reason of its scale or consequences, would be better addressed at Union level, in particular where it is relevant to two or more competent authorities, the receiving competent authority may refer the question to the Commission for a decision. The Commission shall adopt that decision by means of implementing acts in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 82(3).\nThe Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 83 specifying the criteria for determining when comparative assessments involve questions better addressed at Union level and the procedures for such comparative assessments.\n6.   Notwithstanding Article 17(4), and without prejudice to paragraph 4 of this Article, an authorisation for a biocidal product containing an active substance that is a candidate for substitution shall be granted for a period not exceeding five years and renewed for a period not exceeding five years.\n7.   Where it is decided not to authorise or to restrict the use of a biocidal product pursuant to paragraph 3, that cancellation or amendment of the authorisation shall take effect four years after that decision. However, where the approval of the active substance which is a candidate for substitution expires on an earlier date, the cancellation of the authorisation shall take effect on that earlier date.\nArticle 24\nTechnical guidance notes\nThe Commission shall draw up technical guidance notes to facilitate the implementation of this Chapter and, in particular, Article 22(2) and Article 23(3).\nCHAPTER V\nSIMPLIFIED AUTHORISATION PROCEDURE\nArticle 25\nEligibility for the simplified authorisation procedure\nFor eligible biocidal products, an application for authorisation may be made under a simplified authorisation procedure. A biocidal product shall be eligible if all the following conditions are met:\n(a)\nall the active substances contained in the biocidal product appear in Annex I and satisfy any restriction specified in that Annex;\n(b)\nthe biocidal product does not contain any substance of concern;\n(c)\nthe biocidal product does not contain any nanomaterials;\n(d)\nthe biocidal product is sufficiently effective; and\n(e)\nthe handling of the biocidal product and its intended use do not require personal protective equipment.\nArticle 26\nApplicable procedure\n1.   Applicants seeking the authorisation of a biocidal product meeting the conditions of Article 25 shall submit an application to the Agency, informing it of the name of the competent authority of the Member State that it proposes should evaluate the application and providing written confirmation that that competent authority agrees to do so. That competent authority shall be the evaluating competent authority.\n2.   The evaluating competent authority shall inform the applicant of the fees payable under Article 80(2) and shall reject the application if the applicant fails to pay the fees within 30 days. It shall inform the applicant accordingly.\nUpon receipt of the fees payable under Article 80(2), the evaluating competent authority shall accept the application and inform the applicant accordingly, indicating the date of the acceptance.\n3.   Within 90 days of accepting an application, the evaluating competent authority shall authorise the biocidal product if satisfied that the product meets the conditions laid down in Article 25.\n4.   Where the evaluating competent authority considers that the application is incomplete, it shall inform the applicant as to what additional information is required and shall set a reasonable time limit for the submission of that information. That time limit shall not normally exceed 90 days.\nThe evaluating competent authority shall, within 90 days of receipt of the additional information, authorise the biocidal product if satisfied, on the basis of the additional information submitted, that the product meets the conditions laid down in Article 25.\nThe evaluating competent authority shall reject the application if the applicant fails to submit the requested information within the deadline and shall inform the applicant accordingly. In such cases, where fees have been paid, part of the fees paid in accordance with Article 80(2) shall be reimbursed.\nArticle 27\nMaking available on the market of biocidal products authorised in accordance with the simplified authorisation procedure\n1.   A biocidal product authorised in accordance with Article 26 may be made available on the market in all Member States without the need for mutual recognition. However, the authorisation holder shall notify each Member State no later than 30 days before placing the biocidal product on the market within the territory of that Member State and shall use the official language or languages of that Member State in the product’s labelling, unless that Member State provides otherwise.\n2.   Where a Member State other than that of the evaluating competent authority considers that a biocidal product authorised in accordance with Article 26 has not been notified or labelled in accordance with paragraph 1 of this Article or does not meet the requirements of Article 25, it may refer that matter to the coordination group established in accordance with Article 35(1). Article 35(3) and Article 36 shall apply mutatis mutandis.\nWhere a Member State has valid reasons to consider that a biocidal product authorised in accordance with Article 26 does not meet the criteria laid down in Article 25 and a decision pursuant to Articles 35 and 36 has not yet been taken, that Member State may provisionally restrict or prohibit making available on the market or use of that product on its territory.\nArticle 28\nAmendment of Annex I\n1.   The Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 83 amending Annex I, after receiving the opinion of the Agency, in order to include active substances provided that there is evidence that they do not give rise to concern according to paragraph 2 of this Article.\n2.   Active substances give rise to concern where:\n(a)\nthey meet the criteria for classification according to Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008 as:\n—\nexplosive/highly flammable,\n—\norganic peroxide,\n—\nacutely toxic of category 1, 2 or 3,\n—\ncorrosive of category 1A, 1B or 1C,\n—\nrespiratory sensitiser,\n—\nskin sensitiser,\n—\ngerm cell mutagen of category 1 or 2;\n—\ncarcinogen of category 1 or 2,\n—\nhuman reproductive toxicant of category 1 or 2 or with effects on or via lactation,\n—\nspecific target organ toxicant by single or repeated exposure, or\n—\ntoxic to aquatic life of acute category 1;\n(b)\nthey fulfil any of the substitution criteria set out in Article 10(1); or\n(c)\nthey have neurotoxic or immunotoxic properties.\nActive substances also give rise to concern, even if none of the specific criteria in points (a) to (c) are met, where a level of concern equivalent to that arising from points (a) to (c) can be reasonably demonstrated based on reliable information.\n3.   The Commission shall also be empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 83 amending Annex I, after receiving the opinion of the Agency, in order to restrict or to remove the entry for an active substance if there is evidence that biocidal products containing that substance do not, in certain circumstances, satisfy the conditions set out in paragraph 1 of this Article or in Article 25. Where imperative grounds of urgency so require, the procedure provided for in Article 84 shall apply to delegated acts adopted pursuant to this paragraph.\n4.   The Commission shall apply paragraph 1 or 3 at its own initiative or at the request of an economic operator or a Member State providing the necessary evidence as referred to in those paragraphs.\nWhenever the Commission amends Annex I it shall adopt a separate delegated act in respect of each substance.\n5.   The Commission may adopt implementing acts further specifying the procedures to be followed with respect to an amendment of Annex I. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 82(3).\nCHAPTER VI\nNATIONAL AUTHORISATIONS OF BIOCIDAL PRODUCTS\nArticle 29\nSubmission and validation of applications\n1.   Applicants wishing to apply for a national authorisation in accordance with Article 17 shall submit an application to the receiving competent authority. The receiving competent authority shall inform the applicant of the fees payable under Article 80(2), and shall reject the application if the applicant fails to pay the fees within 30 days. It shall inform the applicant accordingly. Upon receipt of the fees payable under Article 80(2), the receiving competent authority shall accept the application and inform the applicant accordingly, indicating the date of the acceptance.\n2.   Within 30 days of acceptance, the receiving competent authority shall validate the application if it complies with the following requirements:\n(a)\nthe relevant information referred to in Article 20 has been submitted; and\n(b)\nthe applicant states that it has not applied to any other competent authority for a national authorisation for the same biocidal product for the same use(s).\nIn the context of the validation referred to in the first subparagraph, the receiving competent authority shall not make an assessment of the quality or the adequacy of the data or justifications submitted.\n3.   Where the receiving competent authority considers that the application is incomplete, it shall inform the applicant as to what additional information is required for the validation of the application and shall set a reasonable time limit for the submission of that information. That time limit shall not normally exceed 90 days.\nThe receiving competent authority shall, within 30 days of receipt of the additional information, validate the application if it determines that the additional information submitted is sufficient to comply with the requirements laid down in paragraph 2.\nThe receiving competent authority shall reject the application if the applicant fails to submit the requested information within the deadline and shall inform the applicant accordingly.\n4.   Where the Register for Biocidal Products referred to in Article 71 shows that a competent authority other than the receiving competent authority is examining an application relating to the same biocidal product or has already authorised the same biocidal product, the receiving competent authority shall decline to evaluate the application. In that event, the receiving competent authority shall inform the applicant of the possibility of seeking mutual recognition in accordance with Article 33 or 34.\n5.   If paragraph 3 does not apply and the receiving competent authority considers that the application is complete, it shall validate the application and without delay inform the applicant accordingly, indicating the date of the validation.\nArticle 30\nEvaluation of applications\n1.   The receiving competent authority shall, within 365 days of the validation of an application in accordance with Article 29, decide whether to grant an authorisation in accordance with Article 19. It shall take into account the results of the comparative assessment carried out in accordance with Article 23, if applicable.\n2.   Where it appears that additional information is necessary to carry out the evaluation, the receiving competent authority shall ask the applicant to submit such information within a specified time limit.

A biocidal product shall be considered as identical to the reference product only if all the following conditions are met:\n(a)\nthey have been manufactured by the same company, by an associated undertaking or under license in accordance with the same manufacturing process;\n(b)\nthey are identical in specification and content in respect of the active substances and the type of formulation;\n(c)\nthey are the same in respect of the non-active substances present; and\n(d)\nthey are either the same or equivalent in packaging size, material or form, in terms of the potential adverse impact on the safety of the product with regard to human health, animal health or the environment.\n4.   An application for a parallel trade permit shall include the following information and items:\n(a)\nname and authorisation number of the biocidal product in the Member State of origin;\n(b)\nname and address of the competent authority of the Member State of origin;\n(c)\nname and address of the authorisation holder in the Member State of origin;\n(d)\noriginal label and instructions for use with which the biocidal product is distributed in the Member State of origin if it is considered as necessary for the examination by the competent authority of the Member State of introduction;\n(e)\nname and address of the applicant;\n(f)\nname to be given to the biocidal product to be distributed in the Member State of introduction;\n(g)\na draft label for the biocidal product intended to be made available on the market in the Member State of introduction in the official language or languages of the Member State of introduction, unless that Member State provides otherwise;\n(h)\na sample of the biocidal product which is intended to be introduced if it is considered as necessary by the competent authority of the Member State of introduction;\n(i)\nname and authorisation number of the reference product in the Member State of introduction.\nThe competent authority of the Member State of introduction may require a translation of the relevant parts of the original instructions for the use referred to in point (d).\n5.   The parallel trade permit shall prescribe the same conditions for making available on the market and use as the authorisation of the reference product.\n6.   The parallel trade permit shall be valid for the duration of authorisation of the reference product in the Member State of introduction.\nIf the authorisation holder of the reference product applies for cancellation of authorisation in accordance with Article 49 and the requirements of Article 19 are still fulfilled, the validity of the parallel trade permit shall expire on the date on which the authorisation of the reference product would normally have expired.\n7.   Without prejudice to specific provisions in this Article, Articles 47 to 50 and Chapter XV shall apply mutatis mutandis to biocidal products made available on the market under a parallel trade permit.\n8.   The competent authority of the Member State of introduction may withdraw a parallel trade permit if the authorisation of the introduced biocidal product is withdrawn in the Member State of origin because of safety or efficacy reasons.\nCHAPTER XI\nTECHNICAL EQUIVALENCE\nArticle 54\nAssessment of technical equivalence\n1.   Where it is necessary to establish the technical equivalence of active substances, the person seeking to establish that equivalence (‘the applicant’) shall submit an application to the Agency and pay the applicable fees in accordance with Article 80(1).\n2.   The applicant shall submit all data that the Agency requires to assess technical equivalence.\n3.   The Agency shall inform the applicant of the fees payable under Article 80(1), and shall reject the application if the applicant fails to pay the fees within 30 days. It shall inform the applicant and the evaluating competent authority accordingly.\n4.   After giving the applicant the opportunity to submit comments, the Agency shall take a decision within 90 days of receipt of the application referred to in paragraph 1 and shall communicate it to Member States and to the applicant.\n5.   Where, in the opinion of the Agency, additional information is necessary to carry out the assessment of technical equivalence, the Agency shall ask the applicant to submit such information within a time limit specified by the Agency. The Agency shall reject the application if the applicant fails to submit the additional information within the specified time limit. The 90-day period referred to in paragraph 4 shall be suspended from the date of issue of the request until the information is received. The suspension shall not exceed 180 days except where justified by the nature of the data requested or in exceptional circumstances.\n6.   Where appropriate, the Agency may consult the competent authority of the Member State which acted as the evaluating competent authority for the evaluation of the active substance.\n7.   An appeal may be brought, in accordance with Article 77, against decisions of the Agency under paragraphs 3, 4 and 5 of this Article.\n8.   The Agency shall draw up technical guidance notes to facilitate the implementation of this Article.\nCHAPTER XII\nDEROGATIONS\nArticle 55\nDerogation from the requirements\n1.   By way of derogation from Articles 17 and 19, a competent authority may permit, for a period not exceeding 180 days, the making available on the market or use of a biocidal product which does not fulfil the conditions for authorisation laid down in this Regulation, for a limited and controlled use under the supervision of the competent authority, if such a measure is necessary because of a danger to public health, animal health or the environment which cannot be contained by other means.\nThe competent authority referred to in the first subparagraph shall, without delay, inform the other competent authorities and the Commission of its action and the justification for it. The competent authority shall, without delay, inform the other competent authorities and the Commission of the revocation of such action.\nOn receipt of a reasoned request from the competent authority, the Commission shall, without delay and by means of implementing acts, decide whether, and under what conditions, the action taken by that competent authority may be extended, for a period not exceeding 550 days. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 82(3).\n2.   By way of derogation from point (a) of Article 19(1) and until an active substance is approved, competent authorities and the Commission may authorise, for a period not exceeding three years, a biocidal product containing a new active substance.\nSuch a provisional authorisation may be issued only if, after dossiers have been evaluated in accordance with Article 8, the evaluating competent authority has submitted a recommendation for approval of the new active substance and the competent authorities which received the application for the provisional authorisation or, in the case of a provisional Union authorisation, the Agency, consider that the biocidal product is expected to comply with points (b), (c) and (d) of Article 19(1) taking into account the factors set out in Article 19(2).\nIf the Commission decides not to approve the new active substance, the competent authorities which granted the provisional authorisation or the Commission shall cancel that authorisation.\nWhere a decision on the approval of the new active substance has not yet been adopted by the Commission when the period of three years expires, the competent authorities which granted the provisional authorisation, or the Commission, may extend the provisional authorisation for a period not exceeding one year, provided that there are good reasons to believe that the active substance will satisfy the conditions laid down in Article 4(1) or, where applicable, the conditions set out in Article 5(2). Competent authorities which extend the provisional authorisation shall inform the other competent authorities and the Commission of such action.\n3.   By way of derogation from point (a) of Article 19(1), the Commission may, by means of implementing acts, allow a Member State to authorise a biocidal product containing a non-approved active substance if it is satisfied that that active substance is essential for the protection of cultural heritage and that no appropriate alternatives are available. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the advisory procedure referred to in Article 82(2). A Member State wishing to obtain such a derogation shall apply to the Commission, providing due justification.\nArticle 56\nResearch and development\n1.   By way of derogation from Article 17, an experiment or a test for the purposes of research or development involving an unauthorised biocidal product or a non-approved active substance intended exclusively for use in a biocidal product (‘experiment’ or ‘test’) may take place only under the conditions laid down in this Article.\nPersons carrying out an experiment or test shall draw up and maintain written records detailing the identity of the biocidal product or active substance, labelling data, quantities supplied and the names and addresses of those persons receiving the biocidal product or active substance, and shall compile a dossier containing all available data on possible effects on human or animal health or impact on the environment. They shall make this information available to the competent authority on request.\n2.   Any person intending to carry out an experiment or test that may involve, or result in, release of the biocidal product into the environment shall first notify the competent authority of the Member State where the experiment or test will occur. The notification shall include the identity of the biocidal product or active substance, labelling data and quantities supplied, and all available data on possible effects on human or animal health or impact on the environment. The person concerned shall make available any other information requested by the competent authorities.\nIn the absence of an opinion from the competent authority within 45 days of the notification referred to in the first subparagraph, the notified experiment or test may take place.\n3.   If the experiments or tests could have harmful effects, whether immediate or delayed, on the health of humans, particularly of vulnerable groups, or animals, or any unacceptable adverse effect on humans, animals or the environment, the relevant competent authority of the Member State concerned may prohibit them or allow them subject to such conditions as it considers necessary to prevent those consequences. The competent authority shall, without delay, inform the Commission and other competent authorities of its decision.\n4.   The Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 83 specifying detailed rules supplementing this Article.\nArticle 57\nExemption from registration under Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006\nIn addition to the active substances referred to in Article 15(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006, active substances manufactured or imported for use in biocidal products authorised for placing on the market in accordance with Article 27, 55 or 56 shall be regarded as being registered and the registration as completed for manufacture or import for use in a biocidal product and therefore as fulfilling the requirements of Chapters 1 and 5, Title II of Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006.\nCHAPTER XIII\nTREATED ARTICLES\nArticle 58\nPlacing on the market of treated articles\n1.   This Article shall apply exclusively to treated articles that are not biocidal products. It shall not apply to treated articles where the sole treatment undertaken was the fumigation or disinfection of premises or containers used for storage or transport and where no residues are expected to remain from such treatment.\n2.   A treated article shall not be placed on the market unless all active substances contained in the biocidal products that it was treated with or incorporates are included in the list drawn up in accordance with Article 9(2), for the relevant product-type and use, or in Annex I, and any conditions or restrictions specified therein are met.\n3.   The person responsible for the placing on the market of such a treated article shall ensure that the label provides the information listed in the second subparagraph, where:\n—\nin the case of a treated article containing a biocidal product, a claim is made by the manufacturer of that treated article regarding the biocidal properties of the article, or\n—\nin relation to the active substance(s) concerned, having particular regard to the possibility of contact with humans or the release into the environment, the conditions associated with the approval of the active substance(s) so require.\nThe label referred to in the first subparagraph shall provide the following information:\n(a)\na statement that the treated article incorporates biocidal products;\n(b)\nwhere substantiated, the biocidal property attributed to the treated article;\n(c)\nwithout prejudice to Article 24 of Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008, the name of all active substances contained in the biocidal products;\n(d)\nthe name of all nanomaterials contained in the biocidal products, followed by the word ‘nano’ in brackets;\n(e)\nany relevant instructions for use, including any precautions to be taken because of the biocidal products with which a treated article was treated or which it incorporates.\nThis paragraph shall not apply where at least equivalent labelling requirements already exist under sector-specific legislation for biocidal products in treated articles to meet information requirements concerning those active substances.\n4.   Notwithstanding the labelling requirements set out in paragraph 3, the person responsible for the placing on the market of a treated article shall label it with any relevant instructions for use, including any precautions to be taken, if this is necessary to protect humans, animals and the environment.\n5.   Notwithstanding the labelling requirements set out in paragraph 3, the supplier of a treated article shall, where a consumer so requests, provide that consumer, within 45 days, free of charge, with information on the biocidal treatment of the treated article.\n6.   The labelling shall be clearly visible, easily legible and appropriately durable. Where necessary because of the size or the function of the treated article, the labelling shall be printed on the packaging, on the instructions for use or on the warranty in the official language or languages of the Member State of introduction, unless that Member State provides otherwise. In the case of treated articles that are not produced as part of a series but rather designed and manufactured to meet a specific order, the manufacturer may agree other methods of providing the customer with the relevant information.\n7.   The Commission may adopt implementing acts for the application of paragraph 2 of this Article, including appropriate notification procedures, possibly involving the Agency, and further specifying the labelling requirements under paragraphs 3, 4 and 6 of this Article. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 82(3).\n8.   Where there are significant indications that an active substance contained in a biocidal product with which a treated article is treated or which it incorporates does not meet the conditions laid down in Article 4(1), Article 5(2) or Article 25, the Commission shall review the approval of that active substance or its inclusion in Annex I in accordance with Article 15(1) or Article 28(2).\nCHAPTER XIV\nDATA PROTECTION AND DATA-SHARING\nArticle 59\nProtection of data held by competent authorities or the Agency\n1.   Without prejudice to Articles 62 and 63, data submitted for the purposes of Directive 98/8/EC or of this Regulation shall not be used by competent authorities or the Agency for the benefit of a subsequent applicant, except where:\n(a)\nthe subsequent applicant submits a letter of access; or\n(b)\nthe relevant time limit for data protection has expired.\n2.   When submitting data to a competent authority or to the Agency for the purposes of this Regulation the applicant shall, where relevant, indicate the name and contact details of the data owner for all data submitted. The applicant shall also specify whether it is the data owner or holds a letter of access.\n3.   The applicant shall, without delay, inform the competent authority or the Agency about any changes to the ownership of the data.\n4.   The advisory scientific committees set up under Commission Decision 2004/210/EC of 3 March 2004 setting up Scientific Committees in the field of consumer safety, public health and the environment (47) shall also have access to the data referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article.\nArticle 60\nData protection periods\n1.   Data submitted for the purposes of Directive 98/8/EC or of this Regulation shall benefit from data protection under the conditions laid down in this Article. The protection period for the data shall start when they are submitted for the first time.\nData protected under this Article or for which the protection period under this Article has expired shall not be protected again.\n2.   The protection period for data submitted with a view to the approval of an existing active substance shall end 10 years from the first day of the month following the date of adoption of a decision in accordance with Article 9 on the approval of the relevant active substance for the particular product-type.\nThe protection period for data submitted with a view to the approval of a new active substance shall end 15 years from the first day of the month following the date of adoption of a decision in accordance with Article 9 on the approval of the relevant active substance for the particular product-type.\nThe protection period for new data submitted with a view to the renewal or review of the approval of an active substance shall end five years from the first day of the month following the date of the adoption of a decision in accordance with Article 14(4) concerning the renewal or the review.\n3.   The protection period for data submitted with a view to the authorisation of a biocidal product containing only existing active substances shall end 10 years from the first day of the month following the first decision concerning the authorisation of the product taken in accordance with Article 30(4), Article 34(6) or Article 44(4).\nThe protection period for data submitted with a view to the authorisation of a biocidal product containing a new active substance shall end 15 years from the first day of the month following the first decision concerning the authorisation of the product taken in accordance with Article 30(4), Article 34(6) or Article 44(4).\nThe protection period for new data submitted with a view to the renewal or amendment of the authorisation of a biocidal product shall end five years from the first day of the month following the decision concerning the renewal or amendment of the authorisation.\nArticle 61\nLetter of access\n1.   A letter of access shall contain at least the following information:\n(a)\nthe name and contact details of the data owner and the beneficiary;\n(b)\nthe name of the active substance or biocidal product for which access to the data is authorised;\n(c)\nthe date on which the letter of access takes effect;\n(d)\na list of the submitted data to which the letter of access grants citation rights.\n2.   Revocation of a letter of access shall not affect the validity of the authorisation issued on the basis of the letter of access in question.\nArticle 62\nData sharing\n1.   In order to avoid animal testing, testing on vertebrates for the purposes of this Regulation shall be undertaken only as a last resort. Testing on vertebrates shall not be repeated for the purposes of this Regulation.\n2.   Any person intending to perform tests or studies (‘the prospective applicant’)\n(a)\nshall, in the case of data involving tests on vertebrates; and\n(b)\nmay, in the case of data not involving tests on vertebrates,\nsubmit a written request to the Agency to determine whether such tests or studies have already been submitted to the Agency or to a competent authority in connection with a previous application under this Regulation or Directive 98/8/EC. The Agency shall verify whether such tests or studies have already been submitted.\nWhere such tests or studies have already been submitted to the Agency or to a competent authority in connection with a previous application, under this Regulation or Directive 98/8/EC, the Agency shall, without delay, communicate the name and contact details of the data submitter and data owner to the prospective applicant.\nThe data submitter shall, where relevant, facilitate contacts between the prospective applicant and the data owner.\nWhere the data acquired under those tests or studies are still protected under Article 60, the prospective applicant:\n(a)\nshall, in the case of data involving tests on vertebrates; and\n(b)\nmay, in the case of data not involving tests on vertebrates,\nrequest from the data owner all the scientific and technical data related to the tests and studies concerned as well as the right to refer to these data when submitting applications under this Regulation.\nArticle 63\nCompensation for data sharing\n1.   Where a request has been made in accordance with Article 62(2), the prospective applicant and the data owner shall make every effort to reach an agreement on the sharing of the results of the tests or studies requested by the prospective applicant. Such an agreement may be replaced by submission of the matter to an arbitration body and a commitment to accept the arbitration order.\n2.   Where such agreement is reached, the data owner shall make all the scientific and technical data related to the tests and studies concerned available to the prospective applicant or shall give the prospective applicant permission to refer to the data owner’s tests or studies when submitting applications under this Regulation.\n3.   Where no agreement is reached with respect to data involving tests or studies on vertebrates, the prospective applicant shall inform the Agency and the data owner thereof, at the earliest one month after the prospective applicant receives the name and address of the data submitter from the Agency.\nWithin 60 days of being informed, the Agency shall give the prospective applicant permission to refer to the requested tests or studies on vertebrates, provided that the prospective applicant demonstrates that every effort has been made to reach an agreement and that the prospective applicant has paid the data owner a share of the costs incurred. Where the prospective applicant and data owner cannot agree, national courts shall decide on the proportionate share of the cost that the prospective applicant is to pay to the data owner.\nThe data owner shall not refuse to accept any payment offered pursuant to the second subparagraph. Any acceptance is without prejudice, however, to his right to have the proportionate share of the cost determined by a national court, in accordance with the second subparagraph.\n4.   Compensation for data sharing shall be determined in a fair, transparent and non-discriminatory manner, having regard to the guidance established by the Agency (48). The prospective applicant shall be required to share only in the costs of information that it is required to submit for the purposes of this Regulation.\n5.   An appeal may be brought, in accordance with Article 77, against decisions of the Agency under paragraph 3 of this Article.\nArticle 64\nUse of data for subsequent applications\n1.   Where the relevant data protection period according to Article 60 has expired in relation to an active substance, the receiving competent authority or the Agency may agree that a subsequent applicant for authorisation may refer to data provided by the first applicant in so far as the subsequent applicant can provide evidence that the active substance is technically equivalent to the active substance for which the data protection period has expired, including the degree of purity and the nature of any relevant impurities.\nWhere the relevant data protection period according to Article 60 has expired in relation to a biocidal product, the receiving competent authority or the Agency may agree that a subsequent applicant for authorisation may refer to data provided by the first applicant in so far as the subsequent applicant can provide evidence that the biocidal product is the same as the one already authorised, or the differences between them are not significant in relation to the risk assessment and the active substance(s) in the biocidal product are technically equivalent to those in the biocidal product already authorised, including the degree of purity and the nature of any impurities.\nAn appeal may be brought, in accordance with Article 77, against decisions of the Agency under the first and second subparagraphs of this paragraph.\n2.   Notwithstanding paragraph 1, subsequent applicants shall provide the following data accordingly to the receiving competent authority or the Agency, as applicable:\n(a)\nall necessary data for the identification of the biocidal product, including its composition;\n(b)\nthe data needed to identify the active substance and to establish technical equivalence of the active substance;\n(c)\nthe data needed to demonstrate the comparability of the risk from and efficacy of the biocidal product to that of the authorised biocidal product.\nCHAPTER XV\nINFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION\nSECTION 1\nMonitoring and reporting\nArticle 65\nCompliance with requirements\n1.   Member States shall make the necessary arrangements for the monitoring of biocidal products and treated articles which have been placed on the market to establish whether they comply with the requirements of this Regulation.

The data elements belonging to the CDS are considered as the basic data which should, in principle, be provided for all active substances. However, in some cases the physical or chemical properties of the substance may mean that it is impossible or unnecessary to provide specific data elements belonging to the CDS.\nWith regard to the ADS, the data elements to be provided for a specific active substance shall be determined by considering each of the ADS data elements indicated in this Annex taking into account, inter alia, the physical and chemical properties of the substance, existing data, information which is part of the CDS and the types of products in which the active substance will be used and the exposure patterns related to these uses.\nSpecific indications for the inclusion of some data elements are provided in column 1 of the Annex II table. The general considerations regarding adaptation of information requirements as set out in Annex IV shall also apply. In light of the importance of reducing testing on vertebrates, column 3 of the Annex II table gives specific indications for the adaptation of some of the data elements which might require the use of such tests on vertebrates. The information submitted shall, in any case, be sufficient to support a risk assessment demonstrating that the criteria referred to in Article 4(1) are met.\nThe applicant should consult the detailed technical guidance regarding the application of this Annex and the preparation of the dossier referred to in point (a) of Article 6(1), which is available on the website of the Agency.\nThe applicant has the obligation to initiate a pre-submission consultation. In addition to the obligation set down in Article 62(2), applicants may also consult with the competent authority that will evaluate the dossier with regard to the proposed information requirements and in particular the testing on vertebrates that the applicant proposes to carry out.\nAdditional information may need to be submitted if it is necessary to carry out the evaluation as indicated in Article 8(2).\n3.\nA detailed and full description of the studies conducted or referred to and of the methods used shall be included. It is important to ensure that the data available is relevant and is of sufficient quality to fulfil the requirements. Evidence should also be provided to demonstrate that the active substance upon which the tests have been carried out is the same as the substance for which the application has been submitted.\n4.\nThe formats made available by the Agency must be used for submission of the dossiers. In addition, IUCLID must be used for those parts of the dossiers to which IUCLID applies. Formats and further guidance on data requirements and dossier preparation are available on the website of the Agency.\n5.\nTests submitted for the purpose of the approval of an active substance shall be conducted according to the methods described in Commission Regulation (EC) No 440/2008 of 30 May 2008 laying down test methods pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council on the Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH) (1). However, if a method is inappropriate or not described, other methods shall be used which are scientifically appropriate, whenever possible internationally recognised, and their appropriateness must be justified in the application. When test methods are applied to nanomaterials, an explanation shall be provided of their scientific appropriateness for nanomaterials, and where applicable, of the technical adaptations/adjustments that have been made in order to respond to the specific characteristics of these materials.\n6.\nTests performed should comply with the relevant requirements of protection of laboratory animals, set out in Directive 2010/63/EU of the European Parliament and the Council of 22 September 2010 on the protection of animals used for scientific purposes (2) and in the case of ecotoxicological and toxicological tests, good laboratory practice, set out in Directive 2004/10/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 February 2004 on the harmonisation of laws, regulations and administrative provisions relating to the application of the principles of good laboratory practice and the verification of their application for tests on chemical substances (3) or other international standards recognised as being equivalent by the Commission or the Agency. Tests on physico-chemical properties and safety-relevant substance data should be performed at least according to international standards.\n7.\nWhere testing is done, a detailed description (specification) of the active substance used and its impurities must be provided. Testing should be performed with the active substance as manufactured or, in the case of some of the physical and chemical properties (see indications given in column I of the table), with a purified form of the active substance.\n8.\nWhere test data exist that have been generated before 1 September 2013 by methods other than those laid down in Regulation (EC) No 440/2008, the adequacy of such data for the purposes of this Regulation and the need to conduct new tests according to the Regulation (EC) No 440/2008 must be decided by the competent authority of the Member State concerned, on a case-by-case basis, taking into account, among other factors, the need to minimise testing on vertebrates.\n9.\nNew tests involving vertebrates shall be conducted as the last available option to comply with the data requirements set out in this Annex when all the other data sources have been exhausted. In-vivo testing with corrosive substances at concentration/dose levels causing corrosivity shall also be avoided.\nTITLE 1\nCHEMICAL SUBSTANCES\nCore data set and additional data set for active substances\nInformation required to support the approval of an active substance is listed in the table below.\nConditions for not requiring a specific test that are set out in the appropriate test methods in the Regulation (EC) No 440/2008 and are not repeated in column 3, also apply.\nColumn 1\nInformation required\nColumn 2\nAll data is CDS unless indicated as ADS\nColumn 3\nSpecific rules for adaptation from standard information concerning some of the information requirements that may require recourse to testing of vertebrates\n1.

The data elements belonging to the CDS are considered as the basic data which should, in principle, be provided for all biocidal products.\nWith regard to the ADS, the data elements to be provided for a specific biocidal product shall be determined by considering each of the ADS data elements indicated in this Annex taking into account, inter alia, the physical and chemical properties of the product, existing data, information which is part of the CDS and the types of products and the exposure patterns related to these uses.\nSpecific indications for the inclusion of some data elements are provided in column 1 of the Annex III table. The general considerations regarding adaptation of information requirements as set out in Annex IV to this Regulation shall also apply. In light of the importance of reducing testing on vertebrates, column 3 of the table gives specific indications for the adaptation of some of the data elements which might require the use of such tests on vertebrates.\nFor some of the information requirements set out in this Annex, it may be possible to satisfy these requirements based on available information of the properties of the active substance(s) contained in the product and the properties of non-active substance(s) included in the product. For non-active substances, applicants shall use the information provided to them in the context of Title IV of Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006, where relevant, and the information made available by the Agency in accordance with point (e) of Article 77(2) of that Regulation.\nThe relevant calculation methods used for the classification of mixtures as laid down in Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008 shall, where appropriate, be applied in the hazard assessment of the biocidal product. Such calculation methods shall not be used if, in relation to a particular hazard, synergistic and antagonistic effects between the different substances contained in the product are considered likely.\nDetailed technical guidance regarding the application of this Annex and the preparation of the dossier is available on the website of the Agency.\nThe applicant has the obligation to initiate a pre-submission consultation. In addition to the obligation set out in Article 62(2), applicants may also consult with the competent authority that will evaluate the dossier with regard to the proposed information requirements and in particular the testing on vertebrates that the applicant proposes to carry out.\nAdditional information may need to be submitted if necessary to carry out the evaluation as indicated in Article 29(3) or Article 44(2).\nThe information submitted shall, in any case, be sufficient to support a risk assessment demonstrating that the criteria in Article 19(1)(b) are met.\n3.\nA detailed and full description of studies conducted and of the methods used shall be included. It is important to ensure that the data available is relevant and is of sufficient quality to fulfil the requirements.\n4.\nThe formats made available by the Agency shall be used for submission of the dossiers. In addition, IUCLID shall be used for those parts of the dossiers to which IUCLID applies. Formats and further guidance on data requirements and dossier preparation are available on the Agency homepage.\n5.\nTests submitted for the purpose of authorisation shall be conducted according to the methods described in Regulation (EC) No 440/2008. However, if a method is inappropriate or not described, other methods shall be used which are scientifically appropriate, whenever possible internationally recognised, and their appropriateness must be justified in the application. When test methods are applied to nanomaterials, an explanation shall be provided of their scientific appropriateness for nanomaterials, and, where applicable, of the technical adaptations/adjustments that have been made in order to respond to the specific characteristics of these materials.\n6.\nTests performed should comply with the relevant requirements of protection of laboratory animals, set out in Directive 2010/63/EU and, in the case of ecotoxicological and toxicological tests, good laboratory practice, set out in Directive 2004/10/EC or other international standards recognised as being equivalent by the Commission or the Agency. Tests on physico-chemical properties and safety-relevant substance data should be performed at least according to international standards.\n7.\nWhere testing is done, a detailed quantitative and qualitative description (specification) of the product used for each test and its impurities must be provided.\n8.\nWhere test data exist that have been generated before 17 July 2012 by methods other than those laid down in Regulation (EC) No 440/2008, the adequacy of such data for the purposes of this Regulation and the need to conduct new tests according to the Regulation (EC) No 440/2008 must be decided by the competent authority of the Member State, on a case-by-case basis, taking into account, among other factors, the need to avoid unnecessary testing.\n9.\nNew tests involving vertebrates shall be conducted as the last available option to comply with the data requirements set out in this Annex when all the other data sources have been exhausted. In vivo testing with corrosive substances at concentration/dose levels causing corrosivity shall also be avoided.\nTITLE 1\nCHEMICAL PRODUCTS\nCore data set and additional data set for chemical products\nInformation required to support the authorisation of a biocidal product is listed in the table below.\nFor each information requirement set down in this Annex the indications given in columns 1 and 3 of Annex II for the same information requirement shall also apply.\nColumn 1\nInformation required:\nColumn 2\nAll data is CDS unless indicated as ADS\nColumn 3\nSpecific rules for adaptation from standard information concerning some of the information requirements that may require recourse to testing of vertebrates\n1.

TESTING DOES NOT APPEAR SCIENTIFICALLY NECESSARY\n1.1.   Use of existing data\n1.1.1.   Data on physical-chemical properties from experiments not carried out according to GLP or the relevant test methods.\nData shall be considered to be equivalent to data generated by the corresponding test methods if the following conditions are met:\n(1)\nadequacy of the data for the purpose of classification and labelling and risk assessment;\n(2)\nsufficient adequate and reliable documentation is provided to assess the equivalency of the study; and\n(3)\nthe data are valid for the endpoint being investigated and the study is performed using an acceptable level of quality assurance.\n1.1.2.   Data on human health and environmental properties from experiments not carried out according to GLP or the relevant test methods.\nData shall be considered to be equivalent to data generated by the corresponding test methods if the following conditions are met:\n(1)\nadequacy of the data for the purpose of classification and labelling and risk assessment;\n(2)\nadequate and reliable coverage of the key parameters/endpoints foreseen to be investigated in the corresponding test methods;\n(3)\nexposure duration comparable to or longer than the corresponding test methods if exposure duration is a relevant parameter;\n(4)\nadequate and reliable documentation of the study is provided; and\n(5)\nthe study is performed using a system of quality assurance.\n1.1.3.   Historical human data\nAs a general rule, in accordance with Article 7(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008, tests on humans shall not be performed for the purposes of this Regulation. However, existing historical human data, such as epidemiological studies on exposed populations, accidental or occupational exposure data, biomonitoring studies, clinical studies and human volunteer studies performed in accordance with internationally accepted ethical standards shall be considered.\nData collected on humans shall not be used to lower the safety margins resulting from tests or studies on animals.\nThe strength of the data for a specific human health effect depends, among other things, on the type of analysis and the parameters covered, and on the magnitude and specificity of the response and consequently the predictability of the effect. Criteria for assessing the adequacy of the data include:\n(1)\nthe proper selection and characterisation of the exposed and control groups;\n(2)\nadequate characterisation of exposure;\n(3)\nsufficient length of follow-up for disease occurrence;\n(4)\nvalid method for observing an effect;\n(5)\nproper consideration of bias and confounding factors; and\n(6)\na reasonable statistical reliability to justify the conclusion.\nIn all cases adequate and reliable documentation shall be provided.\n1.2.   Weight of evidence\nThere may be sufficient weight of evidence from several independent sources of information leading to the assumption/conclusion that a substance has or does not have a particular dangerous property, while the information from each single source alone is considered insufficient to support this notion. There may be sufficient weight of evidence from the use of positive results of newly developed test methods, not yet included in the relevant test methods or from an international test method recognised by the Commission as being equivalent, leading to the conclusion that a substance has a particular dangerous property. However, if the newly developed test method has been approved by the Commission, but has not yet been published, its results may be taken into account even where this leads to the conclusion that a substance does not have a particular dangerous property.\nWhere consideration of all the available data provides sufficient weight of evidence for the presence or absence of a particular dangerous property:\n—\nfurther testing on vertebrates for that property shall not be undertaken,\n—\nfurther testing not involving vertebrates may be omitted.\nIn all cases adequate and reliable documentation shall be provided.\n1.3.   Qualitative or Quantitative structure-activity relationship ((Q)SAR)\nResults obtained from valid qualitative or quantitative structure-activity relationship models ((Q)SARs) may indicate the presence, but not the absence of a given dangerous property. Results of (Q)SARs may be used instead of testing when the following conditions are met:\n—\nthe results are derived from a (Q)SAR model whose scientific validity has been established,\n—\nthe substance falls within the applicability domain of the (Q)SAR model,\n—\nthe results are adequate for the purpose of classification and labelling and risk assessment, and\n—\nadequate and reliable documentation of the applied method is provided.\nThe Agency shall, in collaboration with the Commission, Member States and interested parties, develop and provide guidance on the use of (Q)SARs.\n1.4.   In vitro methods\nResults obtained from suitable in vitro methods may indicate the presence of a given dangerous property or may be important in relation to a mechanistic understanding, which may be important for the assessment. In this context, ‘suitable’ means sufficiently well-developed according to internationally agreed test development criteria.\nWhere such in vitro tests are positive, it is necessary to confirm the dangerous property by adequate in vivo tests. However, such confirmation may be waived if the following conditions are met:\n(1)\nresults are derived from an in vitro method whose scientific validity has been established by a validation study, according to internationally agreed validation principles;\n(2)\nresults are adequate for the purpose of classification and labelling and risk assessment; and\n(3)\nadequate and reliable documentation of the applied method is provided.\nIn the case of negative results, these exemptions do not apply. A confirmation test may be requested on a case-by-case basis.\n1.5.   Grouping of substances and read-across approach\nSubstances whose physico-chemical, toxicological and ecotoxicological properties are similar or follow a regular pattern as a result of structural similarity may be considered as a group or ‘category’ of substances. Application of the group concept requires that physico-chemical properties, human and animal health effects, and environmental effects or environmental fate may be predicted from data for reference substance(s) within the group by interpolation to other substances in the group (read-across approach). This avoids the need to test every substance for every endpoint.\nThe similarities may be based on:\n(1)\na common functional group indicating the presence of dangerous properties;\n(2)\ncommon precursors and/or the likelihood of common breakdown products via physical and biological processes, which result in structurally similar chemicals and indicates the presence of dangerous properties; or\n(3)\na constant pattern in the changing of the potency of the properties across the category.\nIf the group concept is applied, substances shall be classified and labelled on this basis.\nIn all cases results shall:\n—\nbe adequate for the purpose of classification and labelling and risk assessment,\n—\nhave adequate and reliable coverage of the key parameters addressed in the corresponding test method, and\n—\ncover an exposure duration comparable to or longer than the corresponding test method if exposure duration is a relevant parameter.\nIn all cases, adequate and reliable documentation of the applied method shall be provided.\nThe Agency shall, in collaboration with the Commission, Member States and interested parties, develop and provide guidance on technically and scientifically justified methodology for the grouping of substances.\n2.   TESTING IS TECHNICALLY NOT POSSIBLE\nTesting for a specific endpoint may be omitted if it is technically not possible to conduct the study as a consequence of the properties of the substance: e.g. very volatile, highly reactive or unstable substances cannot be used, mixing of the substance with water may cause danger of fire or explosion, or the radio-labelling of the substance required in certain studies may not be possible. The guidance given in the relevant test methods, more specifically on the technical limitations of a specific method, shall always be respected.\n3.   PRODUCT-TAILORED EXPOSURE-DRIVEN TESTING\n3.1.   Testing in accordance with some endpoints in Sections 8 and 9 of Annexes II and III, notwithstanding Article 6(2), may be omitted based on exposure considerations, where exposure data in accordance with Annex II or III are available.\nIn that case, the following conditions shall be met:\n—\nAn exposure assessment shall be performed, covering primary and secondary exposure under realistic worst case for all intended uses of the biocidal product that contains the active substance for which approval is applied, or of the biocidal product for which the authorisation is sought.\n—\nIf a new exposure scenario is introduced at a later stage, during the product authorisation process, additional data shall be submitted to assess whether the justification for data adaptation still applies.\n—\nThe reasons why the outcome of the exposure assessment justifies waiving of data requirements shall be clearly and transparently explained.\nHowever, testing cannot be omitted for non-threshold effects. As a consequence, certain core data shall always be obligatory, e.g. genotoxicity testing.\nIf relevant, the Agency shall, in collaboration with the Commission, Member States and interested parties, develop and provide further guidance on the criteria established in accordance with Article 6(4) and Article 21(3).\n3.2.   In all cases, adequate justification and documentation shall be provided. The justification shall be based on an exposure assessment, in accordance with the relevant Technical Notes for Guidance where available.\nANNEX V\nBIOCIDAL PRODUCT-TYPES AND THEIR DESCRIPTIONS AS

This may include ‘risk estimation’, i.e. the quantification of that likelihood.\n(e)   Environment\nWater, including sediment, air, soil, wild species of fauna and flora, and any interrelationship between them, as well as any relationship with living organisms.\nINTRODUCTION\n1.\nThis Annex sets out the common principles for the evaluation of dossiers for biocidal products referred to in Article 19(1)(b). A decision by a Member State or the Commission to authorise a biocidal product shall be taken on the basis of the conditions set down in Article 19, taking account of the evaluation carried out according to this Annex. Detailed technical guidance regarding the application of this Annex is available on the website of the Agency.\n2.\nThe principles set out in this Annex can be applied in their entirety to the evaluation of biocidal products comprised of chemical substances. For biocidal products containing micro-organisms, these principles should be further developed in technical guidance taking into account practical experience gained, and be applied taking into account the nature of the product and the latest scientific information. In the case of biocidal products containing nanomaterials, the principles set out in this Annex will also need to be adapted and elaborated in technical guidance to take account of the latest scientific information.\n3.\nIn order to ensure a high and harmonised level of protection of human health, animal health and the environment, any risks arising from the use of a biocidal product shall be identified. To achieve this, a risk assessment shall be carried out to determine the acceptability or otherwise of any risks that are identified. This is done by carrying out an assessment of the risks associated with the relevant individual components of the biocidal product, taking into account any cumulative and synergistic effects.\n4.\nA risk assessment on the active substance(s) present in the biocidal product is always required. This risk assessment shall entail hazard identification, and, as appropriate, dose (concentration) - response (effect) assessment, exposure assessment and risk characterisation. Where a quantitative risk assessment cannot be made a qualitative assessment shall be produced.\n5.\nAdditional risk assessments shall be carried out, in the same manner as described above, on any substance of concern present in the biocidal product. Information submitted in the framework of Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 shall be taken into account where appropriate.\n6.\nIn order to carry out a risk assessment, data are required. These data are detailed in Annexes II and III and take account of the fact that there are a wide variety of applications as well as different product-types and that this has an impact on the associated risks. The data required shall be the minimum necessary to carry out an appropriate risk assessment. The evaluating body shall take due consideration of the requirements of Articles 6, 21 and 62 in order to avoid duplication of data submissions. Data may also be required on a substance of concern present in a biocidal product. For in-situ generated active substances, the risk assessment includes also the possible risks from the precursor(s).\n7.\nThe results of the risk assessments carried out on the active substance and on the substances of concern present in the biocidal product shall be integrated to produce an overall assessment for the biocidal product itself.\n8.\nWhen making evaluations of a biocidal product the evaluating body shall:\n(a)\ntake into consideration other relevant technical or scientific information which is reasonably available to them with regard to the properties of the biocidal product, its components, metabolites, or residues;\n(b)\nevaluate, where relevant, justifications submitted by the applicant for not supplying certain data.\n9.\nThe application of these common principles shall, when taken together with the other conditions set out in Article 19, lead to the competent authorities or the Commission deciding whether or not a biocidal product can be authorised. Such authorisation may include restrictions on use or other conditions. In certain cases the competent authorities may conclude that more data are required before an authorisation decision can be made.\n10.\nIn the case of biocidal products containing active substances covered by the exclusion criteria in Article 5(1), the competent authorities or the Commission shall also evaluate whether the conditions of Article 5(2) can be satisfied.\n11.\nDuring the process of evaluation, applicants and the evaluating bodies shall cooperate in order to resolve quickly any questions on the data requirements, to identify at an early stage any additional studies required, to amend any proposed conditions for the use of the biocidal product, or to modify its nature or its composition in order to ensure full compliance with the requirements of Article 19 and of this Annex. The administrative burden, especially for SMEs, shall be kept to the minimum necessary without prejudicing the level of protection afforded to humans, animals and the environment.\n12.\nThe judgments made by the evaluating body during the evaluation must be based on scientific principles, preferably recognised at international level, and must be made with the benefit of expert advice.\nASSESSMENT\nGeneral principles\n13.\nThe data submitted in support of an application for authorisation of a biocidal product shall be validated by the evaluating or receiving competent authority in accordance with the relevant articles of the Regulation. After validation of these data the competent authorities shall utilise them by carrying out a risk assessment based on the proposed use. Information submitted in the framework of Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 shall be taken into account where appropriate.\n14.\nA risk assessment on the active substance present in the biocidal product shall always be carried out. If there are, in addition, any substances of concern present in the biocidal product then a risk assessment shall be carried out for each of these. The risk assessment shall cover the proposed normal use of the biocidal product, together with a realistic worst-case scenario including any relevant production and disposal issue. The assessment shall also take account of how any ‘treated articles’ treated with or containing the product may be used and disposed of. Active substances that are generated in-situ and the associated precursors shall also be considered.\n15.\nIn carrying out the assessment, the possibility of cumulative or synergistic effects shall also be taken into account. The Agency shall, in collaboration with the Commission, Member States and interested parties, develop and provide further guidance on the scientific definitions and methodologies for the assessment of cumulative and synergistic effects.\n16.\nFor each active substance and each substance of concern present in the biocidal product, the risk assessment shall entail hazard identification and the establishment of appropriate reference values for dose or effect concentrations such as NOAEL or Predicted No Effect Concentrations (PNEC), where possible. It shall also include, as appropriate, a dose (concentration) — response (effect) assessment, together with an exposure assessment and a risk characterisation.\n17.\nThe results arrived at from a comparison of the exposure to the appropriate reference values for each of the active substances and for any substances of concern shall be integrated to produce an overall risk assessment for the biocidal product. Where quantitative results are not available the results of the qualitative assessments shall be integrated in a similar manner.\n18.\nThe risk assessment shall determine:\n(a)\nthe hazards due to the physico-chemical properties,\n(b)\nthe risk to humans and animals,\n(c)\nthe risk to the environment,\n(d)\nthe measures necessary to protect humans, animals and the environment, both during the proposed normal use of the biocidal product and in a realistic worst-case situation.\n19.\nIn certain cases it may be concluded that further data are required before a risk assessment can be finalised. Any such additional data requested shall be the minimum necessary to complete such a risk assessment.\n20.\nThe information provided on the biocidal product family shall permit the evaluating body to reach a decision on whether all the products within the biocidal product family comply with the criteria under Article 19(1)(b).\n21.\nWhere relevant the technical equivalence for every active substance contained in the biocidal product shall be established with reference to active substances already included in the list of approved active substances.\nEffects on human and animal health\nEffects on human health\n22.\nThe risk assessment shall take account of the following potential effects arising from the use of the biocidal product and the populations liable to exposure.\n23.\nThe effects previously mentioned result from the properties of the active substance and any substance of concern present. They are:\n—\nacute toxicity,\n—\nirritation,\n—\ncorrosivity,\n—\nsensitisation,\n—\nrepeated dose toxicity,\n—\nmutagenicity,\n—\ncarcinogenicity,\n—\nreproductive toxicity,\n—\nneurotoxicity,\n—\nimmunotoxicity,\n—\ndisruption of the endocrine system,\n—\nany other special properties of the active substance or substance of concern,\n—\nother effects due to physico-chemical properties.\n24.\nThe populations previously mentioned are:\n—\nprofessional users,\n—\nnon-professional users,\n—\nhumans exposed directly or indirectly via the environment.\nIn considering these populations, particular attention should be given to the need to protect vulnerable groups within these populations.\n25.\nThe hazard identification shall address the properties and potential adverse effects of the active substance and any substances of concern present in the biocidal product.\n26.\nThe evaluating body shall apply points 27 to 30 when carrying out a dose (concentration) - response (effect) assessment on an active substance or a substance of concern present in a biocidal product.\n27.\nFor repeated dose toxicity and reproductive toxicity the dose-response relationship shall be assessed for each active substance or substance of concern and, where possible, a NOAEL identified. If it is not possible to identify a NOAEL, the lowest-observed-adverse-effect level (LOAEL) shall be identified. Where appropriate, other dose-effect descriptors may be used as reference values.\n28.\nFor acute toxicity, corrosivity and irritation, it is not usually possible to derive a NOAEL or LOAEL on the basis of tests conducted in accordance with the requirements of this Regulation. For acute toxicity, the LD50 (median lethal dose) or LC50 (median lethal concentration) value or another appropriate dose-effect descriptor shall be derived. For the other effects it shall be sufficient to determine whether the active substance or substance of concern has an inherent capacity to cause such effects during use of the biocidal product.\n29.\nFor mutagenicity and carcinogenicity, a non-threshold assessment should be carried out if the active substance or substance of concern is genotoxic and carcinogenic. If the active substance or a substance of concern is not genotoxic a threshold assessment shall be carried out.\n30.\nWith respect to skin sensitisation and respiratory sensitisation, in so far as there is no consensus on the possibility of identifying a dose/concentration below which adverse effects are unlikely to occur, particularly in a subject already sensitised to a given substance, it shall be sufficient to evaluate whether the active substance or substance of concern has an inherent capacity to cause such effects as a result of the use of the biocidal product.\n31.\nWhen carrying out the risk assessment special consideration shall be given to toxicity data derived from observations of human exposure where such data are available, e.g. information gained from manufacture, from poison centres or epidemiology surveys.\n32.\nAn exposure assessment shall be carried out for each of the human populations (professional users, non-professional users and humans exposed directly or indirectly via the environment), for which exposure to a biocidal product occurs or can reasonably be foreseen, with particular attention paid to the pathways of exposure relevant for vulnerable groups. The objective of the assessment shall be to make a quantitative or qualitative estimate of the dose/concentration of each active substance or substance of concern, including relevant metabolites and degradation products to which a population is, or may be exposed during use of the biocidal product and articles treated with that product.\n33.\nThe exposure assessment shall be based on the information in the technical dossier provided in conformity with Articles 6 and 21 and on any other available and relevant information. Particular account shall be taken, as appropriate, of:\n—\nadequately measured exposure data,\n—\nthe form in which the biocidal product is marketed,\n—\nthe type of biocidal product,\n—\nthe application method and application rate,\n—\nthe physico-chemical properties of the biocidal product,\n—\nthe likely routes of exposure and potential for absorption,\n—\nthe frequency and duration of exposure,\n—\nmaximum residue levels,\n—\nthe type and size of specific exposed populations, where such information is available.\n34.\nWhen conducting the exposure assessment, special consideration shall be given to adequately measured, representative exposure data where such data are available. Where calculation methods are used for the estimation of exposure levels, adequate models shall be applied.\nThese models shall:\n—\nmake a best possible estimation of all relevant processes taking into account realistic parameters and assumptions,\n—\nbe subjected to an analysis taking into account possible elements of uncertainty,\n—\nbe reliably validated with measurements carried out under circumstances relevant for the use of the model,\n—\nbe relevant to the conditions in the area of use.\nRelevant monitoring data from substances with analogous use and exposure patterns or analogous properties shall also be considered.\n35.\nWhere, for any of the effects set out in point 23 a reference value has been identified, the risk characterisation shall entail comparison of the reference value with the evaluation of the dose/concentration to which the population will be exposed. Where a reference value cannot be established a qualitative approach shall be used.\nAssessment factors account for the extrapolation from animal toxicity to the exposed human population. The setting of an overall assessment factor considers the degree of uncertainty in inter-species and intra-species extrapolation. In the absence of suitable chemical-specific data, a default assessment factor of 100 is applied to the relevant reference value. Additional elements can also be considered for assessment factors, including toxicokinetics and toxicodynamics, the nature and severity of the effect, human (sub-)populations, exposure deviations between study results and human exposure with regard to frequency and duration, study duration extrapolation (e.g. sub-chronic to chronic), dose-response relationship and the overall quality of the toxicity data package.\nEffects on animal health\n36.\nUsing the same relevant principles as described in the section dealing with effects on humans, the evaluating body shall consider the risks posed to animals from the biocidal product.\nEffects on the environment\n37.\nThe risk assessment shall take account of any adverse effects arising in any of the three environmental compartments — air, soil and water (including sediment) — and of the biota, following the use of the biocidal product.\n38.\nThe hazard identification shall address the properties and potential adverse effects of the active substance and any substances of concern present in the biocidal product.\n39.\nA dose (concentration) — response (effect) assessment shall be carried out in order to predict the concentration below which adverse effects in the environmental compartment of concern are not expected to occur. This shall be carried out for the active substance and for any substance of concern present in the biocidal product. This concentration is known as PNEC. However, in some cases, it may not be possible to establish a PNEC and a qualitative estimation of the dose (concentration) — response (effect) then has to be made.\n40.\nThe PNEC shall be determined from the data on effects on organisms and ecotoxicity studies submitted in accordance with requirements of Articles 6 and 20. It shall be calculated by applying an assessment factor to the reference values resulting from tests on organisms, e.g. LD50 (median lethal dose), LC50 (median lethal concentration), EC50 (median effective concentration), IC50 (concentration causing 50 % inhibition of a given parameter, e.g. growth), NOEL(C) (no-observed-effect level (concentration)), or LOEL(C) (lowest-observed-effect level (concentration)). Where appropriate, other dose-effect descriptors may be used as reference values.\n41.\nAn assessment factor is an expression of the degree of uncertainty in extrapolation from test data on a limited number of species to the real environment. Therefore, in general, the more extensive the data and the longer the duration of the tests, the smaller the degree of uncertainty and the size of the assessment factor.\n42.\nFor each environmental compartment, an exposure assessment shall be carried out in order to predict the likely concentration of each active substance or substance of concern present in the biocidal product. This concentration is known as the predicted environmental concentration (PEC). However, in some cases it may not be possible to establish a PEC and a qualitative estimate of exposure then has to be made.\n43.\nA PEC, or where necessary a qualitative estimate of exposure, need only be determined for the environmental compartments to which emissions, discharges, disposal or distributions (including any relevant contribution from articles treated with biocidal products) are known or are reasonably foreseeable.\n44.\nThe PEC, or the qualitative estimation of exposure, shall be determined taking account of, in particular and where appropriate:\n—\nadequately measured exposure data,\n—\nthe form in which the product is marketed,\n—\nthe type of biocidal product,\n—\nthe application method and application rate,\n—\nthe physico-chemical properties,\n—\nbreakdown/transformation products,\n—\nlikely pathways to environmental compartments and potential for adsorption/desorption and degradation,\n—\nthe frequency and duration of exposure,\n—\nlong range environmental transportation.\n45.\nWhen conducting the exposure assessment, special consideration shall be given to adequately measured, representative exposure data where such data are available. Where calculation methods are used for the estimation of exposure levels, adequate models shall be applied. The characteristics of these models shall be as listed in point 34. Where appropriate, on a case-by-case basis, relevant monitoring data from substances with analogous use and exposure patterns or analogous properties should also be considered.\n46.\nFor any given environmental compartment, the risk characterisation shall, as far as possible, entail comparison of the PEC with the PNEC so that a PEC/PNEC ratio may be derived.\n47.\nIf it has not been possible to derive a PEC/PNEC ratio, the risk characterisation shall entail a qualitative evaluation of the likelihood that an effect is occurring under the current conditions of exposure or will occur under the expected conditions of exposure.\n48.\nThe evaluating body shall conclude that the biocidal product does not comply with criterion (iv) under point (b) of Article 19(1) if it contains any substance of concern or relevant metabolites or breakdown or reaction products fulfilling the criteria for being PBT or vPvB in accordance with Annex XIII to Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006, or if it has endocrine-disrupting properties unless it is scientifically demonstrated that under relevant field conditions there is no unacceptable effect.\nEffects on target organisms\n49.\nAn assessment shall be made to demonstrate that the biocidal product does not cause unnecessary suffering in its effect on target vertebrates. This shall include an evaluation of the mechanism by which the effect is obtained and the observed effects on the behaviour and health of the target vertebrates; where the intended effect is to kill the target vertebrate, the time necessary to obtain the death of the target vertebrate and the conditions under which death occurs shall be evaluated.\n50.\nThe evaluating body shall, where relevant, evaluate the possibility of the development by the target organism of resistance or cross-resistance to an active substance in the biocidal product.\nEfficacy\n51.\nData submitted by the applicant shall be sufficient to substantiate the efficacy claims for the product. Data submitted by the applicant or held by the evaluating body must be able to demonstrate the efficacy of the biocidal product against the target organism when used normally in accordance with the conditions of authorisation.\n52.\nTesting should be carried out according to Union guidelines where these are available and applicable. Where appropriate, other methods from the list below can be used. If relevant acceptable field data exist, these can be used.\n—\nISO, CEN or other international standard method\n—\nnational standard method\n—\nindustry standard method (if accepted by the evaluating body)\n—\nindividual producer standard method (if accepted by the evaluating body)\n—\ndata from the actual development of the biocidal product (if accepted by the evaluating body).\nSummary\n53.\nIn each of the areas where risk assessments have been carried out, the evaluating body shall combine the results for the active substance together with the results for any substance of concern to produce an overall assessment for the biocidal product itself. This shall also take account of any cumulative or synergistic effects.\n54.\nFor biocidal product containing more than one active substance, any adverse effects shall also be considered together to produce an overall assessment for the biocidal product itself.\nCONCLUSIONS\nGeneral principles\n55.\nThe purpose of the evaluation is to establish whether or not the product complies with the criteria set down in point (b) of Article 19(1). The evaluating body shall reach its conclusion as a result of the integration of the risks arising from each active substance together with the risks from each substance of concern present in the biocidal product, based on the assessment carried out in accordance with points 13 to 54 of this Annex.\n56.\nIn establishing compliance with the criteria set out in point (b) of Article 19(1), the evaluating body shall arrive at one of the following conclusions for each product-type and each area of use of the biocidal product for which application has been made:\n(1)\nthat the biocidal product complies with the criteria;\n(2)\nthat, subject to specific conditions/restrictions, the biocidal product can comply with the criteria;\n(3)\nthat it is not possible, without additional data, to establish if the biocidal product complies with the criteria;\n(4)\nthat the biocidal product does not comply with the criteria.\n57.\nThe evaluating body shall, when seeking to establish whether a biocidal product complies with the criteria in point (b) of Article 19(1), take into account uncertainty arising from the variability in the data used in the evaluation process.\n58.\nIf the conclusion arrived at by the evaluating body is that additional information or data are required, then the evaluating body shall justify the need for any such information or data. This additional information or data shall be the minimum necessary to carry out a further appropriate risk assessment.\nEffects on human and animal health\nEffects on human health\n59.\nThe evaluating body shall consider possible effects on all human populations, namely professional users, non-professional users and humans exposed directly or indirectly through the environment. In reaching these conclusions, particular attention shall be paid to vulnerable groups among the different populations.\n60.\nThe evaluating body shall examine the relationship between exposure and effect. A number of factors need to be considered when examining this relationship. One of the most important factors is the nature of the adverse effect of the substance under consideration. These effects include acute toxicity, irritancy, corrosivity, sensitisation, repeated dose toxicity, mutagenicity, carcinogenicity, neurotoxicity, immunotoxicity, reproductive toxicity, disruption of the endocrine system together with physico-chemical properties, and any other adverse properties of the active substance or substance of concern, or of their relevant metabolites or degradation products.\n61.\nTypically, the margin of exposure (MOEref) — the ratio between the dose descriptor and the exposure concentration — is in the region of 100, but a MOEref that is higher or lower than this may also be appropriate depending on, among other things, the nature of the critical effects and the sensitivity of the population.\n62.\nThe evaluating body shall, where appropriate, conclude that criterion (iii) under point (b) of Article 19(1) can only be complied with by application of prevention and protection measures including the design of work processes, engineering controls, use of adequate equipment and materials, application of collective protection measures and, where exposure cannot be prevented by other means, application of individual protection measures including the wearing of personal protective equipment such as respirators, breathing-masks, overalls, gloves and goggles, in order to reduce exposure for professional operators.\n63.\nIf, for non-professional users, the wearing of personal protective equipment would be the only possible method for reducing exposure to an acceptable level for this population, the product shall not normally be considered as complying with criterion (iii) under point (b) of Article 19(1) for this population.\nEffects on animal health\n64.\nUsing the same relevant criteria as described in the section dealing with effects on human health, the evaluating body shall consider whether criterion (iii) under point (b) of Article 19(1) is complied with for animal health.\nEffects on the environment\n65.\nThe basic tool used in the decision-making is the PEC/PNEC ratio or, if this is not available, a qualitative estimation. Due consideration shall be given to the accuracy of this ratio due to variability in the data used both in measurements of concentration and of estimation.\nIn the determination of the PEC, the most appropriate model should be used taking into account the environmental fate and behaviour of the biocidal product.\n66.\nFor any given environmental compartment, if the PEC/PNEC ratio is equal to or less than 1, the risk characterisation shall be that no further information and/or testing is necessary. If the PEC/PNEC ratio is greater than 1, the evaluating body shall judge, on the basis of the size of that ratio and on other relevant factors, whether further information and/or testing is required to clarify the concern or appropriate risk reduction measures are necessary, or whether the biocidal product cannot comply with criterion (iv) under point (b) of Article 19(1).\nWater\n67.\nThe evaluating body shall conclude that the biocidal product does not comply with criterion (iv) under point (b) of Article 19(1) where, under the proposed conditions of use, the foreseeable concentration of the active substance or any other substance of concern, or of relevant metabolites or breakdown or reaction products in water (or its sediments) has an unacceptable impact on non-target organisms in the aquatic, marine or estuarine environment, unless it is scientifically demonstrated that under relevant field conditions there is no unacceptable effect. In particular, the evaluating body shall conclude that the biocidal product does not comply with criterion (iv) under point (b) of Article 19(1), where under the proposed conditions of use, the foreseeable concentration of the active substance or any other substance of concern, or of relevant metabolites or breakdown or reaction products in water (or its sediments), would undermine the achievement of compliance with the standards laid down in:\n—\nDirective 2000/60/EC,\n—\nDirective 2006/118/EC,\n—\nDirective 2008/56/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 June 2008 establishing a framework for community action in the field of marine environmental policy (2),\n—\nDirective 2008/105/EC, or\n—\ninternational agreements on the protection of river systems or marine waters from pollution.\n68.\nThe evaluating body shall conclude that the biocidal product does not comply with criterion (iv) under point (b) of Article 19(1) where, under the proposed conditions of use, the foreseeable concentration of the active substance or any other substance of concern, or of relevant metabolites or breakdown or reaction products in groundwater, exceeds the lower of the following concentrations:\n—\nthe maximum permissible concentration laid down by Directive 98/83/EC, or\n—\nthe maximum concentration as laid down following the procedure for approving the active substance under this Regulation, on the basis of appropriate data, in particular toxicological data,\nunless it is scientifically demonstrated that under relevant field conditions the lower concentration is not exceeded.\n69.\nThe evaluating body shall conclude that the biocidal product does not comply with criterion (iv) under point (b) of Article 19(1) where the foreseeable concentration of the active substance or a substance of concern, or of relevant metabolites, breakdown or reaction products to be expected in surface water or its sediments after use of the biocidal product under the proposed conditions of use:\n—\nexceeds, where the surface water in or from the area of envisaged use is intended for the abstraction of drinking water, the values fixed by:\n—\nDirective 2000/60/EC,\n—\nDirective 98/83/EC, or\n—\nhas an impact deemed unacceptable on non-target organisms,\nunless it is scientifically demonstrated that under relevant field conditions this concentration is not exceeded.\n70.\nThe proposed instructions for use of the biocidal product, including procedures for cleaning application equipment, must be such that, if followed, they minimise the likelihood of accidental contamination of water or its sediments.\nSoil\n71.\nThe evaluating body shall conclude that the biocidal product does not comply with criterion (iv) under point (b) of Article 19(1) where, under the proposed conditions of use, the foreseeable concentration of the active substance or any other substance of concern, or of relevant metabolites or breakdown or reaction products in soil, has an unacceptable impact on non-target species, unless it is scientifically demonstrated that under relevant field conditions there is no unacceptable effect.\nAir\n72.\nThe evaluating body shall conclude that the biocidal product does not comply with criterion (iv) of point (b) of Article 19(1) where there is a reasonably foreseeable possibility of unacceptable effect on the air compartment, unless it is scientifically demonstrated that under relevant field conditions there is no unacceptable effect.\nNon-target organisms\n73.\nThe evaluating body shall conclude that the biocidal product does not comply with criterion (iv) under point (b) of Article 19(1) where there is a reasonably foreseeable possibility of non-target organisms being exposed to the biocidal product, if for any active substance or substance of concern:\n—\nthe PEC/PNEC is above 1, or\n—\nthe concentration of the active substance or any other substance of concern, or of relevant metabolites or breakdown or reaction products, has an unacceptable impact on non-target species, unless it is scientifically demonstrated that under relevant field conditions there is no unacceptable effect.\n74.\nThe evaluating body shall conclude that the biocidal product does not comply with criterion (iv) under point (b) of Article 19(1) where there is a reasonably foreseeable possibility of micro-organisms in sewage treatment plants being exposed to the biocidal product, if for any active substance, substance of concern, relevant metabolite, breakdown or reaction product the PEC/PNEC ratio is above 1, unless it is clearly established in the risk assessment that under field conditions no unacceptable impact, either directly or indirectly, occurs on the viability of such micro-organisms.\nEffects on target organisms\n75.\nWhere the development of resistance or cross-resistance to the active substance in the biocidal product is likely, the evaluating body shall consider actions to minimise the consequences of this resistance. This may involve modification of the conditions under which an authorisation is given. However, where the development of resistance or cross-resistance cannot be reduced sufficiently, the evaluating authority shall conclude that the biocidal product does not satisfy criterion (ii) under point (b) of Article 19(1).\n76.\nA biocidal product intended to control vertebrates shall not normally be regarded as satisfying criterion (ii) under point (b) of Article 19(1) unless:\n—\ndeath is synchronous with the extinction of consciousness, or\n—\ndeath occurs immediately, or\n—\nvital functions are reduced gradually without signs of obvious suffering.\nFor repellent products, the intended effect shall be obtained without unnecessary suffering and pain for the target vertebrate.\nEfficacy\n77.\nThe level, consistency and duration of protection, control or other intended effects must, as a minimum, be similar to those resulting from suitable reference products, where such products exist, or to other means of control. Where no reference products exist, the biocidal product must give a defined level of protection or control in the areas of proposed use. Conclusions as to the performance of the biocidal product must be valid for all areas of proposed use and for all areas in the Member State or, where appropriate, in the Union, except where the biocidal product is intended for use in specific circumstances. The evaluating body shall evaluate dose-response data generated in appropriate trials (which must include an untreated control) involving dose rates lower than the recommended rate, in order to assess if the recommended dose is the minimum necessary to achieve the desired effect.\nSummary\n78.\nIn relation to the criteria set out in points (iii) and (iv) of Article 19(1)(b), the evaluating body shall combine the conclusions arrived at for the active substance(s) and the substances of concern to produce overall summary conclusions for the biocidal product itself. A summary of the conclusions in relation to the criteria set out in points (i) and (ii) of Article 19(1)(b) shall also be made.\nOVERALL INTEGRATION OF CONCLUSIONS\nThe evaluating body shall, on the basis of the evaluation carried out in accordance with the principles set down in this Annex, come to a conclusion as to whether or not it is established that the biocidal product complies with the criteria laid down under point (b) of Article 19(1).\n(1)  See definition of vulnerable groups in Article 3.\n(2)  OJ L 164, 25.6.2008, p. 19.\nANNEX VII\nCORRELATION TABLE\nDirective 98/8/EC\nThis Regulation\n—\nArticle 1\nArticle 1\nArticle 2\nArticle 2\nArticle 3\nArticle 10\nArticle 4\nArticle 10\nArticle 5\n—\nArticle 6\nArticle 11(1)(a)\n6(1)\nArticle 11(1)(a)(i) and (ii)\n6(2)\n—\n6(3)\n—\n6(4)\n—\nArticle 7\nArticle 11(1)(a)\n7(1)\n—\n7(2)\n—\n7(3)\n—\n7(4)\n—\n7(5)\n—\n7(6)\n—\nArticle 8\nArticle 11(2), first subparagraph\n8(1)\nArticle 11(2), second subparagraph\n8(2)\nArticle 10(1), first subparagraph\n8(3)\n—\n8(4)\n—\nArticle 9\n11(4)\n9(1)\n—\n9(2)\n—\nArticle 10\nArticle 33\nArticle 11\nArticle 10(4)\nArticle 12\n—\n12(1)\n—\n12(2)\n—\n12(3)\n—\nArticle 13\n—\nArticle 14\n—\nArticle 15\n—\nArticle 16\n—\nArticle 17\nArticle 3(1)\n17(1)\nArticle 8(1)\n17(2)\n—\n17(3)\nArticle 3(6)\n17(4)\nArticle 3(7)\n17(5)\n—\n17(6)\n—\nArticle 18\n—\nArticle 19\nArticle 5(1)\n19(1)\nArticle 5(1)(b)\n19(2)\n—\n19(3)\nArticle 5(2)\n19(4)\n—\n19(5)\nArticle 2(1)(j)\n19(6)\n—\n19(7)\n—\n19(8)\n—\n19(9)\n—\nArticle 20\nArticle 8(2)\n20(1)\nArticle 8(12)\n20(2)\n—\n20(3)\n—\nArticle 21\n—\nArticle 22\nArticle 5(3)\n22(1)\n—\n22(2)\n—\nArticle 23\n—\n23(1)\nArticle 10(5)(i)\n23(2)\n—\n23(3)\n—\n23(4)\n—\n23(5)\n—\n23(6)\nArticle 33\nArticle 24\n—\nArticle 25\n—\nArticle 26\n—\nArticle 27\n—\nArticle 28\n—\nArticle 29\n—\nArticle 30\n—\nArticle 31\nArticle 4\nArticle 32\n—\nArticle 33\n—\nArticle 34\n—\nArticle 35\nArticle 4(4)\nArticle 36\n—\nArticle 37\n—\nArticle 38\n—\nArticle 39\n—\nArticle 40\n—\nArticle 41\n—\nArticle 42\n—\nArticle 43\n—\nArticle 44\n—\nArticle 45\n—\nArticle 46\n—\nArticle 47\nArticle 7\nArticle 48\nArticle 7\nArticle 49\nArticle 7\nArticle 50\n—\nArticle 51\n—\nArticle 52\n—\nArticle 53\n—\nArticle 54\nArticle 15\nArticle 55\nArticle 17\nArticle 56\n—\nArticle 57\n—\nArticle 58\nArticle 12\nArticle 59\n—\nArticle 60\n—\n60(1)\nArticle 12(1)(c)(ii) and (1)(b) and (1)(d)(ii)\n60(2)\nArticle 12(2)(c)(i) and (ii)\n60(3)\n—\nArticle 61\n—\nArticle 62\n—\nArticle 63\nArticle 13(2)\n63(1)\n—\n63(2)\n—\n63(3)\nArticle 13(1)\nArticle 64\n—\nArticle 65\nArticle 24\n65(1)\n—\n65(2)\nArticle 24\n65(3)\n—\n65(4)\n—\nArticle 66\n—\n66(1)\n—\n66(2)\n—\n66(3)\nArticle 19(1)\n66(4)\n—\nArticle 67\n—\nArticle 68\n—\nArticle 69\nArticle 20(1) and 20(2)\nArticle 69(1)\nArticle 20(3)\nArticle 69(2)\nArticle 20(6)\nArticle 69(2)\nArticle 21, second subparagraph\nArticle 70\n—\nArticle 71\n—\nArticle 72\nArticle 22(1), first and second subparagraphs\n72(1)\nArticle 22(1), third subparagraph\n72(2)\nArticle 22(2)\n72(3)\n—\nArticle 73\n—\nArticle 74\n—\nArticle 75\n—\nArticle 76\n—\nArticle 77\n—\nArticle 78\n—\nArticle 79\n—\nArticle 80\n—\n80(1)\nArticle 25\n80(2)\n—\n80(3)\nArticle 26\nArticle 81\nArticle 28\nArticle 82\n—\nArticle 83\n—\nArticle 84\nArticle 29\nArticle 85\n—\nArticle 86\n—\nArticle 87\nArticle 32\nArticle 88\n—\nArticle 89\n—\nArticle 90\n—\nArticle 91\n—\nArticle 92\n—\nArticle 93\n—\nArticle 94\n—\nArticle 95\n—\nArticle 96\n—\nArticle 97\nAnnex IA\nAnnex I\nAnnex II A, III A and IV A\nAnnex II\nAnnex II B, III B and IV B\nAnnex III\n—\nAnnex IV\nAnnex V\nAnnex V\nAnnex VI\nAnnex VI", "summary": "Safe insect repellents, disinfectants and other industrial chemicals (biocides) in the EU\nSafe insect repellents, disinfectants and other industrial chemicals (biocides) in the EU\nSUMMARY OF:\nRegulation (EU) No 528/2012 concerning the making available on the market and use of biocidal products\nWHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?\n              \nIt harmonises the rules in the European Union (EU) concerning the sale and use of biocidal products*, while ensuring high levels of protection of human and animal health, and of the environment.\nKEY POINTS\nActive substance approval\nIn order to be allowed to be sold in the EU, all biocidal products require a permit. The active substances that they contain must be approved or included into Annex I of the regulation.\nThe evaluation of biocidal active substances is carried out at the EU level. For each active substance that needs to be evaluated, an EU Member State ‘rapporteur’ is appointed. The rapporteur is responsible for producing an assessment report which is peer-reviewed by the other Member State representatives within the Biocidal Products Committee (BPC) of the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA). The BPC prepares an opinion of the agency, which is the basis for the Commission’s decision to approve (or not approve) the substance.\nActive substances that meet the exclusion criteria are not approved. These are substances that are: carcinogenic, mutagenic or toxic to reproduction;endocrine disruptors*;persistent*, bioaccumulative* and toxic*; orvery persistent and very bioaccumulative.\nExemptions are possible, however, when: the risks from exposure to the substance are negligible;the substance is essential in preventing or controlling a serious danger to human health, animal health or the environment; ornon-approval would cause a disproportionate negative effect on society when compared to the effects caused by the use of the active substance.\nThe risks associated with nanomaterial biocides* must be specifically assessed.\nThe approval of an active substance is granted for a period not exceeding 10 years.\nApproved active substances are listed on the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) website.\nProduct authorisation\nOnce an active substance is approved, companies must apply for permission to place their products on the market in one of the following ways.\nBy submitting a request for EU authorisation to the European Chemicals Agency: if the product is deemed safe following the assessment by a competent evaluating authority of a Member State and the granting of an authorisation by the Commission, it can be sold directly throughout the EU without the need to obtain specific national authorisation.\nBy submitting a request for national authorisation, if the product is to be sold in a single Member State. If an authorisation is granted, companies wishing to place the same product on the market of other Member States can apply for the principle of mutual recognition of the authorisation of the product.\nThere is also a simplified authorisation procedure for the least harmful products which meet specific conditions (contain no substances of concern, no nanomaterials or are sufficiently effective and their handling does not require the use of personal protective equipment).\nBy way of exception, biocidal products containing active substances which were already on the market in May 2000 and are included in the work programme for the examination of existing biocidal active substances can be made available on the market and used in accordance with national laws of each Member State pending the final decision on the approval of the active substance(s) they contain.\nData sharing\nTo minimise costs and the use of animal testing, the regulation requires the sharing of data on approved substances and products authorised in the EU. The agency has set up an information system (register for biocidal products) that contains all the information on applications, assessments and authorisations or approvals.\nTreated articles\nThe regulation covers articles that have been treated with or incorporate a biocidal product (such as furniture and paints). Treated articles can only be treated with active substances that have been approved in the EU and must be labelled following specific rules.\nDelegated and implementing acts\nThe European Commission has adopted many delegated and implementing acts in relation to Regulation (EC) No 528/2012.\nOf particular note are:\nDelegated Regulation (EU) 2017/2100 which sets out the scientific criteria for determining endocrine-disrupting properties;\nDelegated Regulations (EU) No 1062/2014, (EU) 2017/698 and (EU) 2019/157 on the work programme for the systematic examination of all existing active substances contained in biocidal products.\nFROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?\n              \nIt has applied since 1 September 2013.\nBACKGROUND\n              \nFor more information, see:\nBiocides (European Commission)\nBPR Legislation (European Chemicals Agency).\nKEY TERMS\n              \nBiocidal products: products such as household disinfectants, insecticides and other chemicals used to suppress pests (parasites, fungi, bacteria, etc.) or to protect materials. As their properties can pose risks to humans, animals and the environment, they are regulated at the EU level.\nEndocrine disruptors: chemicals which under certain conditions can affect the hormonal system of humans and animals.\nPersistent: these are chemicals that persist in the environment (i.e. do not break down) and thus may damage human health. The pesticide DDT is an example.\nBioaccumulative: the accumulation of a substance such as a chemical in an organism. Bioaccumulation occurs when this substance is absorbed faster by the organism than it is eliminated.\nToxic: substances which may harm the environment or health if inhaled, ingested or absorbed through the skin.\nNanomaterial biocide: a biocide produced using a nanomaterial. Nanomaterials are chemical substances or materials that are manufactured and used on a very small scale. Nanomaterials have unique and more pronounced characteristics compared to the same material without nanoscale features (source: European Chemical Agency).\nMAIN DOCUMENT\n            \nRegulation (EU) No 528/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 May 2012 concerning the making available on the market and use of biocidal products (OJ L 167, 27.6.2012, pp. 1-123)\nSuccessive amendments to Regulation (EU) No 528/2012 have been incorporated into the original text.
