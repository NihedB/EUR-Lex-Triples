Both the European Parliament and the Council have endorsed this strategy.\n(2)\nRegulation (EU) No 1291/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council (3) established Horizon 2020 – The Framework Programme for Research and Innovation (2014-2020) (‘Horizon 2020’). Horizon 2020 aims at achieving a greater impact with respect to research and innovation by contributing to the strengthening of public-public partnerships, including through Union participation in programmes undertaken by several Member States in accordance with Article 185 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.\n(3)\nPublic-public partnerships should aim to develop closer synergies, increase coordination and avoid unnecessary duplication with Union, international, national and regional research programmes, and should fully respect the Horizon 2020 general principles, in particular those relating to openness and transparency. Moreover, open access to scientific publications should be ensured.\n(4)\nBy Decision No 743/2008/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (4), the Community decided to make a financial contribution to Eurostars, a joint research and development programme undertaken by all Member States and five participating countries in the framework of Eureka, an intergovernmental initiative established in 1985 with the objective of promoting cooperation in industrial research (‘Eurostars’).\n(5)\nIn April 2012, the Commission communicated to the European Parliament and the Council a report on the interim evaluation of Eurostars carried out by a Group of Independent Experts two years after the beginning of the programme. The overall opinion of the experts was that Eurostars meets its objectives, adds value to European research and development performing small and medium-sized enterprises (‘SMEs’) and should be continued after 2013. Eurostars is also considered to meet a number of genuine needs of SMEs engaged in research and development; it has attracted a large number of applications, with the budget for projects eligible for funding exceeding the initial budget. A number of recommendations for improvement were made, mainly addressing the need of further integration of national programmes and improvements in the operational performance in order to reach shorter time-to-contract and more transparency in the procedures.\n(6)\nThe definition of SME provided for in Commission Recommendation 2003/361/EC of 6 May 2003 concerning the definition of micro, small and medium-sized enterprises (5) should apply.\n(7)\nIn accordance with Council Decision 2013/743/EU (6), support may be provided to an action building on Eurostars and reorienting it along the lines stated in its interim evaluation.\n(8)\nThe second Research and Development Programme jointly undertaken by several Member States aimed at supporting research and development performing small and medium-sized enterprises (‘Eurostars-2’), aligned with the Europe 2020 strategy, its flagship initiative ‘Innovation Union’ and the Commission Communication of 17 July 2012 entitled ‘A Reinforced European Research Area Partnership for Excellence and Growth’, will aim to supporting research and development performing SMEs by co-financing their market oriented research projects in any field. As such, and in combination with the activities under the ‘Leadership in Enabling and Industrial Technologies’ objective set out in Horizon 2020, it will contribute to the goals of the Industrial Leadership part of that programme to speed-up development of the technologies and innovations that will underpin tomorrow’s businesses and help innovative European SMEs to grow into world-leading companies. As part of the improvements from the previous Eurostars programme, Eurostars-2 should head towards shorter time-to-grant, stronger integration and lean, transparent and more efficient administration to the ultimate benefit of research and development performing SMEs. To keep the bottom-up nature and the business-driven agenda with its main focus on market potential from the previous Eurostars programme is key to the success of Eurostars-2.\n(9)\nIn order to take into account the duration of Horizon 2020, calls for proposals under Eurostars-2 should be launched at the latest by 31 December 2020. In duly justified cases calls for proposals may be launched by 31 December 2021.\n(10)\nThe Eureka Ministerial Conference on 22 June 2012 in Budapest endorsed a strategic vision for Eurostars-2 (‘Budapest Document’). The ministers committed to support the continuation of Eurostars after its termination in 2013 for the period covered by Horizon 2020. This will consist of a reinforced partnership addressing the recommendations of the interim evaluation of Eurostars. The Budapest Document sets out two main objectives for Eurostars-2. Firstly, a structural-oriented objective to deepen the synchronisation and alignment of the national research programmes in the field of funding, which is a central element towards the realisation of the European Research Area by the member countries. Secondly a content-related objective to support research and development performing SMEs engaging in transnational research and innovation projects. The Budapest Document invites the Union to participate in Eurostars-2.\n(11)\nFor the purpose of simplification, administrative burdens should be reduced for all parties. Double audits and disproportionate documentation and reporting should be avoided. When audits are conducted, the specificities of the national programmes should be taken into account, as appropriate.\n(12)\nAudits of recipients of Union funds provided under Eurostars-2 should be carried out in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 1291/2013.\n(13)\nThe Participating States intend to contribute to the implementation of Eurostars-2 during the period covered by Eurostars-2 (2014-2024).\n(14)\nEurostars-2 activities should be in line with the objectives and bottom-up principles of Horizon 2020 and with the general principles and conditions laid down in Article 26 of Regulation (EU) No 1291/2013.\n(15)\nA ceiling should be established for the Union’s financial contribution to Eurostars-2 for the duration of the Horizon 2020. Within the limits of that ceiling, there should be flexibility regarding the Union’s contribution, which should be at least one third but no more than half of the contribution of the Participating States in order to ensure a critical mass necessary to satisfy the demand from projects eligible for financial support, to achieve a high leverage effect and ensure stronger integration of national research programmes of the Participating States.\n(16)\nIn accordance with the objectives of Regulation (EU) No 1291/2013, any Member State and any country associated to Horizon 2020 should be entitled to participate in Eurostars-2.\n(17)\nAny Eureka Member or country associated to Eureka that is not a Member State or a country associated to Horizon 2020 may become a Eurostars-2 partner country.\n(18)\nThe Union’s financial contribution should be subject to formal commitments from the Participating States to contribute to the implementation of Eurostars-2 and to the fulfilment of those commitments. Financial support under Eurostars-2 should mainly take the form of grants to projects selected following calls for proposals launched under Eurostars-2. In order to meet the objectives of Eurostars-2, the Participating States shall ensure sufficient financial contributions to fund a reasonable number of proposals selected through each call.\n(19)\nThe joint implementation of Eurostars-2 requires an implementation structure. The Participating States have agreed on designating the Eureka Secretariat (‘ESE’) as the implementation structure for Eurostars-2. ESE is an international non-profit association established under Belgian law in 1997 by the Eureka countries and, since 2008, is responsible for the implementation of Eurostars. ESE’s role goes beyond the implementation of Eurostars, being at the same time the secretariat of the Eureka initiative, with its own governance linked to the management of Eureka projects outside of Eurostars. The Union, represented by the Commission, is a founding member of the Eureka initiative and full member of the Eureka Secretariat association.\n(20)\nIn order to achieve the objectives of Eurostars-2, ESE should be in charge of the organisation of the calls for proposals, the verification of the eligibility criteria, the peer-review evaluation and the selection and the monitoring of projects, as well as the allocation of the Union contribution. The evaluation of proposals should be performed centrally by independent external experts under the responsibility of ESE following calls for proposals. The projects’ ranking list should be binding for the Participating States as regards the allocation of funding from the Union’s financial contribution and from contribution from Participating States.\n(21)\nOverall, Eurostars-2should demonstrate clear progress towards further alignment and synchronisation of the national research and innovation programmes as a truly joint programme featuring stronger scientific, management and financial synchronisation. Stronger scientific integration should be achieved through the common definition and implementation of activities and should ensure the excellence and the high impact of the projects selected. Management integration should ensure further improvement of operational excellence and accountability for the programme. Stronger financial integration should be based on overall and yearly adequate financial contribution by the States participating in Eurostars-2 and a high degree of national synchronisation. This should be achieved through a progressive harmonisation of national funding rules.\n(22)\nThe Union’s financial contribution should be managed in accordance with the principle of sound financial management and with the rules on indirect management set out in Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 966/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council (7) and Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 1268/2012 (8).\n(23)\nIn order to protect the Union’s financial interests, the Commission should have the right to reduce, suspend or terminate the Union’s financial contribution if Eurostars-2 is implemented inadequately, partially or late, or if the Participating States do not contribute, or contribute partially or late, to the financing of Eurostars-2. Those rights should be provided for in the delegation agreement to be concluded between the Union and the ESE.\n(24)\nParticipation in indirect actions funded by Eurostars-2 is subject to Regulation (EU) No 1290/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council (9). However, due to the specific operating needs of Eurostars-2, it is necessary to provide for derogations from that Regulation in accordance with Article 1(3) of that Regulation.\n(25)\nIn order to facilitate the participation of SMEs which are more used to national channels and which would otherwise carry out research activities only within their national boundaries, the Eurostars-2 financial contribution should be provided in accordance with the well-known rules of their national programmes and implemented through a funding agreement directly administered by the national authorities, combining Union funding with the corresponding national funding. A derogation should therefore be made from Article 15(9), Articles 18(1), 23(1), (5) to (7), 28 to 34 of Regulation (EU) No 1290/2013.\n(26)\nCalls for proposals by Eurostars-2 should also be published on the single portal for participants as well as through other Horizon 2020 electronic means of dissemination managed by the Commission.\n(27)\nThe Union’s financial interests should be protected by means of proportionate measures throughout the expenditure cycle, including the prevention, detection and investigation of irregularities, the recovery of funds lost, wrongly paid or incorrectly used and, where appropriate, administrative and financial penalties in accordance with Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 966/2012.\n(28)\nThe Commission, in cooperation with the Participating States, should conduct an interim evaluation assessing in particular the quality and efficiency of Eurostars-2 and progress towards the objectives set, as well as a final evaluation and prepare a report on those evaluations.\n(29)\nUpon request from the Commission, ESE and the Participating States should submit any information which the Commission needs to include in the reports on the evaluation of Eurostars-2.\n(30)\nSince the objectives of this Decision, namely to support transnational research activities performed by research-intensive SMEs and to contribute to the integration, alignment and synchronisation of national research funding programmes cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States due to lack of transnational dimension and of complementarity and interoperability of national programmes but can rather, by reason of the scale and impact of the action, be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Decision does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives,\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\nArticle 1\nSubject matter\nThis Decision lays down rules on the participation of the Union in the second Research and Development Programme jointly undertaken by several Member States aimed at supporting research and development performing small and medium-sized enterprises (‘Eurostars-2’) and the conditions for its participation.\nArticle 2\nDefinitions\nFor the purpose of this Decision the following definitions apply:\n(1)\n‘SME’ means a micro-, small- and medium-sized enterprises, as defined in Recommendation 2003/361/EC;\n(2)\n‘research and development performing SME’ means an SME which meets at least one of the following conditions:\n(a)\nreinvests at least 10 % of its turnover to research and development activities;\n(b)\ndedicates at least 10 % of its full-time equivalents to research and development activities;\n(c)\nhas at least five full-time equivalents (for SME with no more than 100 full-time equivalents) for research and development activities; or\n(d)\nhas 10 full-time equivalents (for SME with over 100 full-time equivalents) for research and development activities.\nArticle 3\nObjectives\nEurostars-2 shall pursue the following objectives:\n(1)\npromote research activities that comply with the following conditions:\n(a)\nthe activities are carried out by transnational collaboration of research- and development performing SMEs among themselves or including other actors of the innovation chain (e.g. universities, research organisations);\n(b)\nresults of activities are expected to be introduced into the market within two years of the completion of an activity;\n(2)\nincrease the accessibility, efficiency and efficacy of public funding for SMEs in Europe by aligning, harmonising and synchronising the national funding mechanisms of Participating States;\n(3)\npromote and increase the participation of SMEs without previous experience in transnational research.\nArticle 4\nParticipation in and partnership with Eurostars-2\n1.

The partner countries are EUREKA members or countries associated with Eureka. The EU participates in this joint programme on the basis of Article 185 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (public-public partnership).\nObjectives\nEurostars-2 aims to contribute to the further alignment and synchronisation of national R & D programmes. This is in order to achieve stronger scientific, management and financial integration of R & D across Europe.\nIt seeks to support research-performing SMEs (see below) to increase their knowledge and research intensity — and thus their innovative capacity — so as to expand their business activities into larger, often international, markets. This contributes to competitiveness, growth and job creation.\nDefinition\nA ‘research and development-performing SME’ is defined as an SME which meets at least one of the following conditions:\nit reinvests at least 10 % of its turnover in R & D activities;\nit dedicates at least 10 % of its full-time equivalents (or the same number of hours worked by part-time staff) to R & D activities;\nit has at least 5 full-time equivalents (for SMEs with fewer than 100 full-time equivalents) or 10 full-time equivalents (for SMEs with over 100 full-time equivalents) for R & D activities.\nParticipation and funding\nParticipation of legal entities under Eurostars-2 projects takes place in line with Horizon 2020 rules for participation and dissemination (Regulation (EU) No 1290/2013) and the specific derogations contained in this Eurostars-2 decision. Other legal entities, such as universities and research institutes, may also participate in Eurostars-2 projects.\nLegal entities from Eurostars-2 partner countries are not eligible for an EU financial contribution. The funding rules of the participating national programmes apply to Eurostars-2 grants which are channelled through National Funding Bodies (NFBs) to final beneficiaries. Further rules on eligibility for participation and funding are detailed in Eurostars-2 annual work plans.\nProjects\nEurostars-2 projects are ‘bottom up’, transnational and focus on results that have  market potential, i.e. within 2 years of the completion of an activity, the results of the projects are expected to be introduced on the market.\nImplementation\nESE, the Eureka Secretariat, has been designated by the participating countries to implement Eurostars-2. ESE concludes bilateral agreements with NFBs which set out the responsibilities of the parties in relation to Eurostars-2 rules, objectives and implementation arrangements.\nESE organises the calls for proposals, the peer review (evaluation of work by one or more people of similar competence to the producers of the work (peers)), the selection and the monitoring of projects, as well as the allocation of the EU contribution.\nBudget\nThe EU is contributing € 287 million to Eurostars-2 projects over the 2014–2024 period. This contribution is equivalent to at least one-third of the contribution provided by the national budgets of participating countries.\nSome funding also comes from participating organisations.\nThe EU’s financial contribution is subject to formal commitments from the participating states. Financial support mainly takes the form of grants to selected projects.\nFROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?\n              \nIt has applied since 27 June 2014.\nBACKGROUND\n              \nFor more information, see:\n‘What is Eurostars’ on the Eureka website.\nMAIN DOCUMENT\nDecision No 553/2014/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 May 2014 on the participation of the Union in a research and development programme jointly undertaken by several Member States aimed at supporting research and development performing small and medium-sized enterprises (OJ L 169, 7.6.2014, pp. 1–13)\nRELATED ACTS\n            \nRegulation (EU) No 1291/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 December 2013 establishing Horizon 2020 — the framework programme for research and innovation (2014–20) and repealing Decision No 1982/2006/EC (OJ L 347, 20.12.2013, pp. 104–173)\nSuccessive amendments and corrections to Regulation (Euratom) No 1291/2013 have been incorporated in to the original document.
