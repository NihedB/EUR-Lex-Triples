The study was developed together with stakeholders and interested parties from the Union and the results have been have made publicly available. Transformers are considered as energy related products within the meaning of Article 2(1) of Directive 2009/125/EC.\n(2)\nThe study showed that energy in the use phase is the most significant environmental aspect that can be addressed through product design. Significant amounts of raw materials (copper, iron, resin, aluminium) are used in the manufacturing of transformers, but market mechanisms seem to be ensuring an adequate end-of-life treatment, and therefore it is not necessary to establish related ecodesign requirements.\n(3)\nEcodesign requirements set out in Annex I apply to products placed on the market or put into service wherever they are installed. Therefore such requirements cannot be made dependant on the application in which the product is used.\n(4)\nTransformers are usually purchased under framework agreements. In this context, purchase refers to the act of contracting with the manufacturer for the delivery of a given volume of transformers. The contract is deemed to have come into force on the date of signature by the parties.\n(5)\nCertain categories of transformers should not be covered by this Regulation, due to their specific function,. The energy consumption and saving potential of such transformers is negligible compared to other transformers.\n(6)\nRegulatory concessions are granted because of the weight limitations for mounting transformers on utility poles. In order to avoid misuse of transformers specifically manufactured for pole-mounted operation, they should include a visible display ‘For pole-mounted operation only’, so as to facilitate the work of national market surveillance authorities.\n(7)\nRegulatory concessions are granted to transformers equipped with equipment capable of performing voltage regulation functions to integrate distributed generation from renewable sources into the distribution grid. Such concessions should gradually be phased out as this emerging technology matures and measurement standards become available to separate the losses associated to the core transformer from those associated to the equipment performing additional functions.\n(8)\nEcodesign requirements for the energy performance/efficiency of medium power transformers and for the energy efficiency of large power transformers should be set with a view to harmonising ecodesign requirements for these devices throughout the Union. Such requirements would also contribute to the efficient functioning of the internal market and to improving Member States' environmental performance.\n(9)\nEstablishment of ecodesign requirements for medium and large power transformers is also necessary to increase the market penetration of technologies and design options improving their energy performance or efficiency. Total losses of the transformers fleet in the EU27 in 2008 amounted to 93,4 TWh per year. The cost-effective improvement potential through more efficient design has been estimated in about 16,2 TWh per year in 2025, which corresponds to 3,7 Mt of CO2 emissions.\n(10)\nIt is necessary to provide for a staged entry into force of the ecodesign requirements in order to provide an appropriate timeframe for manufacturers to redesign their products. Time limits for the implementation of those requirements should be set taking into account impacts on the costs for manufacturers, in particular small and medium size enterprises, while ensuring timely achievement of the policy objectives.\n(11)\nTo allow an effective implementation of the regulation, National Regulating Authorities are strongly advised to take account of the effect of minimum efficiency requirements on the initial cost of the transformer and to allow for the installation of more efficient transformers than the regulation requires, whenever these are economically justified on a whole life cycle basis, including an adequate evaluation of losses reduction.\n(12)\nTo facilitate compliance checks, manufacturers should be asked to provide information in the technical documentation referred to in Annexes IV and V to Directive 2009/125/EC.\n(13)\nThe measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee established by Article 19(1) of Directive 2009/125/EC,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nArticle 1\nSubject matter and scope\n1.

The Member States authorities shall provide all relevant information, including the test results if applicable, to the authorities of the other Member States and the Commission within one month of the decision being taken on the non-compliance of the model.\nMember States authorities shall use the measurement methods and calculation methods set out in Annex II.\nGiven the weight and size limitations in the transportation of medium and large power transformers, Member States authorities may decide to undertake the verification procedure at the premises of manufacturers, before they are put into service in their final destination.\nThe verification tolerances set out in this Annex relate only to the verification of the measured parameters by Member States authorities and shall not be used by the manufacturer or importer as an allowed tolerance to establish the values in the technical documentation.\nTable\nMeasured parameter\nVerification tolerances\nLoad losses\nThe measured value shall not be greater than the declared value by more than 5 %.\nNo load losses\nThe measured value shall not be greater than the declared value by more than 5 %.\nThe electrical power required by the cooling system for no load operation\nThe measured value shall not be greater than the declared value by more than 5 %.\nANNEX IV\nIndicative Benchmarks\nAt the time of adoption of this Regulation, the best available technology on the market for medium power transformers was identified as follows:\n(a)\nLiquid-immersed medium power transformers: Ao – 20 %, Ak – 20 %\n(b)\nDry-type medium power transformers: Ao – 20 %, Ak – 20 %\n(c)\nMedium power transformers with amorphous steel core: Ao – 50 %, Ak – 50 %\nThe availability of material to manufacture transformers with amorphous steel core needs further development, before such values of losses can be considered to become minimum requirements in the future.", "summary": "Ecodesign requirements — power transformers\nEcodesign requirements — power transformers\nSUMMARY OF:\nRegulation (EU) No 548/2014 with regard to small, medium and large power transformers\nWHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?\nRegulation (EU) No 548/2014, implementing Directive 2009/125/EC, sets out ecodesign* requirements for placing on the market or putting into service power transformers with a minimum power rating of 1 kVA used in 50 Hz electricity transmission and distribution networks or for industrial applications.\nExperience in the implementation of Directive 2009/125/EC revealed that there were national deviations in standard voltages in electricity distribution grids in certain EU countries. These deviations justified changing the threshold voltage levels in the categorisation of transformers and the applicable minimum energy performance requirements. Regulation (EU) 2019/1783 therefore amends Regulation (EU) No 548/2014.\nKEY POINTS\nThe regulation applies to transformers purchased after 11 June 2014.\nMedium* and large transformers*, regardless of when put on the market or into service, must be reassessed for compliance and conformity with the regulation if: the core or part of the core has been replaced; andone or more of the complete windings has been replaced.\nTransformers designed for a number of specific purposes are excluded from the regulation including those to be: directly connected to a furnace;installed on fixed or floating offshore platforms, offshore wind turbines or on board ships and all kinds of vessels;used in arc-welding equipment or resistance-welding equipment.\nThe ecodesign requirements are set out in the annexes to the regulation.\nThe regulation sets out the conformity assessment procedure.\nChanges introduced under Regulation (EU) 2019/1783\nThese changes include:\nif threshold voltages in electricity distribution networks deviate from the standard ones across the EU, EU countries must notify the European Commission accordingly, so that a public notification can be made for the correct interpretation of the various tables in Annex I to the regulation (ecodesign requirements);\nthe manufacturer, importer or authorised representative must not put on the market any products that can detect when they are being tested and change their performance accordingly;\nto make verification testing easier, market surveillance authorities are permitted to test, or witness the testing of, larger transformers at premises such as those of the manufacturer;\nthe Commission will review the regulation and present the results no later than 1 July 2023.\nFROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?\n              \nRegulation (EU) No 548/2014 has applied since 11 June 2014. The changes introduced by amending Regulation (EU) 2019/1783 have applied since 14 November 2019.\nBACKGROUND\n              \nDirective 2009/125/EC establishes a framework to set ecodesign requirements for energy-related products. The Commission must set these for products which are widely sold and traded in the EU and have a significant environmental impact.\nFor more information see:\nPower transformers: Ecodesign requirements (European Commission)\nThe new ecodesign measures explained (European Commission)\nAbout the energy label and ecodesign — Energy savings (European Commission).\nKEY TERMS\n              \nEcodesign: Policy to improve, through better design, products’ environmental performance throughout their life cycle, especially their energy efficiency.\nMedium power transformers: a power transformer with all windings having rated power lower than or equal to 3 150 kVA, and highest voltage for equipment greater than 1.1 kV and lower than or equal to 36 kV.\nLarge power transformers: a power transformer with at least one winding having either rated power greater than 3 150 kVA or highest voltage for equipment greater than 36 kV.\nMAIN DOCUMENT\n            \nCommission Regulation (EU) No 548/2014 of 21 May 2014 on implementing Directive 2009/125/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council with regard to small, medium and large power transformers (OJ L 152, 22.5.2014, pp. 1-15)\nSuccessive amendments to Regulation (EU) No 548/2014 have been incorporated into the original text.
