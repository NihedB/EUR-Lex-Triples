These are listed in its appendices.\nAppendix I includes species threatened with extinction and for which trade must be strictly regulated and only authorised in exceptional circumstances.\nAppendix II includes species that, though not necessarily threatened with imminent extinction, may become so unless trade is strictly regulated. To facilitate more effective control of these species, the appendix can include also lookalike species — those that look similar to species that are endangered.\nAppendix III includes species that are regulated by a party and for which the cooperation of other parties is needed in order to control their exploitation through international trade.\nPermits and certificates\nPermits and certificates are used under CITES to regulate and monitor trade in endangered species. They are issued by the designated managing authorities of each party (in the EU, by the authorities of the Member States).\nPermits and certificates are issued only if certain conditions are fulfilled. Depending on the category of species, these include: whether trade would be detrimental for the species’ survival;whether the specimen was acquired legally;in the case of live animals, the conditions for transport and housing.\nSpecies in Appendix I cannot be traded for commercial purposes.\nScientific authorities advise managing authorities on the granting of export permits to ensure the conservation status of species in Appendix II remains well above the level for inclusion in Appendix I.\nThere are a number of exemptions from some of these rules, including for: specimens acquired before the convention became applicable to them;transits and transshipments through a party’s territory where the specimen remains under customs control;captive-bred animals and artificially propagated plants;the exchange of specimens in the collections of scientists and scientific institutions and of captive-bred or pre-convention specimens held by travelling exhibitions.\nMonitoring and enforcement\nParties are required to take appropriate measures to: penalise illegal trade in, or possession of specimens covered by CITES rules;confiscate or return to the country of export specimens seized in illegal trade.\nParties must record and report all trade data to the CITES secretariat on an annual basis. The European Commission also produces an analysis of the EU's annual trade report.\nParties submit a triennial report to the secretariat on the legal rules and measures taken to enforce CITES.\nDATE OF ENTRY INTO FORCE\n              \nThe convention entered into force for the EU as a party on 8 July 2015.\nBACKGROUND\nTrade in protected species of wild fauna and flora is regulated by Regulation (EC) No 338/97 — see summary.\nCITES is implemented in the EU through a set of regulations known as the EU wildlife trade regulations.\nThe EU also has an action plan against wildlife trafficking (see summary). The original action plan ran until 2020 and is due for revision in line with the EU biodiversity strategy for 2030 (see summary).\nFor more information, see:\nThe European Union and Trade in Wild Fauna and Flora (European Commission).\nMAIN DOCUMENTS\n            \nConvention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (OJ L 75, 19.3.2015, pp. 4–15)\nCouncil Decision (EU) 2015/451 of 6 March 2015 concerning the accession of the European Union to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) (OJ L 75, 19.3.2015, pp. 1–3)\nRELATED DOCUMENTS\n            \nCommission Regulation (EC) No 865/2006 of 4 May 2006 laying down detailed rules concerning the implementation of Council Regulation (EC) No 338/97 on the protection of species of wild fauna and flora by regulating trade therein (OJ L 166, 19.6.2006, pp. 1–69)\nSee consolidated version\nCommission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2019/1587 of 24 September 2019 prohibiting the introduction into the Union of specimens of certain species of wild fauna and flora in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) No 338/97 on the protection of species of wild fauna and flora by regulating trade therein (OJ L 248, 27.9.2019, pp. 5–21)\nCommunication from the Commission to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions — EU Action Plan against Wildlife Trafficking (COM(2016) 87 final, 26.2.2016)\nCommission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 792/2012 of 23 August 2012 laying down rules for the design of permits, certificates and other documents provided for in Council Regulation (EC) No 338/97 on the protection of species of wild fauna and flora by regulating trade therein and amending Commission Regulation (EC) No 865/2006 (OJ L 242, 7.9.2012, pp. 13–45)\nSuccessive amendments to Regulation (EU) No 792/2012 have been incorporated into the original text.
