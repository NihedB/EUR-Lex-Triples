{"celex_id": "32014R0251", "reference": "20.3.2014\nEN\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\nL 84/14\nREGULATION (EU) No 251/2014 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL\nof 26 February 2014\non the definition, description, presentation, labelling and the protection of geographical indications of aromatised wine products and repealing Council Regulation (EEC) No 1601/91\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 43(2) and Article 114 thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative act to the national Parliaments,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee (1),\nActing in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure (2),\nWhereas:\n(1)\nCouncil Regulation (EEC) No 1601/91 (3) and Commission Regulation (EC) No 122/94 (4) have proved successful in regulating aromatised wines, aromatised wine-based drinks and aromatised wine-product cocktails (‘aromatised wine products’). However, in the light of technologic innovation, market developments and evolving consumer expectations it is necessary to update the rules applicable to the definition, description, presentation, labelling and protection of geographical indications of certain aromatised wine products, while taking into account traditional production methods.\n(2)\nFurther amendments are needed as a consequence of the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty, in order to align the powers conferred upon the Commission pursuant to Regulation (EEC) No 1601/91 to Articles 290 and 291 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). In view of the scope of those amendments, it is appropriate to repeal Regulation (EEC) No 1601/91 and to replace it with this Regulation. Regulation (EC) No 122/94 introduced rules on flavouring and addition of alcohol applicable to some aromatised wine products, and in order to ensure clarity, those rules should be incorporated into this Regulation.\n(3)\nRegulation (EU) No 1169/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council (5) applies to the presentation and labelling of aromatised wine products, save as otherwise provided for in this Regulation.\n(4)\nAromatised wine products are important for consumers, producers and the agricultural sector in the Union. The measures applicable to aromatised wine products should contribute to the attainment of a high level of consumer protection, the prevention of deceptive practices and the attainment of market transparency and fair competition. By doing so, the measures will safeguard the reputation that the Union’s aromatised wine products have achieved in the internal market and on the world market by continuing to take into account the traditional practices used in the production of aromatised wine products as well as increased demand for consumer protection and information. Technological innovation should also be taken into account in respect of the products for which such innovation serves to improve quality, without affecting the traditional character of the aromatised wine products concerned.\n(5)\nThe production of aromatised wine products constitutes a major outlet for the agricultural sector of the Union, which should be emphasised by the regulatory framework.\n(6)\nIn the interest of consumers, this Regulation should apply to all aromatised wine products placed on the market in the Union, whether produced in the Member States or in third countries. In order to maintain and improve the reputation of the Union’s aromatised wine products on the world market, the rules provided for in this Regulation should also apply to aromatised wine products produced in the Union for export.\n(7)\nTo ensure clarity and transparency in Union law governing aromatised wine products, it is necessary to clearly define the products covered by that law, the criteria for the production, description, presentation and labelling of aromatised wine products and in particular, the sales denomination. Specific rules on the voluntary indication of the provenance supplementing those laid down in Regulation (EU) No 1169/2011 should also be laid down. By laying down such rules, all stages in the production chain are regulated and consumers are protected and properly informed.\n(8)\nThe definitions of aromatised wine products should continue to respect traditional quality practices but should be updated and improved in the light of technological developments.\n(9)\nAromatised wine products should be produced in accordance with certain rules and restrictions, which guarantee that consumer expectations as regards quality and production methods are met. In order to meet the international standards in this field, the production methods should be established and the Commission should as a general rule take into account the standards recommended and published by the International Organisation of Vine and Wine (OIV).\n(10)\nRegulation (EC) No 1333/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council (6) and Regulation (EC) No 1334/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council (7) should apply to aromatised wine products.\n(11)\nMoreover, the ethyl alcohol used for the production of aromatised wine products should be exclusively of agricultural origin, so as to meet consumer expectations and conform to traditional quality practices. This will also ensure an outlet for basic agricultural products.\n(12)\nGiven the importance and complexity of the aromatised wine products sector, it is appropriate to lay down specific rules on the description and presentation of aromatised wine products supplementing the labelling provisions laid down in Regulation (EU) No 1169/2011. Those specific rules should also prevent the misuse of sales denominations of aromatised wine products in the case of products which do not meet the requirements set out in this Regulation.\n(13)\nWith a view to facilitating consumers’ understanding, it should be possible to supplement the sales denominations laid down in this Regulation with the customary name of the product within the meaning of Regulation (EU) No 1169/2011.\n(14)\nCouncil Regulation (EC) No 834/2007 (8) applies, inter alia, to processed agricultural products for use as food, which includes aromatised wine products. Accordingly, aromatised wine products which meet the requirements laid down in that Regulation and the acts adopted pursuant to it may be placed on the market as organic aromatised wine products.\n(15)\nIn applying a quality policy and in order to allow a high level of quality of aromatised wine products with a geographical indication, Member States should be allowed to adopt stricter rules than those laid down in this Regulation on the production, description, presentation and labelling of aromatised wine products with a geographical indication that are produced in their own territory, in so far as such rules are compatible with Union law.\n(16)\nGiven that Regulation (EC) No 110/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council (9), Regulation (EU) No 1151/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council (10), and the provisions on geographical indications in Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council (11) do not apply to aromatised wine products, specific rules on protection of geographical indications for aromatised wine products should be laid down. Geographical indications should be used to identify aromatised wine products as originating in the territory of a country, or a region or locality in that territory, where a given quality, reputation or other characteristic of the aromatised wine product is essentially attributable to its geographical origin and such geographical indications should be registered by the Commission.\n(17)\nA procedure for the registration, compliance, alteration and possible cancellation of third country and Union geographical indications should be laid down in this Regulation.\n(18)\nMember State authorities should be responsible for ensuring compliance with this Regulation, and arrangements should be made for the Commission to be able to monitor and verify such compliance.\n(19)\nIn order to supplement or amend certain non-essential elements of this Regulation, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the TFEU should be delegated to the Commission in respect of the establishment of production processes for obtaining aromatised wine products; criteria for the demarcation of geographical areas and rules, restrictions and derogations related to production in such areas; the conditions under which a product specification may include additional requirements; the determination of the cases in which a single producer may apply for the protection of a geographical indication and the restrictions governing the type of applicant that may apply for such protection; the establishment of the conditions to be complied with in respect of an application for the protection of a geographical indication, scrutiny by the Commission, the objection procedure and procedures for amendment and cancellation of geographical indications; the establishment of the conditions applicable to trans-border applications; the setting of the date for the submission of an application or a request, the date from which the protection applies and the date on which an amendment to a protection applies; the establishment of the conditions relating to amendments to product specifications, including the conditions when an amendment is considered minor and the conditions relating to the applications for, and approval of, amendments, which do not involve any change to the single document; the restrictions regarding the protected name; the nature and type of information to be notified in the exchange of information between Member States and the Commission, the methods of notification, the rules related to the access rights to information or information systems made available and the modalities of publication of the information. It is of particular importance that the Commission carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level. The Commission, when preparing and drawing up delegated acts, should ensure a simultaneous, timely and appropriate transmission of relevant documents to the European Parliament and to the Council.\n(20)\nIn order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of this Regulation with regard to the methods of analysis for determining the composition of aromatised wine products; decisions on conferring protection on geographical indications and on rejecting applications for such protection; decisions on cancelling the protection of geographical indications and of existing geographical designations; decisions on approval of application for amendments in the case of minor amendments to the product specifications; the information to be provided in the product specification with regard to the definition of geographical indication; the means of making decisions on protection or rejection of geographical indications available to the public; relating to the submission of trans-border applications; checks and verifications to be carried out by Member States; the procedure, including admissibility, for the examination of applications for protection or for the approval of an amendment of a geographical indication, and the procedure, including admissibility, for requests for objection, cancellation or conversion and the submission of information relating to existing geographical designations; administrative and physical checks to be carried out by Member States; and rules on providing the information necessary for the application of the provision concerning the exchange of information between Member States and the Commission, the arrangements for the management of the information to be notified, the content, form, timing, frequency and deadlines of the notifications and arrangements for transmitting or making information and documents available to the Member States, the competent authorities in third countries, or the public; implementing power should be conferred on the Commission. Those implementing powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council (12).\n(21)\nThe Commission should, by means of implementing acts and, given their special nature, acting without applying Regulation (EU) No 182/2011, publish the single document in the Official Journal of the European Union, decide whether to reject an application for protection of a geographical indication on grounds of inadmissibility and establish and maintain a register of geographical indications protected under this Regulation, including the listing of existing geographical designations in that register or their removal from the register.\n(22)\nThe transition from the rules provided for in Regulation (EEC) No 1601/91 to those laid down in this Regulation could give rise to difficulties which are not dealt with in this Regulation. For that purpose, the power to adopt the necessary transitional measures should be delegated to the Commission.\n(23)\nSufficient time and appropriate arrangements should be allowed to facilitate a smooth transition from the rules provided for in Regulation (EEC) No 1601/91 to the rules laid down in this Regulation. In any event the marketing of existing stocks should be allowed after the application of this Regulation, until those stocks are exhausted.\n(24)\nSince the objectives of this Regulation, namely the establishment of the rules on the definition, description, presentation and labelling of aromatised wine products and rules on the protection of geographical indications of aromatised wine products, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States but can rather, by reason of its scale and effects, be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives,\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nCHAPTER I\nSCOPE AND DEFINITIONS\nArticle 1\nSubject matter and scope\n1.   This Regulation lays down rules on the definition, description, presentation and labelling of aromatised wine products as well as on the protection of geographical indications of aromatised wine products.\n2.   Regulation (EU) No 1169/2011 shall apply to the presentation and labelling of aromatised wine products, save as otherwise provided for in this Regulation.\n3.   This Regulation shall apply to all aromatised wine products placed on the market in the Union whether produced in the Member States or in third countries, as well as to those produced in the Union for export.\nArticle 2\nDefinitions\nFor the purpose of this Regulation, the following definitions apply:\n(1)\n‘sales denomination’ means the name of any of the aromatised wine products laid down in this Regulation;\n(2)\n‘description’ means the list of the specific characteristics of an aromatised wine product;\n(3)\n‘geographical indication’ means an indication which identifies an aromatised wine product as originating in a region, a specific place, or a country, where a given quality, reputation or other characteristics of that product is essentially attributable to its geographical origin.\nCHAPTER II\nDEFINITION, DESCRIPTION, PRESENTATION AND LABELLING OF AROMATISED WINE PRODUCTS\nArticle 3\nDefinition and classification of aromatised wine products\n1.   Aromatised wine products are products obtained from products of the wine sector as referred to in Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 that have been flavoured.

Aromatised wine products shall be produced in accordance with the requirements, restrictions and descriptions laid down in Annexes I and II.\n2.   The Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 33 concerning the establishment of authorised production processes for obtaining aromatised wine products, taking into account consumers’ expectations.\nIn establishing the authorised production processes referred to in the first subparagraph, the Commission shall take into account the production processes recommended and published by the OIV.\n3.   The Commission shall, where necessary, adopt, by means of implementing acts, methods of analysis for determining the composition of aromatised wine products. Those methods shall be based on any relevant methods recommended and published by the OIV, unless they would be ineffective or inappropriate in view of the objective pursued. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 34(2).\nPending the adoption of such methods by the Commission, the methods to be used shall be those allowed by the Member State concerned.\n4.   The oenological practices and restrictions laid down in accordance with Articles 74, 75(4) and 80 of Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 shall apply to the grapevine products used in the production of aromatised wine products.\nArticle 5\nSales denominations\n1.   The sales denominations set out in Annex II shall be used for any aromatised wine product placed on the market in the Union, provided that it complies with the requirements for the corresponding sales denomination laid down in that Annex. Sales denominations may be supplemented by a customary name as defined in Article 2(2)(o) of Regulation (EU) No 1169/2011.\n2.   Where aromatised wine products comply with the requirements of more than one sales denomination, the use of only one of those sales denominations is authorised, except where Annex II provides otherwise.\n3.   An alcoholic beverage not fulfilling the requirements laid down in this Regulation shall not be described, presented or labelled by associating words or phrases such as ‘like’, ‘type’, ‘style’, ‘made’, ‘flavour’ or any other term similar to any of the sales denominations.\n4.   Sales denominations may be supplemented or replaced by a geographical indication protected under this Regulation.\n5.   Without prejudice to Article 26, sales denominations shall not be supplemented by protected designations of origin or protected geographical indications allowed for wine products.\nArticle 6\nAdditional particulars to the sales denominations\n1.   The sales denominations referred to in Article 5 may also be supplemented by the following particulars concerning the sugar content of the aromatised wine product:\n(a)   ‘extra-dry’: in the case of products with a sugar content of less than 30 grams per litre and, for the category of aromatised wines and by way of derogation from Article 3(2)(g), a minimum total alcoholic strength by volume of 15 % vol.;\n(b)   ‘dry’: in the case of products with a sugar content of less than 50 grams per litre and, for the category of aromatised wines and by way of derogation from Article 3(2)(g), a minimum total alcoholic strength by volume of 16 % vol.;\n(c)   ‘semi-dry’: in the case of products with a sugar content of between 50 and less than 90 grams per litre;\n(d)   ‘semi-sweet’: in the case of products with a sugar content of between 90 and less than 130 grams per litre;\n(e)   ‘sweet’: in the case of products with a sugar content of 130 grams per litre or more.\nThe sugar content indicated in points (a) to (e) of the first subparagraph is expressed as invert sugar.\nThe particulars ‘semi-sweet’ and ‘sweet’ may be accompanied by an indication of the sugar content, expressed in grams of invert sugar per litre.\n2.   Where the sales denomination is supplemented by or includes the particular ‘sparkling’, the quantity of sparkling wine used shall be not less than 95 %.\n3.   Sales denominations may also be supplemented by a reference to the main flavouring used.\nArticle 7\nIndication of provenance\nWhere the provenance of aromatised wine products is indicated, it shall correspond to the place where the aromatised wine product is produced. The provenance shall be indicated with the words ‘produced in (…)’, or expressed in equivalent terms, supplemented by the name of the corresponding Member State or third country.\nArticle 8\nUse of language in the presentation and labelling of aromatised wine products\n1.

Where the application for protection concerns a geographical area in a third country, it shall contain in addition to the elements provided for in Article 10, proof that the name in question is protected in its country of origin.\n2.   The application for protection shall be sent to the Commission, either directly by the applicant or via the authorities of the third country concerned.\n3.   The application for protection shall be filed in one of the official languages of the Union or accompanied by a certified translation into one of those languages.\nArticle 12\nApplicants\n1.   Any interested group of producers, or in exceptional cases a single producer, may lodge an application for protection of a geographical indication. Other interested parties may participate in the application for protection.\n2.   Producers may lodge an application for protection only for aromatised wine products which they produce.\n3.   In the case of a name designating a trans-border geographical area, a joint application for protection may be lodged.\nArticle 13\nPreliminary national procedure\n1.   Applications for protection of a geographical indication of aromatised wine products originating in the Union shall be subject to a preliminary national procedure in accordance with paragraphs 2 to 7 of this Article.\n2.   The application for protection shall be filed with the Member State in whose territory the geographical indication originates.\n3.   The Member State shall examine the application for protection in order to verify whether it meets the conditions set out in this Chapter.\nThe Member State shall, by means of a national procedure, ensure the adequate publication of the application for protection and shall provide for a period of at least two months from the date of publication within which any natural or legal person with a legitimate interest and resident or established on its territory may object to the proposed protection by lodging a duly substantiated statement with the Member State.\n4.   If the Member State considers that the geographical indication does not meet the relevant requirements or is incompatible with Union law in general, it shall reject the application.\n5.   If the Member State considers that the relevant requirements are met, it shall:\n(a)\npublish the single document and the product specification at least on the internet; and\n(b)\nforward to the Commission an application for protection containing the following information:\n(i)\nthe name and address of the applicant;\n(ii)\nthe product specification referred in Article 10(2);\n(iii)\nthe single document referred to in Article 10(1)(d);\n(iv)\na declaration by the Member State that it considers that the application lodged by the applicant meets the conditions required; and\n(v)\nthe reference to the publication, as referred to in point (a).\nThe information referred to in point (b) of the first subparagraph shall be forwarded in one of the official languages of the Union or accompanied by a certified translation into one of those languages.\n6.   Member States shall adopt the laws, regulations or administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Article by 28 March 2015.\n7.   Where a Member State has no national legislation concerning the protection of geographical indications, it may, on a transitional basis only, grant protection to the name in accordance with the terms of this Chapter at national level. Such protection shall take effect from the date the application is lodged with the Commission and shall cease on the date on which a decision on registration or refusal under this Chapter is taken.\nArticle 14\nScrutiny by the Commission\n1.   The Commission shall make the date of submission of the application for protection public.\n2.   The Commission shall examine whether the applications for protection referred to in Article 13(5) meet the conditions laid down in this Chapter.\n3.   Where the Commission considers that the conditions laid down in this Chapter are met, it shall, by means of implementing acts adopted without applying the procedure referred to in Article 34(2), publish in the Official Journal of the European Union the single document referred to in Article 10(1)(d) and the reference to the publication of the product specification referred to in Article 13(5)(a).\n4.   Where the Commission considers that the conditions laid down in this Chapter are not met, it shall, by means of implementing acts, decide to reject the application. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 34(2).\nArticle 15\nObjection procedure\nWithin two months from the date of publication provided for in Article 14(3), any Member State or third country, or any natural or legal person with a legitimate interest, resident or established in a Member State other than that applying for the protection or in a third country, may object to the proposed protection by lodging with the Commission a duly substantiated statement relating to the conditions of eligibility as laid down in this Chapter.\nIn the case of natural or legal persons resident or established in a third country, such statement shall be lodged, either directly or via the authorities of the third country concerned, within the time limit of two months referred to in the first paragraph.\nArticle 16\nDecision on protection\nOn the basis of the information available to the Commission upon the completion of the objection procedure referred to in Article 15, the Commission shall, by means of implementing acts, either confer protection on the geographical indication which meets the conditions laid down in this Chapter and is compatible with Union law, or reject the application where those conditions are not met. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 34(2).\nArticle 17\nHomonyms\n1.   A name, for which an application for protection is lodged, and which is wholly or partially homonymous with that of a name already registered under this Regulation, shall be registered with due regard for local and traditional usage and for any risk of confusion.\n2.   A homonymous name which misleads the consumer into believing that products come from another territory shall not be registered even if the name is accurate as far as the actual territory, region or place of origin of the products in question is concerned.\n3.   The use of a registered homonymous name shall be subject to there being a sufficient distinction in practice between the homonym registered subsequently and the name already on the register, having regard to the need to treat the producers concerned in an equitable manner and not to mislead the consumer.\nArticle 18\nGrounds for refusal of protection\n1.   Names that have become generic shall not be protected as a geographical indication.\nFor the purposes of this Chapter, a ‘name that has become generic’ means the name of an aromatised wine product which, although relating to the place or the region where this product was originally produced or placed on the market, has become the common name of an aromatised wine product in the Union.\nTo establish whether or not a name has become generic, account shall be taken of all relevant factors, in particular:\n(a)\nthe existing situation in the Union, notably in areas of consumption;\n(b)\nthe relevant Union or national law.\n2.   A name shall not be protected as a geographical indication where, in the light of a trademark’s reputation and renown, protection is liable to mislead the consumer as to the true identity of the aromatised wine product.\nArticle 19\nRelationship with trademarks\n1.   Where a geographical indication is protected under this Regulation, the registration of a trademark the use of which falls under Article 20(2) and relating to an aromatised wine product shall be refused if the application for registration of the trademark is submitted after the date of submission of the application for protection of the geographical indication to the Commission and the geographical indication is subsequently protected.\nTrademarks registered in breach of the first subparagraph shall be invalidated.\n2.   Without prejudice to Article 17(2), a trademark the use of which falls under Article 20(2), which has been applied for, registered or established by use, if that possibility is provided for by the legislation concerned, in the territory of the Union before the date on which the application for protection of the geographical indication is submitted to the Commission, may continue to be used and renewed notwithstanding the protection of a geographical indication, provided that no grounds for the trademark’s invalidity or revocation exist as specified by the Directive 2008/95/EC of the European Parliament of the Council (13) or by Council Regulation (EC) No 207/2009 (14).\nIn such cases the use of the geographical indication shall be permitted alongside the relevant trademarks.\nArticle 20\nProtection\n1.   Geographical indications protected under this Regulation may be used by any operator marketing an aromatised wine product which has been produced in conformity with the corresponding product specification.\n2.   Geographical indications protected under this Regulation and the aromatised wine products using those protected names in conformity with the product specification shall be protected against:\n(a)\nany direct or indirect commercial use of a protected name:\n(i)\nby comparable products not complying with the product specification of the protected name; or\n(ii)\nin so far as such use exploits the reputation of a geographical indication;\n(b)\nany misuse, imitation or evocation, even if the true origin of the product or service is indicated or if the protected name is translated, transcribed or transliterated or accompanied by an expression such as ‘style’, ‘type’, ‘method’, ‘as produced in’, ‘imitation’, ‘flavour’, ‘like’ or similar;\n(c)\nany other false or misleading indication as to the provenance, origin, nature or essential qualities of the product, on the inner or outer packaging, advertising material or documents relating to the wine product concerned, and the packing of the product in a container liable to convey a false impression as to its origin;\n(d)\nany other practice liable to mislead the consumer as to the true origin of the product.\n3.   Geographical indications protected under this Regulation shall not become generic in the Union within the meaning of Article 18(1).\n4.   Member States shall take the appropriate administrative and judicial measures to prevent or to stop unlawful use of geographical indications protected under this Regulation as referred to in paragraph 2.\nArticle 21\nRegister\nThe Commission shall, by means of implementing acts adopted without applying the procedure referred to in Article 34(2), establish and maintain an electronic register of geographical indications protected under this Regulation for aromatised wine products which shall be publicly accessible.\nGeographical indications pertaining to products of third countries that are protected in the Union pursuant to an international agreement to which the Union is a contracting party may be entered in the register referred to in the first paragraph as geographical indications protected under this Regulation.\nArticle 22\nDesignation of competent authority\n1.   Member States shall designate the competent authority or authorities responsible for checks in respect of the obligations established by this Chapter in accordance with the criteria laid down in Article 4 of Regulation (EC) No 882/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council (15).\n2.   Member States shall ensure that any operator complying with this Chapter is entitled to be covered by a system of checks.\n3.
