Such disparities, together with the absence of such legislation in some Member States, would be liable to create unnecessary barriers to trade and distortion of competition within the internal market.(5) National laws and provisions which, for the purposes of combating ground-level ozone, establish limit values for the content of VOCs in the products covered by this Directive therefore need to be harmonised in order to ensure that they do not restrict the free movement of these products.(6) Since the objective of the proposed action, namely reducing emissions of VOCs, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States, because emissions of VOCs in one Member State affect air quality in other Member States and reductions of VOC emissions can therefore, by reason of the scale and effects of the action, be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Directive does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve this objective.(7) The VOC content of paints, varnishes and vehicle refinishing products gives rise to significant emissions of VOCs into the air, which contribute to the local and transboundary formation of photochemical oxidants in the boundary layer of the troposphere.(8) The VOC content of certain paints and varnishes and vehicle refinishing products should therefore be reduced as much as is technically and economically feasible taking into account climatic conditions.(9) A high level of environmental protection requires the setting and achievement of content limit values for VOCs used in products covered by this Directive.(10) Provision should be made for transitional measures for products produced before the requirements of this Directive come into force.(11) Member States should be able to grant individual licences for the sale and purchase for specific purposes of products in strictly limited quantities which do not comply with the solvent limit values established by this Directive.(12) This Directive complements Community provisions on the labelling of chemical substances and preparations.(13) The protection of the health of consumers and/or workers and the protection of the working environment should not fall within the scope of this Directive, and measures taken by Member States for these purposes should therefore not be affected by this Directive.(14) Content limit values need to be monitored in order to determine whether the mass concentrations of VOCs found in each category of paints, varnishes and vehicle refinishing products covered by this Directive are within the permitted limits.(15) As the VOC content of products used for certain vehicle refinishing activities are now regulated under this Directive, Council Directive 1999/13/EC of 11 March 1999 on the limitation of emissions of volatile organic compounds due to the use of organic solvents in certain activities and installations(4) should be amended accordingly.(16) Member States should, nevertheless, be able to maintain or introduce national measures for the control of emissions from vehicle refinishing activities involving the coating of road vehicles as defined in Council Directive 70/156/EEC of 6 February 1970 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the type-approval of motor vehicles and their trailers(5), or part of them, carried out as part of vehicle repair, conservation or decoration outside of manufacturing installations.(17) This Directive should not apply to products sold for exclusive use in installations authorised according to Directive 1999/13/EC where emission limiting measures provide alternative means of achieving at least equivalent VOC emission reductions.(18) The Member States should lay down rules on penalties applicable to infringements of the provisions of this Directive and ensure that they are implemented. Those penalties should be effective, proportionate and dissuasive.(19) Member States should report to the Commission on the experience gained in the application of this Directive.(20) A review should be made both of the scope for reducing the VOC content of products outside the scope of this Directive and the possibility of further reducing the VOC limit values already provided for.(21) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Directive should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission(6),HAVE ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:Article 1Purpose and scope1.

This would prevent or reduce air pollution resulting from the contribution of VOCs to forming ozone in the troposphere, the lowest layer of the earth’s atmosphere.\nKEY POINTS\n              \nThe directive defines the technical specifications for certain paints and varnishes (excluding aerosols) and vehicle refinishing products. They are principally coatings applied to buildings or vehicles. These products are listed in subcategories in Annex I of the directive.\nThis directive complements Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008 on the labelling of chemical substances and preparations and places the responsibility on EU countries to ensure that the products concerned are on sale only when they have a VOC content which does not exceed the limits set out in Annex II of the directive (ranging from 30 to 750 grams/litre (g/l) for paints and varnishes) and comply with the labelling requirements. The label must indicate:\nthe subcategory of the product and the relevant VOC limit values in g/l;\nthe maximum content of VOC in g/l of the product in a ready-to-use condition.\nAnnex II of the directive also lists maximum VOC content limit values for vehicle refinishing products. The European Commission will adapt this list to take account of technical progress.\nEU countries must report the results of the monitoring programme to demonstrate compliance with the directive and the categories and quantities of products licensed. It must be reported to the Commission every 5 years. Countries must permit the free circulation of these products which, in their ready-for-use condition, comply with the directive’s requirements. They must also set penalties for infringing national rules adopted in line with the directive and make sure they are enforced.\nThe Commission submitted this report to the European Parliament and the Council, examining:\nthe broad potential to make reductions in the VOC content of products outside the directive’s scope, including aerosols for paints and varnishes;\nthe possible introduction, in a second phase, of a further reduction in the VOC content of vehicle refinishing products;\nany new aspect of the socioeconomic impact of the second phase as envisioned for paints and varnishes.\nThe Commission also submitted a report taking account of technological developments in the manufacture of paints, varnishes and vehicle refinishing products. This report examines the broad scope and potential for making further reductions in VOC content of products within the scope of the directive, including the possible distinction between paints used for interiors and exteriors.\nThe Paints Directive amended the previous VOC Solvent Emissions Directive (Directive 1999/13/EC which has since been repealed by 2010/75/EU, the Industrial Emissions Directive) removing the sub-activity of ‘Vehicle Refinishing’ (the painting of road vehicles carried out as part of vehicle repair, conservation or decoration away from manufacturing installations) from its scope. This activity now comes under the scope of the Paints Directive.\nAs an exception (‘derogation’), such compliance is not required for paints, varnishes and vehicle refinishing products to be used:\nfor activities listed in Annex VII (Part I) to Directive 2010/75/EU and regulated in accordance with its Chapter V, or\nfor the restoration and maintenance of buildings and vintage vehicles of historical and cultural value.\nThe monitoring and reporting requirements are, from 16 July 2021, repealed and replaced by Regulation (EU) 2019/1020 on a national market surveillance strategy.\nFROM WHEN DOES THE DIRECTIVE APPLY?\n              \nIt has applied since 30 April 2004 and had to become law in the EU countries by 30 October 2005.\nBACKGROUND\n              \nFor more information, see:\nThe Paints Directive (European Commission).\nKEY TERMS\n              \nVolatile organic compound (VOC): any organic compound with high vapour pressure at ordinary room temperature, and a boiling point below 250°C, causing large numbers of molecules to evaporate and enter the surrounding air.\nMAIN DOCUMENT\n            \nDirective 2004/42/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 April 2004 on the limitation of emissions of volatile organic compounds due to the use of organic solvents in certain paints and varnishes and vehicle refinishing products and amending Directive 1999/13/EC (OJ L 143, 30.4.2004, pp. 87-96)\nSuccessive amendments to Directive 2004/42/EC have been incorporated into the original text.

In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Directive does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve this objective.(7) The VOC content of paints, varnishes and vehicle refinishing products gives rise to significant emissions of VOCs into the air, which contribute to the local and transboundary formation of photochemical oxidants in the boundary layer of the troposphere.(8) The VOC content of certain paints and varnishes and vehicle refinishing products should therefore be reduced as much as is technically and economically feasible taking into account climatic conditions.(9) A high level of environmental protection requires the setting and achievement of content limit values for VOCs used in products covered by this Directive.(10) Provision should be made for transitional measures for products produced before the requirements of this Directive come into force.(11) Member States should be able to grant individual licences for the sale and purchase for specific purposes of products in strictly limited quantities which do not comply with the solvent limit values established by this Directive.(12) This Directive complements Community provisions on the labelling of chemical substances and preparations.(13) The protection of the health of consumers and/or workers and the protection of the working environment should not fall within the scope of this Directive, and measures taken by Member States for these purposes should therefore not be affected by this Directive.(14) Content limit values need to be monitored in order to determine whether the mass concentrations of VOCs found in each category of paints, varnishes and vehicle refinishing products covered by this Directive are within the permitted limits.(15) As the VOC content of products used for certain vehicle refinishing activities are now regulated under this Directive, Council directive 1999/13/ec of 11 March 1999 on the limitation of emissions of volatile organic compounds due to the use of organic solvents in certain activities and installations(4) should be amended accordingly.(16) Member States should, nevertheless, be able to maintain or introduce national measures for the control of emissions from vehicle refinishing activities involving the coating of road vehicles as defined in Council directive 70/156/eec of 6 February 1970 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the type-approval of motor vehicles and their trailers(5), or part of them, carried out as part of vehicle repair, conservation or decoration outside of manufacturing installations.(17) This Directive should not apply to products sold for exclusive use in installations authorised according to directive 1999/13/ec where emission limiting measures provide alternative means of achieving at least equivalent VOC emission reductions.(18) The Member States should lay down rules on penalties applicable to infringements of the provisions of this Directive and ensure that they are implemented. Those penalties should be effective, proportionate and dissuasive.(19) Member States should report to the Commission on the experience gained in the application of this Directive.(20) A review should be made both of the scope for reducing the VOC content of products outside the scope of this Directive and the possibility of further reducing the VOC limit values already provided for.(21) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Directive should be adopted in accordance with Council decision 1999/468/ec of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission(6),HAVE ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:Article 1Purpose and scope1. The purpose of this Directive is to limit the total content of VOCs in certain paints and varnishes and vehicle refinishing products in order to prevent or reduce air pollution resulting from the contribution of VOCs to the formation of tropospheric ozone.2.
