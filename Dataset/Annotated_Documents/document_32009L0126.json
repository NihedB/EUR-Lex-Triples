Emissions of VOCs, including petrol vapour, in one Member State can contribute to air quality problems in other Member States.\n(4)\nOzone is also a greenhouse gas and contributes to atmospheric warming and climate change.\n(5)\nDirective 94/63/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 December 1994 on the control of volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions resulting from the storage of petrol and its distribution from terminals to service stations (7) (Stage I petrol vapour recovery) aims to recover petrol vapour emitted from the storage and distribution of petrol between oil terminals and service stations.\n(6)\nPetrol vapour is also emitted during the refuelling of motor vehicles at service stations and should be recovered in a manner consistent with the provisions of Directive 94/63/EC.\n(7)\nVarious Community instruments have been developed and implemented to limit VOC emissions. However, further action is necessary to achieve the objectives for health and the environment established in the Sixth Community Environmental Action Programme and Directive 2001/81/EC.\n(8)\nWith a view to reducing lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions from road transport fuels, Directive 98/70/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 October 1998 relating to the quality of petrol and diesel fuels (8) will, from 1 January 2011, permit the placing on the market of petrol containing a larger proportion of biofuel components than was previously the case. This may lead to an increase in VOC emissions, because of the possibility for Member States to implement limited derogations from the vapour pressure requirements of that Directive.\n(9)\nExisting service stations may need to adapt existing infrastructure and it is preferable to install vapour recovery equipment when they undergo major refurbishment of the fuelling system (that is to say, significant alteration or renewal of the station infrastructure, particularly tanks and pipes), since this significantly reduces the cost of the necessary adaptations. However, larger existing stations are better able to adapt and should install petrol vapour recovery earlier, given that they make a greater contribution to emissions. New service stations can integrate petrol vapour recovery equipment during the design and construction of the service station and can therefore install such equipment immediately.\n(10)\nThe fuel tanks of newly manufactured motor vehicles contain no petrol vapour. A derogation is therefore appropriate for the first fuelling of such vehicles.\n(11)\nAlthough several Member States have national requirements concerning Stage II petrol vapour recovery systems, there is no Community legislation. Therefore, it is appropriate to establish a uniform minimum level of petrol vapour recovery in order to deliver a high level of environmental benefit and to facilitate trade in petrol vapour recovery equipment.\n(12)\nPeriodic checks of all installed Stage II petrol vapour recovery equipment should be performed in order to ensure that petrol vapour recovery equipment produces real reductions in emissions. Member States may decide that checks are to be performed by one or more of the following: official inspection services, the operator itself or a third party. In the case of official inspections, Member States should have regard to Recommendation 2001/331/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 4 April 2001 providing for minimum criteria for environmental inspections in the Member States (9).\n(13)\nStage II petrol vapour recovery equipment should be tested regularly. The European Committee for Standardisation (CEN) should be encouraged to develop a harmonised testing methodology.\n(14)\nMember States should lay down rules on penalties applicable to infringements of the national provisions adopted pursuant to this Directive and ensure that they are implemented. Those penalties should be effective, proportionate and dissuasive, since non-compliance can result in damage to human health and the environment.\n(15)\nIn accordance with point 34 of the Interinstitutional Agreement on better law-making (10), Member States are encouraged to draw up, for themselves and in the interests of the Community, their own tables illustrating, as far as possible, the correlation between this Directive and the transposition measures, and to make them public.\n(16)\nSince it is adopted pursuant to Article 175 of the Treaty, this Directive does not prevent Member States from maintaining or introducing more stringent protective measures that are compatible with the Treaty. Pursuant to Article 176 of the Treaty, Member States are to notify the Commission of any such measures.\n(17)\nThe measures necessary for the implementation of this Directive should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission (11).\n(18)\nIn particular, the Commission should be empowered to adopt implementing measures concerning harmonised methods and standards. Since those measures are of general scope and are designed to amend non-essential elements of this Directive, inter alia, by supplementing it with new non-essential elements, they must be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny provided for in Article 5a of Decision 1999/468/EC.\n(19)\nSince the objective of this Directive, namely to reduce emissions of petrol vapour to the atmosphere, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore, due to the transboundary nature of air pollution, be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality as set out in that Article, this Directive does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve that objective,\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:\nArticle 1\nSubject matter\nThis Directive lays down measures aimed at reducing the amount of petrol vapour emitted to the atmosphere during the refuelling of motor vehicles at service stations.\nArticle 2\nDefinitions\nFor the purposes of this Directive:\n1.\n‘petrol’ means petrol as defined in Article 2(a) of Directive 94/63/EC;\n2.\n‘petrol vapour’ means any gaseous compound which evaporates from petrol;\n3.\n‘service station’ means a service station as defined in Article 2(f) of Directive 94/63/EC;\n4.\n‘existing service station’ means a service station which is built or for which an individual planning permission, construction licence or operating licence is granted before 1 January 2012;\n5.\n‘new service station’ means a service station which is built or for which an individual planning permission, construction licence or operating licence is granted on or after 1 January 2012;\n6.\n‘Stage II petrol vapour recovery system’ means equipment aimed at recovering the petrol vapour displaced from the fuel tank of a motor vehicle during refuelling at a service station and which transfers that petrol vapour to a storage tank at the service station or back to the petrol dispenser for resale;\n7.\n‘petrol vapour capture efficiency’ means the amount of petrol vapour captured by the Stage II petrol vapour recovery system compared to the amount of petrol vapour that would otherwise be emitted to the atmosphere in the absence of such a system and expressed as a percentage;\n8.\n‘vapour/petrol ratio’ means the ratio between the volume at atmospheric pressure of petrol vapour passing through the Stage II petrol vapour recovery system and the volume of petrol dispensed;\n9.\n‘throughput’ means the total annual quantity of petrol unloaded from mobile containers into a service station.\nArticle 3\nService stations\n1.

With a 2009 directive, the European Union (EU) is taking action to recover such vapours.\nACT\n                  \nDirective 2009/126/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 October 2009 on stage II petrol vapour recovery during refuelling of motor vehicles at service stations\nSUMMARY\nWHAT DOES THIS DIRECTIVE DO?\n                     \nIt ensures the recovery of harmful petrol vapour that would otherwise be emitted during the refuelling of a motor vehicle at a service station. The petrol pumps of many EU service stations will have to be equipped to recover this vapour.\nKEY POINTS\nThis directive applies to new and majorly refurbished service stations that have an annual throughput of more than 500 m3 of petrol, and service stations with an annual throughput of more than 100 m3 that are located under living accommodations. They are obliged to install stage II petrol vapour recovery (PVR) systems.\nLarge service stations that have an annual throughput of 3 000 m3 must install PVR systems by 2018.\nThe PVR equipment must be certified by the manufacturer in accordance with relevant technical standards and must be able to capture at least 85 % of petrol vapour.\nThe efficiency of PVR equipment must be tested once every year, or every 3 years if the service station has automatic monitoring equipment.\nService stations that install PVR equipment must notify consumers about the equipment by placing a sign, sticker, or other notification on or around the petrol dispenser.\nThe test methods and standards used to determine the efficiency of PVR systems are harmonised under Directive 2014/99/EU.\nBACKGROUND\n                     \nPetrol is a complex mixture of volatile organic compounds which readily evaporate into the air where they contribute to several pollution problems. These include excessive levels of toxic benzene in ambient air and photochemical formation of ozone which is an air pollutant causing respiratory illnesses such as asthma. In addition, ozone is a greenhouse gas.\nFor more information, see petrol storage and distribution on the European Commission’s website.\nREFERENCES\nAct\nEntry into force\nDeadline for transposition in the Member States\nOfficial Journal\nDirective 2009/126/EC\n31.10.2009\n1.1.2012\nOJ L 285 of 31.10.2009, pp. 36-39\nAmending act(s)\nEntry into force\nDeadline for transposition in the Member States\nOfficial Journal\nDirective 2014/99/EU\n12.11.2014\n12.5.2016\nOJ L 304, 23.10.2014, pp. 89-90\nlast update 11.08.2015", "tags": ["supply", "atmospheric pollutant", "technical regulations", "petrol", "motor vehicle", "energy distribution", "national implementing measure", "reduction of gas emissions"], "subjects": ["Internal market - Principles", "Environment", "Approximation of laws"], "split": "train", "reference_annotations": {}, "summary_annotations": {}}
