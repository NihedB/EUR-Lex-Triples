These criteria are designed to ensure that countries can demonstrate stability — within certain defined limits – in prices, in their government’s financial position, in exchange rate stability and in long-term interest rates.\nThe regulation has been amended several times to adopt the conversion rates of new countries joining the euro area:\nGreece in 2001;\nSlovenia in 2007;\nCyprus and Malta in 2008;\nSlovakia in 2009;\nEstonia in 2011;\nLatvia in 2014;\nLithuania in 2015.\nAccording to Article 140 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU, the conversion rates between the euro and the currencies of the EU countries are set by the Council of the EU. It decides with the unanimity of the euro area countries and the country concerned, acting on a proposal from the European Commission and after consulting the European Central Bank.\nThe conversion rates are irrevocably fixed:\n1 euro =\nExchange rate\nFormer national currency\n40.34\nBelgian francs\n1.96\nGerman marks\n15.65\nEstonian kroons\n340.75\nGreek drachma\n166.39\nSpanish pesetas\n6.56\nFrench francs\n0.79\nIrish pounds\n1 936.27\nItalian lire\n0.59\nCyprus pounds\n0.70\nLatvian lats\n3.45\nLithuanian litas\n40.34\nLuxembourg francs\n0.43\nMaltese liras\n2.20\nDutch guilders\n13.76\nAustrian schillings\n200.48\nPortuguese escudos\n239.64\nSlovenian tolars\n30.13\nSlovak korunas\n5.95\nFinnish marks\nFROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?\n              \nIt has applied since 1 January 1999.\nBACKGROUND\n              \nFor more information, see:\n‘Adopting the euro’ on the European Commission’s website\n‘Use of the euro’ on the European Central Bank’s website\nMAIN DOCUMENT\n            \nCouncil Regulation (EC) No 2866/98 of 31 December 1998 on the conversion rates between the euro and the currencies of the Member States adopting the euro (OJ L 359, 31.12.1998, pp. 1–2)\nSuccessive amendments to Regulation (EC) No 2866/98 have been incorporated in the basic text.
