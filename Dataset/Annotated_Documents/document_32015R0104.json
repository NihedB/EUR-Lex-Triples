{"celex_id": "32015R0104", "reference": "28.1.2015\nEN\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\nL 22/1\nCOUNCIL REGULATION (EU) 2015/104\nof 19 January 2015\nfixing for 2015 the fishing opportunities for certain fish stocks and groups of fish stocks, applicable in Union waters and, for Union vessels, in certain non-Union waters, amending Regulation (EU) No 43/2014 and repealing Regulation (EU) No 779/2014\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 43(3) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European Commission,\nWhereas:\n(1)\nArticle 43(3) of the Treaty provides that the Council, on a proposal from the Commission, is to adopt measures on the fixing and allocation of fishing opportunities.\n(2)\nRegulation (EU) No 1380/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council (1) requires that conservation measures be adopted taking into account available scientific, technical and economic advice, including, where relevant, reports drawn up by the Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries (STECF) and other advisory bodies, as well as in the light of any advice received from Advisory Councils.\n(3)\nIt is incumbent upon the Council to adopt measures on the fixing and allocation of fishing opportunities, including certain conditions functionally linked thereto, as appropriate. In accordance with Article 16(4) of Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013, fishing opportunities should be fixed in accordance with the objectives of the Common Fisheries Policy established in Article 2(2) of that Regulation. In accordance with Article 16(1) of that Regulation fishing opportunities should be allocated to Member States in such a way as to ensure relative stability of fishing activities of each Member State for each fish stock or fishery.\n(4)\nThe total allowable catch (TACs) should therefore be established, in line with Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013, on the basis of available scientific advice, taking into account biological and socio-economic aspects whilst ensuring fair treatment between fishing sectors, as well as in the light of the opinions expressed during the consultation of stakeholders, in particular at the meetings of the Advisory Councils.\n(5)\nThe landing obligation referred to in Article 15 of Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013 is introduced on a fishery-by-fishery basis. In the region covered by this Regulation, when a fishery falls under the landing obligation, all species in that fishery subject to catch limits should be landed. As of 1 January 2015, the landing obligation applies to small pelagic fisheries (i.e. fisheries for mackerel, herring, horse mackerel, blue whiting, boarfish, anchovy, argentine, sardine and sprat), to large pelagic fisheries (i.e. fisheries for bluefin tuna, swordfish, albacore tuna, bigeye tuna and blue and white marlin), to fisheries for industrial purposes (e.g. fisheries for capelin, sandeel and Norwegian pout). Article 16(2) of Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013 provides that, when the landing obligation in respect of a fish stock is introduced, fishing opportunities are to be fixed taking into account the change from fixing fishing opportunities that reflect landings to fixing fishing opportunities that reflect catches.\n(6)\nFor some years, certain TACs for stocks of elasmobranchs (skates, sharks, rays) have been set at 0, with a linked provision establishing an obligation to immediately release accidental catches. The reason for this specific treatment is that those stocks are in a poor conservation status and, because of their high survival rates, discards will not raise fishing mortality rates for them; discards are deemed as beneficial for the conservation of these species. As of 1 January 2015, however, catches of these species in pelagic fisheries will have to be landed, unless they are covered by any of the derogations from the landing obligation foreseen in Article 15 of Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013. Article 15(4)(a) of that Regulation allows such derogations for species in respect of which fishing is prohibited and which are identified as such in a Union legal act adopted in the area of the Common Fisheries Policy. Therefore, it is appropriate to prohibit the fishing of these species in the areas concerned.\n(7)\nIn recent years, the TAC for anchovy in the Bay of Biscay has been set in a separate fishing opportunities regulation applicable from 1 July of one year to 30 June of the following year. In 2014, STECF concluded that changing the management period to a normal calendar year (January to December) considerably reduces conservation risks for this stock. Following consultations with Spain, France and the South Western Waters Advisory Council (SWWAC), the change proposed by STECF was positively assessed. On this basis it is appropriate to repeal Council Regulation (EU) No 779/2014 (2) and to introduce a new TAC for the stock of anchovy in the Bay of Biscay for 2015 in this Regulation.\n(8)\nIn addition, pursuant to Article 16(4) of Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013, for stocks subject to specific multiannual plans the TACs should be established in accordance with the rules laid down in those plans. Consequently, the TACs for stocks of Southern hake and Norway lobster, of sole in the Western Channel, of plaice and sole in the North Sea, of herring to the west of Scotland, of cod in the Kattegat, to the west of Scotland, the Irish Sea, the North Sea, Skagerrak and the Eastern Channel and of bluefin tuna in the Eastern Atlantic and the Mediterranean should be established in accordance with the rules laid down in Council Regulations (EC) No 2166/2005 (3), (EC) No 509/2007 (4), (EC) No 676/2007 (5), (EC) No 1300/2008 (6), (EC) No 1342/2008 (7) (the ‘Cod Plan’) and (EC) No 302/2009 (8).\n(9)\nWith regard, however, to the stocks of northern hake (Council Regulation (EC) No 811/2004 (9)) and sole in the Bay of Biscay (Council Regulation (EC) No 388/2006 (10)), the minimum targets of the relevant recovery and management plans have been reached and, therefore, it is appropriate to follow scientific advice provided in order to achieve or maintain the TACs at maximum sustainable yield levels, as the case may be.\n(10)\nFor stocks for which there is no sufficient or reliable data in order to provide size estimates, management measures and TAC levels should follow the precautionary approach to fisheries management as defined in Article 4(1)(8) of Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013, while taking into account stock-specific factors, including, in particular, available information on stock trends and mixed fisheries considerations.\n(11)\nCouncil Regulation (EC) No 847/96 (11) introduced additional conditions for year-to-year management of TACs, including flexibility provisions under Articles 3 and 4 for precautionary and analytical stocks respectively. Under Article 2 of that Regulation, when fixing the TACs, the Council is to decide to which stocks Articles 3 and 4 do not apply, in particular on the basis of the biological status of the stocks. More recently, a flexibility mechanism was introduced for all catches covered by the landing obligation by Article 15(9) of Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013. Therefore, in order to avoid excessive flexibility, which would undermine the conservation objectives set out in the Common Fisheries Policy, and to prevent negative impacts on the biological state of the stocks, Articles 3 and 4 of Regulation (EC) No 847/96 may apply to TACs only where Member States do not use the year-to-year flexibility provided for in Article 15(9) of Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013.\n(12)\nIn accordance with the outcome of consultations between the Union and Norway, the Union may authorise fishing of Northern prawn in area IIIa by Union vessels of up to 10 per cent beyond the quota available to the Union, provided that any quantities used beyond the quota available to the Union would be deduced from its quota for 2015. It is appropriate to enable such flexibility in the fixing of those fishing opportunities in order the ensure a level-playing field for Union vessels by allowing the Member States concerned to opt for the use of a flexibility quota. Regulation (EU) No 43/2014 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(13)\nWhere a TAC relating to a stock is allocated to one Member State only, it is appropriate to empower that Member State in accordance with Article 2(1) of the Treaty to determine the level of such TAC. Provisions should be made to ensure that, when fixing that TAC level, the Member State concerned acts in a manner fully consistent with the principles and rules of the Common Fisheries Policy.\n(14)\nIt is necessary to establish the fishing effort ceilings for 2015 in accordance with Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 2166/2005, Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 509/2007, Article 9 of Regulation (EC) No 676/2007, Articles 11 and 12 of Regulation (EC) No 1342/2008 and Articles 5 and 9 of Regulation (EC) No 302/2009, while taking into account Council Regulation (EC) No 754/2009 (12).\n(15)\nIn the light of the most recent scientific advice from International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) and in accordance with the international commitments in the context of the North East Atlantic Fisheries Convention (NEAFC), it is necessary to limit the fishing effort on certain deep-sea species.\n(16)\nFor certain species, such as certain species of sharks, even a limited fishing activity could result in a serious risk to their conservation. Fishing opportunities for such species should therefore be fully restricted through a general prohibition on fishing those species.\n(17)\nAt the 11th Conference of the Parties of the Convention of Migratory Species of Wild Animals, held in Quito from 3 to 9 November 2014, a number of species was added to the lists of protected species in Appendices I and II of the Convention, with effect from 8 February 2015. Therefore, it is appropriate to provide for the protection of those species with respect to Union vessels fishing in all waters and non-Union vessels fishing in Union waters.\n(18)\nThe use of fishing opportunities available to Union vessels set out in this Regulation is subject to Council Regulation (EC) No 1224/2009 (13), and in particular to Articles 33 and 34 of that Regulation, concerning the recording of catches and fishing effort and the notification of data on the exhaustion of fishing opportunities. It is therefore necessary to specify the codes to be used by Member States when sending data to the Commission relating to landings of stocks subject to this Regulation.\n(19)\nFor certain TACs Member States should be allowed to grant additional allocations for vessels participating in trials on fully documented fisheries. The aim of those trials is to test a catch-quota system in fisheries that are not yet under the landing obligation set out in Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013, i.e. a system where all catches should be landed and counted against quotas in order to avoid discards and the waste of otherwise usable fish resources they entail. Uncontrolled discards of fish are a threat to the long term sustainability of fish as a public good and thus to the Common Fisheries Policy objectives. By contrast, catch-quota systems inherently present the fishers with an incentive to optimise the catch selectivity of their operations. For the purpose of monitoring compliance with the conditions to which the fully documented fisheries trials are subject, Member States should ensure detailed and accurate documentation of all fishing trips and adequate capacity and means, such as observers, closed-circuit television (CCTV) and others. In doing so, Member States should respect the principle of efficiency and proportionality. For the use of CCTV systems, the requirements of Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (14) should be complied with.\n(20)\nIn order to ensure that trials of fully documented fisheries can effectively evaluate the potential of catch-quota systems to control the absolute fishing mortality of the stocks concerned, it is necessary for all fish caught in those trials, including those under minimum landing size, to be counted against the total allocation assigned to the participating vessel, and for fishing operations to cease when that total allocation has been fully utilised by that vessel. It is also appropriate to allow transfers of allocations between vessels participating in the fully documented fisheries trials and non-participating vessels provided that it can be demonstrated that discards by non-participating vessels do not increase.\n(21)\nIt is appropriate, following advice from the ICES, to maintain a specific system to manage sandeel in Union waters of ICES divisions IIa and IIIa and ICES subarea IV. Given that the ICES scientific advice is expected to become available only in February 2015, it is appropriate to set the TAC and quotas provisionally at zero until such advice is released.\n(22)\nIn order to guarantee full use of fishing opportunities, it is appropriate to allow for the implementation of a flexible arrangement between some of the TAC areas where the same biological stock is concerned.\n(23)\nIn accordance with the procedure provided for in the agreements or protocols on fisheries relations with Norway (15) and the Faroe Islands (16) the Union has held consultations on fishing rights with those partners. In accordance with the procedure provided for in the agreement and protocol on fisheries relations with Greenland (17), the Joint Committee has established the level of fishing opportunities available for the Union in Greenland waters in 2015. It is therefore necessary to include these fishing opportunities in this regulation.\n(24)\nAt its Annual Meeting in 2014, NEAFC adopted a conservation measure on the redfish stock in the Irminger Sea fixing for 2015 the TAC and quotas for the contracting parties, including the Union. Furthermore, consultations between NEAFC Coastal States will continue in 2015 on fishing opportunities for Atlanto-Scandian herring for that year. It is therefore appropriate to fix provisional catch limits for Atlanto-Scandian herring as a percentage of the Union quota in place for 2014, whilst awaiting a revision following the outcome of the NEAFC Coastal States consultations.\n(25)\nAt its Annual Meeting in 2014, NEAFC did not adopt a conservation measure on the redfish stock in ICES international waters of I and II fixing the TAC and quotas for the Contracting Parties. Consultations will continue in 2015 on fishing opportunities for this redfish stock. As the fishery occurs in the second half of the year, catch limits for this stock will be fixed during 2015, taking account of the outcome of the NEAFC Coastal States consultations.\n(26)\nAt its Annual Meeting in 2014, the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT) adopted an increase of the TACs and quotas for bluefin tuna over a period of three years, and confirmed TACs and quotas for North-Atlantic swordfish, Southern-Atlantic swordfish, Southern-Atlantic Albacore and North-Atlantic Albacore at the current level for the 2015-2016 period. Furthermore, as it is already the case for the stock of bluefin tuna, it is appropriate that catches in recreational and sport fisheries performed on all other ICCAT stocks included in Annex ID should also be subject to the catch limits adopted by that organisation in order to guarantee that the Union does not exceed its quotas. All these measures should be implemented in the law of the Union.\n(27)\nAt its Annual Meeting in 2014, the Parties to the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) adopted catch limits for both target and by-catch species, including a by-catch quota for the years 2015 and 2016 for certain exploratory fisheries in subarea 88.2. The uptake of such quota during 2015 should be considered when setting fishing opportunities for the year 2016.\n(28)\nAt its Annual Meeting in 2014, the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission (IOTC) did not modify the conservation and management measures in place. It is however necessary to fix the capacity limits in Annex VI to this Regulation taking into account the inclusion of Mayotte as an outermost region in Annex II of Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013 as modified by Council Regulation (EU) No 1385/2013 (18).\n(29)\nThe third Annual Meeting of the South Pacific Regional Fisheries Management Organisation (SPRFMO) will be held in February 2015. It is appropriate that current measures in the SPRFMO Convention Area are provisionally maintained until such Annual Meeting is held. However, the stock of jack mackerel should not be targeted before a TAC is set as a result of that Annual Meeting.\n(30)\nAt its 87th Annual Meeting in 2014, the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission (IATTC) maintained its conservation measures for yellowfin tuna, bigeye tuna and skipjack tuna. IATTC also maintained its resolution on the conservation of oceanic whitetip sharks. Those measures should continue to be implemented in the law of the Union.\n(31)\nAt its Annual Meeting in 2014, the South East Atlantic Fisheries Organisation (SEAFO) adopted a recommendation for new biennial TACs for alfonsinos, orange roughy and pelagic armourhead, while the existing TACs for Patagonian toothfish and deep-sea red crab remained in force. The currently applicable measures on allocation of fishing opportunities adopted by SEAFO should be implemented in the law of the Union.\n(32)\nAt its 9th Annual Meeting, the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission (WCPFC) adopted a conservation and management measure for the protection of whale sharks from purse seine fishing operations. At its 10th Annual Meeting, WCPFC adopted catch limits for longliners fishing for bigeye tuna. The 11th Annual Meeting of the WCPFC in 2014 did not modify its measures adopted in 2013 as regards fishing opportunities. All these measures should be implemented in the law of the Union.\n(33)\nAt its Annual Meeting in 2013, the Parties to the Convention on the Conservation and Management of Pollock resources in the central Bering Sea did not modify its measures regarding fishing opportunities. Those measures should be implemented in the law of the Union.\n(34)\nAt its 36th Annual Meeting in 2014, the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organisation (NAFO) adopted a number of fishing opportunities for 2015 of certain stocks in Subareas 1-4 of the NAFO Convention Area. In that context, NAFO adopted a moratorium for the shrimp fishery in Division 3L, increased the TAC for redfish in Division 3M in order to cover certain by-catches and reopened the fishery for witch flounder in Division 3NO.\n(35)\nCertain international measures which create or restrict fishing opportunities for the Union are adopted by the relevant Regional Fisheries Management Organisations (RFMOs) at the end of the year and become applicable before the entry into force of this Regulation. It is therefore necessary for the provisions that implement such measures in the law of the Union to apply retroactively. In particular, since the fishing season in CCAMLR Convention Area runs from 1 December to 30 November, and thus certain fishing opportunities or prohibitions in the CCAMLR Convention Area are laid down for a period of time starting from 1 December 2014, it is appropriate that the relevant provisions of this Regulation apply from that date. Such retroactive application will be without prejudice to the principle of legitimate expectations as CCAMLR members are forbidden to fish in the CCAMLR Convention Area without authorisation.\n(36)\nIn accordance with the declaration by the Union addressed to the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela on the granting of fishing opportunities in EU waters to fishing vessels flying the flag of Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela in the exclusive economic zone off the coast of French Guiana (19), it is necessary to fix the fishing opportunities for snappers available to Venezuela in Union waters.\n(37)\nIn order to ensure uniform conditions for granting an individual Member State an authorisation to benefit from the system of managing its fishing effort allocations in accordance with a kilowatt days system, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission.\n(38)\nIn order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of this Regulation, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission relating to the granting of additional days at sea for permanent cessation of fishing activities and for enhanced scientific observer coverage as well as to establish the formats of spreadsheet for the collection and transmission of information concerning transfer of days at sea between fishing vessels flying the flag of a Member State. Those powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council (20).\n(39)\nIn order to avoid the interruption of fishing activities and to ensure the livelihood of the fishermen of the Union, this Regulation should apply from 1 January 2015, except for the provisions concerning fishing effort limits, which should apply from 1 February 2015, and certain provisions in particular regions, which should have a specific date of application. For reasons of urgency, this Regulation should enter into force immediately after its publication.\n(40)\nFishing opportunities should be used in full compliance with the applicable law of the Union,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nTITLE I\nGENERAL PROVISIONS\nArticle 1\nSubject matter\n1.

The TACs for Union vessels in Union waters or certain non-Union waters and the allocation of such TACs among Member States, and the conditions functionally linked thereto, where appropriate, are set out in Annex I.\n2.   Union vessels shall be authorised to make catches, within the TACs set out in Annex I, in waters falling within the fisheries jurisdiction of the Faroe Islands, Greenland, Iceland and Norway, and the fishing zone around Jan Mayen, subject to the condition set out in Article 19 of and Annex III to this Regulation and in Regulation (EC) No 1006/2008 (32) and its implementing provisions.\n3.   For the purposes of the special condition laid down in Annex IA for the stock of sandeel in Union waters of ICES zones IIa, IIIa and IV, the management areas defined in Annex IID shall apply.\nArticle 6\nTACs to be determined by Member States\n1.   The TACs for certain fish stocks shall be determined by the Member State concerned. Those stocks are identified in Annex I.\n2.   The TACs to be determined by a Member State shall:\n(a)\nbe consistent with the principles and rules of the Common Fisheries Policy, in particular the principle of sustainable exploitation of the stock; and\n(b)\nresult:\n(i)\nif analytical assessments are available, in the exploitation of the stock consistent with maximum sustainable yield from 2015 onwards, with as high a probability as possible;\n(ii)\nif analytical assessments are unavailable or incomplete, in the exploitation of the stock consistent with the precautionary approach to fisheries management.\n3.   By 15 March 2015, each Member State concerned shall submit the following information to the Commission:\n(a)\nthe TACs adopted;\n(b)\nthe data collected and assessed by the Member State concerned on which the TACs adopted are based;\n(c)\ndetails on how the TACs adopted comply with paragraph 2.\nArticle 7\nConditions for landing catches and by-catches\n1.   Fish from stocks for which TACs are established that have been caught in the fisheries specified in Article 15(1)(a) of Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013 are subject to the landing obligation as established in Article 15 of that Regulation (‘the landing obligation’).\n2.

Scope\n1.1.\nThis Annex shall apply to Union vessels carrying on board or deploying any of the gears referred to in point 1 of Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 1342/2008 and present in any of the geographical areas specified in point 2 of this Annex.\n1.2.\nThis Annex shall not apply to vessels of less than 10 metres' length overall. Those vessels shall not be required to carry fishing authorisations issued in accordance with Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 1224/2009. Member States concerned shall assess the fishing effort of those vessels by effort groups to which they belong, using appropriate sampling methods. During the management period specified in Article 8 of this Regulation the Commission shall seek scientific advice for evaluating the effort deployment of those vessels, with a view to their future inclusion into the effort regime.\n2.   Regulated gears and geographical areas\nFor the purposes of this Annex, the gear groupings referred to in point 1 of Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 1342/2008 (‘regulated gear’) and the groupings of geographical areas referred to in point 2 of that Annex shall apply.\n3.   Authorisations\nIf a Member State deems it appropriate in order to reinforce the sustainable implementation of this effort regime, it may introduce a prohibition to fish with regulated gear in any of the geographical areas to which this Annex applies by any of vessels flying its flag which has no record of such fishing activity, unless it ensures that equivalent capacity, measured in kilowatts, is prevented from fishing in that area.\n4.   Maximum allowable fishing effort\n4.1.\nThe maximum allowable effort referred to in Article 12(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1342/2008 and in Article 9(2) of Regulation (EC) No 676/2007 for the management period specified in Article 8 of this Regulation, for each of the effort groups of each Member State is set out in Appendix 1 to this Annex.\n4.2.\nThe maximum levels of annual fishing effort set in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) No 1954/2003 (1) shall not affect the maximum allowable fishing effort set in this Annex.\n5.   Management\n5.1.\nMember States shall manage the maximum allowable effort in accordance with the conditions laid down in Article 9 of Regulation (EC) No 676/2007, Article 4 and Articles 13 to 17 of Regulation (EC) No 1342/2008 and Articles 26 to 35 of Regulation (EC) No 1224/2009.\n5.2.\nA Member State may establish management periods for allocating all or parts of the maximum allowable effort to individual vessels or groups of vessels. In such case, the number of days or hours for which a vessel may be present within the area during a management period shall be fixed at the discretion of the Member State concerned. During any such management periods, the Member State concerned may reallocate effort between individual vessels or groups of vessels.\n5.3.\nIf a Member State authorises vessels flying its flag to be present within an area by hours, it shall continue measuring the consumption of days in accordance with the conditions referred to in point 5.1. Upon request by the Commission, the Member State concerned shall demonstrate its precautionary measures taken to avoid an excessive consumption of effort within the area due to a vessel terminating presences in the area before the end of a 24-hour period.\n6.   Fishing effort report\nArticle 28 of Regulation (EC) No 1224/2009 shall apply to vessels falling under the scope of this Annex. The geographical area referred to in that Article shall be understood, for the purpose of cod management, as each of the geographical areas referred to in point 2 of this Annex.\n7.   Communication of relevant data\nMember States shall transmit to the Commission the data on fishing effort deployed by their fishing vessels in accordance with Articles 33 and 34 of Regulation (EC) No 1224/2009.

Scope\nThis Annex shall apply to Union vessels of 10 metres' length overall or more carrying on board or deploying trawls, Danish seines or similar gears of mesh size equal to or larger than 32 mm and gill-nets of mesh size equal to or larger than 60 mm or bottom longlines in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 2166/2005, and present in ICES divisions VIIIc and IXa excluding the Gulf of Cádiz.\n2.   Definitions\nFor the purposes of this Annex:\n(a)\n‘gear grouping’ means the grouping consisting of the following two gear categories:\n(i)\ntrawls, Danish seines or similar gears of mesh size equal to or larger than 32 mm and\n(ii)\ngill-nets of mesh size equal to or larger than 60 mm and bottom longlines;\n(b)\n‘regulated gear’ means any of the two gear categories belonging to the gear grouping;\n(c)\n‘area’ means ICES divisions VIIIc and IXa excluding the Gulf of Cádiz;\n(d)\n‘current management period’ means the period specified in Article 8;\n(e)\n‘special conditions’ means the special conditions set out in point 6.1.\n3.   Limitation in activity\nWithout prejudice to Article 29 of Regulation (EC) No 1224/2009, each Member State shall ensure that, when carrying on board any regulated gear, Union vessels flying its flag shall be present within the area for no more than the number of days specified in Chapter III of this Annex.\nCHAPTER II\nAuthorisations\n4.   Authorised vessels\n4.1.\nA Member State shall not authorise fishing with regulated gear in the area by any vessel flying its flag which has no record of such fishing activity in the area in the period from 2002 to 2014, excluding the record of fishing activities as a result of transfer of days between fishing vessels, unless it ensures that equivalent capacity, measured in kilowatts, is prevented from fishing in the area.\n4.2.\nA vessel flying the flag of a Member State having no quotas in the area shall not be authorised to fish in the area with regulated gear, unless the vessel is allocated a quota after a transfer as permitted in accordance with Article 16(8) of Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013 and is allocated days at sea in accordance with point 11 or 12 of this Annex.\nCHAPTER III\nNumber of days present within the area allocated to Union vessels\n5.   Maximum number of days\n5.1.\nDuring the current management period, the maximum number of days at sea for which a Member State may authorise a vessel flying its flag to be present within the area having carried on board any regulated gear is shown in Table I.\n5.2.\nIf a vessel is able to demonstrate that its hake catches represent less than 8 % of the total live weight of fish caught in a given fishing trip, the flag Member State of the vessel shall be allowed not to count the days at sea associated with that fishing trip against the applicable maximum number of days at sea as set out in Table I.\n6.   Special conditions for the allocation of days\n6.1.\nFor the purposes of fixing the maximum number of days at sea that a Union vessel may be authorised by its flag Member State to be present within the area, the following special conditions shall apply in accordance with Table I:\n(a)\nthe total landings of hake in the two calendar years 2012 or 2013 made by the vessel concerned shall represent less than 5 tonnes according to the landings in live weight; and\n(b)\nthe total landings of Norway lobster in the years specified in point (a) above made by the vessel concerned shall represent less than 2,5 tonnes according to the landings in live weight.\n6.2.\nIf a vessel benefits from an unlimited number of days as a result of its compliance with the special conditions, the vessel's landings in the current management period shall not exceed 5 tonnes of the total landings in live weight of hake and 2,5 tonnes of the total landings in live weight of Norway lobster.\n6.3.\nWhen either of the special conditions is not met by a vessel, that vessel shall, with immediate effect, no longer be entitled to the allocation of days corresponding to the given special condition.\n6.4.\nThe application of the special conditions referred to in point 6.1. may be transferred from one vessel to one or more other vessels which replace that vessel in the fleet, provided that the replacing vessel uses similar gear and does not have in any year of its operation a record of landings of hake and Norway lobster higher than the quantities specified in point 6.1.\nTable I\nMaximum number of days a vessel may be present within the area by fishing gear per year\nSpecial condition\nRegulated gear\nMaximum number of days\nBottom trawls, Danish seines and similar trawls of mesh size ≥ 32 mm, gill-nets of mesh size ≥ 60 mm and bottom longlines\nES\n114\nFR\n109\nPT\n113\n6.1.(a) and 6.1.(b)\nBottom trawls, Danish seines and similar trawls of mesh size ≥ 32 mm, gill-nets of mesh size ≥ 60 mm and bottom longlines\nUnlimited\n7.   Kilowatt day system\n7.1.\nA Member State may manage its fishing effort allocations in accordance with a kilowatt days system. Through that system it may authorise any vessel concerned by any regulated gear and special conditions as set out in Table I to be present within the area for a maximum number of days which is different from that set out in that Table, provided that the overall amount of kilowatt days corresponding to the regulated gear and to the special conditions is respected.\n7.2.\nThis overall amount of kilowatt days shall be the sum of all individual fishing efforts allocated to the vessels flying the flag of that Member State and qualified for the regulated gear and, where applicable, the special conditions. Such individual fishing efforts shall be calculated in kilowatt days by multiplying the engine power of each vessel by the number of days at sea it would benefit from, according to Table I, if point 7.1. were not applied. For as long as the number of days is unlimited according to Table I, the relevant number of days the vessel would benefit from is 360.\n7.3.\nA Member State wishing to benefit from the system referred to in point 7.1. shall submit a request to the Commission, for the regulated gear and special conditions as laid down in Table I, with reports in electronic format containing the details of the calculation based on:\n(a)\nthe list of vessels authorised to fish by indicating their Union fishing fleet register number (CFR) and their engine power;\n(b)\nthe track record of the years specified in point 6.1.(a) for such vessels reflecting the catch composition defined in the special condition referred to in point 6.1.(a) or (b), if these vessels are qualified for such special conditions;\n(c)\nthe number of days at sea for which each vessel would have initially been authorised to fish according to Table I and the number of days at sea which each vessel would benefit from in application of point 7.1.\n7.4.\nOn the basis of that request, the Commission shall assess whether the conditions referred to in point 7 are complied with and, where applicable, may authorise that Member State to benefit from the system referred to in point 7.1.\n8.   Allocation of additional days for permanent cessation of fishing activities\n8.1.\nAn additional number of days at sea on which a vessel may be authorised by its flag Member State to be present within the area when carrying on board any regulated gear may be allocated to a Member State by the Commission on the basis of permanent cessations of fishing activities that have taken place during the preceding management period, either in accordance with Article 23 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1198/2006 (1) or Council Regulation (EC) No 744/2008 (2). Permanent cessations resulting from any other circumstances may be considered by the Commission on a case-by-case basis, following a written and duly motivated request from the Member State concerned. Such written request shall identify the vessels concerned and confirm, for each of them, that they shall never return to fishing activities.\n8.2.\nThe effort expended in 2003 measured in kilowatt days of the withdrawn vessels using the regulated gear shall be divided by the effort expended by all vessels using that gear during 2003. The additional number of days at sea shall be then calculated by multiplying the ratio so obtained by the number of days that would have been allocated according to Table I. Any part of a day resulting from that calculation shall be rounded to the nearest whole day.\n8.3.\nPoints 8.1. and 8.2. shall not apply where a vessel has been replaced in accordance with point 3 or 6.4., or when the withdrawal has already been used in previous years to obtain additional days at sea.\n8.4.\nA Member State wishing to benefit from the allocations referred to in point 8.1. shall submit a request to the Commission, by 15 June of the current management period, with reports in electronic format containing, for the gear grouping and special conditions as laid down in Table I, the details of the calculation based on:\n(a)\nlists of withdrawn vessels with their Union fishing fleet register number (CFR) and their engine power;\n(b)\nthe fishing activity deployed by such vessels in 2003 calculated in days at sea according to the grouping of fishing gears and, if necessary, special conditions.\n8.5.\nOn the basis of such a request by a Member State the Commission may, by means of implementing acts, allocate that Member State a number of days additional to that referred to in point 5.1. for that Member State. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 45(2).\n8.6.\nDuring the current management period, a Member State may re-allocate those additional days at sea to all or part of the vessels remaining in fleet and qualified for the regulated gears. Additional days stemming from a withdrawn vessel that benefited from a special condition referred to in point 6.1.(a) or (b) may not be allocated to a vessel remaining active that does not benefit from a special condition.\n8.7.\nWhen the Commission allocates additional days at sea due to a permanent cessation of fishing activities during the preceding management period, the maximum number of days per Member State and gear shown in Table I shall be adjusted accordingly for the current management period.\n9.   Allocation of additional days for enhanced scientific observer coverage\n9.1.\nThree additional days on which a vessel may be present within the area when carrying on board any regulated gear may be allocated to a Member State by the Commission on the basis of an enhanced programme of scientific observer coverage in partnership between scientists and the fishing industry. Such a programme shall focus in particular on levels of discarding and on catch composition and shall go beyond the requirements on data collection, as laid down in Regulation (EC) No 199/2008 (3) and its implementing rules for national programmes.\n9.2.\nScientific observers shall be independent from the owner, the master of the vessel and any crew member.\n9.3.\nA Member State wishing to benefit from the allocations referred to in point 9.1. shall submit a description of its enhanced scientific observer coverage programme to the Commission for approval.\n9.4.\nOn the basis of that description, and after consultation with STECF, the Commission may, by means of implementing acts, allocate the Member State concerned a number of days additional to that referred to in point 5.1. for that Member State and for the vessels, the area and gear concerned by the enhanced programme of scientific observers. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 45(2).\n9.5.\nIf an enhanced scientific observer coverage programme submitted by a Member State has been approved by the Commission in the past and the Member State concerned wishes to continue its application without changes, it shall inform the Commission of the continuation of that programme four weeks before the beginning of the period for which the programme applies.\nCHAPTER IV\nManagement\n10.   General obligation\nMember States shall manage the maximum allowable effort in accordance with the conditions laid down in Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 2166/2005 and Articles 26 to 35 of Regulation (EC) No 1224/2009.\n11.   Management periods\n11.1.\nA Member State may divide the days present within the area set out in Table I into management periods of durations of one or more calendar months.\n11.2.\nThe number of days or hours for which a vessel may be present within the area during a management period shall be fixed by the Member State concerned.\n11.3.\nWhere a Member State authorises vessels flying its flag to be present within the area by hours, the Member State shall continue measuring the consumption of days as specified in point 10. Upon request by the Commission, the Member State shall demonstrate its precautionary measures taken to avoid an excessive consumption of days within the area due to a vessel terminating presences in the area before the end of a 24-hour period.\nCHAPTER V\nExchanges of fishing effort allocations\n12.   Transfer of days between fishing vessels flying the flag of a member state\n12.1.\nA Member State may permit any fishing vessel flying its flag to transfer days present within the area for which it has been authorised to another vessel flying its flag within the area, provided that the product of the days received by a vessel multiplied by its engine power in kilowatts (kilowatt days) is equal to or less than the product of the days transferred by the donor vessel and the engine power in kilowatts of that vessel. The engine power in kilowatts of the vessels shall be that recorded for each vessel in the Union fishing fleet register.\n12.2.\nThe total number of days present within the area transferred in accordance with point 12.1., multiplied by the engine power in kilowatts of the donor vessel, shall not be higher than the donor vessel's average annual days track record in the area as verified by the fishing logbook in the years specified in point 6.1.(a) multiplied by the engine power in kilowatts of that vessel.\n12.3.\nThe transfer of days as described in point 12.1. shall be permitted between vessels operating with any regulated gear and during the same management period.\n12.4.\nThe transfer of days is only permitted for vessels benefiting from an allocation of fishing days without special conditions.\n12.5.\nOn request from the Commission, Member States shall provide information on the transfers that have taken place. The format of spreadsheets for the collection and transmission of information referred to in this point may be established by the Commission, by means of implementing acts. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 45(2).\n13.   Transfer of days between fishing vessels flying the flag of different member states\nMember States may permit the transfer of days present within the area for the same management period and within the area between any fishing vessels flying their flags provided that points 4.1. and 4.2. and 12 apply mutatis mutandis. Where Member States decide to authorise such a transfer, they shall notify the Commission, before the transfer takes place, of the details of the transfer, including the number of days to be transferred, the fishing effort and, where applicable, the fishing quotas relating thereto.\nCHAPTER VI\nReporting obligations\n14.   Fishing effort report\nArticle 28 of Regulation (EC) No 1224/2009 shall apply to vessels falling under the scope of this Annex. The geographical area referred to in that Article shall be understood as the area specified in point 2 of this Annex.\n15.

Scope\n1.1.\nThis Annex shall apply to Union vessels of 10 metres length overall or more carrying on board or deploying beam trawls of mesh size equal to or greater than 80 mm and static nets including gill-nets, trammel-nets and tangle-nets with mesh size equal to or less than 220 mm in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 509/2007, and present in ICES division VIIe.\n1.2.\nVessels fishing with static nets with mesh size equal to or larger than 120 mm and with track records of less than 300 kg live weight of sole per year during the three previous years, according to their fishing records, shall be exempt from the application of this Annex subject to the following conditions:\n(a)\nsuch vessels caught less than 300 kg live weight of sole during the 2014 management period;\n(b)\nsuch vessels do not tranship any fish at sea to another vessel;\n(c)\nby 31 July 2015 and 31 January 2016 each Member State concerned makes a report to the Commission on these vessels' catch records for sole in the three previous years as well as on catches of sole in 2015.\nWhere any of these conditions is not met, the vessels concerned shall cease to be exempt from the application of this Annex, with immediate effect.\n2.   Definitions\nFor the purposes of this Annex the following definitions shall apply:\n(a)\n‘gear grouping’ means the grouping consisting of the following two gear categories:\n(i)\nbeam trawls of mesh size equal to or greater than 80 mm and\n(ii)\nstatic nets, including gill-nets, trammel nets and tangle-nets, with mesh size equal to or less than 220 mm;\n(b)\n‘regulated gear’ means any of the two gear categories belonging to the gear grouping;\n(c)\n‘area’ means ICES division VIIe;\n(d)\n‘current management period’ means the period from 1 February 2015 to 31 January 2016.\n3.   Limitation in activity\nWithout prejudice to Article 29 of Regulation (EC) No 1224/2009, each Member State shall ensure that, when carrying on board any regulated gear, Union vessels flying its flag and registered in the Union shall be present within the area for no more than the number of days set out in Chapter III of this Annex.\nCHAPTER II\nAuthorisations\n4.   Authorised vessels\n4.1\nA Member State shall not authorise fishing with regulated gear in the area by any vessel flying its flag which has no record of such fishing activity in the area in the period from 2002 to 2014, excluding the record of fishing activities as a result of transfer of days between fishing vessels, unless it ensures that equivalent capacity, measured in kilowatts, is prevented from fishing in the area.\n4.2\nHowever, a vessel with a track record of using a regulated gear may be authorised to use a different fishing gear, provided that the number of days allocated to this latter gear is greater than or equal to the number of days allocated to the regulated gear.\n4.3\nA vessel flying the flag of a Member State having no quotas in the area shall not be authorised to fish in the area with regulated gear, unless the vessel is allocated a quota after a transfer as permitted in accordance with Article 16(8) of Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013 and is allocated days at sea in accordance with point 10 or 11 of this Annex.\nCHAPTER III\nNumber of days present within the area allocated to Union vessels\n5.   Maximum number of days\nDuring the current management period, the maximum number of days at sea for which a Member State may authorise a vessel flying its flag to be present within the area having carried on board any regulated gear is shown in Table I.\nTable I\nMaximum number of days a vessel may be present within the area by category of regulated gear per year\nRegulated gear\nMaximum number of days\nBeam trawls of mesh size ≥ 80 mm\nBE\n164\nFR\n175\nUK\n207\nStatic nets with mesh size ≤220 mm\nBE\n164\nFR\n178\nUK\n164\n6.   Kilowatt day system\n6.1.\nDuring the current management period, a Member State may manage its fishing effort allocations in accordance with a kilowatt days system. Through that system it may authorise any vessel concerned by any regulated gear as set out in Table I to be present within the area for a maximum number of days which is different from that set out in that Table, provided that the overall amount of kilowatt days corresponding to the regulated gear is respected.\n6.2.\nThis overall amount of kilowatt days shall be the sum of all individual fishing efforts allocated to the vessels flying the flag of that Member State and qualified for the regulated gear. Such individual fishing efforts shall be calculated in kilowatt days by multiplying the engine power of each vessel by the number of days at sea it would benefit from, according to Table I, if point 6.1. were not applied.\n6.3.\nA Member State wishing to benefit from the system referred to in point 6.1. shall submit a request to the Commission, for the regulated gear as laid down in Table I, with reports in electronic format containing the details of the calculation based on:\n(a)\nthe list of vessels authorised to fish by indicating their Union fishing fleet register number (CFR) and their engine power;\n(b)\nthe number of days at sea for which each vessel would have initially been authorised to fish according to Table I and the number of days at sea which each vessel would benefit from in application of point 6.1.\n6.4.\nOn the basis of that request, the Commission shall assess whether the conditions referred to in point 6 are complied with and, where applicable, may authorise that Member State to benefit from the system referred to in point 6.1.\n7.   Allocation of additional days for permanent cessation of fishing activities\n7.1.\nAn additional number of days at sea on which a vessel may be authorised by its flag Member State to be present within the area when carrying on board any regulated gear may be allocated to a Member State by the Commission on the basis of permanent cessations of fishing activities that have taken place during the preceding management period either in accordance with Article 23 of Regulation (EC) No 1198/2006 or Regulation (EC) No 744/2008. Permanent cessations resulting from any other circumstances may be considered by the Commission on a case-by-case basis, following a written and duly motivated request from the Member State concerned. Such written request shall identify the vessels concerned and confirm, for each of them, that they shall never return to fishing activities.\n7.2.\nThe effort expended in 2003 measured in kilowatt days of the withdrawn vessels using a given gear grouping shall be divided by the effort expended by all vessels using that gear grouping during 2003. The additional number of days at sea shall be then calculated by multiplying the ratio so obtained by the number of days that would have been allocated according to Table I. Any part of a day resulting from that calculation shall be rounded to the nearest whole day.\n7.3.\nPoints 7.1.and 7.2. shall not apply where a vessel has been replaced in accordance with point 4.2., or when the withdrawal has already been used in previous years to obtain additional days at sea.\n7.4.\nA Member State wishing to benefit from the allocations referred to in point 7.1. shall submit a request to the Commission, by 15 June of the current management period, with reports in electronic format containing for the gear grouping as laid down in Table I, the details of the calculation based on:\n(a)\nlists of withdrawn vessels with their Union fishing fleet register number (CFR) and their engine power;\n(b)\nthe fishing activity deployed by such vessels in 2003 calculated in days at sea according to the grouping of fishing gears.\n7.5.\nOn the basis of such a request by a Member State the Commission may, by means of implementing acts, allocate that Member State a number of days additional to that referred to in point 5 for that Member State. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 45(2).\n7.6.\nDuring the current management period, a Member State may re-allocate those additional days at sea to all or part of the vessels remaining in fleet and qualified for the regulated gears.\n7.7.\nWhen the Commission allocates additional days at sea due to a permanent cessation of fishing activities during the preceding management period the maximum number of days per Member State and gear shown in Table I shall be adjusted accordingly for the current management period.\n8.   Allocation of additional days for enhanced scientific observer coverage\n8.1.\nThree additional days on which a vessel may be present within the area when carrying on board any regulated gear may be allocated between 1 February 2014 and 31 January 2015 to a Member State by the Commission on the basis of an enhanced programme of scientific observer coverage in partnership between scientists and the fishing industry. Such a programme shall focus in particular on levels of discarding and on catch composition and go beyond the requirements on data collection, as laid down in Regulation (EC) No 199/2008 and its implementing rules for national programmes.\n8.2.\nScientific observers shall be independent from the owner, the master of the fishing vessel and any crew member.\n8.3.\nA Member State wishing to benefit from the allocations referred to in point 8.1. shall submit a description of its enhanced scientific observer coverage programme to the Commission for approval.\n8.4.\nOn the basis of that description, and after consultation with STECF, the Commission may, by means of implementing acts, allocate the Member State concerned a number of days additional to that referred to in point 5 for that Member State and for the vessels, the area and gear concerned by the enhanced programme of scientific observers. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 45(2).\n8.5.\nIf an enhanced scientific observer coverage programme submitted by a Member State has been approved by the Commission in the past and the Member State concerned wishes to continue its application without changes, it shall inform the Commission of the continuation of that programme four weeks before the beginning of the period for which the programme applies.\nCHAPTER IV\nManagement\n9.   General obligation\nMember States shall manage the maximum allowable effort in accordance with Articles 26 to 35 of Regulation (EC) No 1224/2009.\n10.   Management periods\n10.1.\nA Member State may divide the days present within the area set out in Table I into management periods of durations of one or more calendar months.\n10.2.\nThe number of days or hours for which a vessel may be present within the area during a management period shall be fixed by the Member State concerned.\n10.3.\nWhere a Member State authorises vessels flying its flag to be present within the area by hours, the Member State shall continue measuring the consumption of days as specified in point 9. Upon request by the Commission, the Member State shall demonstrate its precautionary measures taken to avoid an excessive consumption of days within the area due to a vessel terminating presences in the area before the end of a 24-hour period.\nCHAPTER V\nExchanges of fishing effort allocations\n11.   Transfer of days between fishing vessels flying the flag of a member state\n11.1.\nA Member State may permit any fishing vessel flying its flag to transfer days present within the area for which it has been authorised to another vessel flying its flag within the area, provided that the product of the days received by a vessel multiplied by its engine power in kilowatts (kilowatt days) is equal to or less than the product of the days transferred by the donor vessel and the engine power in kilowatts of that vessel. The engine power in kilowatts of the vessels shall be that recorded for each vessel in the Union fishing fleet register.\n11.2.\nThe total number of days present within the area transferred in accordance with point 11.1., multiplied by the engine power in kilowatts of the donor vessel, shall not be higher than the donor vessel's average annual days track record in the area as verified by the fishing logbook in the years 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004 and 2005 multiplied by the engine power in kilowatts of that vessel.\n11.3.\nThe transfer of days as described in point 11.1. shall be permitted between vessels operating with any regulated gear and during the same management period.\n11.4.\nOn request from the Commission, Member States shall provide information on the transfers that have taken place. Formats of spreadsheet for the collection and transmission of information referred to in this point may be established by the Commission, by means of implementing acts. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 45(2).\n12.   Transfer of days between fishing vessels flying the flag of different member states\nMember States may permit transfer of days present within the area for the same management period and within the area between any fishing vessels flying their flags provided that points 4.2., 4.4., 5, 6 and 10 apply mutatis mutandis. Where Member States decide to authorise such a transfer, they shall notify the Commission before the transfer takes place, the details of the transfer, including the number of days to be transferred, the fishing effort and, where applicable, the fishing quotas relating thereto.\nCHAPTER VI\nReporting obligations\n13.   Fishing effort report\nArticle 28 of Regulation (EC) No 1224/2009 shall apply to vessels falling under the scope of this Annex. The geographical area referred to in that Article shall be understood as the area specified in point 2 of this Annex.\n14.   Collection of relevant data\nMember States shall collect on a quarterly basis the information about total fishing effort deployed within the area for towed gears and static gears, effort deployed by vessels using different types of gear in the area, and the engine power of those vessels in kilowatt days, on the basis of information used for the management of fishing days present within the area as set out in this Annex.\n15.   Communication of relevant data\nUpon request from the Commission, Member States shall make available to the Commission a spreadsheet with data specified in point 14 in the format specified in Tables II and III by sending it to the appropriate electronic mailbox address, which shall be communicated to the Member States by the Commission. Member States shall, upon the Commission's request, send detailed information to the Commission on effort allocated and consumed covering all or parts of the 2013 and 2014 management periods, using the data format specified in Tables IV and V.\nTable II\nReporting format kW-day information by management period\nMember State\nGear\nManagement period\nCumulative effort declaration\n(1)\n(2)\n(3)\n(4)\nTable III\nData format kW-day information by management period\nName of field\nMaximum number of characters/digits\nAlignment (1)\nL(eft)/R(ight)\nDefinition and comments\n(1)\nMember State\n3\nMember State (Alpha-3 ISO code) in which the vessel is registered\n(2)\nGear\n2\nOne of the following gear types:\nBT\n=\nbeam trawls ≥ 80 mm\nGN\n=\ngillnet < 220 mm\nTN\n=\ntrammel net or entangling net < 220 mm\n(3)\nManagement period\n4\nOne year in the period from the 2006 management period to the current management period\n(4)\nCumulative effort declaration\n7\nR\nCumulative amount of fishing effort expressed in kilowatt days deployed from 1 February until 31 January of the relevant management period\nTable IV\nReporting format for vessel-related information\nMember State\nCFR\nExternal marking\nLength of management period\nGear notified\nDays eligible using notified gear(s)\nDays spent with notified gear(s)\nTransfer of days\nNo 1\nNo 2\nNo 3\n…\nNo 1\nNo 2\nNo 3\n…\nNo 1\nNo 2\nNo 3\n…\n(1)\n(2)\n(3)\n(4)\n(5)\n(5)\n(5)\n(5)\n(6)\n(6)\n(6)\n(6)\n(7)\n(7)\n(7)\n(7)\n(8)\nTable V\nData format for vessel-related information\nName of field\nMaximum number of characters/digits\nAlignment (2)\nL(eft)/R(ight)\nDefinition and comments\n(1)\nMember State\n3\nMember State (Alpha-3 ISO code) in which vessel is registered\n(2)\nCFR\n12\nUnion fishing fleet register number (CFR)\nUnique identification number of a fishing vessel\nMember State (Alpha-3 ISO code) followed by an identifying series (9 characters).

The EU is aiming to ensure sustainable long-term fishing yields where possible for all stocks by the end of 2015, and at the latest by 2020. This is known as the maximum sustainable yield (MSY)*. Each year, European governments determine the total amount of fish that can be caught.\nWHAT DOES THE REGULATION DO?\nIt sets the total allowable catch (TAC) for each species that EU vessels can take from different fishing grounds, both inside and outside the EU.\nKEY POINTS\n—\nTACs are based on the best available scientific evidence. They reflect biological advice, the socio-economic needs of the fishing industry and the principle of ensuring sustainable exploitation of the various stocks in line with MSY.\n—\nEU governments, on the basis of a European Commission proposal, set the TACs every year.\n—\nSpecial multiannual plans apply to certain fish stocks, such as plaice and sole in the North Sea and sole in the Western Channel, to allow them to recover or to manage them in a long term perspective.\n—\nThe TACs specify how much fish certain EU vessels may catch in waters under the jurisdiction of the Faroes, Greenland, Iceland and Norway and the limits for catches by non-EU boats in EU waters.\n—\nEach individual TAC is divided into quotas for the different EU countries fishing in those waters. Once the quota ceilings have been reached, no more fishing can take place that year.\n—\nThe annual legislation protects certain species, such as the basking shark, porbeagle or skate, which may not be caught either in all, or some specific, EU waters.\n—\nEU governments may give extra fishing allowances to vessels which are involved in trials using close-circuit television cameras to record and fully document all their on-board fishing and processing activities.\nSINCE WHEN DOES THIS REGULATION APPLY?\nAs of 1 January 2015.\nBACKGROUND\n—\nManaging fish stocks on the European Commission's website\n—\nTACs and quotas on the European Commission's website\nKEY TERM\n* Maximum sustainable yield (MSY): the largest yield (catch) that can be taken from the stock of a species over an indefinite period, i.e. without endangering its survival.\nACT\nCouncil Regulation (EU) 2015/104 of 19 January 2015 fixing for 2015 the fishing opportunities for certain fish stocks and groups of fish
