Livestock farming and the placing on the market of food of animal origin constitute an important source of income for farmers. The implementation of veterinary measures aimed at raising the level of public and animal health in the Community assists the rational development of the farming sector.(2) The protection of human health against diseases and infections transmissible directly or indirectly between animals and humans (zoonoses) is of paramount importance.(3) Zoonoses transmissible through food may cause human suffering, as well as economic losses to food production and the food industry.(4) Zoonoses transmitted through sources other than food, especially from wild animal and pet animal populations, are also a matter of concern.(5) Zoonoses present at the level of primary production must be adequately controlled to ensure that the objectives of this Regulation are achieved. However, in the case of primary production leading to the direct supply of small quantities of primary products, by the food business operator producing them, to the final consumer or to local shops, it is appropriate to protect public health through national law. In this case there is a close relationship between the producer and the consumer. Such production should not make a significant contribution to the average prevalence of zoonoses in animal populations in the Community as a whole. The general requirements for sampling and analysis may not be practical or appropriate for producers with very small numbers of animals who may be located in regions suffering from special geographical constraints.(6) Council Directive 92/117/EEC of 17 December 1992 concerning measures for protection against specified zoonoses and specified zoonotic agents in animals and products of animal origin in order to prevent outbreaks of food-borne infections and intoxications(4) provided for the establishment of monitoring systems for certain zoonoses and controls on salmonella in certain poultry flocks.(7) That Directive required Member States to submit to the Commission the national measures that they had taken to achieve the objectives of the Directive and to draw up plans for monitoring salmonella in poultry. However, Council Directive 97/22/EC(5) amending Directive 92/117/EEC suspended the requirement pending the review provided for in Article 15a of Directive 92/117/EEC.(8) Several Member States have already submitted their plans for the monitoring of salmonella, which the Commission has approved. Moreover, all Member States were required, with effect from 1 January 1998, to fulfil the minimum measures laid down for salmonella in Annex III, Section I, to Directive 92/117/EEC, and to establish rules specifying the measures to be taken to avoid the introduction of salmonella on to a farm.(9) Those minimum measures focused on monitoring and controlling salmonella in breeding flocks of the species Gallus gallus. When serotypes Salmonella enteritidis or Salmonella typhimurium were detected and confirmed in samples taken, Directive 92/117/EEC laid down specific measures to control the infection.(10) Other Community legislation provides for the monitoring and control of certain zoonoses in animal populations. In particular Council Directive 64/432/EEC of 26 June 1964 on animal health problems affecting intra-Community trade in bovine animals and swine(6) deals with bovine tuberculosis and bovine brucellosis. Council Directive 91/68/EEC of 28 January 1991 on animal health conditions governing intra-Community trade in ovine and caprine animals(7) deals with ovine and caprine brucellosis. This Regulation should not create any unnecessary duplication of these existing requirements.(11) Moreover, future Community legislation on food hygiene should cover specific elements necessary for the prevention, control and monitoring of zoonoses and zoonotic agents and include specific requirements for the microbiological quality of food.(12) Directive 92/117/EEC provided for the collection of data on the occurrence of zoonoses and zoonotic agents in feedingstuffs, animals, food and humans. That data collection system, although not harmonised and therefore not allowing comparison between Member States, does provide a basis for evaluating the current situation concerning zoonoses and zoonotic agents in the Community.(13) The results of the data collection system show that certain zoonotic agents, namely Salmonella spp. and Campylobacter spp., cause the majority of cases of zoonoses in humans. There seems to be a decreasing trend of human cases of salmonellosis, in particular due to Salmonella enteritidis and Salmonella typhimurium, thus reflecting the success of related control measures taken in the Community. Nevertheless, it is assumed that many cases remain unreported and therefore the data collected do not necessarily give the full picture of the situation.(14) In its opinion on zoonoses adopted on 12 April 2000, the Scientific Committee on Veterinary Measures relating to Public Health considered that the measures in place at that time to control food-borne zoonotic infections were insufficient. It further considered that the epidemiological data that Member States were collecting were incomplete and not fully comparable. As a consequence, the Committee recommended improved monitoring arrangements and identified risk management options.(15) It is therefore necessary to improve the existing control systems for specific zoonotic agents. Simultaneously, the rules laid down in Directive 2003/99/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 November 2003 on the monitoring of zoonoses and zoonotic agents, amending Council Decision 90/424/EEC and repealing Council Directive 92/117/EEC(8) will replace the monitoring and data collection systems established by Directive 92/117/EEC.(16) In principle, controls should cover the whole food chain, from farm to table.(17) The rules governing such controls should generally be those laid down under Community legislation on feedingstuffs, animal health and food hygiene.(18) However, for certain zoonoses and zoonotic agents it is necessary to lay down specific requirements for controls.(19) Those specific requirements should be based on targets for the reduction of the prevalence of zoonoses and zoonotic agents.(20) The targets should be established for zoonoses and zoonotic agents in animal populations taking account, in particular, of their frequency and epidemiological trends in animal and human populations, feed and food, their gravity for humans, their potential economic consequences, scientific advice and the existence of appropriate measures to reduce their prevalence. Targets may be established in respect of other parts of the food chain, where necessary.(21) To ensure the achievement of the targets in good time, Member States should set up specific control programmes, which the Community should approve.(22) The main responsibility for the safety of food should lie with food and feed business operators. Member States should, therefore, encourage the creation of business-wide control programmes.(23) Within their control programmes, Member States and food and feed business operators may wish to use specific control methods. However, certain methods may not be acceptable, in particular if they hamper the achievement of the target in general, interfere specifically with necessary testing systems or give rise to potential threats to public health. Appropriate procedures should therefore be laid down enabling the Community to decide that certain control methods should not be used as part of control programmes.(24) Control methods may also exist or be developed which, as such, do not fall under any specific Community legislation on product approval but would help to achieve the targets for the reduction of the prevalence of specified zoonoses and zoonotic agents. It should, therefore, be possible to approve the use of such methods at Community level.(25) It will be essential to ensure that restocking of animals takes place from flocks or herds that have been subject to controls in accordance with the requirements of this Regulation. When a specific control programme is in force, the results of testing should be forwarded to purchasers of animals. To that end, specific requirements should be added to the corresponding Community legislation on intra-Community trade and imports from third countries, in particular as regards consignments of live animals and hatching eggs. Directive 64/432/EEC, Council Directive 72/462/EEC of 12 December 1972 on health and veterinary inspection problems upon importation of bovine animals and swine and fresh meat from third countries(9) and Council Directive 90/539/EEC of 15 October 1990 on animal health conditions governing intra-Community trade in, and imports from third countries of, poultry and hatching eggs(10) should be amended accordingly.(26) The adoption of this Regulation should not affect the additional guarantees agreed for Finland and Sweden on their accession to the Community and confirmed by Commission Decisions 94/968/EC(11), 95/50/EC(12), 95/160/EC(13), 95/161/EC(14), 95/168/EC(15) and by Council Decisions 95/409/EC(16), 95/410/EC(17) and 95/411/EC(18). This Regulation should provide a procedure for the granting, for a transitional period, of guarantees to any Member State that has an approved national control programme exceeding the minimum Community requirements in relation to salmonella. The results of tests on live animals and hatching eggs traded with such a Member State should meet the criteria laid down in its national control programme. Future Community legislation on hygiene rules for food of animal origin should provide a similar procedure in respect of meat and table eggs.(27) Third countries exporting to the Community must implement equivalent measures for the control of zoonoses at the same time as measures are applied in the Community.(28) As regards control of salmonella, available information tends to show that poultry products are a major source of human salmonellosis. Control measures should, therefore, be applied to production of those products, thus extending the measures initiated under Directive 92/117/EEC. As regards the production of table eggs, it is important to establish specific measures concerning the placing on the market of products originating from flocks that have not been tested free of relevant salmonella. As regards poultry meat, the aim is to place on the market poultry meat with reasonable assurance that it is free from relevant salmonella. A transitional period is necessary for food business operators to adapt to the measures envisaged, which may be adapted further in particular in the light of scientific risk assessment.(29) It is appropriate to designate national and Community reference laboratories to give guidance and assistance on matters falling within the scope of this Regulation.(30) To ensure the uniform application of this Regulation, provision should be made for the organisation of Community audits and inspections in accordance with other Community legislation in this field.(31) Appropriate procedures should be laid down for amending certain provisions of this Regulation to take account of technical and scientific progress and for the adoption of implementing and transitional measures.(32) To take account of technical and scientific progress, close and effective cooperation should be ensured between the Commission and the Member States within the Standing Committee set up by Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 28 January 2002 laying down the general principles and requirements of food law, establishing the European Food Safety Authority, and laying down procedures in matters of food safety(19).(33) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Regulation should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission(20),HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:CHAPTER I INTRODUCTORY PROVISIONSArticle 1Subject matter and scope1. The purpose of this Regulation is to ensure that proper and effective measures are taken to detect and to control salmonella and other zoonotic agents at all relevant stages of production, processing and distribution, particularly at the level of primary production, including in feed, in order to reduce their prevalence and the risk they pose to public health.2. This Regulation shall cover:(a) the adoption of targets for the reduction of the prevalence of specified zoonoses in animal populations:(i) at the level of primary production; and(ii) where appropriate for the zoonosis or zoonotic agent concerned, at other stages of the food chain, including in food and feed;(b) the approval of specific control programmes established by Member States and food and feed business operators;(c) the adoption of specific rules concerning certain control methods applied in the reduction of the prevalence of zoonoses and zoonotic agents;(d) the adoption of rules concerning intra-Community trade and imports from third countries of certain animals and products thereof.3.

Measures taken to reduce the prevalence of zoonoses and zoonotic agents listed in Annex I shall be implemented in accordance with the rules laid down in this Regulation and any rules adopted pursuant thereto.CHAPTER III CONTROL PROGRAMMESArticle 5National control programmes1. To achieve the Community targets provided for in Article 4, Member States shall establish national control programmes for each zoonosis and zoonotic agent listed in Annex I. National control programmes shall have regard to the geographical distribution of zoonoses within each Member State and to the financial implications for primary producers and feed and food business operators of establishing effective controls.2. National control programmes shall be continuous and cover a period of at least three consecutive years.3. National control programmes shall:(a) provide for the detection of zoonoses and zoonotic agents in accordance with the requirements and minimum sampling rules laid down in Annex II;(b) define the respective responsibilities of competent authorities and food and feed business operators;(c) specify the control measures to be taken following the detection of zoonoses and zoonotic agents, in particular to protect public health, including implementation of the specific measures laid down in Annex II;(d) allow for the progress under their provisions to be evaluated and for those programmes to be reviewed, in particular in the light of results obtained from the detection of zoonoses and zoonotic agents.4. National control programmes shall cover at least the following stages of the food chain:(a) feed production;(b) primary production of animals;(c) processing and preparation of food of animal origin.5. National control programmes shall contain, where relevant, the provisions laid down in relation to testing methods and criteria against which the results of these tests shall be assessed, for testing animals and hatching eggs despatched within the national territory, as part of the official controls provided for in Annex II, part A.6. The requirements and minimum sampling rules laid down in Annex II may be amended, adapted or supplemented, in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 14(2), after taking account in particular of the criteria listed in point (c) of Article 4(6).7. Within six months of the establishment of the Community targets provided for in Article 4, Member States shall submit their national control programmes to the Commission and set out the measures to be implemented.Article 6Approval of the national control programmes1. After a Member State submits a national control programme in accordance with Article 5, the Commission shall have two months within which to request any further relevant and necessary information from that Member State. The Member State shall provide such further information within two months of receiving such a request. The Commission shall, within two months of receiving such further information or, if it did not request further information, within six months of the submission of the control programme, establish whether it complies with relevant rules, including this Regulation in particular.2. When the Commission has established the conformity of a national control programme, or at the request of the Member State that submitted it, the programme shall be considered without undue delay with a view to approval in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 14(2).3. Amendments to a programme previously approved pursuant to paragraph 2 may be approved, in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 14(2), to take account of the evolution in the situation in the Member State concerned, in particular in the light of the results referred to in Article 5(3)(d).Article 7Food and feed business operators' control programmes1. Food and feed business operators, or organisations representing such operators, may establish control programmes, covering, as far as possible, all stages of production, processing and distribution.2. If they wish their control programmes to form part of a national control programme, food and feed business operators, or their representative organisations, shall submit their control programmes, and any amendments thereto, to the competent authority of the Member State in which they are located for approval. If the operations concerned take place in different Member States, the programmes shall be approved separately for each Member State.3. The competent authority may approve control programmes submitted pursuant to paragraph 2 only if it is satisfied that the control programmes comply with the relevant requirements set out in Annex II and with the objectives of the relevant national control programme.4. Member States shall maintain up-to-date lists of approved control programmes of food and feed business operators or their representative organisations. The lists shall be made available to the Commission upon request.5. Food and feed business operators or their representative organisations shall communicate regularly the results of their control programmes to the competent authorities.CHAPTER IV CONTROL METHODSArticle 8Specific control methods1. At the initiative of the Commission or at the request of a Member State and in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 14(2):(a) it may be decided that specific control methods may or shall be applied for the reduction of prevalence of zoonoses and zoonotic agents at the stage of the primary production of animals and other stages in the food chain;(b) rules may be adopted concerning the conditions for the use of the methods referred to in subparagraph (a);(c) detailed rules may be adopted concerning necessary documents and procedures as well as minimum requirements for the methods referred to in subparagraph (a); and(d) it may be decided that certain specific control methods shall not be used as a part of control programmes.2. The provisions referred to in paragraph 1(a), (b) and (c) shall not apply to methods using substances or techniques covered by Community legislation on animal nutrition, food additives or veterinary medicinal products.CHAPTER V TRADEArticle 9Intra-Community trade1. As from the dates mentioned in Annex I, column 5, at the latest, flocks and herds of origin of the species listed in column 2 shall be tested for the zoonoses and zoonotic agents listed in column 1 prior to any dispatching of the live animals, or hatching eggs, from the food business of origin. The date and the result of testing shall be included in the relevant health certificates provided for in Community legislation.2. The Member State of destination may, in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 14(2), be authorised for a transitional period to require that the results of the tests to be referred to in the relevant health certificates for consignments of animals and hatching eggs subject to testing in the Member State of dispatch fulfil the same criteria as regards salmonella as those laid down under its approved national programme, in accordance with Article 5(5), for consignments despatched within its territory.The authorisation may be withdrawn in accordance with the same procedure.3. The special measures concerning salmonella that applied to live animals dispatched to Finland and Sweden prior to the entry into force of this Regulation shall continue to apply as if they had been authorised in accordance with paragraph 2.4. Without prejudice to Article 5(6), specific rules concerning the setting by Member States of the criteria referred to in Article 5(5) and in paragraph 2 above, may be laid down in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 14(2).Article 10Imports from third countries1. As from the dates mentioned in Annex I, column 5, admission to or retention on the lists of third countries provided for in Community legislation, for the relevant species or category, from which Member States are authorised to import those animals or hatching eggs covered by this Regulation shall be subject to submission to the Commission by the third country concerned of a programme equivalent to those provided for under Article 5 and its approval in accordance with this Article. The programme shall give details of the guarantees offered by that country as regards inspections and controls for zoonoses and zoonotic agents. Those guarantees must be at least equivalent to the guarantees provided for by this Regulation. The Food and Veterinary Office of the Commission shall be closely involved in monitoring to verify whether equivalent control programmes exist in third countries.2. These programmes shall be approved in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 14(2), provided that the equivalence of the measures described under the programme, with the relevant requirements applicable under Community rules, is objectively demonstrated. Alternative guarantees to those provided for in this Regulation may be allowed in accordance with that procedure, provided that they are not more favourable than those applicable to intra-Community trade.3. For third countries with which a regular trade flow is established, the provisions of Article 5(7) and Article 6(1) concerning time periods for the submission and approval of programmes shall apply. For third countries establishing or resuming a trade flow, the time periods provided for in Article 6 shall apply.4. Flocks and herds of origin of species listed in Annex I, column 2, shall be tested prior to any dispatching of the live animals or hatching eggs from the food business of origin. Flocks and herds shall be tested for the zoonoses and zoonotic agents listed in Annex I, column 1, or, if necessary to achieve the objective of equivalent guarantees laid down in paragraph 1, such zoonoses and zoonotic agents as may be specified in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 14(2). The date and the result of testing shall be included in the relevant import certificates, for which the models laid down by Community legislation shall be amended accordingly.5. The Member State of final destination may be authorised, in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 14(2), to require for a transitional period that the results of the testing referred to in paragraph 4 fulfil the same criteria as those laid down under its national programme, in accordance with Article 5(5). The authorisation may be withdrawn and, without prejudice to Article 5(6), specific rules concerning such criteria may be laid down, in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 14(2).6. Admission to or retention on the lists of third countries provided for in Community legislation, for the relevant category of products, from which Member States are authorised to import those products covered by this Regulation shall be subject to submission to the Commission by the third country concerned of guarantees equivalent to those provided for by this Regulation.CHAPTER VI LABORATORIESArticle 11Reference laboratories1.

Symptoms include fever, diarrhoea and abdominal cramps.\nScope\nThe regulation covers:\ntargets for Salmonella (and other zoonotic agents*) reduction;\napproval of control programmes set up by EU countries and food and feed businesses;\nrules on certain methods used to reduce prevalence;\nrules on trade within the EU and imports from non-EU countries of certain animals and their products.\nIt does not apply to primary production for private domestic use or direct local supply in small quantities.\nEU targets\nAfter consultation with EU countries, the European Commission has proposed control targets in primary production. These are expressed as the allowed maximum percentage of herds or flocks infected, the required minimum reduction and the time limit within which this must be achieved.\nEU targets, to be reached within 3 years from the start, in the respective year for each animal group, were set for the following:\n2007: Breeding flocks of chickens (Gallus gallus);\n2008: Laying hens;\n2009: Broilers;\n2010: Turkeys.\nNational control programmes\nTo achieve the targets, EU countries had to draw up national control programmes, covering at least feed production, primary production of animals, and food processing and preparation, in order to:\ndetect infection;\ndefine the responsibilities of public authorities and food and feed businesses;\naddress specific control measures, in particular to protect public health, including how antimicrobials and vaccines are used (see Commission Regulation (EC) No 1177/2006);\nevaluate progress and review if needed.\nThese national programmes had to be approved by and are co-financed by the European Commission.\nEggs\nCommission Regulation (EC) No 1237/2007 amended Regulation (EC) No 2160/2003 and prohibits the placing on the market of eggs from flocks of laying hens contaminated with certain Salmonella.\nOther foodstuffs\nAlong the food supply chain, the measures required by Regulation (EC) No 2160/2003 are supplemented by microbiological criteria for Salmonella, L. monocytogenes and other zoonotic agents or their indicators, which are set out in Regulation (EC) No 2073/2005. This lays down the microbiological criteria for certain microorganisms and rules for food business operators in respect of the requirements of Regulation (EC) No 852/2004 on food hygiene.\nMicrobiological testing alone cannot guarantee the safety of foods tested, but these criteria provide objectives and reference points to assist food businesses and authorities to manage and monitor the safety of foods.\nSpecial guarantees forSalmonellafor trade to some EU countries\nFlocks or food must be tested for Salmonella before trade to Finland, Sweden and Norway (live animals, eggs and meat), and Denmark (eggs), with the results included in the relevant EU health certificates.\nCouncil Decision 95/410/EC regarding poultry intended for slaughter.\nCommission Decision 2004/235/EC regarding laying hens.\nCommission Decision 2003/644/EC regarding breeding hens.\nRegulation (EC) No 1688/2005 regarding certain meat and eggs.\nImports\nTo be officially authorised to export to the EU live poultry, hatching or table eggs, non-EU countries must have equivalent control programmes. Such approvals are the subject of Commission Decision 2007/843/EC. Food exported to the EU must comply with food safety criteria and equivalent guarantees must be provided as regards process hygiene criteria.\nEuropean and national reference laboratories\nThe Commission has designated and finances the work programme of a European reference laboratory for each of the most relevant zoonotic agents. EU countries have designated national reference laboratories for the analysis and testing of these zoonotic agents.\nReports\nTrends on the occurrence of foodborne agents in humans, food, animals and feed can be found on the website of the European Food Safety Authority. Of particular note is the fact that salmonellosis among humans has declined from almost 200,000 cases per year in 2004 to around 90,000 in 2014.\nFROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?\n              \nIt has applied since 12 June 2004.\nBACKGROUND\n              \nFor more information, see:\n‘Control of salmonella’ on the European Commission’s website\n‘Zoonotic diseases’ on the European Food Safety Authority's website\n* KEY TERMS\n              \nZoonotic agent: a bacterium, such as salmonella, causing infections or diseases transmitted directly or indirectly between animals and humans, for instance in contaminated food or through contact.\nMAIN DOCUMENT\n            \nRegulation (EC) No 2160/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 November 2003 on the control of salmonella and other specified food-borne zoonotic agents (OJ L 325, 12.12.2003, pp. 1–15)\nSuccessive amendments to Regulation (EC) No 2160/2003 have been incorporated in to the original document.
