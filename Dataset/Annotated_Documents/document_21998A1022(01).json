The Parties agree to notify one another in a timely fashion of any inventions or copyrighted works arising under this Agreement and to seek protection for such intellectual property in a timely fashion. Rights to such intellectual property shall be allocated as provided in this Annex.I. SCOPE A. This Annex is applicable to all cooperative activities undertaken by the Parties or their participants pursuant to this Agreement, except as otherwise specifically agreed by the Parties.B. For purposes of this Agreement, 'intellectual property` shall have the meaning found in Article 2 of the Convention Establishing the World Intellectual Property Organisation, done at Stockholm, 14 July 1967.C. This Annex addresses the allocation of rights, interests, and royalties between the Parties or their participants. Each Party shall ensure that the other Party or its participants can obtain the rights to intellectual property allocated in accordance with the Annex. This Annex does not otherwise alter or prejudice the allocation between a Party and its nationals, which shall be determined by that Party's laws and practices.D. Disputes concerning intellectual property arising under this Agreement should be resolved through discussions between the relevant participants, or, if necessary, the Parties. Upon mutual agreement of the Parties, the participants may submit a dispute to an arbitral tribunal for binding arbitration. Unless the participants agree otherwise in writing, the arbitration rules of Uncitral shall govern.E. Termination or expiration of this Agreement shall not affect rights or obligations under this Annex.II. ALLOCATION OF RIGHTS A. Each Party shall be entitled to a non-exclusive, irrevocable, royalty-free licence in all countries to reproduce, publicly distribute and translate scientific and technical journal articles, non-proprietary scientific reports and books directly arising from cooperation under this Agreement. All publicly distributed copies of a copyrighted work prepared under this provision shall indicate the names of the authors of the work unless an author explicitly declines to be named. Each Party or its participants shall have the right to review a translation prior to public distribution.B.

The technology management plan shall consider the relative contributions of the Parties and their participants, the benefits of licensing by territory or for fields of use, requirements imposed by the Parties' domestic laws, and other factors deemed appropriate.(b) If the parties or their participants did not agree to a joint technology management plan in the initial research cooperation agreement and cannot reach an agreement within a reasonable time, not to exceed six months, from the time a Party becomes aware of the creation or likely creation of the intellectual property in question as a result of the joint research, the Parties or their participants shall resolve the matter in accordance with the provisions of paragraph I(D). Pending resolution of the matter, such intellectual property shall be owned jointly by the Parties or their participants, but shall be commercially exploited (including product development) only by mutual agreement.(c) 'Joint research` means research that is implemented with financial support from one or both Parties and that involves collaboration by participants from both the Community and the United States of America and is designated as joint research in writing by the Parties or their scientific and technological organisations and agencies, or in the case where there is funding by only one Party, by that Party and the participants in that project.(d) In the event that either Party believes that a particular joint research project under this Agreement has led or will lead to the creation or furnishing of a type of intellectual property that it protects but is not protected throughout the territory of the other Party, the Parties shall immediately hold discussions to determine the allocation of the rights to the said intellectual property. The joint activities in question will be suspended during the discussions, unless otherwise agreed by the Parties thereto.
