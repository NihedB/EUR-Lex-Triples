Rules\nRULES OF PROCEDURE OF THE COURT OF JUSTICE\nTHE COURT OF JUSTICE\nHaving regard to the Treaty on European Union, and in particular Article 19 thereof,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular the sixth paragraph of Article 253 thereof,\nHaving regard to the Treaty establishing the European Atomic Energy Community, and in particular Article 106a(1) thereof,\nHaving regard to the Protocol on the Statute of the Court of Justice of the European Union, and in particular Article 63 and the second paragraph of Article 64 thereof,\nWhereas:\n(1)\nDespite having been amended on several occasions over the years, the Rules of Procedure of the Court of Justice have remained fundamentally unchanged in structure since their original adoption on 4 March 1953. The Rules of Procedure of 19 June 1991, which are currently in force, still reflect the initial preponderance of direct actions, whereas in fact the majority of such actions now fall within the jurisdiction of the General Court, and references for a preliminary ruling from the courts and tribunals of the Member States represent, quantitatively, the primary category of cases brought before the Court. That fact should be taken into account and the structure and content of the Rules of Procedure of the Court adapted, in consequence, to changes in its caseload.\n(2)\nWhile references for a preliminary ruling should be given their proper place in the Rules of Procedure, it is also appropriate to draw a clearer distinction between the rules that apply to all types of action and those that are specific to each type, to be contained in separate titles. In the interests of clarification, procedural provisions common to all cases brought before the Court should, therefore, all be contained in an initial title.\n(3)\nIn the light of experience gained in the course of implementing the various procedures, it is also necessary to supplement or to clarify, for the benefit of litigants as well as of national courts and tribunals, the rules that apply to each procedure. The rules in question concern, in particular, the concepts of party to the main proceedings, intervener and party to the proceedings before the General Court, or, in preliminary rulings, the rules governing the bringing of matters before the Court and the content of the order for reference. With regard to appeals against decisions of the General Court, a clearer distinction must also be drawn between appeals and cross-appeals in consequence of the service of an appeal on the cross-appellant.\n(4)\nConversely, the excessive complexity of certain procedures, such as the review procedure, has come to light on their implementation. Accordingly, they should be simplified by providing, inter alia, for a Chamber of five Judges to be designated for a period of one year to be responsible for ruling both on the First Advocate General’s proposal to review and on the questions to be reviewed.\n(5)\nSimilarly, the procedural arrangements for dealing with requests for Opinions should be eased by aligning them with those that apply to other cases and by providing, in consequence, for a single Advocate General to be involved in dealing with the request for an Opinion. In the interests of making the Rules easier to understand, all the particular procedures currently to be found in a number of separate titles and chapters of the Rules of Procedure should also be brought together in a single title.\n(6)\nIn order to maintain the Court’s capacity, in the face of an ever-increasing caseload, to dispose within a reasonable period of time of the cases brought before it, it is also necessary to continue the efforts made to reduce the duration of proceedings before the Court, in particular by extending the opportunities for the Court to rule by reasoned order, simplifying the rules relating to the intervention of the States and institutions referred to in the first and third paragraphs of Article 40 of the Statute and providing for the Court to be able to rule without a hearing if it considers that it has sufficient information on the basis of all the written observations lodged in a case.\n(7)\nIn the interests of making the Rules applied by the Court easier to understand, lastly, certain rules which are outdated or not applied should be deleted, every paragraph of the present Rules numbered, each article given a specific heading summarising its content and the terminology harmonised.\nWith the Council’s approval given on 24 September 2012.\nHAS ADOPTED THESE RULES OF PROCEDURE:\nINTRODUCTORY PROVISIONS\nArticle 1\nDefinitions\n1.

In addition to, or instead of, specifying an address for service as referred to in paragraph 1, the application may state that the lawyer or agent agrees that service is to be effected on him by telefax or any other technical means of communication.\n3.   If the application does not comply with the requirements referred to in paragraphs 1 or 2, all service on the party concerned for the purpose of the proceedings shall be effected, for so long as the defect has not been cured, by registered letter addressed to the agent or lawyer of that party. By way of derogation from Article 48, service shall then be deemed to be duly effected by the lodging of the registered letter at the post office of the place in which the Court has its seat.\nArticle 122\nAnnexes to the application\n1.   The application shall be accompanied, where appropriate, by the documents specified in the second paragraph of Article 21 of the Statute.\n2.   An application submitted under Article 273 TFEU shall be accompanied by a copy of the special agreement concluded between the Member States concerned.\n3.   If an application does not comply with the requirements set out in paragraphs 1 or 2 of this Article, the Registrar shall prescribe a reasonable time-limit within which the applicant is to produce the abovementioned documents. If the applicant fails to put the application in order, the Court shall, after hearing the Judge-Rapporteur and the Advocate General, decide whether the non-compliance with these conditions renders the application formally inadmissible.\nArticle 123\nService of the application\nThe application shall be served on the defendant. In cases where Article 119(4) or Article 122(3) applies, service shall be effected as soon as the application has been put in order or the Court has declared it admissible notwithstanding the failure to observe the requirements set out in those two Articles.\nArticle 124\nContent of the defence\n1.   Within two months after service on him of the application, the defendant shall lodge a defence, stating:\n(a)\nthe name and address of the defendant;\n(b)\nthe pleas in law and arguments relied on;\n(c)\nthe form of order sought by the defendant;\n(d)\nwhere appropriate, any evidence produced or offered.\n2.   Article 121 shall apply to the defence.\n3.   The time-limit laid down in paragraph 1 may exceptionally be extended by the President at the duly reasoned request of the defendant.\nArticle 125\nTransmission of documents\nWhere the European Parliament, the Council or the European Commission is not a party to a case, the Court shall send to them copies of the application and of the defence, without the annexes thereto, to enable them to assess whether the inapplicability of one of their acts is being invoked under Article 277 TFEU.\nArticle 126\nReply and rejoinder\n1.   The application initiating proceedings and the defence may be supplemented by a reply from the applicant and by a rejoinder from the defendant.\n2.   The President shall prescribe the time-limits within which those procedural documents are to be produced. He may specify the matters to which the reply or the rejoinder should relate.\nChapter 3\nPLEAS IN LAW AND EVIDENCE\nArticle 127\nNew pleas in law\n1.   No new plea in law may be introduced in the course of proceedings unless it is based on matters of law or of fact which come to light in the course of the procedure.\n2.   Without prejudice to the decision to be taken on the admissibility of the plea in law, the President may, on a proposal from the Judge-Rapporteur and after hearing the Advocate General, prescribe a time-limit within which the other party may respond to that plea.\nArticle 128\nEvidence produced or offered\n1.   In reply or rejoinder a party may produce or offer further evidence in support of his arguments. The party must give reasons for the delay in submitting such evidence.\n2.   The parties may, exceptionally, produce or offer further evidence after the close of the written part of the procedure. They must give reasons for the delay in submitting such evidence. The President may, on a proposal from the Judge-Rapporteur and after hearing the Advocate General, prescribe a time-limit within which the other party may comment on such evidence.\nChapter 4\nINTERVENTION\nArticle 129\nObject and effects of the intervention\n1.   The intervention shall be limited to supporting, in whole or in part, the form of order sought by one of the parties. It shall not confer the same procedural rights as those conferred on the parties and, in particular, shall not give rise to any right to request that a hearing be held.\n2.   The intervention shall be ancillary to the main proceedings. It shall become devoid of purpose if the case is removed from the register of the Court as a result of a party’s discontinuance or withdrawal from the proceedings or of an agreement between the parties, or where the application is declared inadmissible.\n3.   The intervener must accept the case as he finds it at the time of his intervention.\n4.   Consideration may be given to an application to intervene which is made after the expiry of the time-limit prescribed in Article 130 but before the decision to open the oral part of the procedure provided for in Article 60(4). In that event, if the President allows the intervention, the intervener may submit his observations during the hearing, if it takes place.\nArticle 130\nApplication to intervene\n1.   An application to intervene must be submitted within six weeks of the publication of the notice referred to in Article 21(4).\n2.   The application to intervene shall contain:\n(a)\na description of the case;\n(b)\na description of the main parties;\n(c)\nthe name and address of the intervener;\n(d)\nthe form of order sought, in support of which the intervener is applying for leave to intervene;\n(e)\na statement of the circumstances establishing the right to intervene, where the application is submitted pursuant to the second or third paragraph of Article 40 of the Statute.\n3.   The intervener shall be represented in accordance with Article 19 of the Statute.\n4.   Articles 119, 121 and 122 of these Rules shall apply.\nArticle 131\nDecision on applications to intervene\n1.   The application to intervene shall be served on the parties in order to obtain any written or oral observations they may wish to make on that application.\n2.   Where the application is submitted pursuant to the first or third paragraph of Article 40 of the Statute, the intervention shall be allowed by decision of the President and the intervener shall receive a copy of every procedural document served on the parties, provided that those parties have not, within 10 days after the service referred to in paragraph 1 has been effected, put forward observations on the application to intervene or identified secret or confidential items or documents which, if communicated to the intervener, the parties claim would be prejudicial to them.\n3.   In any other case, the President shall decide on the application to intervene by order or shall refer the application to the Court.\n4.   If the application to intervene is granted, the intervener shall receive a copy of every procedural document served on the parties, save, where applicable, for the secret or confidential items or documents excluded from such communication pursuant to paragraph 3.\nArticle 132\nSubmission of statements\n1.   The intervener may submit a statement in intervention within one month after communication of the procedural documents referred to in the preceding Article. That time-limit may be extended by the President at the duly reasoned request of the intervener.\n2.   The statement in intervention shall contain:\n(a)\nthe form of order sought by the intervener in support, in whole or in part, of the form of order sought by one of the parties;\n(b)\nthe pleas in law and arguments relied on by the intervener;\n(c)\nwhere appropriate, any evidence produced or offered.\n3.   After the statement in intervention has been lodged, the President shall, where necessary, prescribe a time-limit within which the parties may reply to that statement.\nChapter 5\nEXPEDITED PROCEDURE\nArticle 133\nDecision relating to the expedited procedure\n1.   At the request of the applicant or the defendant, the President of the Court may, where the nature of the case requires that it be dealt with within a short time, after hearing the other party, the Judge-Rapporteur and the Advocate General, decide that a case is to be determined pursuant to an expedited procedure derogating from the provisions of these Rules.\n2.   The request for a case to be determined pursuant to an expedited procedure must be made by a separate document submitted at the same time as the application initiating proceedings or the defence, as the case may be, is lodged.\n3.   Exceptionally the President may also take such a decision of his own motion, after hearing the parties, the Judge-Rapporteur and the Advocate General.\nArticle 134\nWritten part of the procedure\n1.   Under the expedited procedure, the application initiating proceedings and the defence may be supplemented by a reply and a rejoinder only if the President, after hearing the Judge-Rapporteur and the Advocate General, considers this to be necessary.\n2.   An intervener may submit a statement in intervention only if the President, after hearing the Judge-Rapporteur and the Advocate General, considers this to be necessary.\nArticle 135\nOral part of the procedure\n1.   Once the defence has been submitted or, if the decision to determine the case pursuant to an expedited procedure is not made until after that pleading has been lodged, once that decision has been taken, the President shall fix a date for the hearing, which shall be communicated forthwith to the parties. He may postpone the date of the hearing where it is necessary to undertake measures of inquiry or where measures of organisation of procedure so require.\n2.   Without prejudice to Articles 127 and 128, a party may supplement his arguments and produce or offer evidence during the oral part of the procedure. The party must, however, give reasons for the delay in producing such further arguments or evidence.\nArticle 136\nDecision on the substance\nThe Court shall give its ruling after hearing the Advocate General.\nChapter 6\nCOSTS\nArticle 137\nDecision as to costs\nA decision as to costs shall be given in the judgment or order which closes the proceedings.\nArticle 138\nGeneral rules as to allocation of costs\n1.   The unsuccessful party shall be ordered to pay the costs if they have been applied for in the successful party’s pleadings.\n2.   Where there is more than one unsuccessful party the Court shall decide how the costs are to be shared.\n3.   Where each party succeeds on some and fails on other heads, the parties shall bear their own costs. However, if it appears justified in the circumstances of the case, the Court may order that one party, in addition to bearing its own costs, pay a proportion of the costs of the other party.\nArticle 139\nUnreasonable or vexatious costs\nThe Court may order a party, even if successful, to pay costs which the Court considers that party to have unreasonably or vexatiously caused the opposite party to incur.\nArticle 140\nCosts of interveners\n1.   The Member States and institutions which have intervened in the proceedings shall bear their own costs.\n2.   The States, other than the Member States, which are parties to the EEA Agreement, and also the EFTA Surveillance Authority, shall similarly bear their own costs if they have intervened in the proceedings.\n3.   The Court may order an intervener other than those referred to in the preceding paragraphs to bear his own costs.\nArticle 141\nCosts in the event of discontinuance or withdrawal\n1.   A party who discontinues or withdraws from proceedings shall be ordered to pay the costs if they have been applied for in the other party’s observations on the discontinuance.\n2.   However, at the request of the party who discontinues or withdraws from proceedings, the costs shall be borne by the other party if this appears justified by the conduct of that party.\n3.   Where the parties have come to an agreement on costs, the decision as to costs shall be in accordance with that agreement.\n4.   If costs are not claimed, the parties shall bear their own costs.\nArticle 142\nCosts where a case does not proceed to judgment\nWhere a case does not proceed to judgment the costs shall be in the discretion of the Court.\nArticle 143\nCosts of proceedings\nProceedings before the Court shall be free of charge, except that:\n(a)\nwhere a party has caused the Court to incur avoidable costs the Court may, after hearing the Advocate General, order that party to refund them;\n(b)\nwhere copying or translation work is carried out at the request of a party, the cost shall, in so far as the Registrar considers it excessive, be paid for by that party on the Registry’s scale of charges referred to in Article 22.\nArticle 144\nRecoverable costs\nWithout prejudice to the preceding Article, the following shall be regarded as recoverable costs:\n(a)\nsums payable to witnesses and experts under Article 73 of these Rules;\n(b)\nexpenses necessarily incurred by the parties for the purpose of the proceedings, in particular the travel and subsistence expenses and the remuneration of agents, advisers or lawyers.\nArticle 145\nDispute concerning the costs to be recovered\n1.   If there is a dispute concerning the costs to be recovered, the Chamber of three Judges to which the Judge-Rapporteur who dealt with the case is assigned shall, on application by the party concerned and after hearing the opposite party and the Advocate General, make an order. In that event, the formation of the Court shall be composed of the President of that Chamber, the Judge-Rapporteur and the first Judge or, as the case may be, the first two Judges designated from the list referred to in Article 28(3) on the date on which the dispute is brought before that Chamber by the Judge-Rapporteur.\n2.   If the Judge-Rapporteur is not a member of a Chamber of three Judges, the decision shall be taken, under the same conditions, by the Chamber of five Judges to which he is assigned. In addition to the Judge-Rapporteur, the formation of the Court shall be composed of four Judges designated from the list referred to in Article 28(2) on the date on which the dispute is brought before that Chamber by the Judge-Rapporteur.\n3.   The parties may, for the purposes of enforcement, apply for an authenticated copy of the order.\nArticle 146\nProcedure for payment\n1.   Sums due from the cashier of the Court and from its debtors shall be paid in euro.\n2.   Where costs to be recovered have been incurred in a currency other than the euro or where the steps in respect of which payment is due were taken in a country of which the euro is not the currency, the conversion shall be effected at the European Central Bank’s official rates of exchange on the day of payment.\nChapter 7\nAMICABLE SETTLEMENT, DISCONTINUANCE, CASES THAT DO NOT PROCEED TO JUDGMENT AND PRELIMINARY ISSUES\nArticle 147\nAmicable settlement\n1.   If, before the Court has given its decision, the parties reach a settlement of their dispute and inform the Court of the abandonment of their claims, the President shall order the case to be removed from the register and shall give a decision as to costs in accordance with Article 141, having regard to any proposals made by the parties on the matter.\n2.   This provision shall not apply to proceedings under Articles 263 TFEU and 265 TFEU.\nArticle 148\nDiscontinuance\nIf the applicant informs the Court in writing or at the hearing that he wishes to discontinue the proceedings, the President shall order the case to be removed from the register and shall give a decision as to costs in accordance with Article 141.\nArticle 149\nCases that do not proceed to judgment\nIf the Court declares that the action has become devoid of purpose and that there is no longer any need to adjudicate on it, the Court may at any time of its own motion, on a proposal from the Judge-Rapporteur and after hearing the parties and the Advocate General, decide to rule by reasoned order. It shall give a decision as to costs.\nArticle 150\nAbsolute bar to proceeding with a case\nOn a proposal from the Judge-Rapporteur, the Court may at any time of its own motion, after hearing the parties and the Advocate General, decide to rule by reasoned order on whether there exists any absolute bar to proceeding with a case.\nArticle 151\nPreliminary objections and issues\n1.   A party applying to the Court for a decision on a preliminary objection or issue not going to the substance of the case shall submit the application by a separate document.\n2.   The application must state the pleas of law and arguments relied on and the form of order sought by the applicant; any supporting items and documents must be annexed to it.\n3.   As soon as the application has been submitted, the President shall prescribe a time-limit within which the opposite party may submit in writing his pleas in law and the form of order which he seeks.\n4.   Unless the Court decides otherwise, the remainder of the proceedings on the application shall be oral.\n5.   The Court shall, after hearing the Advocate General, decide on the application as soon as possible or, where special circumstances so justify, reserve its decision until it rules on the substance of the case.\n6.   If the Court refuses the application or reserves its decision, the President shall prescribe new time-limits for the further steps in the proceedings.\nChapter 8\nJUDGMENTS BY DEFAULT\nArticle 152\nJudgments by default\n1.   If a defendant on whom an application initiating proceedings has been duly served fails to respond to the application in the proper form and within the time-limit prescribed, the applicant may apply to the Court for judgment by default.\n2.   The application for judgment by default shall be served on the defendant. The Court may decide to open the oral part of the procedure on the application.\n3.   Before giving judgment by default the Court shall, after hearing the Advocate General, consider whether the application initiating proceedings is admissible, whether the appropriate formalities have been complied with, and whether the applicant’s claims appear well founded. The Court may adopt measures of organisation of procedure or order measures of inquiry.\n4.   A judgment by default shall be enforceable. The Court may, however, grant a stay of execution until the Court has given its decision on any application under Article 156 to set aside the judgment, or it may make execution subject to the provision of security of an amount and nature to be fixed in the light of the circumstances; this security shall be released if no such application is made or if the application fails.\nChapter 9\nREQUESTS AND APPLICATIONS RELATING TO JUDGMENTS AND ORDERS\nArticle 153\nCompetent formation of the Court\n1.   With the exception of applications referred to in Article 159, the requests and applications referred to in this Chapter shall be assigned to the Judge-Rapporteur who was responsible for the case to which the request or application relates, and shall be assigned to the formation of the Court which gave a decision in that case.\n2.

The second court is the General Court. Their mission is to ensure the law is complied with in the interpretation and implementation of the treaties by monitoring the legality of EU acts.\nOrganisation of the Court\nThe Court is organised as follows.\nComposition: it comprises 28 judges and 11 advocates general, appointed for 6 years. The tasks of the advocates general are to attend the Court and present legal opinions. The judges elect the President of the Court and the vice-president for a term of 3 years. The president is responsible for representing the Court and managing its work programme and is assisted by the vice-president.\nConstitution of chambers and designation of the judge-rapporteurs: the Court sets up chambers of five judges, the president of which is elected for 3 years, and chambers of three judges, the president of which is elected for 1 year. The President of the Court designates a judge-rapporteur to deal with a case, while an advocate general is designated by the first advocate general. If necessary, the Court may appoint assistant rapporteurs.\nRole of the Registrar: the Court appoints a registrar for a term of 6 years. The Registrar is responsible for the acceptance, transmission and custody of all documents, and for the records. In addition, the Registrar assists the Members of the Court and is in charge of the Court’s publications. Lastly, the Registrar directs the services of the Court under the authority of the President of the Court.\nWorking of the Court: cases are assigned to the full Court, the Grand Chamber or to a chamber of 5 or 3 judges. The number of judges dealing with a case depends on its importance and complexity. Most cases are dealt with by 5 judges, and it is very rare for the whole Court to hear the case. Several cases may be heard and determined together by the same formation of the Court. The deliberations of the Court must remain secret.\nLanguages: a language is assigned for each case. In direct actions, the applicant may choose the language from the 24 official EU languages. In preliminary ruling proceedings, the language of the case is that of the national court or tribunal.\nCharacteristics of proceedings\nIn general, proceedings before the Court comprises the following phases.\nWritten proceedings: this involves an exchange of pleadings between the parties. The pleadings must have clearly defined content. Once the procedure is closed, a preliminary report is presented by the judge-rapporteur to the general meeting of the Court.\nMeasures of inquiry: the Court may decide to hold measures of inquiry such as the personal appearance of the parties, requests for information and documents, oral testimony, the commissioning of an expert’s report and an inspection of the place or thing in question.\nA hearing may take place, if necessary. The hearing is opened and directed by the president. The hearing may take place in private (in camera).\nOpinion of the advocate general: in approximately half of all cases the advocate general delivers an opinion. If the case raises no new points of law the Court may decide that an opinion is not necessary.\nThe final decision: the Court decides by judgment or by order. Only the judgment is delivered in open court. Judgments and orders contain different information, such as a summary of the facts and the grounds for the decision. A copy is then distributed to each of the parties. Judgments and orders are available on the Court’s website.\nThe rules also contain specific provisions concerning the different procedures before the Court:\npreliminary ruling procedure;\ndirect actions;\nappeals against decisions of the General Court;\nopinions; and\nother particular forms of procedure.\nReferences for a preliminary hearing\nNational courts may submit a reference for a preliminary hearing before the Court in order to question the interpretation of EU law. As part of a reference for a preliminary hearing, observations may be made by, in particular:\nthe parties to the main proceedings;\nthe EU countries;\nthe European Commission;\nthe institution which adopted the act, the validity or interpretation of which is in dispute.\nAppeals against decisions by the General Court\nIt is possible to bring an appeal against a decision by the General Court. In this case, an application must be lodged with the Registrar containing, in particular, the supporting pleadings and legal arguments. The application must seek to have the decision set aside, in whole or in part.\nFROM WHEN DO THE RULES OF PROCEDURE APPLY?\n              \nThey have applied since 1 November 2012.\nBACKGROUND\n              \nFor more information, see:\n‘General presentation’ on the Court of Justice of the European Union’s website\nMAIN DOCUMENT\nRules of Procedure of the Court of Justice (OJ L 265, 29.9.2012, pp. 1-42)\nAmendment of the Rules of Procedure of the Court of Justice (OJ L 173, 26.6.2013, p. 65)\nRELATED DOCUMENTS\n            \nCouncil Regulation (EU) 2016/300 of 29 February 2016 determining the emoluments of EU high-level public office holders (OJ L 58, 4.3.2016, pp. 1-12)\nRegulation (EU, Euratom) 2015/2422 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 December 2015 amending Protocol No 3 on the Statute of the Court of Justice of the European Union (OJ L 341, 24.12.2015, pp. 14-17)\nlast update 11.08.2016", "tags": ["Court of Justice of the European Union", "judicial proceedings", "rules of procedure"], "subjects": ["Provisions governing the Institutions"], "split": "train", "reference_annotations": {}, "summary_annotations": {}}
