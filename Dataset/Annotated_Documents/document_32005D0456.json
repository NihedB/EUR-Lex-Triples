The opportunities offered by the Internet should be exploited in order to enable every individual and organisation in the Community to enjoy the social and economic benefits of sharing information and knowledge. The stage has now been set in Europe to exploit the potential of digital content.\n(3)\nThe conclusions of the European Council held in Lisbon on 23 and 24 March 2000 stressed that the shift to a digital, knowledge-based economy, prompted by new goods and services, will be a powerful engine for growth, competitiveness and jobs. On that occasion the role of the content industries in creating added value by exploiting and networking European cultural diversity was specifically recognised.\n(4)\nThe eEurope 2005 Action Plan, developing the Lisbon strategy, calls for actions to stimulate the emergence of secure services, applications and content over broadband networks and thus to provide a favourable environment for private investment, for the creation of new jobs, to boost productivity, to modernise public services and to give everyone the opportunity to participate in the global information society.\n(5)\nThe demand for quality digital content in Europe, with balanced access and user rights, by a broad community, be they citizens in society, students, researchers, SMEs and other business users, or people with special needs wishing to augment their knowledge, or ‘re‐users’ wishing to exploit digital content resources to create services, is increasingly apparent.\n(6)\nDigital content stakeholders are content providers (including public and private organisations and institutions that create, collect or own digital content) and content users (including organisations and enterprises that are end-users that reuse and/or add value to digital content). Particular attention should be given to the participation of SMEs.\n(7)\nThe eContent Programme (2001 to 2004) adopted by Council Decision 2001/48/EC (3), favoured the development and use of European digital content on the Internet and the linguistic diversity of European websites in the information society. The Commission Communication of 10 October 2003 concerning the mid-term evaluation of the eContent Programme reaffirms the importance of acting in this field.\n(8)\nTechnological advances offer the potential to add value to content in the form of embedded knowledge and to improve interoperability at the service level, which is fundamental to accessing and using and distributing digital content. This is particularly relevant to those areas of public interest to be addressed by this programme.\n(9)\nFostering of solid business models will enhance the continuity of the projects initiated under this programme, and will thus improve the conditions for greater economic return from services based on access to, and reuse of, digital content.\n(10)\nA legislative framework has been defined to deal with the challenges of digital content in the information society (4)\n (5)\n (6).\n(11)\nDifferent practices among Member States continue to pose technical obstacles impeding wide access, use, reuse and exploitation of public sector information in the Community.\n(12)\nWhere the digital content involves personal data, Directives 95/46/EC (7) and 2002/58/EC (8) should be respected and the technologies used should respect and, where possible, enhance privacy.\n(13)\nCommunity actions undertaken concerning the content of information should promote the Community's multilingual and multicultural specificity.\n(14)\nThe measures necessary for the implementation of this Decision should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission (9).\n(15)\nThe Commission should ensure complementarity and synergy with related Community initiatives and programmes, in particular those related to education and culture and to the European interoperability framework.\n(16)\nThis Decision lays down, for the entire duration of the programme, a financial framework constituting the prime reference, within the meaning of point 33 of the Interinstitutional Agreement of 6 May 1999 between the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission on budgetary discipline and improvement of the budgetary procedure (10), for the budgetary authority during the annual budgetary procedure.\n(17)\nSince the objectives of the proposed action, namely aiming at making digital content in Europe more accessible, usable and exploitable, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States due to the transnational character of the issues at stake and can therefore, by reason of the European scope and effects of the actions, be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Decision does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives,\nHAVE DECIDED AS FOLLOWS:\nArticle 1\nObjective of the Programme\n1.

INTRODUCTION\neContentplus has the overall aim of making digital content in Europe more accessible, usable and exploitable, facilitating the creation and diffusion of information, in areas of public interest, at Community level.\nIt will create better conditions for accessing and managing digital content and services in multilingual and multicultural environments. It will broaden users' choice and support new ways of interacting with knowledge-enhanced digital content, a feature which is becoming essential to make content more dynamic and tailored to specific contexts (learning, cultural, people with special needs, etc.).\nThe Programme will pave the way for a structured framework for quality digital content in Europe — The European Digital Content Area — by facilitating transfer of experiences, best practice and cross-fertilisation between content sectors, content providers and users.\n(a)\nfacilitating at Community level access to digital content, its use and exploitation;\n(b)\nfacilitating improvement of quality and enhancing best practice related to digital content between content providers and users, and across sectors;\n(c)\nreinforcing cooperation between digital content stakeholders and awareness.\nII.   LINES OF ACTION\nA.\nFacilitating at Community level access to digital content, its use and exploitation\nThe activities to be carried out under this line of action encompass the establishment of networks and alliances between stakeholders, encouraging the creation of new services.\nTarget areas are public sector information, spatial data, learning and cultural content.Focus will be on:\n(a)\nsupporting a wider recognition of the importance of public sector information (PSI), its commercial value and associated societal implications of its use. Activities shall improve effective cross-border use and exploitation of PSI between public sector organisations and private companies, including SMEs, for added-value information products and services;\n(b)\nencouraging a wider use of spatial data by public sector bodies, private companies, including SMEs, and citizens through cooperation mechanisms at European level. Activities should tackle both technical and organisational issues, avoiding duplications and underdeveloped territorial data sets. They should promote cross-border interoperability, supporting coordination between mapping agencies and fostering the emergence of new services at European level for mobile users. They should also support the use of open standards;\n(c)\nfostering the proliferation of open European knowledge pools of digital objects, for education and research communities, as well as the individual. The activities will support the creation of trans-European brokering services for digital learning content, with associated business models. The activities should also encourage the use of open standards, and the creation of large user groups analysing and testing pre-standardisation and specifications schemes with a view to conveying European multilingual and multicultural aspects into the process of definition of global standards for digital learning content;\n(d)\npromoting the emergence of trans-European information infrastructures for accessing and using high quality European digital cultural and scientific resources through the linking of virtual libraries, community memories, etc. Activities should encompass coordinated approaches to digitisation and collection building, preservation of digital objects and inventories of cultural and scientific digital resources. They should improve access to digital cultural and scientific assets through effective licensing schemes and collective pre-emptive clearing of rights.\nB.\nFacilitating improvement of quality and enhancing best practice related to digital content between content providers and users, and across sectors\nThe activities to be carried out under this line of action are intended to facilitate the identification and wide diffusion of best practice in methods, processes and operations to achieve higher quality, greater efficiency and effectiveness in the creation, use and distribution of digital content.\nThese activities encompass experiments that demonstrate searchability, usability, reusability, composability and interoperability of digital content within the context of the existing legal framework while meeting from the early stage of the process the requirements of different target groups and markets in an increasingly multilingual and multicultural environment, and extending beyond mere localisation technologies.\nThese activities will exploit the benefits of enhancing digital content with machine‐understandable data (semantically well-defined metadata based on relevant descriptive terminology, vocabularies and ontologies).\nThe experiments will be conducted in thematic clusters. The gathering, dissemination and cross-sector fertilisations of gained knowledge will be an integral part of the experiments.\nTarget application areas are public sector information, spatial data, digital learning and cultural content, as well as scientific and scholarly digital content.\nC.\nReinforcing cooperation between digital content stakeholders and awareness\nThe activities to be carried out under this line of action include measures accompanying relevant legislation relating to digital content, and fostering increased collaboration between digital content stakeholders, as well as awareness building. These activities will support the development of benchmarking, monitoring and analysis tools, the impact assessment of the Programme and the dissemination of results. They will identify and analyse emerging opportunities and problems (e.g. trust, quality marking, intellectual property rights in education) and propose, as appropriate, solutions.\nANNEX II\nThe means for implementing the programme\n1.\nThe Commission will implement the Programme in accordance with the technical content specified in Annex I.\n2.\nThe Programme will be executed through indirect action comprising:\n(a)\nshared-cost actions\n(i)\nProjects designed to increase knowledge so as to improve existing products, processes and/or services and/or to meet the needs of Community policies. The Community funding will normally not exceed 50 % of the cost of the project. Public sector bodies may be reimbursed on the basis of 100 % of additional costs.\n(ii)\nBest practice actions to spread knowledge. They will normally be conducted in thematic clusters and linked through thematic networks. The Community contribution for the measures set out under this point will be limited to direct costs deemed necessary or appropriate for achieving the specific objectives of the action.\n(iii)\nThematic networks: networks bringing together a variety of stakeholders around a given technological and organisational objective, so as to facilitate coordination activities and the transfer of knowledge. They may be linked to best practice actions. Support will be granted towards the additional eligible costs of coordinating and implementing the network. The Community participation may cover the additional eligible costs of these measures;\n(b)\naccompanying measures\nAccompanying measures will contribute to the implementation of the Programme or the preparation of future activities. Measures devoted to the commercialisation of products, process or services, marketing activities and sales promotion are excluded.\n(i)\nStudies in support of the Programme, including the preparation of future activities.\n(ii)\nExchange of information, conferences, seminars, workshops or other meetings and the management of clustered activities.\n(iii)\nDissemination, information and communication activities.\n3.\nThe selection of shared-cost actions will be based on calls for proposals published on the Commission's Internet site in accordance with the financial provisions in force.\n4.\nApplications for Community support should provide, where appropriate, a financial plan listing all the components of the funding of the projects, including the financial support requested from the Community, and any other requests for or grants of support from other sources.\n5.\nAccompanying measures will be implemented through calls for tenders in accordance with the financial provisions in force.\nANNEX III\nIndicative breakdown of expenditure\n1.\nFacilitating at Community level access to digital content, its use and exploitation\n40 to 50 %\n2.\nFacilitating improvement of quality and enhancing best practice related to digital content between content providers and users, and across sectors\n45 to 55 %\n3.\nReinforcing cooperation between digital content stakeholders and awareness\n8 to 12 %", "summary": "eContentplus (2005-2008)\neContentplus (2005-2008)\nThe eContentplus programme will contribute towards supporting the development of multilingual content with a view to supplying innovative on-line services in the European Union (EU). It will make it possible to reduce fragmentation of the European digital content market and to improve access and ease of use of geographical information, educational material and cultural content.\nACT\nDecision No 456/2005/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 9 March 2005 establishing a multiannual Community programme to make digital content in Europe more accessible, usable and exploitable.\nSUMMARY\nThe eContentplus programme is in line with the conclusions of the Lisbon European Council (March 2000) which stressed that the shift to a digital, knowledge-based economy will be a powerful engine for growth, competitiveness and jobs. It also contributes to the implementation of the eEurope 2005 Action Plan which advocates the launching of actions to stimulate the emergence of secure services, applications and content over broadband networks.\neContentplus is the successor to the eContent Programme (2001-2004). It is part of a set of measures intended to create favourable conditions for innovation and creativity on the convergent content market, such as the MEDIAPlus Programme and the revised \" Television without frontiers \" Directive.\nOverall duration and objective\nThe duration of the programme is 2005-2008. It aims to make digital content more accessible, usable and exploitable by facilitating the creation and dissemination of information at EU level.\nLines of action\nIn order to attain the overall aim of the Programme, the following lines of action will be addressed:\nfacilitating at Community level access to, use and exploitation of digital content;\nfacilitating improvement of quality and enhancing best practice related to digital content between content providers and users;\nreinforcing cooperation between digital content stakeholders and awareness.\nTarget areas\nThe programme will concentrate its efforts on those parts of the digital content market where market fragmentation is most marked and where market forces by themselves have not managed to spur growth. Three areas are being mainly targeted:\nGeographical information: the programme will encourage the aggregation of existing national databases in this area in order to create from them cross-border databases to which new information services and products can refer. eContentplus will thus further the setting up of information services at EU level based on data drawn from the transport, navigation, emergency services and environmental management sectors.\nEducational material: the programme will support the development of open European knowledge pools of digital objects, for education and research communities, as well as the individual. The activities undertaken under the programme will prompt the creation of trans-European brokering services for digital learning content. They will support the emergence of an appropriate information network and encourage the use of open standards to foster the deployment of effective pan-European learning services.\nCultural content, scientific information and scholarly content: eContentplus will encourage the setting-up of European information networks for accessing and using European digital scientific and cultural resources through the linking of virtual libraries or community memories. It will support the development of interoperable collections and objects available in various cultural institutions (libraries, archives, museums, etc.) and of solutions to facilitate the exhibition, discovery or repatriation of such resources.\nParticipation\nAny legal entity from an eligible country (European Union, accession candidate countries, Member States of the European Economic Area and of the European Free Trade Area) may participate in the eContentplus Programme.\nImplementation\nThe programme will be implemented through indirect action comprising:\nshared-cost actions\n- projects designed to increase knowledge so as to improve existing products, processes or services: Community funding will cover a maximum of 50% of the costs;\n- best practice actions to spread knowledge: the Community contribution will be limited to direct costs deemed necessary for achieving the objectives of the action.\n- thematic networks (networks bringing together a variety of stakeholders around a given technological and organisational objective): the Commission financial support will cover the additional eligible costs of coordinating and implementing the network.\naccompanying measures:\nThese will contribute to the implementation of the programme or the preparation of future activities. Measures devoted to the commercialisation of products, process or services, marketing activities and sales promotion are excluded from that category. The accompanying measures will include:\n- studies in support of the programme, including the preparation of future activities;\n- exchange of information, conferences, seminars, workshops, etc.;\n- dissemination, information and communication activities.\nCalls for proposals and invitations to tender\nThe selection of shared-cost actions will be based on invitations to tender published on the Commission's internet site.\nAccompanying measures will be implemented through invitations to tender.\nCoordination with the other programmes\nIn the implementation of the Programme, the Commission will ensure consistency and complementarity of the eContentplus Programme with other relevant Community policies, programmes and actions, in particular the IDA, eTEN, eInclusion, eLearning, Modinis and Safer Internet programmes.\nReferences\nAct\nEntry into force\nDeadline for transposition in the Member States\nOfficial Journal\nDecision 456/2005/EC [adoption : codecision COD/2004/0025]\n24.03.2005\n-\nOJ L 79 of 24.03.2005\nRELATED ACTS\nDecision 2004/387/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 April 2004 on interoperable delivery of pan-European eGovernment services to public administrations, businesses and citizens (IDABC) [Official Journal L 144 of 30.4.2004];\nDecision No 2318/2003/EC\nof the European Parliament and of the Council of 5 December 2003 adopting a multiannual programme (2004 to 2006) for the effective integration of information and communication technologies (ICT) in education and training systems in Europe (eLearning Programme) [Official Journal L 345 of 31.12.2003];\nDecision 2256/2003/EC\nof the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 November 2003 adopting a multiannual programme (2003-2005) for the monitoring of the eEurope 2005 action plan, dissemination of good practices and the improvement of network and information security (MODINIS) [Official Journal L 336 of 23.12.2003];\nDecision 276/1999/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 January 1999 adopting a multiannual Community action plan on promoting safer use of the internet by combating illegal and harmful content on global networks [Official Journal L 33 of 6.2.1999];\nCouncil Regulation (EC) No 2236/95 of 18 September 1995 laying down general rules for the granting of Community financial aid in the field of trans-European networks [Official Journal L 228 of 23.9.1995].\nSee also\nFor more information, visit the Commission's \" Information Society \" website.\nLast updated: 31.08.2007", "tags": ["dissemination of information", "information technology", "EU programme", "information society", "digital technology"], "subjects": ["Research and technological development", "Industry"], "split": "train", "reference_annotations": {"32005D0456_p1": {"text": "(7)  directive 95/46/ec of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data (OJ L 281, 23.11.1995, p. 31).
