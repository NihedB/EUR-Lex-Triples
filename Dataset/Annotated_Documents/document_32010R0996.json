{"celex_id": "32010R0996", "reference": "12.11.2010\nEN\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\nL 295/35\nREGULATION (EU) No 996/2010 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL\nof 20 October 2010\non the investigation and prevention of accidents and incidents in civil aviation and repealing Directive 94/56/EC\n(Text with EEA relevance)\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union and in particular Article 100(2) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European Commission,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee (1),\nAfter consulting the Committee of the Regions,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European Data Protection Supervisor (2),\nActing in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure (3),\nWhereas:\n(1)\nA high general level of safety should be ensured in civil aviation in Europe and all efforts should be made to reduce the number of accidents and incidents to ensure public confidence in air transport.\n(2)\nThe expeditious holding of safety investigations of civil aviation accidents and incidents improves aviation safety and helps to prevent the occurrence of accidents and incidents.\n(3)\nReporting, analysis, and dissemination of findings of safety related incidents are fundamentally important to improving air safety. Therefore the Commission should bring forward a proposal to revise Directive 2003/42/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 June 2003 on occurrence reporting in civil aviation (4) before 31 December 2011.\n(4)\nThe sole objective of safety investigations should be the prevention of future accidents and incidents without apportioning blame or liability.\n(5)\nAccount should be taken of the Convention on International Civil Aviation, signed in Chicago on 7 December 1944 (the Chicago Convention), which provides for the implementation of the measures necessary to ensure the safe operation of aircraft. Particular account should be taken of Annex 13 to the Chicago Convention and of its subsequent amendments, which lay down international standards and recommended practices for aircraft accident and incident investigation, as well as the understanding of the terms of State of Registry, State of the Operator, State of Design, State of Manufacture and State of Occurrence used therein.\n(6)\nAccording to the international standards and recommended practices set out in Annex 13 to the Chicago Convention, the investigation of accidents and serious incidents is to be conducted under the responsibility of the State where the accident or serious incident occurs, or the State of Registry when the location of the accident or serious incident cannot definitely be established as being in the territory of any State. A State may delegate the task of conducting the investigation to another State or request its assistance. Safety investigations in the Union should be conducted in a similar way.\n(7)\nThe lessons learned from the implementation of Council Directive 94/56/EC of 21 November 1994 establishing the fundamental principles governing the investigation of civil aviation accidents and incidents (5) should be used to improve the efficiency of the investigation and prevention of civil aviation accidents and incidents in the Union.\n(8)\nAccount should be taken of the changes in the institutional and regulatory framework governing civil aviation safety in the Union which have taken place since the adoption of Directive 94/56/EC and in particular the establishment of the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA). The Union dimension of safety recommendations should be also taken into account, given that aviation safety is increasingly regulated at Union level.\n(9)\nEASA carries out on behalf of the Member States the functions and tasks of the State of Design, Manufacture and Registry when related to design approval, as specified in the Chicago Convention and its Annexes. Therefore EASA, in accordance with Annex 13 to the Chicago Convention, should be invited to participate in a safety investigation in order to contribute, within the scope of its competence, to its efficiency and to ensure the safety of aircraft design, without affecting the independent status of the investigation. National civil aviation authorities should be similarly invited to participate in safety investigations.\n(10)\nGiven their safety responsibilities, persons designated by EASA, as well as by the national civil aviation authorities, should have access to information of relevance for assessing the effectiveness of safety requirements.\n(11)\nIn order to ensure better prevention of aviation accidents and incidents, EASA, in cooperation with the competent authorities of the Member States, should also participate in the exchange and analysis of information in the framework of the occurrence reporting systems in accordance with Directive 2003/42/EC, whilst avoiding any conflict of interest. This information should be adequately protected from unauthorised use or disclosure.\n(12)\nIt is recognised that the participation of EASA and of the competent authorities of the Member States in the exchange and analysis of information covered by Directive 2003/42/EC could benefit safety investigations through on-line access to relevant safety related information contained in the central repository of information on civil aviation occurrences.\n(13)\nThe scope of safety investigations should depend on the lessons which can be drawn from them for the improvement of aviation safety, especially taking into account the need for the cost-efficient utilisation of investigation resources in the Union.\n(14)\nThe safety investigation of accidents and incidents should be conducted by or under the control of an independent safety investigation authority in order to avoid any conflict of interest and any possible external interference in the determination of the causes of the occurrences being investigated.\n(15)\nThe safety investigation authorities play a core role in the safety investigation process. Their work is of the utmost importance in determining the causes of an accident or incident. It is therefore essential that they should be able to conduct their investigations entirely independently and also that they should possess the financial and human resources required to conduct effective and efficient investigations.\n(16)\nThe capacity of safety investigation authorities of the Member States should be strengthened and cooperation between them is necessary to improve the efficiency of the investigation and prevention of civil aviation accidents and incidents in the Union.\n(17)\nThe coordination role of safety investigation authorities should be recognised and reinforced in a European context, in order to generate real added value in aviation safety, by building upon the already existing cooperation between such authorities and the investigation resources available in the Member States which should be used in the most efficient manner. That recognition and reinforcement could be best achieved by the European Network of Civil Aviation Safety Investigation Authorities (the Network), with clearly defined role and tasks.\n(18)\nThe Network should pursue its coordination activities in a transparent and independent manner and be actively supported by the Union.\n(19)\nThe objectives of this Regulation may be better achieved through cooperation with third countries, which could be allowed to participate as observers, in the work of the Network.\n(20)\nAs it is essential to ensure clear rights for safety investigations, Member States should, in compliance with the legislation in force on the powers of the authorities responsible for judicial investigations and, where appropriate, in close collaboration with those authorities, ensure that safety investigation authorities are allowed to carry out their tasks in the best possible conditions in the interest of aviation safety. The safety investigation authorities should therefore be granted immediate and unrestricted access to the site of the accident and all the elements necessary to satisfy the requirements of a safety investigation should be made available to them, without compromising the objectives of a judicial investigation.\n(21)\nEfficient safety investigation is possible only if important pieces of evidence are duly preserved.\n(22)\nThe civil aviation safety system is based on feedback and lessons learned from accidents and incidents which require the strict application of rules on confidentiality in order to ensure the future availability of valuable sources of information. In this context sensitive safety information should be protected in an appropriate way.\n(23)\nAn accident raises a number of different public interests such as the prevention of future accidents and the proper administration of justice. Those interests go beyond the individual interests of the parties involved and beyond the specific event. The right balance among all interests is necessary to guarantee the overall public interest.\n(24)\nThe civil aviation system should equally promote a non-punitive environment facilitating the spontaneous reporting of occurrences and thereby advancing the principle of ‘just culture’.\n(25)\nThe information provided by a person in the framework of a safety investigation should not be used against that person, in full respect of constitutional principles and national law.\n(26)\nMember States should have the option to limit the cases in which a decision of disclosure regarding information obtained during a safety investigation could be taken, without affecting the smooth functioning of the judicial system.\n(27)\nIt is important for the prevention of accidents and incidents to communicate in the shortest time possible relevant information, including in particular reports and safety recommendations resulting from safety investigations.\n(28)\nThe safety recommendations resulting from an accident or serious incident investigation or other sources, such as safety studies, should always be considered by the competent authority and, as appropriate, acted upon to ensure adequate prevention of accidents and incidents in civil aviation.\n(29)\nProgress on research into both the real-time tracking of aircraft and the possibility of accessing flight-recorder information without the flight recorder being physically present should be encouraged to improve the tools available to investigators for determining the causes of accidents and to enhance capabilities for preventing recurrent incidents. Such developments would be an important step forward in aviation safety.\n(30)\nExperience has shown that reliable lists of persons on board an aircraft are sometimes difficult to obtain in a rapid manner but also that it is important to establish a deadline within which an airline can be required to produce such a list. In addition, the data contained in such lists should be protected from unauthorised use or disclosure. Similarly, the availability of information about the dangerous goods on board an aircraft involved in an accident is necessary to minimise the risks to safety investigators at the site of the occurrence.\n(31)\nFollowing an air accident it is not easy to identify rapidly the appropriate contact person to inform of a passenger’s presence on board. The possibility of designating a contact person should therefore be offered to passengers.\n(32)\nAssistance to the victims of air accidents and their relatives should be adequately specified.\n(33)\nThe manner in which an accident and its consequences are dealt with by Member States and airlines is crucially important. In this respect, Member States should have an emergency plan providing for, in particular, airport emergency services and assistance to the victims of civil aviation accidents and their relatives. Airlines should also have a plan for assistance to the victims of civil aviation accidents and their relatives. Particular attention should be given to the support to and the communication with victims and their relatives, and their associations.\n(34)\nThe rules on access to data, data processing and the protection of individuals laid down in relevant legal acts of the Union should be fully respected in the application of this Regulation.\n(35)\nPenalties should, in particular, allow for the sanctioning of any person who contrary to this Regulation releases information protected by this Regulation; obstructs the actions of a safety investigation authority by preventing the investigators from performing their duties or by refusing to provide useful recordings, material information and documents, hiding, altering or destroying them; or, having knowledge of any occurrence of an accident or serious incident, does not inform the relevant authorities thereof.\n(36)\nSince the objective of this Regulation, namely the establishment of common rules in the field of civil aviation safety investigation cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore, by reason of its Europe-wide scale and effects, be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve that objective.\n(37)\nDirective 94/56/EC should therefore be repealed.\n(38)\nThe Ministerial Statement on Gibraltar Airport, agreed in Cordoba on 18 September 2006 during the first Ministerial meeting of the Forum of Dialogue on Gibraltar, will replace the Joint Declaration on Gibraltar Airport made in London on 2 December 1987, and full compliance with it will be deemed to constitute compliance with the 1987 Declaration,\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nArticle 1\nSubject matter\n1.   This Regulation aims to improve aviation safety by ensuring a high level of efficiency, expediency, and quality of European civil aviation safety investigations, the sole objective of which is the prevention of future accidents and incidents without apportioning blame or liability, including through the establishment of a European Network of Civil Aviation Safety Investigation Authorities. It also provides for rules concerning the timely availability of information relating to all persons and dangerous goods on board an aircraft involved in an accident. It also aims to improve the assistance to the victims of air accidents and their relatives.\n2.   The application of this Regulation to the airport of Gibraltar is understood to be without prejudice to the respective legal positions of the Kingdom of Spain and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland with regard to the dispute over sovereignty over the territory in which the airport is situated.\nArticle 2\nDefinitions\nFor the purposes of this Regulation, the following definitions shall apply:\n(1)\n‘accident’ means an occurrence associated with the operation of an aircraft which, in the case of a manned aircraft, takes place between the time any person boards the aircraft with the intention of flight until such time as all such persons have disembarked, or in the case of an unmanned aircraft, takes place between the time the aircraft is ready to move with the purpose of flight until such time it comes to rest at the end of the flight and the primary propulsion system is shut down, in which:\n(a)\na person is fatally or seriously injured as a result of:\n—\nbeing in the aircraft, or,\n—\ndirect contact with any part of the aircraft, including parts which have become detached from the aircraft, or,\n—\ndirect exposure to jet blast,\nexcept when the injuries are from natural causes, self-inflicted or inflicted by other persons, or when the injuries are to stowaways hiding outside the areas normally available to the passengers and crew; or\n(b)\nthe aircraft sustains damage or structural failure which adversely affects the structural strength, performance or flight characteristics of the aircraft, and would normally require major repair or replacement of the affected component, except for engine failure or damage, when the damage is limited to a single engine, (including its cowlings or accessories), to propellers, wing tips, antennas, probes, vanes, tires, brakes, wheels, fairings, panels, landing gear doors, windscreens, the aircraft skin (such as small dents or puncture holes) or minor damages to main rotor blades, tail rotor blades, landing gear, and those resulting from hail or bird strike, (including holes in the radome); or\n(c)\nthe aircraft is missing or is completely inaccessible;\n(2)\n‘accredited representative’ means a person designated by a State, on the basis of his or her qualifications, for the purpose of participating in a safety investigation conducted by another State.

This Regulation shall apply to safety investigations into accidents and serious incidents:\n(a)\nwhich have occurred in the territories of the Member States to which the Treaties apply, in accordance with the international obligations of the Member States;\n(b)\ninvolving aircraft registered in a Member State or operated by an undertaking established in a Member State, which have occurred outside the territories of the Member States to which the Treaties apply, when such investigations are not conducted by another State;\n(c)\nin which a Member State is entitled, according to international standards and recommended practices, to appoint an accredited representative to participate as a State of Registry, State of the Operator, State of Design, State of Manufacture or State providing information, facilities or experts at the request of the State conducting the investigation;\n(d)\nin which a Member State having a special interest by virtue of fatalities or serious injuries to its citizens is permitted by the State conducting the investigation to appoint an expert.\n2.   This Regulation shall also apply to issues pertaining to the timely availability of information relating to all persons and dangerous goods on board an aircraft involved in an accident and assistance to the victims of air accidents and their relatives.\n3.   This Regulation shall not apply to safety investigations into accidents and serious incidents which involve aircraft engaged in military, customs, police or similar services, except when the Member State concerned so determines, in accordance with Article 5(4) and national legislation.\nArticle 4\nCivil Aviation Safety Investigation Authority\n1.   Each Member State shall ensure that safety investigations are conducted or supervised, without external interference, by a permanent national civil aviation safety investigation authority (safety investigation authority) capable of independently conducting a full safety investigation, either on its own or through agreements with other safety investigation authorities.\n2.   The safety investigation authority shall be functionally independent in particular of aviation authorities responsible for airworthiness, certification, flight operation, maintenance, licensing, air traffic control or aerodrome operation and, in general, of any other party or entity the interests or missions of which could conflict with the task entrusted to the safety investigation authority or influence its objectivity.\n3.   The safety investigation authority shall, in the conduct of the safety investigation, neither seek nor take instructions from anybody and shall have unrestricted authority over the conduct of the safety investigations.\n4.   The activities entrusted to the safety investigation authority may be extended to the gathering and analysis of aviation safety related information, in particular for accident prevention purposes, in so far as these activities do not affect its independence and entail no responsibility in regulatory, administrative or standards matters.\n5.   In order to inform the public of the general aviation safety level, a safety review shall be published annually at national level. In this analysis, the sources of confidential information shall not be revealed.\n6.   The safety investigation authority shall be given by the respective Member State the means required to carry out its responsibilities independently and shall be able to obtain sufficient resources to do so. In particular:\n(a)\nthe head of the safety investigation authority and/or, in the case of a multimodal authority, the head of its aviation branch shall have the experience and competence in civil aviation safety to fulfil his or her tasks in accordance with this Regulation and national law;\n(b)\nthe investigators shall be afforded status giving them the necessary guarantees of independence;\n(c)\nthe safety investigation authority shall comprise at least one available investigator able to perform the function of the investigator-in-charge in the event of a major air accident;\n(d)\nthe safety investigation authority shall be allocated a budget that enables it to carry out its functions;\n(e)\nthe safety investigation authority shall have at its disposal, either directly or by means of the cooperation referred to in Article 6, or through arrangements with other national authorities or entities, qualified personnel and adequate facilities, including offices and hangars to enable the storage and examination of the aircraft, its contents and its wreckage.\nArticle 5\nObligation to investigate\n1.   Every accident or serious incident involving aircraft other than specified in Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 216/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 February 2008 on common rules in the field of civil aviation and establishing a European Aviation Safety Agency (6) shall be the subject of a safety investigation in the Member State in the territory of which the accident or serious incident occurred.\n2.   When an aircraft, other than specified in Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 216/2008, registered in a Member State is involved in an accident or serious incident the location of which cannot be definitely established as being in the territory of any State, a safety investigation shall be conducted by the safety investigation authority of the Member State of registration.\n3.   The extent of safety investigations referred to in paragraphs 1, 2 and 4 and the procedure to be followed in conducting such safety investigations shall be determined by the safety investigation authority, taking into account the lessons it expects to draw from such investigations for the improvement of aviation safety, including for those aircraft with a maximum take-off mass less than or equal to 2 250 kg.\n4.   Safety investigation authorities may decide to investigate incidents other than those referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2, as well as accidents or serious incidents to other types of aircraft, in accordance with the national legislation of the Member States, when they expect to draw safety lessons from them.\n5.   Safety investigations referred to in paragraphs 1, 2 and 4 shall in no case be concerned with apportioning blame or liability. They shall be independent of, separate from and without prejudice to any judicial or administrative proceedings to apportion blame or liability.\nArticle 6\nCooperation between safety investigation authorities\n1.   A safety investigation authority from one Member State may request the assistance of safety investigation authorities from other Member States. When, following a request, a safety investigation authority agrees to provide assistance, such assistance shall, as far as possible, be provided free of charge.\n2.   A safety investigation authority may delegate the task of conducting an investigation into an accident or serious incident to another safety investigation authority subject to mutual agreement and shall facilitate the investigation process by that other authority.\nArticle 7\nEuropean Network of Civil Aviation Safety Investigation Authorities\n1.   Member States shall ensure that their safety investigation authorities establish between them a European Network of Civil Aviation Safety Investigation Authorities (the Network), composed of the heads of the safety investigation authorities in each of the Member States and/or, in the case of a multimodal authority, the head of its aviation branch, or their representatives, including a chairman chosen among these for a period of 3 years.\nIn close consultation with the members of the Network, the chairman shall draw up the annual work programme of the Network, which shall comply with the objectives and meet the responsibilities set out in paragraphs 2 and 3 respectively. The Commission shall transmit the work programme to the European Parliament and the Council. The chairman shall also draw up the agenda for the meetings of the Network.\n2.   The Network shall seek to further improve the quality of investigations conducted by safety investigation authorities and to strengthen their independence. In particular, it shall encourage high standards in investigation methods and investigator training.\n3.   In order to achieve the objectives set out in paragraph 2, the Network shall be responsible, in particular, for:\n(a)\npreparing suggestions to and advising Union institutions on all aspects of development and implementation of Union policies and rules relating to safety investigations and the prevention of accidents and incidents;\n(b)\npromoting the sharing of information useful for the improvement of aviation safety and actively promoting structured cooperation between safety investigation authorities, the Commission, EASA and national civil aviation authorities;\n(c)\ncoordinating and organising, where appropriate, ‘peer reviews’, relevant training activities and skills development programmes for investigators;\n(d)\npromoting best safety investigation practices with a view to developing a common Union safety investigation methodology and drawing up an inventory of such practices;\n(e)\nstrengthening the investigating capacities of the safety investigation authorities, in particular by developing and managing a framework for sharing resources;\n(f)\nproviding, at the request of the safety investigation authorities for the purpose of the application of Article 6, appropriate assistance, including, but not limited to, a list of investigators, equipment and capabilities available in other Member States for potential use by the authority conducting an investigation;\n(g)\nhaving access to information contained in the database referred to in Article 18, and analyse the safety recommendations therein with a view to identifying important safety recommendations of Union-wide relevance.\n4.   The Commission shall inform the European Parliament and the Council of the activities of the Network on a regular basis. The European Parliament shall also be informed whenever the Council or the Commission submits requests to the Network.\n5.   The members of the Network shall neither seek nor accept instructions from any body which could affect the independent status of safety investigations.\n6.   EASA shall, as appropriate, be invited as an observer to the meetings of the Network. The Network may also invite observers from safety investigation authorities of third countries and other relevant experts to attend its meetings.\n7.   The Commission shall be closely associated with the work of the Network and shall receive the necessary support from the Network on relevant aspects related to the development of the Union civil aviation accident investigation and prevention policy and regulation. The Commission shall provide the Network with the necessary support, including but not limited to assistance for the preparation and organisation of its meetings, as well as for the publication of an annual report covering the activities of the Network. The Commission shall transmit the annual report to the European Parliament and the Council.\nArticle 8\nParticipation of EASA and national civil aviation authorities in safety investigations\n1.   Safety investigation authorities shall, provided that the requirement of no conflict of interest is satisfied, invite EASA and national civil aviation authorities of the Member States concerned, within the scope of their respective competence, to appoint a representative to participate:\n(a)\nas an adviser to the investigator-in-charge in any safety investigation under Article 5(1) and (2), conducted in the territory of a Member State or in the location referred to in Article 5(2) under the control and at the discretion of the investigator-in-charge;\n(b)\nas an adviser appointed under this Regulation to assist accredited representative(s) of the Member States in any safety investigation conducted in a third country to which a safety investigation authority is invited to designate an accredited representative in accordance with international standards and recommended practices for aircraft accident and incident investigation, under the supervision of the accredited representative.\n2.   The participants referred to in paragraph 1 shall be entitled, in particular to:\n(a)\nvisit the scene of the accident and examine the wreckage;\n(b)\nsuggest areas of questioning and obtain witness information;\n(c)\nreceive copies of all pertinent documents and obtain relevant factual information;\n(d)\nparticipate in the read-outs of recorded media, except cockpit voice or image recorders;\n(e)\nparticipate in off-scene investigative activities such as component examinations, tests and simulations, technical briefings and investigation progress meetings, except when related to the determination of the causes or the formulation of safety recommendations.\n3.   EASA and the national civil aviation authorities shall support the investigation in which they participate by supplying the requested information, advisers and equipment to the safety investigation authority in charge.\nArticle 9\nObligation to notify accidents and serious incidents\n1.   Any person involved who has knowledge of the occurrence of an accident or serious incident shall notify without delay the competent safety investigation authority of the State of Occurrence thereof.\n2.   The safety investigation authority shall notify without delay the Commission, EASA, the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO), the Member States and third countries concerned in accordance with the international standards and recommended practices of the occurrence of all accidents and serious incidents of which it has been notified.\nArticle 10\nParticipation of the Member States in safety investigations\n1.   Upon receipt of the notification of the occurrence of an accident or serious incident from another Member State or third country, the Member States which are the State of Registry, the State of the Operator, the State of Design and the State of Manufacture shall, as soon as possible, inform the Member State or third country in the territory of which the accident or serious incident occurred whether they intend to appoint an accredited representative in accordance with the international standards and recommended practices. Where such an accredited representative is appointed, his or her name and contact details shall also be provided, as well as the expected date of arrival if the accredited representative intends to travel to the country which sent the notification.\n2.   Accredited representatives for the State of Design shall be appointed by the safety investigation authority of the Member State in the territory of which the principal place of business of the certificate holder for the type design of the aircraft or power plant is located.\nArticle 11\nStatus of the safety investigators\n1.   Upon his or her appointment by a safety investigation authority and notwithstanding any judicial investigation, the investigator-in-charge shall have the authority to take the necessary measures to satisfy the requirements of the safety investigation.\n2.   Notwithstanding any confidentiality obligations under the legal acts of the Union or national law, the investigator-in-charge shall in particular be entitled to:\n(a)\nhave immediate unrestricted and unhampered access to the site of the accident or incident as well as to the aircraft, its contents or its wreckage;\n(b)\nensure an immediate listing of evidence and controlled removal of debris, or components for examination or analysis purposes;\n(c)\nhave immediate access to and control over the flight recorders, their contents and any other relevant recordings;\n(d)\nrequest, and contribute to, a complete autopsy examination of the bodies of the fatally injured persons and to have immediate access to the results of such examinations or of tests made on samples taken;\n(e)\nrequest the medical examination of the people involved in the operation of the aircraft or request tests to be carried out on samples taken from such people and to have immediate access to the results of such examinations or tests;\n(f)\nto call and examine witnesses and to require them to furnish or produce information or evidence relevant to the safety investigation;\n(g)\nhave free access to any relevant information or records held by the owner, the certificate holder of the type design, the responsible maintenance organisation, the training organisation, the operator or the manufacturer of the aircraft, the authorities responsible for civil aviation, EASA and air navigation service providers or aerodrome operators.\n3.   The investigator-in-charge shall extend to his or her experts and advisers, as well as to the accredited representatives, their experts and advisers, the entitlements listed in paragraph 2, to the extent necessary to enable them to participate effectively in the safety investigation. Those entitlements are without prejudice to the rights of the investigators and experts designated by the authority in charge of the judicial investigation.\n4.   Any person participating in safety investigations shall perform his or her duties independently and shall neither seek, nor accept instructions from anybody, other than the investigator-in-charge or the accredited representative.\nArticle 12\nCoordination of investigations\n1.   When a judicial investigation is also instituted, the investigator-in-charge shall be notified thereof. In such a case, the investigator-in-charge shall ensure traceability and retain custody of flight recorders and any physical evidence. The judicial authority may appoint an official from that authority to accompany the flight recorders or physical evidence to the place of the read-out or treatment. Where examination or analysis of such physical evidence may modify, alter or destroy it, prior agreement from the judicial authorities will be required, without prejudice to national law. Where such agreement is not obtained according to the advance arrangements referred to in paragraph 3 within a reasonable time and not later than 2 weeks following the request, it shall not prevent the investigator-in-charge from conducting the examination or analysis. Where the judicial authority is entitled to seize any evidence, the investigator-in-charge shall have immediate and unlimited access to and use of such evidence.\n2.   Where, in the course of the safety investigation, it becomes known or it is suspected that an act of unlawful interference as provided for under national law, such as national law on accident investigations, was involved in the accident or serious incident, the investigator-in-charge shall immediately inform the competent authorities thereof. Subject to Article 14, the relevant information collected in the safety investigation shall be shared with those authorities immediately and upon request, relevant material may also be transferred to those authorities. The sharing of that information and that material shall be without prejudice to the right of the safety investigation authority to continue the safety investigation, in coordination with the authorities to which the control of the site may have been transferred.\n3.   Member States shall ensure that safety investigation authorities, on the one hand, and other authorities likely to be involved in the activities related to the safety investigation, such as the judicial, civil aviation, search and rescue authorities, on the other hand, cooperate with each other through advance arrangements.\nThose arrangements shall respect the independence of the safety investigation authority and allow the technical investigation to be conducted diligently and efficiently. Among others, the advance arrangements shall cover the following subjects:\n(a)\naccess to the site of the accident;\n(b)\npreservation of and access to evidence;\n(c)\ninitial and ongoing debriefings of the status of each process;\n(d)\nexchange of information;\n(e)\nappropriate use of safety information;\n(f)\nresolution of conflicts.\nMember States shall communicate to the Commission those arrangements, which shall transmit them to the chairman of the Network, the European Parliament and the Council for information.\nArticle 13\nPreservation of evidence\n1.   The Member State in the territory of which the accident or serious incident occurred shall be responsible for ensuring safe treatment of all evidence and for taking all reasonable measures to protect such evidence and for maintaining safe custody of the aircraft, its contents and its wreckage for such period as may be necessary for the purpose of a safety investigation. Protection of evidence shall include the preservation, by photographic or other means, of any evidence which might be removed, effaced, lost or destroyed. Safe custody shall include protection against further damage, access by unauthorised persons, pilfering and deterioration.\n2.   Pending the arrival of safety investigators, no person shall modify the state of the site of the accident, take any samples therefrom, undertake any movement of or sampling from the aircraft, its contents or its wreckage, move or remove it, except where such action may be required for safety reasons or to bring assistance to injured persons, or under the express permission of the authorities in control of the site and, when possible, in consultation with the safety investigation authority.\n3.   Any person involved shall take all necessary steps to preserve documents, material and recordings in relation to the event, in particular so as to prevent erasure of recordings of conversations and alarms after the flight.\nArticle 14\nProtection of sensitive safety information\n1.   The following records shall not be made available or used for purposes other than safety investigation:\n(a)\nall statements taken from persons by the safety investigation authority in the course of the safety investigation;\n(b)\nrecords revealing the identity of persons who have given evidence in the context of the safety investigation;\n(c)\ninformation collected by the safety investigation authority which is of a particularly sensitive and personal nature, including information concerning the health of individuals;\n(d)\nmaterial subsequently produced during the course of the investigation such as notes, drafts, opinions written by the investigators, opinions expressed in the analysis of information, including flight recorder information;\n(e)\ninformation and evidence provided by investigators from other Member States or third countries in accordance with the international standards and recommended practices, where so requested by their safety investigation authority;\n(f)\ndrafts of preliminary or final reports or interim statements;\n(g)\ncockpit voice and image recordings and their transcripts, as well as voice recordings inside air traffic control units, ensuring also that information not relevant to the safety investigation, particularly information with a bearing on personal privacy, shall be appropriately protected, without prejudice to paragraph 3.\n2.   The following records shall not be made available or used for purposes other than safety investigation, or other purposes aiming at the improvement of aviation safety:\n(a)\nall communications between persons having been involved in the operation of the aircraft;\n(b)\nwritten or electronic recordings and transcriptions of recordings from air traffic control units, including reports and results made for internal purposes;\n(c)\ncovering letters for the transmission of safety recommendations from the safety investigation authority to the addressee, where so requested by the safety investigation authority issuing the recommendation;\n(d)\noccurrence reports filed under Directive 2003/42/EC.\nFlight data recorder recordings shall not be made available or used for purposes other than those of the safety investigation, airworthiness or maintenance purposes, except when such records are de-identified or disclosed under secure procedures.\n3.   Notwithstanding paragraphs 1 and 2, the administration of justice or the authority competent to decide on the disclosure of records according to national law may decide that the benefits of the disclosure of the records referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 for any other purposes permitted by law outweigh the adverse domestic and international impact that such action may have on that or any future safety investigation. Member States may decide to limit the cases in which such a decision of disclosure may be taken, while respecting the legal acts of the Union.\nThe communication of records referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 to another Member State for purposes other than safety investigation and, in addition as regards paragraph 2, for purposes other than those aiming at the improvement of aviation safety may be granted insofar as the national law of the communicating Member State permits. Processing or disclosure of records received through such communication by the authorities of the receiving Member State shall be permitted solely after prior consultation of the communicating Member State and subject to the national law of the receiving Member State.\n4.   Only the data strictly necessary for the purposes referred to in paragraph 3 may be disclosed.\nArticle 15\nCommunication of information\n1.   The staff of the safety investigation authority in charge, or any other person called upon to participate in or contribute to the safety investigation shall be bound by applicable rules of professional secrecy, including as regards the anonymity of those involved in an accident or incident, under the applicable legislation.\n2.   Without prejudice to the obligations set out in Articles 16 and 17, the safety investigation authority in charge shall communicate the information which it deems relevant to the prevention of an accident or serious incident, to persons responsible for aircraft or aircraft equipment manufacture or maintenance, and to individuals or legal entities responsible for operating aircraft or for the training of personnel.\n3.

Safety investigation authorities shall similarly record in the central repository all safety recommendations received from third countries.\nArticle 19\nOccurrence reporting\n1.   EASA and the competent authorities of the Member States shall in collaboration participate regularly in the exchange and analysis of information covered by Directive 2003/42/EC. This shall cover online access by designated persons to information contained in the central repository established under Regulation (EC) No 1321/2007, including to information which directly identifies the aircraft subject to an occurrence report such as, where available, its serial and registration numbers. Such access shall not cover information that identifies the operator subject to that occurrence report.\n2.   EASA and the authorities of the Member States referred to in paragraph 1 shall ensure the confidentiality of such information in accordance with applicable legislation, and shall limit its use to what is strictly necessary to discharge their safety related obligations. In this respect, that information shall be used only for analysis of safety trends which can form the basis for anonymous safety recommendations or airworthiness directives without apportioning blame or liability.\nArticle 20\nInformation on persons and dangerous goods on board\n1.   Union airlines operating flights arriving to or departing from, and third country airlines operating flights departing from an airport located in the territories of the Member States to which the Treaties apply, shall implement procedures which allow for the production:\n(a)\nas soon as possible, and at the latest within two hours of the notification of the occurrence of an accident to the aircraft, of a validated list, based on the best available information, of all the persons on board; and\n(b)\nimmediately after the notification of the occurrence of an accident to the aircraft, of the list of the dangerous goods on board.\n2.   The lists referred to in paragraph 1 shall be made available to the safety investigation authority in charge, the authority designated by each Member State to liaise with the relatives of the persons on board and, where necessary, to medical units which may need the information for the treatment of victims.\n3.   In order to allow passengers’ relatives to obtain information quickly concerning the presence of their relatives on board an aircraft involved in an accident, airlines shall offer travellers the opportunity to give the name and contact details of a person to be contacted in the event of an accident. This information may be used by the airlines only in the event of an accident and shall not be communicated to third parties or used for commercial purposes.\n4.

Member States must provide their respective SIAs with the means and finances — including a budget — to carry out their responsibilities independently and have access to sufficient resources.\nIn particular, the SIA must have at its disposal qualified personnel and adequate facilities including offices and hangars to store and examine the aircraft, its contents and the wreckage.\nObligation to investigate\nEvery accident or serious incident to which Regulation (EU) 2018/1139 (see summary) applies shall be the subject of a safety investigation in the Member State in which the accident or serious incident occurred.\nWhere an aircraft to which Regulation (EU) 2018/1139 applies and that is registered in a Member State is involved in an accident or a serious incident the location of which cannot be definitely established as being in the territory of any state, a safety investigation shall be conducted by the safety investigation authority of the Member State of registration.\nSIAs may decide to investigate incidents other than the ones described in the above paragraphs, along with accidents and serious incidents to other types of aircraft, in accordance with the national legislation of the Member States, when they expect to draw safety lessons from them.\nWhere no person has been fatally or seriously injured, the responsible SIA may decide, taking into account the expected lessons to be drawn for the improvement of aviation safety, not to initiate a safety investigation on a regulated number of cases that are included in Article 135 of Regulation (EU) 2018/1139 replacing Article 5 of Regulation (EU) No 996/2010.\nIn no event may safety investigations be concerned with apportioning blame or liability. They must be independent of, separate from and without prejudice to any judicial or administrative proceedings to apportion blame or liability.\nCooperation between safety investigation authorities\nThe regulation allows for cooperation between SIAs and for the possibility of delegating tasks.\nEuropean network of civil aviation safety investigation authorities\nMember States must ensure that their SIAs establish a European network of civil aviation safety investigation authorities (Encasia) among themselves to:\nfurther improve the quality of the investigations conducted by SIAs and strengthen their independence;\nencourage high standards in investigation methods and investigator training.\nInvestigation\nNotwithstanding any judicial investigation, the investigator-in-charge has the authority to take the necessary measures to satisfy the requirements of the safety investigation. Among other things, the investigator is entitled to: have immediate unrestricted and unhampered access to the accident or incident site as well as to the aircraft, its contents or wreckage;require that evidence be collected and debris or components removed for analysis;request autopsies and the medical examination of the people involved in the operation of the aircraft;call witnesses and require them to give evidence.\nThe Member State in the territory of which an accident or serious incident occurred is responsible for ensuring safe treatment and protection of all evidence.\nCoordination with other authorities\nMember States must ensure that SIAs and other authorities (e.g. judicial, civil aviation, search and rescue involved in the safety investigation) cooperate with each other via advanced arrangements, providing that those arrangements do not compromise SIAs’ independence.\nMember States must communicate these arrangements to the European Commission, which has to transmit them to the Encasia Chairman, the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union.\nConfidentiality and appropriate use of information\nThe regulation establishes a list of records that must not be made available or used for purposes other than safety investigation (e.g. flight data recorder data, draft reports, identity of persons who have given evidence, notes of investigators).\nRules in the regulation on the confidential use of information, including information such as serial and registration numbers, which directly identify aircraft subject to an occurrence report, are amended by Regulation (EU) No 376/2014. The regulation also recognises that the administration of justice or the competent authority may decide to disclose records according to national law. Member States may decide to limit the cases in which such a decision of disclosure may be taken, while respecting EU legal acts.\nAssistance for victims and relatives\nMember States must each put in place a national civil aviation accident emergency plan with provisions for assistance to victims of accidents and their relatives. They must also ensure that airlines have their own plan to help victims and their relatives, taking particular account of psychological support.\nMember States should also encourage non-EU airlines operating within the EU to adopt a similar plan.\nEach Member State concerned by an accident must appoint a person as a point of contact and information for victims and relatives.\nAirlines must offer travelers the opportunity to provide the contact details of a person who is to be notified in the event of an accident. The name of a person on board must not be made public before the relatives of that person have been informed.\nReport and safety recommendations\nDuring the investigation, the safety authority will recommend any prompt action it considers necessary for the improvement of aviation safety to: persons responsible for aircraft or aircraft equipment manufacture;persons responsible for aircraft or aircraft equipment maintenance;aircraft operators; andpersons responsible for personnel training.\nThe investigation concludes with a report containing safety recommendations after final consultations with the authorities concerned, including the European Union Aviation Safety Agency. The final report will be published in the shortest possible time, if possible within 12 months of the date of accident or incident. The authority will also record responses to its recommendations.\nEach party receiving a safety recommendation, including the safety authorities at national and EU level, must also monitor the progress of the action taken in response to the safety recommendations received.\nThere is legitimate interest in giving public access to all safety recommendations and their responses because of the overarching purpose of Regulation (EU) No 996/2010 and of Regulation (EU) No 376/2014 to reduce the number of accidents and to promote the dissemination of findings of safety-related incidents. As such, Commission Implementing Decision (EU) 2019/1128 regulates the access rights to safety recommendations and responses stored in the European central repository.\nFROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?\n              \nIt has applied since 2 December 2010.\nBACKGROUND\n              \nFor more information, see:\nAccident investigation (European Commission).\nKEY TERMS\n              \nAccident. An occurrence associated with the operation of an aircraft where any person suffers death or serious injury, the aircraft receives substantial damage, or the aircraft is missing or completely inaccessible. In the case of a manned aircraft, the occurrence takes place between the time any person boards the aircraft with the intention of traveling and all such persons have disembarked. In the case of an unmanned aircraft, the occurrence takes place between the time the aircraft is ready to move with the purpose of flight until such time it comes to rest at the end of the flight and the primary propulsion system is shut down.\nIncident. An occurrence, other than an accident, associated with the operation of an aircraft that affects or could affect the safety of operations.\nMAIN DOCUMENT\n            \nRegulation (EU) No 996/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 October 2010 on the investigation and prevention of accidents and incidents in civil aviation and repealing Directive 94/56/EC (OJ L 295, 12.11.2010, pp. 35–50).\nSuccessive amendments to Regulation (EU) No 996/2010 have been incorporated in the original text.
