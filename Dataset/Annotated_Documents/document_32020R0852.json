{"celex_id": "32020R0852", "reference": "22.6.2020\nEN\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\nL 198/13\nREGULATION (EU) 2020/852 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL\nof 18 June 2020\non the establishment of a framework to facilitate sustainable investment, and amending Regulation (EU) 2019/2088\n(Text with EEA relevance)\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 114 thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee (1),\nActing in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure (2),\nWhereas:\n(1)\nArticle 3(3) of the Treaty on European Union aims to establish an internal market that works for the sustainable development of Europe, based, among other things, on balanced economic growth and a high level of protection and the improvement of the quality of the environment.\n(2)\nOn 25 September 2015, the UN General Assembly adopted a new global sustainable development framework: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (the ‘2030 Agenda’). The 2030 Agenda has at its core the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and covers the three dimensions of sustainability: economic, social and environmental. The Commission communication of 22 November 2016 on the next steps for a sustainable European future links the SDGs to the Union policy framework to ensure that all Union actions and policy initiatives, both within the Union and globally, take the SDGs on board at the outset. In its conclusions of 20 June 2017 the Council confirmed the commitment of the Union and its Member States to the implementation of the 2030 Agenda in a full, coherent, comprehensive, integrated and effective manner, in close cooperation with partners and other stakeholders. On 11 December 2019, the Commission published its communication on ‘The European Green Deal’.\n(3)\nThe Paris Agreement adopted under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (the ‘Paris Agreement’) was approved by the Union on 5 October 2016 (3). Article 2(1)(c) of the Paris Agreement aims to strengthen the response to climate change by making finance flows consistent with a pathway towards low greenhouse gas emissions and climate-resilient development, among other means. In that context, on 12 December 2019, the European Council adopted conclusions on climate change. In light thereof, this Regulation represents a key step towards the objective of achieving a climate-neutral Union by 2050.\n(4)\nSustainability and the transition to a safe, climate-neutral, climate-resilient, more resource-efficient and circular economy are crucial to ensuring the long-term competitiveness of the Union economy. Sustainability has long been central to the Union project, and the Treaty on European Union and the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) reflect its social and environmental dimensions.\n(5)\nIn December 2016, the Commission mandated a High-Level Expert Group to develop an overarching and comprehensive Union strategy on sustainable finance. The report of the High-Level Expert Group published on 31 January 2018 calls for the creation of a technically robust classification system at Union level to establish clarity on which activities qualify as ‘green’ or ‘sustainable’, starting with climate change mitigation.\n(6)\nIn its communication of 8 March 2018, the Commission published its action plan on financing sustainable growth, launching an ambitious and comprehensive strategy on sustainable finance. One of the objectives set out in that action plan is to reorient capital flows towards sustainable investment in order to achieve sustainable and inclusive growth. The establishment of a unified classification system for sustainable activities is the most important and urgent action envisaged by the action plan. The action plan recognises that the shift of capital flows towards more sustainable activities has to be underpinned by a shared, holistic understanding of the environmental sustainability of activities and investments. As a first step, clear guidance on activities that qualify as contributing to environmental objectives would help inform investors about the investments that fund environmentally sustainable economic activities. Further guidance on activities that contribute to other sustainability objectives, including social objectives, might be developed at a later stage.\n(7)\nGiven the systemic nature of global environmental challenges, there is a need for a systemic and forward-looking approach to environmental sustainability that addresses growing negative trends, such as climate change, the loss of biodiversity, the global overconsumption of resources, food scarcity, ozone depletion, ocean acidification, the deterioration of the fresh water system, and land system change as well as the appearance of new threats, such as hazardous chemicals and their combined effects.\n(8)\nDecision No 1386/2013/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council (4) calls for an increase in private sector funding for environmental and climate-related expenditure, in particular by putting in place incentives and methodologies that stimulate companies to measure the environmental costs of their business and profits derived from using environmental services.\n(9)\nAchieving the SDGs in the Union requires the channelling of capital flows towards sustainable investments. It is important to fully exploit the potential of the internal market to achieve those goals. In that context, it is crucial to remove obstacles to the efficient movement of capital into sustainable investments in the internal market and to prevent new obstacles from emerging.\n(10)\nIn view of the scale of the challenge and the costs associated with inaction or delayed action, the financial system should be gradually adapted in order to support the sustainable functioning of the economy. To that end, sustainable finance needs to become mainstream and consideration needs to be given to the sustainability impact of financial products and services.\n(11)\nMaking available financial products which pursue environmentally sustainable objectives is an effective way of channelling private investments into sustainable activities. Requirements for marketing financial products or corporate bonds as environmentally sustainable investments, including requirements set by Member States and the Union to allow financial market participants and issuers to use national labels, aim to enhance investor confidence and awareness of the environmental impact of those financial products or corporate bonds, to create visibility and to address concerns about ‘greenwashing’. In the context of this Regulation, greenwashing refers to the practice of gaining an unfair competitive advantage by marketing a financial product as environmentally friendly, when in fact basic environmental standards have not been met. Currently, a few Member States have labelling schemes in place. Those existing schemes build on different classification systems for environmentally sustainable economic activities. Given the political commitments under the Paris Agreement and at Union level, it is likely that more and more Member States will establish labelling schemes or impose other requirements on financial market participants or issuers in respect of promoting financial products or corporate bonds as environmentally sustainable. In such cases, Member States would use their own national classification systems for the purposes of determining which investments qualify as sustainable. If those national labelling schemes or requirements use different criteria to determine which economic activities qualify as environmentally sustainable, investors would be discouraged from investing across borders due to difficulties in comparing different investment opportunities. In addition, economic operators that wish to attract investment from across the Union would have to meet different criteria in different Member States in order for their activities to qualify as environmentally sustainable. The absence of uniform criteria would therefore increase costs and significantly disincentivise economic operators from accessing cross-border capital markets for the purposes of sustainable investment.\n(12)\nThe criteria for determining whether an economic activity qualifies as environmentally sustainable should be harmonised at Union level in order to remove barriers to the functioning of the internal market with regard to raising funds for sustainability projects, and to prevent the future emergence of barriers to such projects. With such harmonisation, economic operators would find it easier to raise funding across borders for their environmentally sustainable activities, as their economic activities could be compared against uniform criteria in order to be selected as underlying assets for environmentally sustainable investments. Such harmonisation would therefore facilitate cross-border sustainable investment in the Union.\n(13)\nIf financial market participants do not provide any explanation to investors about how the activities in which they invest contribute to environmental objectives, or if financial market participants use different concepts in their explanations of what an environmentally sustainable economic activity is, investors will find it disproportionately burdensome to check and compare different financial products. It has been found that such practices discourage investors from investing in environmentally sustainable financial products. Furthermore, a lack of investor confidence has a major detrimental impact on the market for sustainable investment. It has also been shown that national rules and market-based initiatives taken to tackle that issue within national borders lead to the fragmentation of the internal market. If financial market participants disclose how and to what extent the financial products that are made available as environmentally sustainable invest in activities that meet the criteria for environmentally sustainable economic activities under this Regulation, and if financial market participants use common criteria for such disclosures across the Union, that would help investors compare investment opportunities across borders and would incentivise investee companies to make their business models more environmentally sustainable. Additionally, investors would invest in environmentally sustainable financial products across the Union with higher confidence, thereby improving the functioning of the internal market.\n(14)\nTo address existing obstacles to the functioning of the internal market and to prevent the emergence of such obstacles in the future, Member States and the Union should be required to use a common concept of environmentally sustainable investment when introducing requirements at national and Union level regarding financial market participants or issuers for the purpose of labelling financial products or corporate bonds that are marketed as environmentally sustainable. To avoid market fragmentation and harm to the interests of consumers and investors as a result of diverging notions of environmentally sustainable economic activities, national requirements that financial market participants or issuers have to comply with in order to market financial products or corporate bonds as environmentally sustainable should build on the uniform criteria for environmentally sustainable economic activities. Such financial market participants and issuers include financial market participants that make available environmentally sustainable financial products and non-financial companies that issue environmentally sustainable corporate bonds.\n(15)\nEstablishing criteria for environmentally sustainable economic activities may encourage economic operators not covered by this Regulation, on a voluntary basis, to publish and disclose information on their websites regarding the environmentally sustainable economic activities they carry out. That information will not only help financial market participants and other relevant actors on the financial markets to easily identify which economic operators carry out environmentally sustainable economic activities, but will also make it easier for those economic operators to raise funding for their environmentally sustainable activities.\n(16)\nA classification of environmentally sustainable economic activities at Union level should enable the development of future Union policies in support of sustainable finance, including Union-wide standards for environmentally sustainable financial products and the eventual establishment of labels that formally recognise compliance with those standards across the Union. It could also serve as the basis for other economic and regulatory measures. Uniform legal requirements for determining the degree of environmental sustainability of investments, based on uniform criteria for environmentally sustainable economic activities, are necessary as a reference for future Union law that aims to facilitate the shift of investment towards environmentally sustainable economic activities.\n(17)\nIn the context of achieving the SDGs in the Union, policy choices such as the creation of a European Fund for Strategic Investment, have been effective in contributing to the channelling of private investment towards sustainable investments alongside public spending. Regulation (EU) 2015/1017 of the European Parliament and of the Council (5) specifies a 40 % climate investment target for infrastructure and innovation projects under the European Fund for Strategic Investment. Common criteria for determining whether economic activities qualify as sustainable, including their impact on the environment, could underpin future similar initiatives of the Union to mobilise investment that pursues climate-related or other environmental objectives.\n(18)\nTo avoid harming investor interests, fund managers and institutional investors that make available financial products should disclose how and to what extent they use the criteria for environmentally sustainable economic activities to determine the environmental sustainability of their investments. The information disclosed should enable investors to understand the proportion of the investments underlying the financial product in environmentally sustainable economic activities as a percentage of all investments underlying that financial product, thereby enabling investors to understand the degree of environmental sustainability of the investment. Where the investments underlying the financial product are in economic activities that contribute to an environmental objective, the information to be disclosed should specify the environmental objective or objectives to which the investment underlying the financial product contributes, as well as how and to what extent the investments underlying the financial product fund environmentally sustainable economic activities, and should include details on the respective proportions of enabling and transitional activities. The Commission should specify the information that needs to be disclosed in that regard. That information should enable national competent authorities to easily verify compliance with that disclosure obligation, and to enforce such compliance in accordance with applicable national law. Where financial market participants do not take the criteria for environmentally sustainable investments into account, they should provide a statement to that end. To avoid the circumvention of the disclosure obligation, that obligation should also apply where financial products are marketed as promoting environmental characteristics, including financial products that have as their objective environmental protection in a broad sense.\n(19)\nThe disclosure obligations laid down in this Regulation supplement the rules on sustainability-related disclosures laid down in Regulation (EU) 2019/2088 of the European Parliament and of the Council (6). To enhance transparency and to provide an objective point of comparison by financial market participants to end investors on the proportion of investments that fund environmentally sustainable economic activities, this Regulation supplements the rules on transparency in pre-contractual disclosures and in periodic reports laid down in Regulation (EU) 2019/2088. The definition of ‘sustainable investment’ in Regulation (EU) 2019/2088 includes investments in economic activities that contribute to an environmental objective which, amongst others, should include investments into ‘environmentally sustainable economic activities’ within the meaning of this Regulation. Moreover, Regulation (EU) 2019/2088 only considers an investment to be a sustainable investment if it does not significantly harm any environmental or social objective as set out in that Regulation.\n(20)\nTo ensure the reliability, consistency and comparability of sustainability-related disclosures in the financial services sector, disclosures pursuant to this Regulation should use existing sustainability indicators to the extent feasible as proposed by the European Parliament in its resolution of 29 May 2018 on sustainable finance (7). In that context, the technical screening criteria should, to the extent feasible, be based on the sustainability indicators referred to in Regulation (EU) 2019/2088.\n(21)\nRegarding economic activities carried out by undertakings that are not required to disclose information under this Regulation, there could be exceptional cases where financial market participants cannot reasonably obtain the relevant information to reliably determine the alignment with the technical screening criteria established pursuant to this Regulation. In such exceptional cases and only for those economic activities for which complete, reliable and timely information could not be obtained, financial market participants should be allowed to make complementary assessments and estimates on the basis of information from other sources. Such assessments and estimates should only compensate for limited and specific parts of the desired data elements, and produce a prudent outcome. In order to ensure that the disclosure to investors is clear and not misleading, financial market participants should clearly explain the basis for their conclusions as well as the reasons for having to make such complementary assessments and estimates for the purposes of disclosure to end investors.\n(22)\nIn its communication of 20 June 2019 on ‘Guidelines on non-financial reporting: Supplement on reporting climate-related information’, the Commission recommends that certain large companies report on certain climate-related key performance indicators (KPIs) that are based on the framework established by this Regulation. In particular, information on the proportion of the turnover, capital expenditure (CapEx) or operating expenditure (OpEx) of such large non-financial companies that is associated with environmentally sustainable economic activities, as well as KPIs that are tailored for large financial companies, is useful to investors who are interested in companies whose products and services contribute substantially to any one of the environmental objectives set out in this Regulation. It is therefore appropriate to require the annual publication of such KPIs by such large companies and to further define that requirement in delegated acts, in particular with regard to large financial companies. While it would be disproportionately burdensome to extend such a requirement to smaller companies, smaller companies may voluntarily decide to publish such information.\n(23)\nFor the purpose of determining the environmental sustainability of a given economic activity, an exhaustive list of environmental objectives should be laid down. The six environmental objectives that this Regulation should cover are: climate change mitigation; climate change adaptation; the sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources; the transition to a circular economy; pollution prevention and control; and the protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems.\n(24)\nAn economic activity that pursues the environmental objective of climate change mitigation should contribute substantially to the stabilisation of greenhouse gas emissions by avoiding or reducing them or by enhancing greenhouse gas removals. The economic activity should be consistent with the long-term temperature goal of the Paris Agreement. That environmental objective should be interpreted in accordance with relevant Union law, including Directive 2009/31/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (8).\n(25)\nAn economic activity that pursues the environmental objective of climate change adaptation should contribute substantially to reducing or preventing the adverse impact of the current or expected future climate, or the risks of such adverse impact, whether on that activity itself or on people, nature or assets. That environmental objective should be interpreted in accordance with relevant Union law and the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015–2030.\n(26)\nThe environmental objective of the sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources should be interpreted in accordance with relevant Union law, including Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council (9) and Directives 2000/60/EC (10), 2006/7/EC (11), 2006/118/EC (12), 2008/56/EC (13) and 2008/105/EC (14) of the European Parliament and of the Council, Council Directives 91/271/EEC (15), 91/676/EEC (16) and 98/83/EC (17) and Commission Decision (EU) 2017/848 (18), and with the communications of the Commission of 18 July 2007 on ‘Addressing the challenge of water scarcity and droughts in the European Union’, of 14 November 2012 on ‘A Blueprint to Safeguard Europe’s Water Resources’ and of 11 March 2019 on ‘European Union Strategic Approach to Pharmaceuticals in the Environment’.\n(27)\nThe environmental objective of the transition to a circular economy should be interpreted in accordance with relevant Union law in the areas of the circular economy, waste and chemicals, including Regulations (EC) No 1013/2006 (19), (EC) No 1907/2006 (20) and (EU) 2019/1021 (21) of the European Parliament and of the Council and Directives 94/62/EC (22), 2000/53/EC (23), 2006/66/EC (24), 2008/98/EC (25), 2010/75/EU (26), 2011/65/EU (27), 2012/19/EU (28), (EU) 2019/883 (29) and (EU) 2019/904 (30) of the European Parliament and of the Council, Council Directive 1999/31/EC (31), Commission Regulation (EU) No 1357/2014 (32) and Commission Decisions 2000/532/EC (33) and 2014/955/EU (34), and with the communications of the Commission of 2 December 2015 on ‘Closing the loop – An EU action plan for the Circular Economy’ and of 16 January 2018 on ‘A European Strategy for Plastics in a Circular Economy’.\n(28)\nAn economic activity can contribute substantially to the environmental objective of transitioning to a circular economy in several ways. It can, for example, increase the durability, reparability, upgradability and reusability of products, or can reduce the use of resources through the design and choice of materials, facilitating repurposing, disassembly and deconstruction in the buildings and construction sector, in particular to reduce the use of building materials and promote the reuse of building materials. It can also contribute substantially to the environmental objective of transitioning to a circular economy by developing ‘product-as-a-service’ business models and circular value chains, with the aim of keeping products, components and materials at their highest utility and value for as long as possible. Any reduction in the content of hazardous substances in materials and products throughout the life cycle, including by replacing them with safer alternatives, should, as a minimum, be in accordance with Union law. An economic activity can also contribute substantially to the environmental objective of transitioning to a circular economy by reducing food waste in the production, processing, manufacturing or distribution of food.\n(29)\nThe environmental objective of pollution prevention and control should be interpreted in accordance with relevant Union law, including Directives 2000/60/EC, 2004/35/EC (35), 2004/107/EC (36), 2006/118/EC, 2008/50/EC (37), 2008/105/EC, 2010/75/EU, (EU) 2016/802 (38) and (EU) 2016/2284 (39) of the European Parliament and of the Council.\n(30)\nThe environmental objective of the protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems should be interpreted in accordance with relevant Union law, including Regulations (EU) No 995/2010 (40), (EU) No 511/2014 (41) and (EU) No 1143/2014 (42) of the European Parliament and of the Council, Directive 2009/147/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (43), Council Regulation (EC) No 338/97 (44), Council Directives 91/676/EEC and 92/43/EEC (45), and with the communications of the Commission of 21 May 2003 on ‘Forest Law Enforcement, Governance and Trade (FLEGT)’, of 3 May 2011 on ‘Our life insurance, our natural capital: an EU biodiversity strategy to 2020’, of 6 May 2013 on ‘Green Infrastructure (GI) – Enhancing Europe’s natural Capital’, of 26 February 2016 on ‘EU Action Plan against Wildlife Trafficking’ and of 23 July 2019 on ‘Stepping up EU Action to Protect and Restore the World’s Forests’.\n(31)\nAn economic activity can contribute substantially to the environmental objective of the protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems, in several ways, including by protecting, conserving or restoring biodiversity and ecosystems, and thereby enhancing ecosystem services. Such services are grouped into four categories, namely provisioning services, such as the provisioning of food and water; regulating services, such as the control of climate and disease; supporting services, such as nutrient cycles and oxygen production; and cultural services, such as providing spiritual and recreational benefits.\n(32)\nFor the purposes of this Regulation, the term ‘sustainable forest management’ should be construed by taking into account practices and uses of forests and forest land that contribute to enhancing biodiversity or to halting or preventing the degradation of ecosystems, deforestation and habitat loss, by taking into account the stewardship and use of forests and forest land in a way, and at a rate, that maintains their biodiversity, productivity, regeneration capacity, vitality and their potential to fulfil, now and in the future, relevant ecological, economic and social functions, at local, national, and global levels, and that does not cause damage to other ecosystems, as set out in Resolution H1 of the Second Ministerial Conference on the Protection of Forests in Europe of 16–17 June 1993 in Helsinki on General Guidelines for the Sustainable Management of Forests in Europe as well as by taking into account Regulations (EU) No 995/2010 and (EU) 2018/841 (46) of the European Parliament and of the Council and Directive (EU) 2018/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council (47) and the communication of the Commission of 20 September 2013 on ‘A new EU Forest Strategy: for forests and the forest-based sector’.\n(33)\nFor the purposes of this Regulation, the term ‘energy efficiency’ is used in a broad sense and should be construed by taking into account relevant Union law, including Regulation (EU) 2017/1369 of the European Parliament and of the Council (48) and Directives 2012/27/EU (49) and (EU) 2018/844 (50) of the European Parliament and of the Council, as well as the implementing measures adopted pursuant to Directive 2009/125/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (51).\n(34)\nFor each environmental objective, uniform criteria for determining whether economic activities contribute substantially to that objective should be laid down. One element of the uniform criteria should be to avoid significant harm to any of the environmental objectives set out in this Regulation. This is in order to avoid that investments qualify as environmentally sustainable in cases where the economic activities benefitting from those investments cause harm to the environment to an extent that outweighs their contribution to an environmental objective. Such criteria should take into account the life cycle of the products and services provided by that economic activity in addition to the environmental impact of the economic activity itself, including taking into account evidence from existing life-cycle assessments, in particular by considering their production, use and end of life.\n(35)\nRecalling the joint commitment of the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission to pursuing the principles enshrined in the European Pillar of Social Rights in support of sustainable and inclusive growth, and recognising the relevance of international minimum human and labour rights and standards, compliance with minimum safeguards should be a condition for economic activities to qualify as environmentally sustainable. For that reason, economic activities should only qualify as environmentally sustainable where they are carried out in alignment with the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, including the declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work of the International Labour Organisation (ILO), the eight fundamental conventions of the ILO and the International Bill of Human Rights. The fundamental conventions of the ILO define human and labour rights that undertakings should respect. Several of those international standards are enshrined the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, in particular the prohibition of slavery and forced labour and the principle of non-discrimination. Those minimum safeguards are without prejudice to the application of more stringent requirements related to the environment, health, safety and social sustainability set out in Union law, where applicable. When complying with those minimum safeguards, undertakings should adhere to the principle of ‘do no significant harm’ referred to in Regulation (EU) 2019/2088, and take into account the regulatory technical standards adopted pursuant to that Regulation that further specify that principle.\n(36)\nIn order to ensure consistency between this Regulation and Regulation (EU) 2019/2088, this Regulation should amend Regulation (EU) 2019/2088 to mandate the European Supervisory Authorities established by Regulations (EU) No 1093/2010 (52), (EU) No 1094/2010 (53) and (EU) No 1095/2010 (54) of the European Parliament and of the Council (collectively, the ‘ESAs’) to jointly develop regulatory technical standards to further specify the details of the content and presentation of the information in relation to the principle of ‘do no significant harm’. Those regulatory technical standards should be consistent with the content, methodologies, and presentation of the sustainability indicators in relation to adverse impacts as referred to in Regulation (EU) 2019/2088. They should also be consistent with the principles enshrined in the European Pillar of Social Rights, the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises, the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, including the ILO Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work, the eight fundamental conventions of the ILO and the International Bill of Human Rights.\n(37)\nRegulation (EU) 2019/2088 should further be amended to mandate the ESAs to develop, through the Joint Committee, draft regulatory technical standards to supplement the rules on transparency of the promotion of environmental characteristics and of environmentally sustainable investments in pre-contractual disclosures and in periodic reports.\n(38)\nGiven the specific technical details needed to assess the environmental impact of an economic activity and the fast-changing nature of both science and technology, the criteria for environmentally sustainable economic activities should be adapted regularly to reflect such changes. For the criteria to be up to date, based on scientific evidence and input from experts as well as relevant stakeholders, the conditions for ‘substantial contribution’ and ‘significant harm’ should be specified with more granularity for different economic activities and should be updated regularly. For that purpose, granular and calibrated technical screening criteria for the different economic activities should be established by the Commission on the basis of technical input from a multi-stakeholder platform on sustainable finance.\n(39)\nSome economic activities have a negative impact on the environment, and reducing such negative impact can make a substantial contribution to one or more environmental objectives. For those economic activities, it is appropriate to establish technical screening criteria that require a substantial improvement in environmental performance compared with, inter alia, the industry average, but at the same time avoid environmentally harmful lock-in effects, including carbon-intensive lock-in effects, during the economic lifetime of the funded economic activity. Those criteria should also consider the long-term impact of a specific economic activity.\n(40)\nAn economic activity should not qualify as environmentally sustainable if it causes more harm to the environment than the benefits it brings. The technical screening criteria should identify the minimum requirements necessary to avoid significant harm to other objectives, including by building on any minimum requirements laid down pursuant to Union law. When establishing and updating the technical screening criteria, the Commission should ensure that those criteria are based on available scientific evidence, are developed by taking into account life-cycle considerations, including existing life-cycle assessments, and are updated regularly. Where scientific evaluation does not allow for a risk to be determined with sufficient certainty, the precautionary principle should apply in accordance with Article 191 TFEU.\n(41)\nIn establishing and updating the technical screening criteria for the environmental objective of climate change mitigation, the Commission should take into account and provide incentives for the ongoing and necessary transition towards a climate-neutral economy in accordance with Article 10(2) of this Regulation. In addition to the use of climate-neutral energy and more investments in already low-carbon economic activities and sectors, the transition requires substantial reductions in greenhouse gas emissions in other economic activities and sectors for which there are no technologically and economically feasible low-carbon alternatives. Those transitional economic activities should qualify as contributing substantially to climate change mitigation if their greenhouse gas emissions are substantially lower than the sector or industry average, they do not hamper the development and deployment of low-carbon alternatives and they do not lead to a lock-in of assets incompatible with the objective of climate-neutrality, considering the economic lifetime of those assets. The technical screening criteria for such transitional economic activities should ensure that those transitional activities have a credible path towards climate-neutrality, and should be adjusted accordingly at regular intervals.\n(42)\nAn economic activity should qualify as contributing substantially to one or more of the environmental objectives set out in this Regulation where it directly enables other activities to make a substantial contribution to one or more of those objectives. Such enabling activities should not lead to a lock-in of assets that undermine long-term environmental goals, considering the economic lifetime of those assets, and should have a substantial positive environmental impact, on the basis of life-cycle considerations.\n(43)\nWhen establishing and updating the technical screening criteria the Commission should take into account relevant Union law, including Regulations (EC) No 1221/2009 (55) and (EC) 66/2010 (56) of the European Parliament and of the Council, as well as Commission Recommendation 2013/179/EU (57) and the communication of the Commission of 16 July 2018 on ‘Public procurement for a better environment’. To avoid unnecessary inconsistencies with classifications of economic activities that already exist for other purposes, the Commission should also take into account the statistical classifications relating to the environmental goods and services sector, namely the classification of environmental protection activities (CEPA) and the classification of resource management activities (CReMA) of Regulation (EU) No 538/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council (58). When establishing and updating the technical screening criteria, the Commission should take into account existing environmental indicators and reporting frameworks, developed by, amongst others, the Commission and the European Environment Agency, and existing international standards, such as those developed by, amongst others, the OECD.\n(44)\nWhen establishing and updating the technical screening criteria, the Commission should also take into account the specificities of the infrastructure sector and should take into account environmental, social and economic externalities within a cost-benefit analysis. In that regard, the Commission should take into account relevant Union law, including Directives 2001/42/EC (59), 2011/92/EU (60), 2014/23/EU (61), 2014/24/EU (62) and 2014/25/EU (63) of the European Parliament and of the Council, standards and current methodology, as well as the work of international organisations, such as the OECD. In that context, the technical screening criteria should promote appropriate governance frameworks integrating environmental, social and governance factors as referred to in the United Nations-supported Principles for Responsible Investment at all stages of a project’s life cycle.\n(45)\nThe technical screening criteria should ensure that relevant economic activities within a specific sector can qualify as environmentally sustainable and are treated equally if they contribute equally to one or more of the environmental objectives laid down in this Regulation. The potential capacity to contribute to those environmental objectives can vary across sectors, which should be reflected in those criteria. However, within each sector, those criteria should not unfairly disadvantage certain economic activities over others if the former contribute to the environmental objectives to the same extent as the latter.\n(46)\nWhen establishing and updating technical screening criteria for environmentally sustainable activities, the Commission should assess whether the establishment of those criteria would give rise to stranded assets or would result in inconsistent incentives, or would have any other adverse impact on financial markets.\n(47)\nTo avoid overly burdensome compliance costs on economic operators, the Commission should establish technical screening criteria that provide for sufficient legal clarity, that are practicable and easy to apply, and for which compliance can be verified within reasonable cost-of-compliance boundaries, thereby avoiding unnecessary administrative burden. Technical screening criteria could require carrying out a life-cycle assessment where sufficiently practicable and where necessary.\n(48)\nTo ensure that investments are channelled towards economic activities that make the greatest positive impact on the environmental objectives, the Commission should give priority to the establishment of technical screening criteria for the economic activities that potentially contribute most to the environmental objectives.\n(49)\nAppropriate technical screening criteria should be established for the transport sector, including for mobile assets. Those screening criteria should take into account the fact that the transport sector, including international shipping, contributes close to 26 % of total greenhouse gas emissions in the Union. As stated in the Action Plan on Financing Sustainable Growth the transport sector represents about 30 % of the additional annual investment needed for sustainable development in the Union, for example to increase electrification or to support the transition to cleaner modes of transport by promoting modal shift and better traffic management.\n(50)\nWhen developing the technical screening criteria, it is of particular importance that the Commission carry out appropriate consultations in line with the Better Regulation Agenda. The process for the establishment and update of the technical screening criteria should involve relevant stakeholders and should build on the advice of experts who have proven knowledge and experience in the relevant areas. For that purpose, the Commission should set up a Platform on Sustainable Finance (the ‘Platform’). The Platform should be composed of experts representing both the public and private sectors. Public-sector experts should include representatives of the European Environmental Agency, the ESAs, the European Investment Bank and the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights. Private sector experts should include representatives of financial and non-financial market participants and business sectors, representing relevant industries, and persons with accounting and reporting expertise. The Platform should also include experts representing civil society, including experts in the field of environmental, social, labour and governance issues. Financial market participants should be encouraged to inform the Commission if they consider that an economic activity that does not meet the technical screening criteria, or for which such criteria have not yet been established, should qualify as environmentally sustainable, in order to help the Commission in evaluating the appropriateness of complementing or updating the technical screening criteria.\n(51)\nThe Platform should be constituted in accordance with the applicable horizontal rules on the creation and operation of Commission expert groups, including with regard to the selection process. The selection process should aim to ensure a high level of expertise, geographical and gender balance, as well as a balanced representation of relevant know-how, taking into account the specific tasks of the Platform. During the selection process, the Commission should perform an assessment in accordance with those horizontal rules to determine whether potential conflicts of interest exist and should take appropriate measures to resolve any such conflicts.\n(52)\nThe Platform should advise the Commission on the development, analysis and review of technical screening criteria, including the potential impact of such criteria on the valuation of assets that qualify as environmentally sustainable assets under existing market practices. The Platform should also advise the Commission on whether the technical screening criteria are suitable for use in future Union policy initiatives aimed at facilitating sustainable investment and on the possible role of sustainability accounting and reporting standards in supporting the application of the technical screening criteria. The Platform should advise the Commission on developing further measures to improve data availability and quality, taking into account the objective of avoiding undue administrative burden, on addressing other sustainability objectives, including social objectives, and on the functioning of minimum safeguards and the possible need to supplement them.\n(53)\nThe Commission should continue the existing Member State Expert Group on Sustainable Finance and provide it with a formal status. The tasks of that expert group will, inter alia, consist of advising the Commission on the appropriateness of the technical screening criteria and the approach taken by the Platform with regard to developing those criteria. For that purpose, the Commission should keep the Member States informed through regular meetings of the Member State Expert Group on Sustainable Finance.\n(54)\nIn order to specify the requirements set out in this Regulation, and in particular to establish and update for different economic activities granular and calibrated technical screening criteria for what constitutes ‘substantial contribution’ and ‘significant harm’ to the environmental objectives, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 TFEU should be delegated to the Commission in respect of the information required to comply with the disclosure obligations pursuant to this Regulation, and in respect of the technical screening criteria. It is of particular importance that the Commission carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level, such as through the Platform and the Member State Expert Group on Sustainable Finance, and that those consultations be conducted in accordance with the principles laid down in the Interinstitutional Agreement of 13 April 2016 on Better Law-Making (64). In particular, to ensure equal participation in the preparation of delegated acts, the European Parliament and the Council receive all documents at the same time as Member States’ experts, and their experts systematically have access to meetings of Commission expert groups dealing with the preparation of delegated acts.\n(55)\nThis Regulation supplements the disclosure requirements laid down in Regulation (EU) 2019/2088. To ensure the orderly and effective monitoring of compliance by financial market participants with this Regulation, Member States should rely on the competent authorities designated in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2019/2088. To enforce compliance, Member States should in addition lay down rules on measures and penalties, which should be effective, proportionate and dissuasive. National competent authorities and the ESAs should exercise the product intervention powers laid down in Regulations (EU) No 600/2014 (65), (EU) No 1286/2014 (66) and (EU) 2019/1238 (67) of the European Parliament and of the Council also with respect to mis-selling practices or misleading disclosures of sustainability-related information, including the information required under this Regulation.\n(56)\nIn order to ensure the efficient and sustainable organisation of the work and meeting practices of both the Platform and the Member State Expert Group on Sustainable Finance, and in order to enable broad participation and efficient interaction within the groups, their subgroups, the Commission and stakeholders, the increased use of digital, including virtual, technologies should be considered, where appropriate.\n(57)\nTo give sufficient time to the relevant actors to familiarise themselves with the criteria for qualification as environmentally sustainable economic activities set out in this Regulation and to prepare for their application, the obligations set out in this Regulation should become applicable, for each environmental objective, 12 months after the relevant technical screening criteria have been established.\n(58)\nThe provision in this Regulation referring to certificate-based tax incentive schemes that exist prior to the entry into force of this Regulation is without prejudice to the respective competences of the Union and the Member States with respect to tax provisions, as set out by the Treaties.\n(59)\nThe application of this Regulation should be reviewed regularly in order to assess, inter alia: the progress with regard to the development of technical screening criteria for environmentally sustainable economic activities; the possible need to revise and complement those criteria for determining whether an economic activity qualifies as environmentally sustainable; the effectiveness of the classification system for environmentally sustainable economic activities in channelling private investment into such activities and in particular as regards the flow of capital into private enterprises and other legal entities; and the further development of that classification system, including by expanding its scope beyond environmentally sustainable economic activities, in order to cover activities that significantly harm the environment, as well as other sustainability objectives, including social objectives.\n(60)\nSince the objectives of this Regulation cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States, but can rather, by reason of the need to introduce at Union level uniform criteria for environmentally sustainable economic activities, be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union. In accordance with the principle of proportionality as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives,\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nCHAPTER I\nSUBJECT MATTER, SCOPE AND DEFINITIONS\nArticle 1\nSubject matter and scope\n1.
