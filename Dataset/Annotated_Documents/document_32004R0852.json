{"celex_id": "32004R0852", "reference": "30.4.2004\nEN\nOfficial Journal of the European Communities\nL 139/1\nREGULATION (EC) No 852/2004 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL\nof 29 April 2004\non the hygiene of foodstuffs\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Articles 95 and 152(4)(b) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the Commission (1),\nHaving regard to the Opinion of the Economic and Social Committee (2),\nHaving consulted the Committee of the Regions,\nActing in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty (3),\nWhereas:\n(1)\nThe pursuit of a high level of protection of human life and health is one of the fundamental objectives of food law, as laid down in Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 (4). That Regulation also lays down other common principles and definitions for national and Community food law, including the aim of achieving free movement of food within the Community.\n(2)\nCouncil Directive 93/43/EEC of 14 June 1993 on the hygiene of foodstuffs (5) laid down the general rules of hygiene for foodstuffs and the procedures for verification of compliance with these rules.\n(3)\nExperience has shown that these rules and procedures constitute a sound basis for ensuring food safety. In the context of the common agricultural policy, many Directives have been adopted to establish specific health rules for the production and placing on the market of the products listed in Annex I to the Treaty. These health rules have reduced trade barriers for the products concerned, contributing to the creation of the internal market while ensuring a high level of protection of public health.\n(4)\nWith regard to public health, these rules and procedures contain common principles, in particular in relation to the manufacturers' and competent authorities' responsibilities, structural, operational and hygiene requirements for establishments, procedures for the approval of establishments, requirements for storage and transport and health marks.\n(5)\nThese principles constitute a common basis for the hygienic production of all food, including products of animal origin listed in Annex I to the Treaty.\n(6)\nIn addition to this common basis, specific hygiene rules are necessary for certain foodstuffs. Regulation (EC) No /2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of ... laying down specific hygiene rules for food of animal origin (6) lays down these rules.\n(7)\nThe principal objective of the new general and specific hygiene rules is to ensure a high level of consumer protection with regard to food safety.\n(8)\nAn integrated approach is necessary to ensure food safety from the place of primary production up to and including placing on the market or export. Every food business operator along the food chain should ensure that food safety is not compromised.\n(9)\nCommunity rules should not apply either to primary production for private domestic use, or to the domestic preparation, handling or storage of food for private domestic consumption. Moreover, they should apply only to undertakings, the concept of which implies a certain continuity of activities and a certain degree of organisation.\n(10)\nFood hazards present at the level of primary production should be identified and adequately controlled to ensure the achievement of the objectives of this Regulation. However, in the case of the direct supply of small quantities of primary products, by the food business operator producing them, to the final consumer or to a local retail establishment, it is appropriate to protect public health through national law, in particular because of the close relationship between the producer and the consumer.\n(11)\nThe application of hazard analysis and critical control point (HACCP) principles to primary production is not yet generally feasible. However, guides to good practice should encourage the use of appropriate hygiene practices at farm level. Where necessary, specific hygiene rules for primary production should supplement these guides. It is appropriate for the hygiene requirements applicable to primary production and associated operations to differ from those for other operations.\n(12)\nFood safety is a result of several factors: legislation should lay down minimum hygiene requirements; official controls should be in place to check food business operators' compliance and food business operators should establish and operate food safety programmes and procedures based on the HACCP principles.\n(13)\nSuccessful implementation of the procedures based on the HACCP principles will require the full cooperation and commitment of food business employees. To this end, employees should undergo training. The HACCP system is an instrument to help food business operators attain a higher standard of food safety. The HACCP system should not be regarded as a method of self-regulation and should not replace official controls.\n(14)\nWhile the requirement of establishing procedures based on the HACCP principles should not initially apply to primary production, the feasibility of its extension will be one element of the review that the Commission will carry out following implementation of this Regulation. It is, however, appropriate for Member States to encourage operators at the level of primary production to apply such principles as far as possible.\n(15)\nThe HACCP requirements should take account of the principles contained in the Codex Alimentarius. They should provide sufficient flexibility to be applicable in all situations, including in small businesses. In particular, it is necessary to recognise that, in certain food businesses, it is not possible to identify critical control points and that, in some cases, good hygienic practices can replace the monitoring of critical control points. Similarly, the requirement of establishing \"critical limits\" does not imply that it is necessary to fix a numerical limit in every case. In addition, the requirement of retaining documents needs to be flexible in order to avoid undue burdens for very small businesses.\n(16)\nFlexibility is also appropriate to enable the continued use of traditional methods at any of the stages of production, processing or distribution of food and in relation to structural requirements for establishments. Flexibility is particularly important for regions that are subject to special geographical constraints, including the outermost regions referred to in Article 299(2) of the Treaty. However, flexibility should not compromise food hygiene objectives. Moreover, since all food produced in accordance with the hygiene rules will be in free circulation throughout the Community, the procedure allowing Member States to exercise flexibility should be fully transparent. It should provide, where necessary to resolve disagreements, for discussion within the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health established by Regulation (EC) No 178/2002.\n(17)\nThe setting of objectives such as pathogen reduction targets or performance standards may guide the implementation of hygiene rules. It is therefore necessary to provide procedures for that purpose. Such objectives would supplement existing food law, such as Council Regulation (EEC) No 315/93 of 8 February 1993 laying down Community procedures for contaminants in food (7) which provides for the establishment of maximum tolerances for specific contaminants, and Regulation (EC) No 178/2002, which prohibits the placing on the market of unsafe food and provides a uniform basis for the use of the precautionary principle.\n(18)\nTo take account of technical and scientific progress, close and effective cooperation should be ensured between the Commission and the Member States within the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health. This Regulation takes account of international obligations laid down in the WTO Sanitary and Phytosanitary Agreement and the international food safety standards contained in the Codex Alimentarius.\n(19)\nThe registration of establishments and the cooperation of food business operators are necessary to allow the competent authorities to perform official controls efficiently.\n(20)\nThe traceability of food and food ingredients along the food chain is an essential element in ensuring food safety. Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 contains rules to ensure the traceability of food and food ingredients and provides a procedure for the adoption of implementing rules to apply these principles in respect of specific sectors.\n(21)\nFood imported into the Community is to comply with the general requirements laid down in Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 or satisfy rules that are equivalent to Community rules. The present Regulation defines certain specific hygiene requirements for food imported into the Community.\n(22)\nFood exported to third countries from the Community is to comply with the general requirements laid down in Regulation (EC) No 178/2002. The present Regulation defines certain specific hygiene requirements for food exported from the Community.\n(23)\nScientific advice should underpin Community legislation on food hygiene. To this end, the European Food Safety Authority should be consulted whenever necessary.\n(24)\nSince this Regulation replaces Directive 93/43/EEC, the latter should be repealed.\n(25)\nThe requirements of this Regulation should not apply until all parts of the new legislation on food hygiene have entered into force. It is also appropriate to provide for at least 18 months to elapse between entry into force and the application of the new rules, to allow the affected industries time to adapt.\n(26)\nThe measures necessary for the implementation of this Regulation should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission (8),\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nCHAPTER I\nGENERAL PROVISIONS\nArticle 1\nScope\n1.

In particular:\n(a)\nfloor surfaces are to be maintained in a sound condition and be easy to clean and, where necessary, to disinfect. This will require the use of impervious, non-absorbent, washable and non-toxic materials unless food business operators can satisfy the competent authority that other materials used are appropriate. Where appropriate, floors are to allow adequate surface drainage;\n(b)\nwall surfaces are to be maintained in a sound condition and be easy to clean and, where necessary, to disinfect. This will require the use of impervious, non-absorbent, washable and non-toxic materials and require a smooth surface up to a height appropriate for the operations unless food business operators can satisfy the competent authority that other materials used are appropriate;\n(c)\nceilings (or, where there are no ceilings, the interior surface of the roof) and overhead fixtures are to be constructed and finished so as to prevent the accumulation of dirt and to reduce condensation, the growth of undesirable mould and the shedding of particles;\n(d)\nwindows and other openings are to be constructed to prevent the accumulation of dirt. Those which can be opened to the outside environment are, where necessary, to be fitted with insect-proof screens which can be easily removed for cleaning. Where open windows would result in contamination, windows are to remain closed and fixed during production;\n(e)\ndoors are to be easy to clean and, where necessary, to disinfect. This will require the use of smooth and non-absorbent surfaces unless food business operators can satisfy the competent authority that other materials used are appropriate; and\n(f)\nsurfaces (including surfaces of equipment) in areas where foods are handled and in particular those in contact with food are to be maintained in a sound condition and be easy to clean and, where necessary, to disinfect. This will require the use of smooth, washable corrosion-resistant and non-toxic materials, unless food business operators can satisfy the competent authority that other materials used are appropriate.\n2.\nAdequate facilities are to be provided, where necessary, for the cleaning, disinfecting and storage of working utensils and equipment. These facilities are to be constructed of corrosion-resistant materials, be easy to clean and have an adequate supply of hot and cold water.\n3.\nAdequate provision is to be made, where necessary, for washing food. Every sink or other such facility provided for the washing of food is to have an adequate supply of hot and/or cold potable water consistent with the requirements of Chapter VII and be kept clean and, where necessary, disinfected.\nCHAPTER III\nREQUIREMENTS FOR MOVABLE AND/OR TEMPORARY PREMISES (SUCH AS MARQUEES, MARKET STALLS, MOBILE SALES VEHICLES), PREMISES USED PRIMARILY AS A PRIVATE DWELLING HOUSE BUT WHERE FOODS ARE REGULARLY PREPARED FOR PLACING ON THE MARKET, AND VENDING MACHINES\n1.\nPremises and vending machines are, so far as is reasonably practicable, to be so sited, designed, constructed and kept clean and maintained in good repair and condition as to avoid the risk of contamination, in particular by animals and pests.\n2.\nIn particular, where necessary:\n(a)\nappropriate facilities are to be available to maintain adequate personal hygiene (including facilities for the hygienic washing and drying of hands, hygienic sanitary arrangements and changing facilities);\n(b)\nsurfaces in contact with food are to be in a sound condition and be easy to clean and, where necessary, to disinfect. This will require the use of smooth, washable, corrosion-resistant and non-toxic materials, unless food business operators can satisfy the competent authority that other materials used are appropriate;\n(c)\nadequate provision is to be made for the cleaning and, where necessary, disinfecting of working utensils and equipment;\n(d)\nwhere foodstuffs are cleaned as part of the food business' operations, adequate provision is to be made for this to be undertaken hygienically;\n(e)\nan adequate supply of hot and/or cold potable water is to be available;\n(f)\nadequate arrangements and/or facilities for the hygienic storage and disposal of hazardous and/or inedible substances and waste (whether liquid or solid) are to be available;\n(g)\nadequate facilities and/or arrangements for maintaining and monitoring suitable food temperature conditions are to be available;\n(h)\nfoodstuffs are to be so placed as to avoid the risk of contamination so far as is reasonably practicable.\nCHAPTER IV\nTRANSPORT\n1.\nConveyances and/or containers used for transporting foodstuffs are to be kept clean and maintained in good repair and condition to protect foodstuffs from contamination and are, where necessary, to be designed and constructed to permit adequate cleaning and/or disinfection.\n2.\nReceptacles in vehicles and/or containers are not to be used for transporting anything other than foodstuffs where this may result in contamination.\n3.\nWhere conveyances and/or containers are used for transporting anything in addition to foodstuffs or for transporting different foodstuffs at the same time, there is, where necessary, to be effective separation of products.\n4.\nBulk foodstuffs in liquid, granulate or powder form are to be transported in receptacles and/or containers/tankers reserved for the transport of foodstuffs. Such containers are to be marked in a clearly visible and indelible fashion, in one or more Community languages, to show that they are used for the transport of foodstuffs, or are to be marked \"for foodstuffs only\".\n5.\nWhere conveyances and/or containers have been used for transporting anything other than foodstuffs or for transporting different foodstuffs, there is to be effective cleaning between loads to avoid the risk of contamination.\n6.\nFoodstuffs in conveyances and/or containers are to be so placed and protected as to minimise the risk of contamination.\n7.\nWhere necessary, conveyances and/or containers used for transporting foodstuffs are to be capable of maintaining foodstuffs at appropriate temperatures and allow those temperatures to be monitored.\nCHAPTER V\nEQUIPMENT REQUIREMENTS\n1.\nAH articles, fittings and equipment with which food comes into contact are to:\n(a)\nbe effectively cleaned and, where necessary, disinfected. Cleaning and disinfection are to take place at a frequency sufficient to avoid any risk of contamination;\n(b)\nbe so constructed, be of such materials and be kept in such good order, repair and condition as to minimise any risk of contamination;\n(c)\nwith the exception of non-returnable containers and packaging, be so constructed, be of such materials and be kept in such good order, repair and condition as to enable them to be kept clean and, where necessary, to be disinfected; and\n(d)\nbe installed in such a manner as to allow adequate cleaning of the equipment and the surrounding area.\n2.\nWhere necessary, equipment is to be fitted with any appropriate control device to guarantee fulfilment of this Regulation's objectives.\n3.\nWhere chemical additives have to be used to prevent corrosion of equipment and containers, they are to be used in accordance with good practice.\nCHAPTER VI\nFOOD WASTE\n1.\nFood waste, non-edible by-products and other refuse are to be removed from rooms where food is present as quickly as possible, so as to avoid their accumulation.\n2.\nFood waste, non-edible by-products and other refuse are to be deposited in closable containers, unless food business operators can demonstrate to the competent authority that other types of containers or evacuation systems used are appropriate. These containers are to be of an appropriate construction, kept in sound condition, be easy to clean and, where necessary, to disinfect.\n3.\nAdequate provision is to be made for the storage and disposal of food waste, non-edible by-products and other refuse. Refuse stores are to be designed and managed in such a way a to enable them to be kept clean and, where necessary, free of animals and pests.\n4.\nAll waste is to be eliminated in a hygienic and environmentally friendly way in accordance with Community legislation applicable to that effect, and is not to constitute a direct or indirect source of contamination.\nCHAPTER VII\nWATER SUPPLY\n1.\n(a)\nThere is to be an adequate supply of potable water, which is to be used whenever necessary to ensure that foodstuffs are not contaminated;\n(b)\nClean water may be used with whole fishery products. Clean seawater may be used with live bivalve molluscs, echinoderms, tunicates and marine gastropods; clean water may also be used for external washing. When such water is used, adequate facilities are to be available for its supply.\n2.\nWhere non-potable water is used, for example for fire control, steam production, refrigeration and other similar purposes, it is to circulate in a separate duly identified system. Non-potable water is not to connect with, or allow reflux into, potable water systems.\n3.\nRecycled water used in processing or as an ingredient is not to present a risk of contamination. It is to be of the same standard as potable water, unless the competent authority is satisfied that the quality of the water cannot affect the wholesomeness of the foodstuff in its finished form.\n4.\nIce which comes into contact with food or which may contaminate food is to be made from potable water or, when used to chill whole fishery products, clean water. It is to be made, handled and stored under conditions that protect it from contamination.\n5.\nSteam used directly in contact with food is not to contain any substance that presents a hazard to health or is likely to contaminate the food.\n6.\nWhere heat treatment is applied to foodstuffs in hermetically sealed containers it is to be ensured that water used to cool the containers after heat treatment is not a source of contamination for the foodstuff.\nCHAPTER VIII\nPERSONAL HYGIENE\n1.\nEvery person working in a food-handling area is to maintain a high degree of personal cleanliness and is to wear suitable, clean and, where necessary, protective clothing.\n2.\nNo person suffering from, or being a carrier of a disease likely to be transmitted through food or afflicted, for example, with infected wounds, skin infections, sores or diarrhoea is to be permitted to handle food or enter any food-handling area in any capacity if there is any likelihood of direct or indirect contamination. Any person so affected and employed in a food business and who is likely to come into contact with food is to report immediately the illness or symptoms, and if possible their causes, to the food business operator.\nCHAPTER DC\nPROVISIONS APPLICABLE TO FOODSTUFFS\n1.\nA food business operator is not to accept raw materials or ingredients, other than live animals, or any other material used in processing products, if they are known to be, or might reasonably be expected to be, contaminated with parasites, pathogenic microorganisms or toxic, decomposed or foreign substances to such an extent that, even after the food business operator had hygienically applied normal sorting and/or preparatory or processing procedures, the final product would be unfit for human consumption.\n2.\nRaw materials and all ingredients stored in a food business are to be kept in appropriate conditions designed to prevent harmful deterioration and protect them from contamination.\n3.\nAt all stages of production, processing and distribution, food is to be protected against any contamination likely to render the food unfit for human consumption, injurious to health or contaminated in such a way that it would be unreasonable to expect it to be consumed in that state.\n4.\nAdequate procedures are to be in place to control pests. Adequate procedures are also to be in place to prevent domestic animals from having access to places where food is prepared, handled or stored (or, where the competent authority so permits in special cases, to prevent such access from resulting in contamination).\n5.\nRaw materials, ingredients, intermediate products and finished products likely to support the reproduction of pathogenic micro-organisms or the formation of toxins are not to be kept at temperatures that might result in a risk to health. The cold chain is not to be interrupted. However, limited periods outside temperature control are permitted, to accommodate the practicalities of handling during preparation, transport, storage, display and service of food, provided that it does not result in a risk to health. Food businesses manufacturing, handling and wrapping processed foodstuffs are to have suitable rooms, large enough for the separate storage of raw materials from processed material and sufficient separate refrigerated storage.\n6.\nWhere foodstuffs are to be held or served at chilled temperatures they are to be cooled as quickly as possible following the heat-processing stage, or final preparation stage if no heat process is applied, to a temperature which does not result in a risk to health.\n7.\nThe thawing of foodstuffs is to be undertaken in such a way as to minimise the risk of growth of pathogenic microorganisms or the formation of toxins in the foods. During thawing, foods are to be subjected to temperatures that would not result in a risk to health. Where run-off liquid from the thawing process may present a risk to health it is to be adequately drained. Following thawing, food is to be handled in such a manner as to minimise the risk of growth of pathogenic microorganisms or the formation of toxins.\n8.\nHazardous and/or inedible substances, including animal feed, are to be adequately labelled and stored in separate and secure containers.\nCHAPTER X\nPROVISIONS APPLICABLE TO THE WRAPPING AND PACKAGING OF FOODSTUFFS\n1.\nMaterial used for wrapping and packaging are not to be a source of contamination.\n2.\nWrapping materials are to be stored in such a manner that they are not exposed to a risk of contamination.\n3.\nWrapping and packaging operations are to be carried out so as to avoid contamination of the products. Where appropriate and in particular in the case of cans and glass jars, the integrity of the container's construction and its cleanliness is to be assured.\n4.\nWrapping and packaging material re-used for foodstuffs is to be easy to clean and, where necessary, to disinfect.\nCHAPTER XI\nHEAT TREATMENT\nThe following requirements apply only to food placed on the market in hermetically sealed containers:\n1.\nany heat treatment process used to process an unprocessed product or to process further a processed product is;\n(a)\nto raise every party of the product treated to a given temperature for a given period of time; and\n(b)\nto prevent the product from becoming contaminated during the process;\n2.\nto ensure mat the process employed achieves the desired objectives, food business operators are to check regularly the main relevant parameters (particularly temperature, pressure, sealing and microbiology), including by the use of automatic devices;\n3.\nthe process used should conform to an internationally recognised standard (for example, pasteurisation, ultra high temperature or sterilisation).\nCHAPTER XII\nTRAINING\nFood business operators are to ensure:\n1.\nthat food handlers are supervised and instructed and/or trained in food hygiene matters commensurate with their work activity;\n2.\nthat those responsible for the development and maintenance of the procedure referred to in Article 5(1) of this Regulation or for the operation of relevant guides have received adequate training in the application of the HACCP principles; and\n3.\ncompliance with any requirements of national law concerning training programmes for persons working in certain food sectors.", "summary": "Food safety — from farm to fork\nFood safety — from farm to fork\nSUMMARY OF:\nRegulation (EC) No 852/2004 on the hygiene of foodstuffs\nWHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?\nThe European Union (EU) seeks to ensure food hygiene at all stages of the production process, from farms to processing plants and retailers to the final consumer.\nThe regulation and its annexes define a set of requirements for the EU that firms working with food must meet in order to ensure that food is safe for consumers.\nKEY POINTS\n              \nThe key principle is that everyone working in the food business must ensure food is dealt with in a hygienic and safe way, i.e. free of contamination from foodborne hazards, at every stage of the production process. This is achieved through:\ngood hygiene practices;\nprocedures based on the hazard analysis and critical control points (HACCP) principles.\nGood hygiene practices\nAnnex I lays down good hygiene practices applicable during the primary production stage (i.e. farming, hunting or fishing) and during the transport, handling and storage of primary products and the transport of live animals.\nThe good hygiene practices set out in Annex II apply to food operators after primary production (slaughterhouses, processing plants, retailers, etc.) and cover areas such as:\ncleanness of food premises and equipment;\ntransport conditions;\nfood waste management;\nwater supply;\npersonal hygiene and training of food workers;\nwrapping and packaging;\nheat treatment processes.\nProcedures based on the HACCP principles\nBusinesses in the food sector (except those involved in primary production) should apply procedures based on HACCP principles in line with the general principles of food hygiene of the Codex Alimentarius. These principles include:\nidentifying any hazards that must be controlled;\nidentifying the critical control points and establishing critical limits;\nestablishing and implementing effective monitoring;\nestablishing corrective actions when needed;\nestablishing procedures to verify that HACCP procedures are working effectively;\nestablishing documents and records to demonstrate the effective application of the HACCP procedures.\nThe development of national and EU guidance to implement the good hygiene practices and HACCP procedures in a specific food sector is encouraged.\nOther requirements of Regulation (EC) No 852/2004\nWhere required by national or EU legislation, businesses in the food sector must be approved and all premises registered with the appropriate authority, allowing this authority to visit them and verify compliance with the hygiene requirements.\nFood imported into the EU and exported food of animal origin must comply with EU standards or their equivalent, as well as any requirements which the importing country may impose.\nClosely related EU legislation\nRegulation (EC) No 853/2004 (see summary) sets out additional specific hygiene rules for food of animal origin, for example meat, fishery products and cheeses.\nRegulation (EC) No 178/2002 on the general principles and requirements of EU food law (see summary), also supplements the hygiene requirements by laying down obligations on the traceability* of food and requiring that when discovering that a food consignment presents a serious health risk, a food business must immediately withdraw that food from the market and inform users and the relevant authority.\nAmendments to Regulation (EC) No 852/2004\nThe regulation has been amended several times, including by the following regulations.\nRegulation (EC) No 1019/2008 clarifies the rules regarding the water used for whole fishery products and for the external washing of live bivalve molluscs, echinoderms, tunicates and marine gastropods.\nRegulation (EU) No 579/2014 grants exceptions from certain rules in Regulation (EC) No 852/2004 to allow liquid oils or fats intended for or likely to be used for human consumption to be transported in seagoing vessels which are not reserved for the transport of foodstuffs, subject to certain conditions which ensure the protection of public health and the safety and wholesomeness of the foodstuffs concerned.\nRegulation (EU) 2021/382, which concerns food allergen management, redistribution of food and food safety culture, amends Annexes I and II of Regulation (EC) No 852/2004 to take into account certain advice from the European Food Safety Authority, and the adoption of new standards by the Codex Alimentarius Commission. These changes seek to: include requirements introducing good hygiene practices to prevent or limit the presence of substances causing allergies or intolerances;lay down certain requirements to promote and facilitate redistribution of food (e.g. food donations), while guaranteeing its safety for consumers;include general requirements on food safety culture to increase awareness and improve the practices of food establishment employees.\nFROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?\n              \nIt has applied since 1 January 2006.\nBACKGROUND\n              \nFor more information, see:\nFood hygiene (European Commission).\nKEY TERMS\n              \nTraceability. The ability to trace and follow a food or food-producing animal through all stages of production, processing and distribution.\nMAIN DOCUMENT\n            \nRegulation (EC) No 852/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on the hygiene of foodstuffs (OJ L 139, 30.04.2004, pp. 1–54).
