It should ensure that European Union (EU) rules on banknotes and coins denominated in euro — including those related to its protection against counterfeiting — are applicable within its territory. The Republic of San Marino shall undertake all the necessary measures to combat counterfeiting and to cooperate with the European Commission, the European Central Bank (ECB) and Europol. Until a cooperation agreement between Europol and the Republic of San Marino is signed, the Republic of San Marino shall cooperate with Europol via the competent Italian authorities in this area.\n(6)\nThe Republic of San Marino should take particular account of the recommendations of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), notably FATF calls to its members and FATF-style regional body members to apply necessary countermeasures against identified high risk jurisdictions. The Republic of San Marino, which is represented in the Committee of Experts on the Evaluation of Anti-Money Laundering Measures and the Financing of Terrorism, takes duly account of the recommendations made or to be made in the Republic of San Marino mutual evaluation reports so as to enhance its response to money laundering threats.\n(7)\nThis Agreement does not impose any obligation on the ECB and national central banks to include the financial instruments of the Republic of San Marino in the list(s) of assets eligible for monetary policy operations of the European System of Central Banks.\n(8)\nThe Republic of San Marino has a banking sector which expects to operate in closer connection with that of the euro area. Relevant EU banking and financial legislation, legislation concerning the prevention of money laundering, the prevention of fraud and counterfeiting of non-cash means of payment and statistical reporting requirements should therefore be made progressively applicable to the Republic of San Marino with a view to ensuring a more level playing field.\n(9)\nA Joint Committee composed of representatives of the Republic of San Marino, the Italian Republic, the Commission and the ECB should be established in order to examine the application of this Agreement, decide the annual ceiling for coin issuance and assess the measures taken by the Republic of San Marino for implementing relevant EU legislation.\n(10)\nThe Court of Justice of the European Union should be the judicial body in charge of settling any disputes which may arise from the application of the Agreement,\nHAVE AGREED AS FOLLOWS:\nArticle 1\nThe Republic of San Marino shall be entitled to use the euro as its official currency in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) No 1103/97 of 17 June 1997 on certain provisions relating to the introduction of the euro (3) and Regulation (EC) No 974/98 of 3 May 1998 on the introduction of the euro.

The Joint Committee may revise annually the fixed part with a view to taking into account both inflation — on the basis of the HICP inflation of Italy in the last 12 months for which the data are available at the moment of the calculation — and the possible significant trends affecting the euro coins collector market,\n—\na variable part, corresponding to the average per capita coin issuance of the Italian Republic in the last 12 months for which the data are available multiplied by the number of inhabitants of San Marino.\nArticle 4\n1.

Andorra\nMonetary agreement between the EU and San Marino\nMonetary agreement between the EU and Monaco\nWHAT IS THE AIM OF DECISIONS AND THE AGREEMENTS?\nWith the arrival of the euro on 1 January 1999, it was necessary for the European Union (EU) to redefine monetary relations with countries and territories which had previously used the French franc and the Portuguese escudo.\nSimilarly, a new monetary footing needed to be established with EU neighbours, such as Monaco, San Marino and the Vatican. These had no national currency of their own, but used those of countries which subsequently adopted the euro.\nKEY POINTS\n              \nThe new arrangements are set out in the following agreements:\n1.\nExchange rate matters\nFrance was able to continue its agreements with the West African Economic and Monetary Union, the Communauté économique et monétaire de l'Afrique centrale and the Comoros. These guaranteed the exchange of CFA (Communauté Financière Africaine) and Comorian francs into the French franc at a fixed rate for as long as the French franc continued to exist.\nPortugal was able to continue its agreement with Cape Verde. This ensured exchange rate stability between the two countries’ currencies and allowed for financial and technical assistance from Portugal until the escudo ceased to exist.\nFrance and Portugal had to inform the European Commission, the European Central Bank (ECB) and the Economic and Financial Committee of any developments that could affect monetary and exchange-rate policies.\n2.Monetary arrangements\nThe French territories of Saint-Pierre-et-Miquelon, close to Canada’s eastern coast, and Mayotte in the Indian Ocean, neither of which are part of the EU, replace the French franc with the euro. They were allowed to use banknotes and coins in francs until 30 June 2002.\n3.Monetary relations\nMonaco, San Marino and the Vatican signed monetary agreements with the EU before the introduction of euro banknotes and coins in 2002. These have been renegotiated to correct some shortcomings. They authorise the 3 countries to use the euro as their official currency. They must:\nnot issue any euro notes or coins unless the agreement allows this;\ncomply with EU rules on euro notes and coins, copyright and exchange of damaged notes;\nprotect euro notes and coins against counterfeiting.\nThe agreements allow each of the 3 countries to issue a limited number of euro coins:\nMonaco (an annual volume of 1/500th of the quantity of coins minted in France);\nSan Marino (a maximum annual face value of €1,944,000);\nthe Vatican (maximum annual face value of €1 million).\nAndorra asked on 15 July 2003 for a monetary agreement with the EU. This was concluded on 30 June 2011, enabling the country to use the euro as its official currency and, from July 2013, to issue its own euro coins.\nFROM WHEN DO THE DECISION AND THE AGREEMENTS APPLY?\n1 January 1999 for the CFA franc, the French franc (Saint-Pierre-et-Miquelon and Mayotte), the Comorian franc and the Cape Verde escudo.\n1 January 2010: the Vatican — this agreement replaced a previous monetary agreement concluded in 2000 between the European Community, represented by Italy in association with the Commission and the ECB, and the Vatican City State.\n1 December 2011: Monaco — this agreement replaced an agreement concluded in 2001 by France, in association with the Commission and the ECB.\n1 April 2012: Andorra.\n1 September 2012: San Marino — this agreement replaced a previous agreement between Italy, on behalf of the European Community, and San Marino.\nBACKGROUND\n              \nFor more information, see:\nThe euro outside the euro area (European Commission).\nMAIN DOCUMENTS\n            \nCouncil Decision 98/683/EC of 23 November 1998 concerning exchange rate matters relating to the CFA Franc and the Comorian Franc (OJ L 320, 28.11.1998, pp. 58–59).\nSuccessive amendments to Decision 98/683/EC have been incorporated into the original text.
