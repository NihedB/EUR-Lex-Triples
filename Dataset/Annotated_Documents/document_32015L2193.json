{"celex_id": "32015L2193", "reference": "28.11.2015\nEN\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\nL 313/1\nDIRECTIVE (EU) 2015/2193 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL\nof 25 November 2015\non the limitation of emissions of certain pollutants into the air from medium combustion plants\n(Text with EEA relevance)\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 192(1) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee (1),\nHaving regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions (2),\nActing in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure (3),\nWhereas:\n(1)\nDecision No 1386/2013/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council (4) (‘the Action Programme’) recognises that emissions of pollutants to air have been reduced significantly over the past decades, but that at the same time air pollution levels are still problematic in many parts of Europe, and that citizens of the Union continue to be exposed to air-polluting substances, potentially compromising their health and wellbeing. According to the Action Programme, ecosystems continue to suffer from excess nitrogen and sulphur deposition associated with emissions from transport, unsustainable agricultural practices and power generation. In many areas of the Union, air pollution levels are still above the limits that the Union has set, and Union air quality standards are still failing to meet the targets set by the World Health Organisation.\n(2)\nIn order to ensure a healthy environment for all, the Action Programme calls for local measures to be complemented with adequate policy at both national and Union level. It requires in particular strengthening efforts to reach full compliance with air quality legislation of the Union and defining strategic targets and actions beyond 2020.\n(3)\nScientific assessments show that the average lifetime loss for citizens of the Union due to air pollution is eight months.\n(4)\nEmissions of pollutants from the combustion of fuel in medium combustion plants are generally not regulated at Union level even though they contribute increasingly to air pollution, due in particular to an increase in the use of biomass as a fuel, driven by climate and energy policy.\n(5)\nThe combustion of fuel in certain small combustion plants and appliances is covered by implementing measures as referred to in Directive 2009/125/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (5). Further measures are urgently needed under Directive 2009/125/EC in order to cover the remaining regulatory gap. Combustion of fuel in large combustion plants is covered by Directive 2010/75/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council (6) from 7 January 2013, while Directive 2001/80/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (7) continues to apply to large combustion plants covered by Article 30(2) of Directive 2010/75/EU until 31 December 2015.\n(6)\nThe Commission concluded, in its report to the European Parliament and the Council of 17 May 2013 on the reviews undertaken under Article 30(9) and Article 73 of Directive 2010/75/EU on industrial emissions addressing emissions from intensive livestock rearing and combustion plants, that, for the combustion of fuels in medium combustion plants, a clear potential for cost-effective abatement of air emissions has been demonstrated.\n(7)\nThe Union's international obligations in relation to air pollution, which are designed to abate acidification, eutrophication, ground-level ozone and emissions of particulate matter, are agreed under the Gothenburg Protocol to the Convention on Long-range Transboundary Air Pollution, which was amended in 2012 to strengthen the existing reduction commitments for sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, ammonia and volatile organic compounds, and to introduce new reduction commitments for fine particulate matter (PM 2.5), to be attained from 2020 onwards.\n(8)\nThe Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions of 18 December 2013 entitled ‘A Clean Air Programme for Europe’ calls for action to control emissions of air-polluting substances from medium combustion plants, thereby completing the regulatory framework for the combustion sector. The Clean Air Programme completes the pollution reduction agenda for 2020 laid down in the Communication from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament of 21 September 2005 entitled ‘Thematic Strategy on Air Pollution’, and develops impact reduction objectives for the period up to 2030. To achieve all those strategic objectives, a regulatory agenda should be established, including measures to control emissions from medium combustion plants.\n(9)\nMedium combustion plants should be developed and operated in such a way as to promote energy efficiency. Such considerations as well as economic considerations, technical possibilities and the lifecycle of existing medium combustion plants should in particular be taken into account when retrofitting medium combustion plants or deciding on major investments.\n(10)\nIn order to ensure that the operation of a medium combustion plant does not lead to a deterioration of air quality, measures taken to limit emissions of sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxides and dust into the air should not result in an increase of emissions of other pollutants, such as carbon monoxide.\n(11)\nMedium combustion plants that are already subject to Union-wide minimum requirements, such as plants to which an aggregation rule applies under Chapter III of Directive 2010/75/EU, or plants that incinerate or co-incinerate solid or liquid waste and are thereby covered by Chapter IV of that Directive, should be excluded from the scope of this Directive.\n(12)\nCertain other medium combustion plants should also be excluded from the scope of this Directive, on the basis of their technical characteristics or their use in particular activities.\n(13)\nAs medium combustion plants firing refinery fuels alone or with other fuels for the production of energy within mineral oil and gas refineries, and recovery boilers within installations for the production of pulp, are subject to emission levels associated with best available techniques (BAT) set out in BAT conclusions already established under Directive 2010/75/EU, this Directive should not apply to such plants.\n(14)\nThis Directive should apply to combustion plants, including a combination formed by two or more new medium combustion plants, with a total rated thermal input equal to or greater than 1 MW and less than 50 MW. Individual combustion plants with a rated thermal input less than 1 MW should not be considered for the purpose of calculating the total rated thermal input of a combination of combustion plants. In order to avoid a regulatory gap, this Directive should also apply to a combination formed by new medium combustion plants where the total rated thermal input is equal to or more than 50 MW, without prejudice to Chapter III of Directive 2010/75/EU.\n(15)\nIn order to ensure the control of emissions of sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxides and dust into the air, each medium combustion plant should operate only if it has been granted a permit or been registered by the competent authority, based on information submitted by the operator.\n(16)\nFor the purposes of controlling emissions into the air from medium combustion plants, emission limit values and requirements for monitoring should be set out in this Directive.\n(17)\nThe emission limit values set out in Annex II should not apply to medium combustion plants located in the Canary Islands, French Overseas Departments, the Azores and Madeira, because of the technical and logistical issues associated with such plants' isolated location. The Member States concerned should set emission limit values for such plants in order to reduce their emissions to air and the potential risks to human health and the environment.\n(18)\nIn order to provide existing medium combustion plants with sufficient time to adapt technically to the requirements of this Directive, the emission limit values should apply to those plants after a fixed period from the date of application of this Directive.\n(19)\nIn order to take account of certain specific circumstances where the application of emission limit values would lead to disproportionately high costs compared to the environmental benefits, Member States should be able to exempt medium combustion plants used in cases of emergency and operated during limited time periods from compliance with the emission limit values set out in this Directive.\n(20)\nDue to the infrastructural constraints faced by existing medium combustion plants which are part of small isolated systems (SIS) or micro isolated systems (MIS) and the need to facilitate their interconnection, such plants should be given more time to adapt to the emission limit values set out in this Directive.\n(21)\nConsidering the overall benefits of district heating in terms of contributing to a reduction in domestic use of fuels that cause high levels of air pollution, and in terms of energy efficiency improvement and CO2 emissions reduction, it should be possible for Member States to give more time to existing medium combustion plants which provide a substantial amount of their useful heat production to a public network for district heating, to adapt to the emission limit values set out in this Directive.\n(22)\nConsidering recent investments in biomass plants aimed at increasing the use of renewable energy sources and which have already led to reduced emissions of pollutants, and in order to take account of related investment cycles, it should be possible for Member States to give more time to such plants to adapt to the emission limit values set out in this Directive.\n(23)\nGiven the essential role of gas compressor stations for the reliability and safe operation of national gas transmission networks and the specific constraints relating to their upgrade, it should be possible for Member States to give more time to medium combustion plants driving such stations to adapt to the emission limit values for nitrogen oxides set out in this Directive.\n(24)\nIn accordance with Article 193 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), this Directive does not prevent Member States from maintaining or introducing more stringent protective measures. Such measures may be needed for example in zones not complying with air quality limit values. In those cases, Member States should assess the need to apply stricter emission limit values than the requirements set out in this Directive, as part of the development of air quality plans pursuant to Directive 2008/50/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (8). Such assessments should take account of the outcome of an exchange of information on the best emission-reduction performance that can be achieved with best available and emerging technologies. The Commission should organise such exchange of information with Member States, the industries concerned, including operators and technology providers, and non-governmental organisations, including those promoting environmental protection.\n(25)\nMember States should ensure that the operator of a medium combustion plant takes the necessary measures in the event of non-compliance with this Directive. Member States should set up a system to check compliance of medium combustion plants with the requirements of this Directive.\n(26)\nIn order to ensure the effective implementation and enforcement of this Directive, inspections should, where possible, be coordinated with those required under other Union legislation, as appropriate.\n(27)\nThe provisions of this Directive regarding access to information relating to its implementation should be applied in such a way as to ensure the full effect of Directive 2003/4/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (9).\n(28)\nIn order to limit the burden for small and medium-sized enterprises operating medium combustion plants, the administrative obligations on operators concerning the provision of information, monitoring and reporting should be proportionate and avoid duplication, while still allowing for effective compliance verification by the competent authority.\n(29)\nTo ensure the consistency and coherence of information provided by the Member States on the implementation of this Directive and to promote exchange of information between Member States and the Commission, the Commission, assisted by the European Environment Agency, should develop an electronic reporting tool also available for internal use by Member States for national reporting and data management purposes.\n(30)\nThe Commission should assess the need to amend the emission limit values set out in Annex II for new medium combustion plants, on the basis of state-of-the-art technologies. In this context, the Commission should also consider the need to set specific emission limit values for other pollutants, such as carbon monoxide, and possible minimum energy efficiency standards.\n(31)\nIn order to adapt to scientific and technical progress, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 TFEU to adjust the provisions on assessment of compliance set out in point 2 of Part 2 of Annex III should be delegated to the Commission. It is of particular importance that the Commission carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level. The Commission, when preparing and drawing up delegated acts, should ensure a simultaneous, timely and appropriate transmission of relevant documents to the European Parliament and the Council.\n(32)\nIn order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of this Directive and to simplify and streamline Member States' reporting obligations, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission in respect of the specification of technical formats for reporting. Those powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council (10).\n(33)\nSince the objectives of this Directive, namely the improvement of environmental quality and human health, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States, but can rather, by reason of their scale and effects, be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union. In accordance with the principle of proportionality as set out in that Article, this Directive does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives.\n(34)\nThis Directive respects the fundamental rights and observes the principles recognised in particular by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (‘the Charter’). In particular, this Directive seeks to ensure the application of Article 37 of the Charter on environmental protection.\n(35)\nIn accordance with the Joint Political Declaration of 28 September 2011 of Member States and the Commission on explanatory documents (11), Member States have undertaken to accompany, in justified cases, the notification of their transposition measures with one or more documents explaining the relationship between the components of a directive and the corresponding parts of national transposition instruments. With regard to this Directive, the legislator considers the transmission of such documents to be justified,\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:\nArticle 1\nSubject matter\nThis Directive lays down rules to control emissions of sulphur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx) and dust into the air from medium combustion plants, and thereby reduce emissions to air and the potential risks to human health and the environment from such emissions.\nThis Directive also lays down rules to monitor emissions of carbon monoxide (CO).\nArticle 2\nScope\n1.   This Directive shall apply to combustion plants with a rated thermal input equal to or greater than 1 MW and less than 50 MW (‘medium combustion plants’), irrespective of the type of fuel they use.\n2.   This Directive shall also apply to a combination formed by new medium combustion plants pursuant to Article 4, including a combination where the total rated thermal input is equal to or greater than 50 MW, unless the combination forms a combustion plant covered by Chapter III of Directive 2010/75/EU.\n3.

The competent authority shall make the information contained in the register available to the public, including via the internet, in accordance with Directive 2003/4/EC.\n6.   Without prejudice to the obligation for medium combustion plants to hold a permit or be registered, Member States may include requirements for certain categories of medium combustion plants in general binding rules. Where general binding rules are adopted, the permit or the registration may simply include a reference to such rules.\n7.   For medium combustion plants which are part of an installation covered by Chapter II of Directive 2010/75/EU, the requirements of this Article shall be deemed to be fulfilled through compliance with that Directive.\n8.   Any permit granted or registration carried out pursuant to other national or Union legislation may be combined with the permit or registration required under paragraph 1 to form a single permit or registration provided that that single permit or registration contains the information required under this Article.\nArticle 6\nEmission limit values\n1.   Without prejudice to Chapter II of Directive 2010/75/EU, where applicable, the emission limit values set out in Annex II to this Directive shall apply to medium combustion plants.\nThe emission limit values set out in Annex II shall not apply to medium combustion plants located in the Canary Islands, French Overseas Departments, the Azores and Madeira. The Member States concerned shall set emission limit values for those plants in order to reduce their emissions to air and the potential risks to human health and the environment.\n2.   From 1 January 2025, emissions into the air of SO2, NOx and dust from an existing medium combustion plant with a rated thermal input greater than 5 MW shall not exceed the emission limit values set out in Tables 2 and 3 of Part 1 of Annex II.\nFrom 1 January 2030, emissions into the air of SO2, NOx and dust from an existing medium combustion plant with a rated thermal input of less than or equal to 5 MW shall not exceed the emission limit values set out in Tables 1 and 3 of Part 1 of Annex II.\n3.   Member States may exempt existing medium combustion plants which do not operate more than 500 operating hours per year, as a rolling average over a period of five years, from compliance with the emission limit values set out in Tables 1, 2 and 3 of Part 1 of Annex II.\nMember States may extend the limit referred to in the first subparagraph to 1 000 operating hours in the following cases of emergency or extraordinary circumstances:\n—\nfor backup power production in connected islands in the event of an interruption of the main power supply to an island,\n—\nmedium combustion plants used for heat production in cases of exceptionally cold weather events.\nIn all cases set out in this paragraph, an emission limit value for dust of 200 mg/Nm3 shall apply for plants firing solid fuels.\n4.   Existing medium combustion plants which are part of SIS or MIS shall comply with the emission limit values set out in Tables 1, 2 and 3 of Part 1 of Annex II from 1 January 2030.\n5.   Until 1 January 2030, Member States may exempt existing medium combustion plants with a rated thermal input greater than 5 MW from compliance with the emission limit values set out in Annex II provided that at least 50 % of the useful heat production of the plant, as a rolling average over a period of five years, is delivered in the form of steam or hot water to a public network for district heating. In the event of such exemption, the emission limit values set by the competent authority shall not exceed 1 100 mg/Nm3 for SO2 and 150 mg/Nm3 for dust.\nUntil 1 January 2030, Member States may exempt medium combustion plants firing solid biomass as the main fuel, which are situated in zones where, according to assessments under Directive 2008/50/EC, conformity with the limit values of that Directive is ensured, from compliance with the emission limit values for dust set out in Annex II to this Directive. In the event of such exemption, the emission limit values set by the competent authority shall not exceed 150 mg/Nm3 for dust.\nThe competent authority shall in any case ensure that no significant pollution is caused and that a high level of protection of the environment as a whole is achieved.\n6.   Until 1 January 2030, Member States may exempt existing medium combustion plants with a rated thermal input greater than 5 MW and which are used to drive gas compressor stations required to ensure the safety and security of a national gas transmission system, from compliance with the emission limit values for NOx set out in Table 3 of Part 1 of Annex II.\n7.   From 20 December 2018, emissions into the air of SO2, NOx and dust from a new medium combustion plant shall not exceed the emission limit values set out in Part 2 of Annex II.\n8.   Member States may exempt new medium combustion plants which do not operate more than 500 operating hours per year, as a rolling average over a period of three years, from compliance with the emission limit values set out in Part 2 of Annex II. In the event of such exemption, an emission limit value for dust of 100 mg/Nm3 shall apply for plants firing solid fuels.\n9.   In zones or parts of zones not complying with the air quality limit values laid down in Directive 2008/50/EC, Member States shall assess the need to apply, for individual medium combustion plants in those zones or parts of zones, stricter emission limit values than those set out in this Directive, as part of the development of air quality plans referred to in Article 23 of Directive 2008/50/EC, taking into account the results of the information exchange referred to in paragraph 10 of this Article, provided that applying such emission limit values would effectively contribute to a noticeable improvement of air quality.\n10.   The Commission shall organise an exchange of information with Member States, the industries concerned and non-governmental organisations on the emission levels achievable with best available and emerging technologies and the related costs.\nThe Commission shall publish the results of the exchange of information.\n11.   The competent authority may grant a derogation for a maximum period of six months from the obligation to comply with the emission limit values provided for in paragraphs 2 and 7 for SO2 in respect of a medium combustion plant which normally uses low-sulphur fuel, in cases where the operator is unable to comply with those emission limit values because of an interruption in the supply of low-sulphur fuel resulting from a serious shortage.\nMember States shall inform the Commission, within one month, of any derogation granted under the first subparagraph.\n12.   The competent authority may grant a derogation from the obligation to comply with the emission limit values provided for in paragraphs 2 and 7 in cases where a medium combustion plant using only gaseous fuel has to resort exceptionally to the use of other fuels because of a sudden interruption in the supply of gas and, for this reason, would need to be equipped with secondary abatement equipment. The period for which such a derogation is granted shall not exceed ten days except where the operator demonstrates to the competent authority that a longer period is justified.\nMember States shall inform the Commission, within one month, of any derogation granted under the first subparagraph.\n13.   Where a medium combustion plant simultaneously uses two or more fuels, the emission limit value for each pollutant shall be calculated by:\n(a)\ntaking the emission limit value relevant for each individual fuel as set out in Annex II;\n(b)\ndetermining the fuel-weighted emission limit value, which is obtained by multiplying the individual emission limit value referred to in point (a) by the thermal input delivered by each fuel, and dividing the product of multiplication by the sum of the thermal inputs delivered by all fuels; and\n(c)\naggregating the fuel-weighted emission limit values.\nArticle 7\nObligations of the operator\n1.   Member States shall ensure that the operator carries out monitoring of emissions in accordance with, as a minimum, Part 1 of Annex III.\n2.   For medium combustion plants using multiple fuels, the monitoring of emissions shall be done while firing a fuel or fuel mix that is likely to result in the highest level of emissions and during a period representing normal operating conditions.\n3.   The operator shall keep a record of and process all monitoring results in such a way as to enable the verification of compliance with the emission limit values in accordance with the rules set out in Part 2 of Annex III.\n4.   For medium combustion plants using secondary abatement equipment in order to meet the emission limit values, the operator shall keep a record of, or information proving, the effective continuous operation of that equipment.\n5.   The operator of a medium combustion plant shall keep the following:\n(a)\nthe permit or the proof of registration by the competent authority and, if relevant, its updated version and related information;\n(b)\nthe monitoring results and information referred to in paragraphs 3 and 4;\n(c)\nwhere applicable, a record of operating hours as referred to in Article 6(3) and in Article 6(8);\n(d)\na record of the type and quantities of fuels used in the plant and of any malfunctions or breakdown of secondary abatement equipment;\n(e)\na record of the events of non-compliance and the measures taken, as referred to in paragraph 7.\nThe data and information referred to in points (b) to (e) of the first subparagraph shall be kept for a period of at least six years.\n6.   The operator shall, without undue delay, make available the data and information listed in paragraph 5 to the competent authority upon request. The competent authority may make such a request in order to allow the check of compliance with the requirements of this Directive. The competent authority shall make such a request if a member of the public requests access to the data or information listed in paragraph 5.\n7.   In the event of non-compliance with the emission limit values set out in Annex II, the operator shall take the measures necessary to ensure that compliance is restored within the shortest possible time, without prejudice to the measures required under Article 8. Member States shall lay down rules for the type, frequency and format of information concerning events of non-compliance to be provided by operators to the competent authority.\n8.   The operator shall provide the competent authority with all necessary assistance to enable it to carry out any inspections and site visits, to take samples and to gather any information necessary for the performance of its duties for the purposes of this Directive.\n9.

measuring systems shall be subject to checking by means of parallel measurements with the reference methods at least once per year and the operator shall inform the competent authority about the results of those checks.\n7.\nSampling and analysis of polluting substances and measurements of process parameters as well as any alternatives used as referred to under points 5 and 6 shall be based on methods enabling reliable, representative and comparable results. Methods complying with harmonised EN standards shall be presumed to satisfy this requirement. During each measurement, the plant shall be operating under stable conditions at a representative even load. In this context, start-up and shut-down periods shall be excluded.\nPART 2\nAssessment of compliance\n1.\nIn the case of periodic measurements, the emission limit values referred to in Article 6 shall be regarded as having been complied with if the results of each of the series of measurements or of the other procedures defined and determined in accordance with the rules laid down by the competent authority, do not exceed the relevant emission limit value.\n2.\nIn the case of continuous measurements, compliance with the emission limit values referred to in Article 6 shall be assessed as set out in point 1 of Part 4 of Annex V to Directive 2010/75/EU.\nThe validated average values are determined as set out in points 9 and 10 of Part 3 of Annex V to Directive 2010/75/EU.\n3.\nFor the purpose of the calculation of the average emission values, the values measured during the periods referred to in Article 6(11) and Article 6(12) as well as during the start-up and shut-down periods shall be disregarded.", "summary": "Air pollution from medium combustion plants\nAir pollution from medium combustion plants\nSUMMARY OF:\nDirective (EU) 2015/2193 on limiting emissions of certain pollutants into the air from medium combustion plants\nSUMMARY\nWHAT DOES THIS DIRECTIVE DO?\n              \nIt lays down rules to control air emissions of sulphur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx) and dust (particles) from medium combustion plants*, as well as rules to monitor carbon monoxide (CO) emissions from these plants.\nThe aim is to reduce potential harm to human health and the environment.\nKEY POINTS\nEU countries must ensure that:\nall new medium combustion plants, that is, plants put into operation after 19 December 2018, have a permit or are registered;\nby 1 January 2024, all existing plants with a rated thermal input (or capacity) greater than 5 megawatt (MW) have a permit or are registered;\nby 1 January 2029, all existing plants with a rated thermal input less than or equal to 5 MW have a permit or are registered.\nEach EU country’s competent authority must hold a publicly available register with information on each plant, such as the type of fuel used and expected number of annual operating hours.\nThe legislation sets out emission limit values by fuel category, distinguishing also between new and existing plants. Some plants may be exempted from the limits.\nThe limit values apply from 20 December 2018 for new plants and by 2025 or 2030 for existing plants, depending on their size.\nOperators of plants must:\nmonitor their emissions;\nmaintain a record, for at least 6 years, of the results of emission monitoring, of operating hours, type and quantities of fuel used and details of any malfunction or breakdown.\nEU countries must:\nestablish effective inspections to check compliance with emission limit values;\nby 1 January 2021, submit a report to the European Commission with an estimate of the total amount of annual emissions of CO;\nby 1 October 2026, provide the Commission with qualitative and quantitative information on the directive's implementation. This must include estimated total annual emissions of SO2, NOx and dust (particles) from plants, according to their type, fuel used and capacity;\nby 1 October 2031, provide the Commission with a second report on implementation.\nThe Commission will:\nsubmit a summary report to the European Parliament and the Council within 12 months of receiving the national reports on implementation;\nby 1 January 2020, review the progress in relation to energy efficiency of medium combustion plants and assess the benefits of setting minimum energy efficiency standards;\nby 1 January 2023, assess whether aspects of the legislation should be reviewed, including the need to set more stringent emission limit values for new plants and regulate CO emissions.\nThe directive does not apply to certain combustion plants, such as\ncoke battery furnaces;\ngas turbines and engines used offshore;\nreactors used in the chemical industry; and\nplants already covered by other EU legislation regulating their emissions, such as Directive 2010/75/EU on industrial emissions (integrated pollution prevention and control).\nThe directive does not apply to ancillary research, development and testing activities.\nFROM WHEN DOES THE DIRECTIVE APPLY?\n              \nIt applies from 18 December 2015. EU countries have to incorporate it into national law by 19 December 2017.\nBACKGROUND\n              \nThe legislation fills the regulatory gap between large combustion plants (over 50 megawatts) which are covered by the industrial emissions directive and smaller appliances, such as heaters and boilers, which come under the Ecodesign directive.\nMedium combustion plants are used for a wide variety of applications (electricity generation, domestic/residential heating and cooling, providing heat/steam for industrial processes, etc.).\nFor more information, see ‘The Medium Combustion Plant (MCP) Directive’ on the European Commission’s website.\nKEY TERM\n* Medium combustion plant: a plant which burns fuel and uses the heat generated, with a rated thermal input equal to or greater than 1 MW and less than 50 MW, irrespective of the type of fuel it uses.\nACT\n            \nDirective (EU) 2015/2193 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 November 2015 on the limitation of emissions of certain pollutants into the air from medium combustion plants (OJ L 313, 28.11.2015, pp. 1–19)\nRELATED ACTS\n            \nDirective 2010/75/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 November 2010 on industrial emissions (integrated pollution prevention and control) (OJ L 334, 17.12.2010, pp. 17–119)\nSuccessive amendments to Directive 2010/75/EU have been incorporated in the original text.
