    \nIt sets out the capital requirements for currencies pegged to the euro.\nKEY POINTS\n              \nDirective 2009/138/EC, known as the Solvency 2 Directive, requires insurance companies to have enough own funds to withstand significant financial difficulties by meeting certain capital requirements.\nCommission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/35 spells out these requirements in greater detail. In particular, insurance companies must have sufficient funds to cover any loss they may experience from either a 25% increase or decrease in the value of a foreign currency against the local currency.\nThis regulation, Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2015/2017:\nreplaces the 25% factor by lower percentages, ranging from 0.39% to 4.27%;\ncontains the adjusted factors for currency risk where the local or foreign currency is the euro, or is pegged to the euro;\napplies to the Danish krone, the Bulgarian lev, the West African and Central African CFA francs and the Comorian franc.\nFROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?\n              \nIt applies from 2 December 2015.\nBACKGROUND\n              \nThe European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA) supports coordination between national authorities and contributes to ensuring the consistent application of EU laws for the insurance and occupational pension sectors in EU countries.\nEIOPA consulted widely on the technical standards contained in the regulation, analysing the potential related costs and benefits and presented its proposal to the European Commission for adoption.\nFor more information, see:\nRisk management and supervision of insurance companies (Solvency 2) (European Commission)\nSolvency II (European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority).\nMAIN DOCUMENT\n            \nCommission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2015/2017 of 11 November 2015 laying down implementing technical standards with regard to the adjusted factors to calculate the capital requirement for currency risk for currencies pegged to the euro in accordance with Directive 2009/138/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (OJ L 295, 12.11.2015, pp. 21-22)\nRELATED DOCUMENTS\n            \nCommission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/35 of 10 October 2014 supplementing Directive 2009/138/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on the taking-up and pursuit of the business of Insurance and Reinsurance (Solvency II) (OJ L 12, 17.1.2015, pp. 1-797)\nSuccessive amendments to Regulation (EU) 2015/35 have been incorporated into the basic text.
