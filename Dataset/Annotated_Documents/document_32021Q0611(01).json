{"celex_id": "32021Q0611(01)", "reference": "11.6.2021\nEN\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\nL 207/1\nINTERINSTITUTIONAL AGREEMENT\nof 20 May 2021\nbetween the European Parliament, the Council of the European Union and the European Commission on a mandatory transparency register\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT, THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION AND THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 295 thereof,\nHaving regard to the Treaty establishing the European Atomic Energy Community, and in particular Article 106a thereof,\nWhereas:\n(1)\nThe European Parliament, the Council of the European Union and the European Commission (‘the signatory institutions’) maintain an open, transparent and regular dialogue with representative associations and civil society in accordance with the Treaty on European Union (TEU), and in particular Article 11(1) and (2) thereof.\n(2)\nThat dialogue enables stakeholders to present their views on decisions that may affect them and hence to contribute effectively to the evidence base on which policy proposals are made. Engaging with stakeholders enhances the quality of decision-making by providing channels for external views and expertise to be given.\n(3)\nTransparency and accountability are essential for maintaining the trust of Union citizens in the legitimacy of the political, legislative and administrative processes of the Union.\n(4)\nThe signatory institutions recognise the importance of coordinating their approach through the adoption of a joint framework for their cooperation, in order to further promote interest representation that is transparent and ethical.\n(5)\nTransparency concerning interest representation is especially important in order to allow citizens to follow the activities and be aware of the potential influence of interest representatives, including influence exercised through financial support and sponsorship. Such transparency is best ensured by means of a code of conduct which contains the rules and principles to be observed by interest representatives that sign up to a transparency register (the ‘register’).\n(6)\nIn view of the positive experience with the transparency register for organisations and self-employed individuals engaged in EU policy-making and policy implementation established by the agreement between the European Parliament and the European Commission of 16 April 2014 (1) (‘the 2014 Agreement’), the signatory institutions consider that the scope of the 2014 Agreement should be expanded.\n(7)\nIt is necessary to make the register mandatory by putting in place, by means of individual decisions adopted by each of the signatory institutions, measures of equivalent effect that make registration of interest representatives in the register a necessary precondition for carrying out certain types of interest representation activities.\n(8)\nIn order to further strengthen the joint framework and build on the progress made in establishing a common transparency culture, the signatory institutions should publish on the website of the register conditionality and complementary transparency measures that they put in place to encourage registration, such as dedicated mailing lists, the recommendation that certain decision-makers meet only registered interest representatives, or the publication of information on meetings between certain decision-makers and interest representatives.\n(9)\nIn order to promote this Agreement beyond the signatory institutions, it should provide for arrangements that allow Union institutions, bodies, offices and agencies, other than the signatory institutions, and Member States’ permanent representations that voluntarily wish to apply the operating principles of the joint framework to benefit from the assistance of the secretariat of the register and its helpdesk support.\n(10)\nIn order to avoid an unnecessary administrative burden and in line with current practice as regards registration, activities carried out by interest representatives exclusively on behalf of an association or network of which they are part should be considered to be activities of that network or association.\n(11)\nActivities of public authorities of Member States, as well as of any association or network of such public authorities that acts on their behalf at Union, national or subnational level, should not be covered by this Agreement, although associations and networks of public authorities at Union, national or subnational level engaging in interest representation activities should be allowed to register.\n(12)\nThe practice of adopting an annual report on the functioning of the register should be maintained as a tool to ensure appropriate visibility for the coordinated approach of the signatory institutions and to bolster citizens’ trust. The scope of the annual report should be expanded to cover conditionality and complementary transparency measures put in place by the signatory institutions.\n(13)\nThe functioning of the register should not impinge on the competences of any of the signatory institutions or affect their respective powers of internal organisation.\n(14)\nIn the exercise of their respective powers of internal organisation, the signatory institutions should delegate to the secretariat and the management board of the register the power to act on their behalf for the adoption of individual decisions concerning applicants and registrants, in accordance with this Agreement. The signatory institutions should be co-defendants in any legal action brought before the Court of Justice of the European Union against final decisions of the management board of the register that adversely affect applicants or registrants.\n(15)\nThe signatory institutions should act in mutual sincere cooperation in implementing this Agreement.\n(16)\nAny of the signatory institutions should be able to pursue other good governance and transparency policies outside the framework of this Agreement, to the extent that such policies do not interfere with the implementation of and the objectives pursued by this Agreement.\n(17)\nThis Agreement is without prejudice to the exercise of rights under Article 11(4) TEU, concerning the European citizens’ initiative, and Article 227 of the Treaty on the functioning of the European Union (TFEU), concerning the right to petition the European Parliament,\nAGREE AS FOLLOWS:\nArticle 1\nPurpose and scope\nThis Agreement establishes a framework and operating principles for a coordinated approach on the part of the signatory institutions as regards transparent and ethical interest representation.\nBy means of individual decisions taken on the basis of their powers of internal organisation, the signatory institutions agree to implement the coordinated approach referred to in the first paragraph with regard to the activities covered by this Agreement (‘covered activities’) and to set out those covered activities that they decide to make conditional upon registration in the register.\nArticle 2\nDefinitions\nFor the purposes of this Agreement, the following definitions apply:\n(a)\n‘interest representative’ means any natural or legal person, or formal or informal group, association or network, that engages in covered activities;\n(b)\n‘applicant’ means any interest representative that applies to be entered in the register;\n(c)\n‘registrant’ means any interest representative with an entry in the register;\n(d)\n‘client’ means any interest representative that has entered into a contractual relationship with an intermediary for the purpose of that intermediary advancing that interest representative’s interests by carrying out covered activities;\n(e)\n‘intermediary’ means any interest representative that advances the interests of a client by carrying out covered activities;\n(f)\n‘client-intermediary relationship’ means any contractual relationship between a client and an intermediary concerning the carrying out of covered activities;\n(g)\n‘staff’ means staff subject to the Staff Regulations of Officials of the European Union and the Conditions of Employment of Other Servants of the Union, laid down in Council Regulation (EEC, Euratom, ECSC) No 259/68 (2), employed by any of the signatory institutions, irrespective of the category to which they belong;\n(h)\n‘conditionality’ means the principle whereby registration in the register is a necessary precondition for interest representatives to be able to carry out certain covered activities.\nArticle 3\nCovered activities\n1.

To that end, they adopt conditionality measures by means of individual decisions on the basis of their powers of internal organisation. The signatory institutions may further adopt complementary transparency measures to encourage registration and strengthen the joint framework.\nInterest representatives that apply to be entered in the register must:\nprovide a wide range of information listed in Annex II to the agreement and agree to make that information publicly available, notably: their name, contact details, staff numbers, legal representative and interests represented, along with the organisations or entities of which the registrant is a member and the registrant’s members,the EU legislative proposals, policies or initiatives they target, membership of Commission expert groups and other EU-supported forums and platforms or of intergroups or other unofficial groupings of Members of the European Parliament (MEPs),financial information, including, within specific bands, annual costs of their activities, costs for intermediaries carrying out activities on their behalf, revenue from individual clients (for intermediaries) or total budget and sources of funding (for registrants that do not represent commercial interests);\nobserve the code of conduct set out in Annex I to the agreement, with its 16 rules and principles, which requires that registrants: declare the interests and objectives they promote and specify the clients or members whom they represent,not obtain or try to obtain information dishonestly or persuade MEPs, members of the Commission or EU staff to break the rules and standards of behaviour applicable to them,not abuse their registration for commercial gain,ensure the information they provide for registration purposes is complete, up to date and accurate.\nThe agreement establishes:\na management board of the register — consisting of the secretaries-general of the signatory institutions — to: determine the register’s priorities and the budget and share required for the implementation of those priorities,adopt an annual report and oversee the overall implementation of the agreement;\na secretariat of the register — consisting of the heads of unit responsible for transparency issues in the signatory institutions and their staff — to manage the register, which involves: establishing guidelines for registrants and providing help-desk support to applicants and registrants,deciding upon the eligibility of applicants and monitoring the content of the register,carrying out investigations and applying measures in accordance with the procedure in Annex III to the agreement.\nThe management board and the secretariat of the register are empowered to adopt, on behalf of the signatory institutions, individual decisions concerning applicants and registrants.\nThe signatory institutions ensure the secretariat of the register has the necessary human, administrative, technical and financial resources.\nOther EU institutions, bodies, offices and agencies and Member States (for their permanent representations) may notify the management board of the register of measures they take to make certain activities conditional upon registration in the register or of any complementary transparency measures they take on a voluntary basis.\nConditionality and complementary transparency measures adopted by the signatory institutions and other EU institutions, bodies, offices or agencies or Member States (for their permanent representations) are made public on the website of the register.\nThe agreement replaces its 2014 predecessor and will be reviewed no later than 2 July 2025.\nFROM WHEN DOES THE AGREEMENT ENTER INTO FORCE?\n              \nIt has been in force since 1 July 2021.\nBACKGROUND\nThe agreement is complemented by a political statement of the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission: recognising the importance of the principle of conditionality and emphasising the aim of the three institutions’ coordinated approach, namely to reinforce a common transparency culture, while setting high standards of transparent and ethical interest representation at the EU level;listing the conditionality and complementary transparency measures already in place for each of the signatory institutions that are acknowledged to be consistent with the agreement.\nIn addition, the Council adopted a decision on 6 May 2021 establishing the rules for contact between its general secretariat and interest representatives.\nThe agreement replaces a 2014 agreement between the European Parliament and the Commission (the Council was an observer) on a transparency register for organisations and self-employed individuals engaged in EU policymaking and policy implementation.\nIt expands the scope of the previous register and makes the registration of interest representatives in the transparency register a prerequisite for certain interest representation activities, such as meeting certain decision-makers or staff of the signatory institutions or getting access to the institutions’ premises.\nFor further information, see:\nTransparency register (European Commission).\nKEY TERMS\n              \nInterest representative.
