{"celex_id": "32009R0663", "reference": "31.7.2009\nEN\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\nL 200/31\nREGULATION (EC) No 663/2009 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL\nof 13 July 2009\nestablishing a programme to aid economic recovery by granting Community financial assistance to projects in the field of energy\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 156 and Article 175(1) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the Commission,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee (1),\nAfter consulting the Committee of the Regions,\nActing in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty (2),\nWhereas:\n(1)\nThe European economy is facing a sharp downturn resulting from the financial crisis. Extraordinary and immediate efforts are needed to counter this serious and unprecedented economic situation. In order to restore confidence among market players, measures impacting on the economy need to be finalised without delay.\n(2)\nAt the same time it is clear that the long-term strength and sustainability of the European economy depend on reshaping it to face the demands of energy security and the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Increasing concerns about securing reliable gas supplies reinforce this conclusion.\n(3)\nIn light of these concerns, the European Council of 11 and 12 December 2008 endorsed in its conclusions the European Economic Recovery Plan (Recovery Plan), presented by the Commission on 26 November 2008, which sets out how Member States and the European Union can coordinate their policies and provide new stimulus to the European economy, targeting that stimulus to the Community’s long-term objectives.\n(4)\nAn important part of the Recovery Plan is the proposal to increase Community spending in defined strategic sectors, so as to address the lack of confidence among investors and to help develop the path to a stronger economy for the future. The European Council asked the Commission to present a list of specific projects, taking into account an adequate geographical balance, to reinforce investment in the development of, in particular, infrastructure projects.\n(5)\nFor the Recovery Plan to be effective, it is vital to finance measures that rapidly address both the economic crisis and the Community’s urgent energy needs. Nevertheless, the special programme established by this Regulation should in no way set a precedent for future co-financing rates in the field of infrastructure investments.\n(6)\nIn order to have a tangible and substantial impact, those measures should be focussed on a few specific sectors in which action would make a clear contribution to the objectives of the security of energy supply and the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions; there exist large, mature projects capable of making efficient and effective use of significant amounts of financial assistance and of catalysing significant amounts of investment from other sources, including from the European Investment Bank; and action at European level would add value. The sectors of gas and electricity infrastructure, offshore wind energy and carbon capture and storage fulfil those criteria. The choice of those sectors reflects the particular circumstances of the Recovery Plan and should not call into question the high priority attached to energy efficiency and the promotion of energy from renewable sources, which were addressed in the Recovery Plan.\n(7)\nIn the event that it is not possible to commit all funds by the end of 2010, the Commission has declared its intention, if appropriate, to propose, when reporting in 2010 on the implementation of this Regulation, measures allowing for the financing of projects consistent with the Recovery Plan, such as projects in the areas of energy efficiency and energy from renewable sources.\n(8)\nIn the case of gas and electricity infrastructures, certain challenges have developed in recent years. The recent gas crises (winters 2006 and 2009) and the increase of oil prices until mid-2008 demonstrated Europe’s vulnerability. Indigenous energy resources — gas and oil — are decreasing to the extent that Europe is increasingly dependent on imports for its energy supply. In this context, energy infrastructure will play a crucial role.\n(9)\nHowever, the current economic and financial crisis is affecting the implementation of energy infrastructure projects. Some important projects, including projects of Community interest, may face severe delays in implementation due to scarcity of funds. Urgent action to support investment in energy infrastructure is therefore appropriate. Given the significant time necessary to plan and then execute such projects, it is important that the Community invest in such infrastructure immediately so that it may, in particular, accelerate the development of projects of particular importance to the security of energy supply within the Community. This will be vital to ensure the Community’s security of energy supply at competitive prices when the economy rebounds and global energy demand increases.\n(10)\nAmong energy infrastructure projects, it is necessary to select those that are important to the operation of the internal energy market, to the security of energy supply and which also contribute to the recovery of the economy.\n(11)\nIn the cases of carbon capture and storage and offshore wind energy in particular, this Regulation should build on the Strategic Energy Technology Plan for Europe, presented by the Commission on 22 November 2007, which called for a joint and strategic plan for energy research and innovation efforts consistent with EU energy policy goals, and a commitment to the establishment of six European Industrial Initiatives. The European Council of 16 October 2008 called in its conclusions on the Commission to significantly accelerate the implementation of the Strategic Energy Technology Plan for Europe. The programme initiates the funding for carbon capture and storage and offshore wind projects without prejudice to the future creation of the six industrial initiatives on energy demonstration projects as outlined by the Strategic Energy Technology Plan for Europe.\n(12)\nIn order to have an immediate impact on the economic crisis, it is essential for this Regulation to list the projects that may receive immediate financial assistance, subject to conformity with criteria that ensure efficiency and effectiveness and to the limits set by the financial envelope.\n(13)\nIn the case of gas and electricity infrastructure projects, a list should be established according to the project’s contribution to the objectives of security and diversification of supply as identified in the Commission’s Second Strategic Energy Review of 13 November 2008 and endorsed by the European Parliament in its resolution of 3 February 2009 and by the Council in its conclusions of 19 February 2009. Projects should be selected on the basis that they implement the priorities identified in that Review, have achieved a reasonable degree of maturity, and contribute to security and diversification of sources of energy and supplies; optimisation of the capacity of the network and the integration of the internal energy market, in particular concerning cross-border sections; development of the network to strengthen economic and social cohesion by reducing the isolation of the least favoured regions or islands of the Community; connection of renewable energy resources; safety, reliability and interoperability of interconnected networks; and solidarity among Member States. The implementation of those projects will require a commitment from national, regional and local authorities to accelerate administrative procedures and authorisations. For many projects, support will not be forthcoming within the timeframe set if this acceleration does not take place.\n(14)\nIn the case of offshore wind energy, the list should contain projects that can be considered, on the basis of information gathered from stakeholders in the framework of the European Wind Energy Technology Platform, and from industrial and other sources, to be approved and ready for implementation; to be innovative, while building on well established concepts; to be capable of acceleration in response to a financial stimulus; to have a cross-border significance; to be of a large scale; and to be able to demonstrate how the results of technological advances will be disseminated effectively in the light of the objectives and structures endorsed by the Strategic Energy Technology Plan for Europe. Financial assistance should be directed towards those projects that are in a position to progress substantially with project development in 2009 and 2010.\n(15)\nIn the case of carbon capture and storage, the list should be largely established on the basis of information gathered from stakeholders in the framework of the Fossil Fuel Forum, the Zero Emissions Fossil Fuel Power Plants Technology Platform and other sources. Financial assistance should be directed towards those projects that are in a position to progress substantially with project development in 2009 and 2010. Readiness should be assessed on the basis of the existence of a mature and feasible concept for the industrial installation, including its carbon capture component; the existence of a mature and feasible concept for the transport and storage of CO2; and a clear commitment on the part of local authorities to support the project. Projects should also demonstrate how the results of technological advances will be disseminated effectively and how they will accelerate the achievement of the objectives laid down in the Strategic Energy Technology Plan for Europe.\n(16)\nIt will be necessary to select among eligible proposals. Such selection should guarantee, inter alia, that no more than one carbon capture and storage proposal is supported in each Member State, in order to ensure the investigation of a wide range of geological storage conditions and to support the objective of encouraging economic recovery across Europe.\n(17)\nCommunity funding should not unduly distort competition or the functioning of the internal market, having regard in particular to the rules on third-party access and possible third party access exemptions. Any further national funds in addition to Community funding should take into account State aid rules. Regardless of its form, Community financial assistance should be granted in accordance with the provisions of Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002 of 25 June 2002 on the Financial Regulation applicable to the general budget of the European Communities (3) (the Financial Regulation) and of Commission Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 2342/2002 of 23 December 2002 laying down detailed rules for the implementation of Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002 on the Financial Regulation applicable to the general budget of the European Communities (4), except where the provisions of this Regulation explicitly depart from those rules.\n(18)\nDue to the urgent need to address the economic crisis and the Community’s pressing energy needs, this Regulation already contains detailed provisions concerning the arrangements for financial assistance, including a list of eligible projects. In addition, due to the urgent need for the stimulus, all legal commitments implementing the budgetary commitments made in 2009 and 2010 should be made before the end of 2010.\n(19)\nWhen actions financed under this Regulation are implemented, the financial interests of the Community should be protected by the application of preventive measures against fraud, corruption and any other illegal activities, by effective checks and by the recovery of amounts unduly paid and, if irregularities are detected, by effective, proportionate and dissuasive penalties, in accordance with Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 2988/95 of 18 December 1995 on the protection of the European Communities financial interests (5), Council Regulation (Euratom, EC) No 2185/96 of 11 November 1996 concerning on-the-spot checks and inspections carried out by the Commission in order to protect the European Communities’ financial interests against fraud and other irregularities (6) and with Regulation (EC) No 1073/1999 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 May 1999 concerning investigations conducted by the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) (7).\n(20)\nTaking into account the nature of the issues in the sub-programmes, the Commission should be assisted by different committees for the selection of proposals retained for funding and the determination of the amount of funding to be granted under each sub-programme.\n(21)\nThe measures necessary for the implementation of this Regulation should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission (8).\n(22)\nSince the objectives of this Regulation, namely to aid economic recovery within the Community, face the demands of energy security and reduce greenhouse gas emissions by increasing spending in defined strategic sectors, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States, and can therefore, by reason of the scope of this Regulation and the nature of the sectors and projects selected, be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives.\n(23)\nDue to the urgent need to address the economic crisis and the Community’s pressing energy needs, this Regulation should enter into force immediately after its publication,\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nCHAPTER I\nINTRODUCTORY PROVISIONS\nArticle 1\nSubject matter\nThis Regulation establishes a financing instrument entitled the European Energy Programme for Recovery (the EEPR) for the development of projects in the field of energy in the Community which, by providing a financial stimulus, contribute to economic recovery, the security of energy supply and the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.\nThis Regulation establishes sub-programmes to advance those objectives in the fields of:\n(a)\ngas and electricity infrastructures;\n(b)\noffshore wind energy; and\n(c)\ncarbon capture and storage.\nThis Regulation identifies projects to be financed under each sub-programme and lays down criteria for identifying and implementing actions to realise these projects.\nArticle 2\nDefinitions\nFor the purposes of this Regulation, the following definitions shall apply:\n(a)\n‘carbon capture and storage’ means the capture of carbon dioxide (CO2) from industrial installations, its transport to a storage site and its injection into a suitable underground geological formation for the purposes of permanent storage;\n(b)\n‘eligible costs’ has the same meaning as in Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 2342/2002;\n(c)\n‘gas and electricity infrastructures’ means:\n(i)\nall high-voltage lines, excluding those of distribution networks, and submarine links, provided that this infrastructure is used for interregional or international transmission or connection;\n(ii)\nhigh-pressure gas pipelines, excluding those of distribution networks;\n(iii)\nunderground storage facilities connected to the high-pressure gas pipelines referred to in point (ii);\n(iv)\nreception, storage and regasification facilities for liquefied natural gas (LNG); and\n(v)\nany equipment or installations essential for the infrastructure referred to in points (i), (ii), (iii) or (iv) to operate properly, including protection, monitoring and control systems;\n(d)\n‘part of a project’ means any activity that is independent financially, technically or over time and which contributes to the completion of a project;\n(e)\n‘investment phase’ means the phase of a project during which construction takes place and capital costs are incurred;\n(f)\n‘offshore wind energy’ means the electric power generated from turbine engines powered by wind and situated in the sea, whether near or far from the shore;\n(g)\n‘planning phase’ means the phase of a project that precedes the investment phase, during which project implementation is prepared, and includes, where appropriate, feasibility assessment, preparatory and technical studies, obtaining licences and authorisations and incurring capital costs.\nArticle 3\nBudget\n1.

In this respect, the Regulation will contribute to these priorities by giving substantial support to offshore wind projects.\nThe Commission recalls in this context the various other new initiatives supporting energy efficiency and renewable energy sources, suggested by the Commission notably in its European Recovery Plan, which was endorsed by the European Council of December 2008. These include:\nA modification to the ERDF Regulation to allow investments up to EUR 8 billion in energy efficiency and renewable energies in housing in all the Member States.\nA public-private partnership on a ‘European energy-efficient buildings’ initiative to promote green technologies and the development of energy-efficient systems and materials in new and renovated buildings. The estimated envelope for this action is EUR 1 billion: EUR 500 million from existing EC FP7 budget over the years 2010 to 2013 and EUR 500 million from industry.\nThe EC-EIB initiative ‘EU Sustainable Energy Financing Initiative’. It aims at enabling investments for energy efficiency and renewable energy projects in urban settings. The Commission finances a technical assistance facility from the Intelligent Energy Europe programme (annual allocation of 15 M EUR for 2009). This facility, managed by the EIB, will facilitate access to EIB loans with substantial leverage effects.\nThe creation by EU institutional investors — led by the EIB — of a market oriented equity fund, called Marguerite: the 2020 European Fund for Energy, Climate Change and Infrastructure. This Fund would invest in the areas of energy and climate change (TEN-E, sustainable energy production, renewable energy, new technologies, energy efficiency investments, security of supply, as well as environmental infrastructure). The Commission supports this initiative.\nFurthermore, the Commission will present before the end of November 2009 the revision of the energy efficiency action plan as demanded by Council (Conclusions of the European Council of March 2009) and Parliament (EP Resolution P6_TA(2009)0064).\nThere is agreement among experts that energy efficiency is the cheapest available option to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The Commission will provide by November 2009 a detailed analysis of the obstacles for increased energy efficiency investments. It will in particular examine whether there is a need for increased financial incentives in the form of low-interest loans and/or grants, how the European budget could be used to this end, and, if appropriate, the Commission will include, inter alia, additional funds for financing of energy efficiency in the new EU Energy Security and Infrastructure Instrument, to be presented in 2010.\nWhen reviewing the energy efficiency action plan, the Commission will pay particular attention to the neighbourhood dimension of energy efficiency. It will analyze how it can give financial and regulatory incentives to neighbourhood countries to step up their investments in energy efficiency.\nShould the Commission, when reporting in 2010 on the implementation of the Regulation under its Article 28, find that it will not be possible to commit by the end of 2010 a part of the funds foreseen for the projects listed in the annex to the Regulation, the Commission will propose, if appropriate and in a geographically balanced way, an amendment to the Regulation allowing for the financing of projects in the area of energy efficiency and renewable energy sources, in addition to the above initiatives, including eligibility criteria similar to those applying to projects listed in the Annex to this Regulation.\nStatement by Portugal\nPortugal is voting in favour, although in its view, in a review of the programme under Article 28, consideration should be given to the inclusion of renewable-energy and energy-efficiency projects, particularly for microgeneration and for smart grids and meters, to help achieve the objectives in Article 4(a) and (b) of the Regulation.", "summary": "European energy programme for recovery\nEuropean energy programme for recovery\nSUMMARY OF:\nRegulation (EC) No 663/2009 — programme to aid economic recovery by granting EU financial assistance to projects in the field of energy\nWHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?\n              \nIt sets up the European energy programme for recovery (EEPR) to fund projects in key areas of the energy sector:\ngas and electricity infrastructures*;\noffshore wind energy*; and\ncarbon capture and storage*.\nIt was established to support the EU’s:\neconomic recovery from the 2008 economic and financial crisis; and\nenergy policy objectives.\nKEY POINTS\n              \nThe programme finances gas and electricity infrastructure projects which aim to:\nsecure and diversify sources of energy and supplies;\nmake the interoperability (i.e. the interconnection) of networks safe and reliable;\ndevelop and optimise the capacity of the network; and\nconnect renewables to the energy grid or network.\nOffshore wind projects are given funding when they meet certain criteria which take into account the construction of the infrastructure, the innovative features of the project and the project’s contribution to the existing wind energy grid.\nCarbon capture and storage projects are given funding when the project demonstrates that it can capture at least 80 % of carbon dioxide (CO2) in industrial installations.\nThe programme’s budget totals €3.98 billion, broken down as follows:\n€2.3 billion going to gas (€1.4bn) and electricity (€910 million) infrastructure projects;\n€565 million to offshore wind projects;\n€15 million to two small island projects;\n€1.05 billion to 13 carbon capture and storage projects;\n€146 million to the programme’s financial instrument, later set up under Regulation (EU) No 1233/2010 which amended Regulation (EC) No 663/2009 to support projects relating to energy efficiency.\nThe European Energy Efficiency Fund, established in 2011, took over the role of allocating money to projects that support energy efficiency. It supports projects concerning:\npublic and private buildings incorporating energy efficiency and/or renewable energy solutions, including those using information and communication technologies (ICTs);\ninvestments in high energy-efficient combined heat and power, including micro-cogeneration, and district heating/cooling networks, in particular from renewable energy sources;\ndecentralised renewable energy sources embedded in local settings and their integration in electricity grids;\nmicro-generation from renewable energy sources;\nclean urban transport supporting increased energy efficiency and integrating renewable energy sources (public transport, electric and hydrogen vehicles);\nlocal infrastructure, including efficient public outdoor lighting such as street lighting, electricity storage solutions, smart metering, and smart grids, that make full use of ICTs;\nenergy efficiency and renewable energy technologies with innovation and economic potential using the best available procedures.\nReports\nThe European Commission publishes reports every year on the EEPR’s implementation. A report on the EEPR published in 2018 after 7 years of implementation shows that:\n35 out of 44 gas and electricity infrastructure projects have been completed;\n4 out of 9 offshore wind projects are operational; but\nonly 1 of the 6 carbon capture and storage projects has been completed and 3 have been terminated prematurely.\nFROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?\n              \nIt has applied since 1 August 2009.\nBACKGROUND\n              \nThe EEPR forms part of the economic recovery plan, established to remedy the effects of the financial and energy crisis that affected the European economy in 2008.\nFor more information, see:\nObjective of the fund (European Energy Efficiency Fund)\nEuropean Energy Programme for Recovery — projects (European Commission)\nEnergy — funding (European Commission).\nKEY TERMS\n              \nGas and electricity infrastructures:all high-voltage lines, other than distribution networks, and underwater links, provided that this infrastructure is used for interregional or international transmission or connection;high-pressure gas pipelines, excluding those of distribution networks;underground storage facilities connected to the high-pressure gas pipelines;reception, storage and regasification facilities for liquefied natural gas; andany equipment or installations essential for the above forms of infrastructure to operate properly, including protection, monitoring and control systems.\nOffshore wind projects: wind farms out at sea.\nCarbon capture and storage: a way of reducing the effect of climate change, consisting of the capture of CO2 from industrial installations, its transport to a storage site and its injection into underground geological formations.\nMAIN DOCUMENT\n            \nRegulation (EC) No 663/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 July 2009 establishing a programme to aid economic recovery by granting Community financial assistance to projects in the field of energy (OJ L 200, 31.7.2009, pp. 31-45)\nSuccessive amendments to Regulation (EC) No 663/2009 have been incorporated in the original text.
