Since further amendments are to be made, it should be recast in the interests of clarity.\n(2)\nDifferences between national laws relating to extraction solvents hinder the free movement of foodstuffs and may create conditions of unequal competition, thereby directly affecting the functioning of the internal market.\n(3)\nThe approximation of those laws is therefore necessary if the free movement of foodstuffs is to be achieved.\n(4)\nLaws relating to extraction solvents for use in foodstuffs should take account primarily of human health requirements but also, within the limits required for the protection of health, of economic and technical needs.\n(5)\nSuch approximation should involve the establishment of a single list of extraction solvents for the preparation of foodstuffs or food ingredients. General purity criteria should also be specified.\n(6)\nThe use of an extraction solvent under conditions of good manufacturing practice should result in the removal of all or the major part of the solvent residues from the foodstuff or food ingredient.\n(7)\nUnder such conditions, the presence of residues or derivatives in the final foodstuff or food ingredient may be unintentional but technically unavoidable.\n(8)\nAlthough in general a specific limitation is useful, it need not be laid down for substances listed in Part I of Annex I which have been found acceptable from the point of view of safety to the consumer when used under conditions of good manufacturing practice.\n(9)\nTo take account of protection of public health, the conditions of use of other extraction solvents listed in Parts II and III of Annex I and maximum residue values permitted in food and food ingredients should be established.\n(10)\nSpecific purity criteria for extraction solvents and methods of analysis and sampling of extraction solvents in and on foodstuffs should be established.\n(11)\nShould the use of an extraction solvent provided for in this Directive appear to constitute a health risk as a result of new information, Member States should be able to suspend or limit such use, or to reduce existing limits, pending a decision at Community level.\n(12)\nThe measures necessary for the implementation of this Directive should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission (5).\n(13)\nIn particular, the Commission should be empowered to amend the list of extraction solvents which may be used during the processing of the raw materials, of foodstuffs, of food components or of food ingredients, and the specification of their conditions of use and maximum residue limits, and to adopt specific purity criteria for extraction solvents and the methods of analysis necessary to verify compliance with the general and specific purity criteria as well as methods of analysis and sampling of extraction solvents in and on foodstuffs. Since those measures are of general scope and are designed to amend non-essential elements of this Directive, inter alia, by supplementing it with new non-essential elements, they must be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny provided for in Article 5a of Decision 1999/468/EC.\n(14)\nOn grounds of efficiency, the normal time-limits for the regulatory procedure with scrutiny should be curtailed for the adoption of amendments of the list of extraction solvents which may be used during the processing of the raw materials, of foodstuffs, of food components or of food ingredients, and the specification of their conditions of use and maximum residue limits, and for the adoption of specific purity criteria for extraction solvents.\n(15)\nWhen, on imperative grounds of urgency, in particular where a risk to human health exists, the normal time-limits for the regulatory procedure with scrutiny cannot be complied with, the Commission should be able to apply the urgency procedure provided for in Article 5a(6) of Decision 1999/468/EC for the adoption of amendments of the list of extraction solvents which may be used during the processing of the raw materials, of foodstuffs, of food components or of food ingredients, and the specification of their conditions of use and maximum residue limits, and for the adoption of specific purity criteria for extraction solvents, as well as for the adoption of amendments to this Directive when it is established that the use in foodstuffs of any substance listed in Annex I or the level of one or more of the components referred to in Article 3 contained in such substances might endanger human health although it complies with the conditions laid down in this Directive.\n(16)\nThe new elements introduced into this Directive only concern the committee procedures. They therefore do not need to be transposed by the Member States.\n(17)\nThis Directive should be without prejudice to the obligations of the Member States relating to the time-limits for transposition into national law of the Directives set out in Annex II, Part B,\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:\nArticle 1\n1.   This Directive applies to extraction solvents used or intended for use in the production of foodstuffs or food ingredients.\nThis Directive shall not apply to extraction solvents used in the production of food additives, vitamins and other nutritional additives, unless such food additives, vitamins or nutritional additives are listed in Annex I.\nHowever, the Member States shall ensure that the use of food additives, vitamins and other nutritional additives does not result in foodstuffs containing extraction solvent residue levels dangerous to human health.\nThis Directive shall apply without prejudice to the provisions adopted under more specific Community rules.\n2.   For the purposes of this Directive:\n(a)\n‘solvent’ means any substance for dissolving a foodstuff or any component thereof, including any contaminant present in or on that foodstuff;\n(b)\n‘extraction solvent’ means a solvent which is used in an extraction procedure during the processing of raw materials, of foodstuffs, or of components or ingredients of these products and which is removed but which may result in the unintentional, but technically unavoidable, presence of residues or derivatives in the foodstuff or food ingredient.\nArticle 2\n1.   Member States shall authorise the use as extraction solvents in the manufacture of foodstuffs or food ingredients of those substances and materials listed in Annex I, under the conditions of use and where appropriate within the maximum residue limits specified in that Annex.\nMember States may not prohibit, restrict or obstruct the marketing of foodstuffs or food ingredients on grounds relating to the extraction solvents used or their residues if these comply with the provisions of this Directive.\n2.   Member States shall not authorise the use of other substances and materials as extraction solvents, nor extend the conditions of use or permitted residues of the extraction solvents listed in Annex I beyond those specified therein.\n3.   Water to which substances regulating acidity or alkalinity may have been added and other food substances which possess solvent properties are authorised as extraction solvents in the manufacture of foodstuffs or food ingredients.\nArticle 3\nMember States shall take all necessary measures to ensure that the substances and materials listed as extraction solvents in Annex I comply with the following general and specific purity criteria:\n(a)\nthey shall not contain a toxicologically dangerous amount of any element or substance;\n(b)\nsubject to any exceptions deriving from the specific purity criteria adopted in accordance with point (d) of Article 4, they shall not contain more than 1 mg/kg of arsenic or more than 1 mg/kg of lead;\n(c)\nthey shall satisfy the specific purity criteria adopted in accordance with point (d) of Article 4.\nArticle 4\nThe Commission shall adopt the following:\n(a)\nthe necessary amendments to Annex I in the light of scientific and technical progress in the field of the use of solvents, their conditions of use and maximum residue limits;\n(b)\nthe methods of analysis necessary to verify compliance with the general and specific purity criteria provided for in Article 3;\n(c)\nthe procedure for taking samples and the methods for qualitative and quantitative analysis of the extraction solvents listed in Annex I and used in foodstuffs or food ingredients;\n(d)\nif necessary, the specific purity criteria for the extraction solvents listed in Annex I, and in particular maximum permitted limits of mercury and cadmium in the extraction solvents.\nThe measures referred to in points (b) and (c) of the first subparagraph, designed to amend non-essential elements of this Directive, inter alia, by supplementing it, shall be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny referred to in Article 6(2).\nThe measures referred to in points (a) and (d) of the first subparagraph, designed to amend non-essential elements of this Directive, inter alia, by supplementing it, shall be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny referred to in Article 6(3).\nWhere necessary, the measures referred to in points (a) and (d) of the first subparagraph shall be adopted in accordance with the urgency procedure referred to in Article 6(4).\nArticle 5\n1.   Where a Member State, as a result of new information or of a reassessment of existing information made since this Directive was adopted, has detailed grounds for establishing that the use in foodstuffs of any substance listed in Annex I or the level of one or more of the components referred to in Article 3 contained in such substances might endanger human health although it complies with the conditions laid down in this Directive, that Member State may temporarily suspend or restrict application of the provisions in question in its territory. It shall immediately inform the other Member States and the Commission thereof and give reasons for its decision.\n2.   The Commission shall examine as soon as possible the evidence given by the Member State concerned and consult the Committee referred to in Article 6(1), and shall then deliver its opinion forthwith and take the appropriate measures, which may replace the measures referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article.\n3.   If the Commission considers that amendments to this Directive are necessary in order to resolve the difficulties mentioned in paragraph 1 and to ensure the protection of human health, it shall adopt those amendments.\nThose measures, designed to amend non-essential elements of this Directive, shall be adopted in accordance with the urgency procedure referred to in Article 6(4).\nAny Member State which has adopted safeguard measures may in that event retain them until the amendments enter into force in its territory.\nArticle 6\n1.   The Commission shall be assisted by the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health, set up by Article 58 of Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 28 January 2002 laying down the general principles and requirements of food law, establishing the European Food Safety Authority and laying down procedures in matters of food safety (6).\n2.

Link to consolidated version.\nSUMMARY\n            \nSolvent extraction is a way of separating a substance from one or more others by applying a solvent*. It is used in the food industry and must be regulated to ensure human health is protected and the products that result from the technique can be sold freely across the European Union.\nWHAT DOES THE DIRECTIVE DO?\n              \nIt replaces earlier legislation and establishes a single list of the extraction solvents* which can be used in the processing of food, food ingredients and raw materials according to good manufacturing practice.\nKEY POINTS\n              \nPermitted extraction solvents are:\n—\n              propane,\n            \n—\n              butane,\n            \n—\n              ethyl acetate,\n            \n—\n              ethanol,\n            \n—\n              carbon dioxide,\n            \n—\n              acetone and\n            \n—\n              nitrous oxide.\n            \nEU countries may not prohibit, restrict or obstruct the sale of food or ingredients if these solvents have been used in compliance with the legislation.\nEU countries may not authorise the use of other substances or materials as extraction solvents.\nNational authorities may temporarily suspend or restrict the use of a permitted extraction solvent if it has detailed grounds to suspect that its use in food could endanger human health.\nThey must immediately inform other EU countries and the European Commission, which will investigate the evidence supplied for their decision.\nSubstances used as extraction solvents must provide certain visible, legible and indelible details on their packaging, containers or labels. These include:\n—\n              commercial name;\n            \n—\n              clear indication of suitability to extract food or food ingredients; and\n            \n—\n              any special storage conditions.\nWHEN DOES THE DIRECTIVE APPLY?\n              \nFrom 26 June 2009.\nKEY TERMS\n* Solvent: any substance that dissolves a foodstuff.\n* Extraction solvent: a substance used during processing of food and which is then removed. It may leave unintentional, but technically unavoidable, residues or derivatives in the food.\nlast update 26.10.2015", "tags": ["nutrition", "foodstuff", "approximation of laws", "solvent", "vitamin", "food chemistry", "food additive"], "subjects": ["Internal market - Principles", "Protocol on Ireland/Northern Ireland", "Approximation of laws", "Foodstuffs"], "split": "train", "reference_annotations": {}, "summary_annotations": {}}
