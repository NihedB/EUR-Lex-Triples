Documents which are to be published by branches of credit institutions and financial institutions whose head office is in another EU country include their annual accounts, consolidated accounts, annual report, etc. These must be published and audited as required by the law of the EU country in which the head office is located. Pending further coordination, EU countries may require branches to publish additional information such as income and costs, and the branch's total claims and liabilities.\nDocuments to be published by branches of credit institutions and financial institutions whose head office is in a non-EU country are the same as for the branches which have their head offices in an EU country. They must be published and audited as required by the law of non-EU country. However, if the rules in question do not conform with EU accounting requirements, EU countries may require branches to publish annual accounts relating to their own activities.\nEU countries may require that certified translations of the documents be published in their official language(s).\nFROM WHEN DOES THE DIRECTIVE APPLY?\n              \nIt has applied since 14 January 1989. EU countries had to incorporate it into national law by 1 January 1991.\nMAIN DOCUMENT\n            \nCouncil Directive 89/117/EEC of 13 February 1989 on the obligations of branches established in a Member State of credit institutions and financial institutions having their head offices outside that Member State regarding the publication of annual accounting documents (OJ L 44, 16.2.1989, pp. 40–42)\nlast update 23.10.2017", "tags": ["financial institution", "publication of accounts", "credit institution"], "subjects": ["Internal market - Principles", "Free movement of capital", "Freedom of establishment", "Approximation of laws"], "split": "train", "reference_annotations": {"31989L0117_p1": {"text": "Whereas the equivalence, required under this Directive, of annual accounting documents of credit institutions and financial institutions having their head offices in non-member countries may lead to problems of assessment; whereas it is therefore necessary for this and other problems in the area covered by the Directive, and in particular in its implementation, to be dealt with by representatives of the Member States and of the Commission jointly in a Contact Committee; whereas, in order to keep the number of such committees within limits, such cooperation should be carried out within the framework of the Committee set up under Article 52 of Council directive 78/660/eec of 25 July 1978 on the annual accounts of certain types of companies (5), as last amended by directive 84/569/eec (6); whereas, however, where problems relating to credit institutions are to be dealt with, the Committee should be appropriately constituted,", "triples": [" directive 84/569/eec,  amended,  directive 78/660/eec"]}}, "summary_annotations": {}}
