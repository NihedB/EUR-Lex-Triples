The knowledge and experience acquired by the Safety and Health Commission for the Mining and Other Extractive Industries should also be safeguarded by setting up standing working parties for specific sectors within this Advisory Committee.(10) This reform should be incorporated in a new decision setting up an Advisory Committee for Safety and Health at Work as a single advisory body, and repealing Decision 74/325/EEC.(11) The Decisions setting up the Mines Safety Commission, the Decision concerning the terms of reference and rules of procedure of the Mines Safety Commission and the Decision 74/326/EEC should also be repealed,HAS DECIDED AS FOLLOWS:Article 1An Advisory Committee for Safety and Health at Work (hereinafter called the \"Committee\") is hereby set up.Article 21.
