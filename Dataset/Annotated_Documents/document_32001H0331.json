thus inspections are an indispensable link in the regulatory chain and an efficient instrument to contribute to a more consistent implementation and enforcement of Community environmental legislation across the Community and to avoid distortions of competition.(8) There is currently a wide disparity in the inspection systems and mechanisms among Member States in terms not only of their capacities for carrying out inspection tasks but also of the scope and contents of the inspection tasks undertaken and even in the very existence of inspection tasks in a few Member States, and this is a situation which cannot be considered satisfactory with reference to the objective of an effective and more consistent implementation, practical application and enforcement of Community legislation on environmental protection.(9) It is necessary, therefore, to provide, at this stage, guidelines in the form of minimum criteria to be applied as a common basis for the performance of environmental inspection tasks within the Member States.(10) Community environmental legislation obliges Member States to apply requirements in relation to certain emissions, discharges and activities; minimum criteria on the organisation and carrying out of inspections should be met in the Member States, as a first stage, for all industrial installations and other enterprises and facilities whose air emissions and/or water discharges and/or waste disposal or recovery activities are subject to authorisation, permit or licensing requirements under Community law.(11) Inspections should take place taking into account the division of responsibilities in the Member States between authorisation and inspection services.(12) In order to make this system of inspections efficient, Member States should ensure that environmental inspections activities are planned in advance.(13) Site visits form an important part of environmental inspection activities.(14) The data and documentation provided by industrial operators registered under the Community eco-management and audit scheme could be a useful source of information in the context of environmental inspections.(15) In order to draw conclusions from site visits, regular reports should be established.(16) Reporting on inspection activities, and public access to information thereon, are important means to ensure through transparency the involvement of citizens, non-governmental organisations and other interested actors in the implementation of Community environmental legislation; access to such information should be in line with the provisions of Council Directive 90/313/EEC of 7 June 1990 on the freedom of access to information on the environment(7).(17) Member States should assist each other administratively in operating this recommendation. The establishment by Member States in cooperation with IMPEL of reporting and advice schemes relating to inspectorates and inspection procedures would help to promote best practice across the Community.(18) Member States should report to the Council and the Commission on their experience in operating this recommendation and the Commission should regularly inform the European Parliament.(19) The Commission should keep the operation and effectiveness of this recommendation under review and report thereon to the European Parliament and the Council as soon as possible after the receipt of the Member States' reports.(20) Further work by IMPEL and Member States, in cooperation with the Commission, should be encouraged in respect of best practices concerning the qualifications and training of environmental inspectors.(21) In accordance with the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty, and given the differences in inspection systems and mechanisms in the Member States, the objectives of the proposed action can best be achieved by guidance set out at Community level.(22) In the light of the experience gained in the operation of this recommendation and taking account of IMPEL's further work, as well as of the results of any schemes provided for in this recommendation, the Commission should, upon receipt of Member States' reports, give consideration to developing the minimum criteria in terms of their scope and substance and to making further proposals which might include a proposal for a directive, if appropriate,HEREBY RECOMMEND:IPurposeEnvironmental inspection tasks should be carried out in the Member States, according to minimum criteria to be applied in the organising, carrying out, following up and publicising of the results of such tasks, thereby strengthening compliance with, and contributing to a more consistent implementation and enforcement of Community environmental law in all Member States.IIScope and definitions1. (a) This recommendation applies to environmental inspections of all industrial installations and other enterprises and facilities, whose air emissions and/or water discharges and/or waste disposal or recovery activities are subject to authorisation, permit or licensing requirements under Community law, without prejudice to specific inspection provisions in existing Community legislation.(b) For the purposes of this recommendation, all the installations and other enterprises and facilities referred to in point (a) are \"controlled installations\".2. For the purposes of this recommendation, \"environmental inspection\" is an activity which entails, as appropriate:(a) checking and promoting the compliance of controlled installations with relevant environmental requirements set out in Community legislation as transposed into national legislation or applied in the national legal order (referred to hereinafter as \"EC legal requirements\");(b) monitoring the impact of controlled installations on the environment to determine whether further inspection or enforcement action (including issuing, modification or revocation of any authorisation, permit or licence) is required to secure compliance with EC legal requirements;(c) the carrying out of activities for the above purposes including:- site visits,- monitoring achievement of environmental quality standards,- consideration of environmental audit reports and statements,- consideration and verification of any self monitoring carried out by or on behalf of operators of controlled installations,- assessing the activities and operations carried out at the controlled installation,- checking the premises and the relevant equipment (including the adequacy with which it is maintained) and the adequacy of the environmental management at the site,- checking the relevant records kept by the operators of controlled installations.3. Environmental inspections, including site visits, may be:(a) routine, that is, carried out as part of a planned inspections programme; or(b) non-routine, that is, carried out in such cases in response to complaints, in connection with the issuing, renewal or modification of an authorisation, permit or licence, or in the investigation of accidents, incidents and occurrences of non-compliance.4. (a) Environmental inspections may be carried out by any public authority at either national, regional or local level, which is established or designated by the Member State and responsible for the matters covered by this recommendation.(b) The bodies referred to in point (a) may, in accordance with their national legislation, delegate the tasks provided for in this recommendation to be accomplished, under their authority and supervision, to any legal person whether governed by public or private law provided such person has no personal interest in the outcome of the inspections it undertakes.(c) The bodies referred to in points (a) and (b) are defined as \"inspecting authorities\".5. For the purposes of this recommendation, an \"operator of a controlled installation\" is any natural or legal person who operates or controls the controlled installation or, where this is provided for in national legislation, to whom decisive economic power over the technical functioning of the controlled installation has been delegated.IIIOrganisation and carrying out of environmental inspections1. Member States should ensure that environmental inspections aim to achieve a high level of environmental protection and to this end should take the necessary measures to ensure that environmental inspections of controlled installations are organised and carried out in accordance with points IV to VIII of this recommendation.2. Member States should assist each other administratively in carrying out the guidelines of this recommendation by the exchange of relevant information and, where appropriate, inspecting officials.3. To prevent illegal cross-border environmental practices, Member States should encourage, in cooperation with IMPEL, the coordination of inspections with regard to installations and activities which might have significant transboundary impact.4. In order to promote best practice across the Community, Member States may, in cooperation with IMPEL, consider the establishment of a scheme, under which Member States report and offer advice on inspectorates and inspection procedures in Member States, paying due regard to the different systems and contexts in which they operate, and report to the Member States concerned on their findings.IVPlans for environmental inspections1. Member States should ensure that environmental inspection activities are planned in advance, by having at all times a plan or plans for environmental inspections providing coverage of all the territory of the Member State and of the controlled installations within it. Such a plan or plans should be available to the public according to Directive 90/313/EEC.2. Such plan or plans may be established at national, regional or local levels, but Member States should ensure that the plan or plans apply to all environmental inspections of controlled installations within their territory and that the authorities mentioned in point II(4) are designated to carry out such inspections.3. Plans for environmental inspections should be produced on the basis of the following:(a) the EC legal requirements to be complied with;(b) a register of controlled installations within the plan area;(c) a general assessment of major environmental issues within the plan area and a general appraisal of the state of compliance by the controlled installations with EC legal requirements;(d) data on and from previous inspection activities, if any.4. Plans for environmental inspections should:(a) be appropriate to the inspection tasks of the relevant authorities, and should take account of the controlled installations concerned and the risks and environmental impacts of emissions and discharges from them;(b) take into account relevant available information in relation to specific sites or types of controlled installations, such as reports by operators of controlled installations made to the authorities, self monitoring data, environmental audit information and environmental statements, in particular those produced by controlled installations registered according to the Community eco-management and audit scheme (EMAS), results of previous inspections and reports of environmental quality monitoring.5. Each plan for environmental inspections should as a minimum:(a) define the geographical area which it covers, which may be for all or part of the territory of a Member State;(b) cover a defined time period, for example one year;(c) include specific provisions for its revision;(d) identify the specific sites or types of controlled installations covered;(e) prescribe the programmes for routine environmental inspections, taking into account environmental risks; these programmes should include, where appropriate, the frequency of site visits for different types of or specified controlled installations;(f) provide for and outline the procedures for non-routine environmental inspections, in such cases in response to complaints, accidents, incidents and occurrences of non-compliance and for purposes of granting permission;(g) provide for coordination between the different inspecting authorities, where relevant.VSite visits1. Member States should ensure that the following criteria are applied in respect of all site visits:(a) that an appropriate check is made of compliance with the EC legal requirements relevant to the particular inspection;(b) that if site visits are to be carried out by more than one environmental inspecting authority, they exchange information on each others' activities and, as far as possible, coordinate site visits and other environmental inspection work;(c) that the findings of site visits are contained in reports made in accordance with point VI and exchanged, as necessary, between relevant inspection, enforcement and other authorities, whether national, regional or local;(d) that inspectors or other officials entitled to carry out site visits have a legal right of access to sites and information, for the purposes of environmental inspection.2. Member States should ensure that site visits are regularly carried out by inspecting authorities as part of their routine environmental inspections and that the following additional criteria are applied for such site visits:(a) that the full range of relevant environmental impacts is examined, in conformity with the applicable EC legal requirements, the environmental inspection programmes and the inspecting bodies' organisational arrangements;(b) that such site visits should aim to promote and reinforce operators' knowledge and understanding of relevant EC legal requirements and environmental sensitivities, and of the environmental impacts of their activities;(c) that the risks to and impact on the environment of the controlled installation are considered in order to evaluate the effectiveness of existing authorisation, permit or licensing requirements and to assess whether improvements or other changes to such requirements are necessary.3. Member States should also ensure that non-routine site visits are carried out in the following circumstances:(a) in the investigation by the relevant inspecting authorities of serious environmental complaints, and as soon as possible after such complaints are received by the authorities;(b) in the investigation of serious environmental accidents, incidents and occurrences of non-compliance, and as soon as possible after these come to the notice of the relevant inspecting authorities;(c) where appropriate, as part of the determination as to whether and on what terms to issue a first authorisation, permit or licence for a process or activity at a controlled installation or the proposed site thereof or to ensure the compliance with the requirements of authorisation, permit or licence after it has been issued and before the start of activity;(d) where appropriate, before the reissue, renewal or modification of authorisations, permits or licences.VIReports and conclusions following site visits1. Member States should ensure that after every site visit the inspecting authorities process or store, in identifiable form and in data files, the inspection data and their findings as to compliance with EC legal requirements, an evaluation thereof and a conclusion on whether any further action should follow, such as enforcement proceedings, including sanctions, the issuing of a new or revised authorisation, permit or licence or follow-up inspection activities, including further site visits. Reports should be finalised as soon as possible.2. Member States should ensure that such reports are properly recorded in writing and maintained in a readily accessible database. The full reports, and wherever this is not practicable the conclusions of such reports, should be communicated to the operator of the controlled installation in question according to Directive 90/313/EEC; these reports should be publicly available within two months of the inspection taking place.VIIInvestigations of serious accidents, incidents and occurrences of non-complianceMember States should ensure that the investigation of serious accidents, incidents and occurrences of non-compliance with EC legislation, whether these come to the attention of the authorities through a complaint or otherwise, is carried out by the relevant authority in order to:(a) clarify the causes of the event and its impact on the environment, and as appropriate, the responsibilities and possible liabilities for the event and its consequences, and to forward conclusions to the authority responsible for enforcement, if different from the inspecting authority;(b) mitigate and, where possible, remedy the environmental impacts of the event through a determination of the appropriate actions to be taken by the operator(s) and the authorities;(c) determine action to be taken to prevent further accidents, incidents and occurrences of non-compliance;(d) enable enforcement action or sanctions to proceed, if appropriate; and(e) ensure that the operator takes appropriate follow-up actions.VIIIReporting on environmental inspection activities in general1. Member States should report to the Commission on their experience of the operation of this recommendation two years after the date of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities, using, to the extent possible, any data available from regional and local inspecting authorities.2. Such reports should be available to the public and should include in particular the following information:(a) data about the staffing and other resources of the inspecting authorities;(b) details of the inspecting authority's role and performance in the establishment and implementation of relevant plan(s) for inspections;(c) summary details of the environmental inspections carried out, including the number of site visits made, the proportion of controlled installations inspected (by type) and estimated length of time before all controlled installations of that type have been inspected;(d) brief data on the degree of compliance by controlled installations with EC legal requirements as appears from inspections carried out;(e) a summary, including numbers, of the actions taken as a result of serious complaints, accidents, incidents and occurrences of non-compliance;(f) an evaluation of the success or failure of the plans for inspections as applicable to the inspecting body, with any recommendations for future plans.IXReview and development of the recommendation1. The Commission should review the operation and effectiveness of this recommendation, as soon as possible after receipt of the Member States' reports mentioned in point VIII above, with the intention of developing the minimum criteria further in terms of their scope in the light of the experience gained from their application, and taking into account any further contributions from interested parties, including IMPEL and the European Environment Agency. The Commission should then submit to the European Parliament and the Council a report accompanied, if appropriate, by a proposal for a directive. The European Parliament and the Council will consider such a proposal without delay.2. The Commission is invited to draw up, as quickly as possible, in cooperation with IMPEL and other interested parties, minimum criteria concerning the qualifications of environmental inspectors who are authorised to carry out inspections for or under the authority or supervision of inspecting authorities.3. Member States should, as quickly as possible, in cooperation with IMPEL, the Commission and other interested parties, develop training programmes in order to meet the demand for qualified environmental inspectors.XImplementationMember States should inform the Commission of the implementation of this recommendation together with details of environmental inspection mechanisms already existing or foreseen not later than twelve months after its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.Done at Luxembourg, 4 April 2001.For the European ParliamentThe PresidentN.

This would foster greater consistency in implementing and applying environment legislation in the Member States.\nThis recommendation aims to meet this need by putting forward minimum criteria for organising, performing, following up and publishing environmental inspections. However, they are not binding on the Member States.\nIt covers environmental inspections of all industrial installations, companies and facilities subject to authorisation, permit or licensing requirements under current EU environmental legislation (\"controlled installations\").\nInspection entails the following:\nchecking that installations comply with EU environmental requirements;\nmonitoring the impact of installations on the environment.\nThe following actions are planned: site visits, monitoring compliance with environmental quality standards, inspecting environmental audit reports and statements, checking premises and equipment, checking the suitability of environmental management and of the relevant records.\nThe recommendation lays down a general obligation on Member States:\nto aim for a high level of environmental protection when organising and carrying out environmental inspections;\nto cooperate with the other Member States on an administrative level in applying the recommendation.\nMember States will have to plan their environmental inspection tasks and have at all times at least one environmental inspection plan covering the controlled installations on their territory. Such plans may be drawn up at local, regional or national level and must be available to the public in accordance with Directive 2003/4/EC concerning freedom of access to information on the environment. They must include: an indication of the geographical area, the period and the sites they cover, information on updating the plans, programmes for routine inspections, procedures for non-routine inspections and a plan for coordination between the different inspecting authorities.\nEnvironmental inspections will include routine on-site inspections by the authorities, which must:\nrespect a number of minimum criteria (compliance with Community legal requirements, risk analysis based on an integrated approach which studies all the effects of the installation on the environment, enhancing the knowledge of those who run such installations as regards environmental requirements, coordination between the different inspection authorities involved);\nbe mandatory in certain specific areas (enquiries carried out following environmental complaints, enquiries into accidents, incidents or infringement cases; checks carried out before authorising a controlled activity or before renewing authorisations);\nbe recorded in reports which will be made available to the public in accordance with Directive 2003/4/EC.\nAdditional requirements are set for enquiries into serious accidents, incidents and infringements of Community legislation:\nto clarify causes, environmental impact, responsibilities and possible liabilities;\nto indicate the action to be taken to mitigate, end or prevent incidents;\nto allow for penalties and to indicate follow-up action.\nTwo years after the publication of the recommendation in the Official Journal, Member States will report to the Commission on how it has been applied. The results will be made available to the public. On the basis of these reports, the Commission will examine the functioning and effectiveness of the recommendation and will assess the case for extending the scope of the minimum criteria. It will submit a report to the European Parliament and the Council and, if appropriate, a proposal for a directive. The Commission must also, in cooperation with the European Environment Agency and the IMPEL network, draw up minimum criteria concerning the qualifications of environmental inspectors. Member States should develop the necessary training programmes.\nRELATED ACTS\nCommunication from the Commission of 14 November 2007 on the review of Recommendation 2001/331/EC providing for minimum criteria for environmental inspections in the Member States [COM(2007) 707 final - not published in the Official Journal].\nThe Commission has stated that all Member States have submitted a report on the implementation of the Recommendation, but that the information provided was often incomplete or difficult to compare. These reports also showed that few Member States have fully implemented the recommendation. The Commission does not consider it appropriate to make the inspections described in the recommendation a legally-binding requirement. However, it does feel that they could be improved, particularly by broadening their scope by clarifying certain definitions, laying down new criteria for the planning of inspections, simplifying reports to provide information that can be compared. Furthermore, in addition to the general criteria defined in the recommendation, the Commission feels that legally-binding sectoral requirements should be established for certain installations or specific activities. The Commission also stresses the importance of cooperation and exchange of information on projects linked to the IMPEL network.\nDirective 2003/87/EC\nof the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 October 2003 establishing a scheme for greenhouse gas emission allowance trading within the Community and amending Council Directive 96/61/EC [Official Journal L 275, 25.10.2003].\nThe European Union is establishing a greenhouse gas emissions trading scheme for the cost-effective reduction of such emissions in the Community. This scheme should enable the Community and the Member States to meet the commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions made in the context of the Kyoto Protocol. Installations operating in the energy sector, iron and steel production and processing, the mineral industry and the paper and card industry will automatically be subject to the emission trading scheme and will be obliged to declare their emissions of greenhouse gases. These statements are then checked, which may involve on-site inspections.\nDirective 96/61/EC\nof 24 September 1996 concerning integrated pollution prevention and control [Official Journal L 257, 10.10.1996].\nThe European Union defines the obligations with which highly polluting industrial and agricultural activities must comply. It establishes a procedure for authorising these activities and sets minimum requirements to be included in all permits, particularly in terms of pollutants released. The aim is to prevent or reduce pollution of the atmosphere, water and soil, as well as the quantities of waste generated by industrial and agricultural installations to ensure a high level of environmental protection. Member States are responsible for ensuring that these industrial installations comply with requirements, organising on-site inspections where necessary.\nLast updated: 27.11.2007", "tags": ["environmental policy", "action programme", "environmental protection", "environmental monitoring", "EU Member State", "EU programme"], "subjects": ["Environment"], "split": "train", "reference_annotations": {}, "summary_annotations": {"32001H0331_p1": {"text": "directive 2003/87/ec---of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 October 2003 establishing a scheme for greenhouse gas emission allowance trading within the Community and amending Council directive 96/61/ec [Official Journal L 275, 25.10.2003].", "triples": [" directive 2003/87/ec,  amending,  directive 96/61/ec"]}}}
