{"celex_id": "32015R0207", "reference": "13.2.2015\nEN\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\nL 38/1\nCOMMISSION IMPLEMENTING REGULATION (EU) 2015/207\nof 20 January 2015\nlaying down detailed rules implementing Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards the models for the progress report, submission of the information on a major project, the joint action plan, the implementation reports for the Investment for growth and jobs goal, the management declaration, the audit strategy, the audit opinion and the annual control report and the methodology for carrying out the cost-benefit analysis and pursuant to Regulation (EU) No 1299/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards the model for the implementation reports for the European territorial cooperation goal\nTHE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,\nHaving regard to Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013 of 17 December 2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council laying down common provisions on the European Regional Development Fund, the European Social Fund, the Cohesion Fund, the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development and the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund and laying down general provisions on the European Regional Development Fund, the European Social Fund, the Cohesion Fund and the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund and repealing Council Regulation (EC) No 1083/2006 (1), and in particular Article 52(4), the second and the fifth paragraphs of Article 101, the second paragraph of Article 106, and Articles 111(5), 125(10) and 127(6), thereof,\nHaving regard to Regulation (EU) No 1299/2013 of 17 December 2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council on specific provisions for the support from the European Regional Development Fund to the European territorial cooperation goal (2), and in particular Article 14(5) thereof,\nAfter consulting the Coordination Committee for the European Structural and Investment Funds,\nWhereas:\n(1)\nCommission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 288/2014 (3) lays down provisions necessary for the preparation of programmes. In order to ensure implementation of the programmes financed by the European Structural and Investment Funds (the ‘ESI Funds’), it is necessary to lay down further provisions for the application of Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013. To facilitate a comprehensive view and the access to those provisions, those provisions should be set out in one implementing act.\n(2)\nThe model for the progress report on implementation of the Partnership Agreement should set out uniform conditions for presenting information required in each part of the progress report in order to ensure that the information provided in the progress report is consistent and comparable and can, where necessary, be aggregated. To this end and taking into account that all information exchanges between Member States and the Commission should take place electronically through a system established for that purpose, the model should also define the technical characteristics of each field, including the format of the data, the input method and the character limits. The character limits proposed for the text fields are based on the needs of the most comprehensive reports.\n(3)\nTo comply with the requirements laid down in Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013, the model for the progress report is divided into five parts. Part I sets out the information and assessment required for all the European Structural and Investment Funds. Part II sets out information and assessment required in the progress report on the Youth Employment Initiative. The information set out in Parts III, IV and V of the model for the progress report should be provided for the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), the European Social Fund (ESF) and the Cohesion Fund where, in accordance with the third subparagraph of Article 111(4) of Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013, Member States with no more than one operational programme per Fund have opted to include the information required by Article 50(5) of the same Regulation and the information referred to in points (a), (b), (c) and (h) of the second subparagraph of Article 111(4) of that Regulation in the progress report on implementation of the Partnership Agreement instead of in the annual implementation reports submitted in 2017 and 2019 and in the final implementation report. Where such information has already been provided in Part I or II of the progress report, it should not be repeated in Part III, IV or V, as all information should be submitted once only.\n(4)\nMajor projects represent a substantial proportion of EU spending and are of strategic importance for achieving the EU strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth. To ensure uniform application it is necessary to provide a standard format for submitting the information requested for the approval of major projects. The information specified within this model should provide sufficient assurance that the financial contribution from the ERDF and the Cohesion Fund will not result in a substantial loss of jobs in existing locations within the Union.\n(5)\nA cost-benefit analysis, including an economic analysis, a financial analysis and a risk assessment is a prerequisite for the approval of a major project. A methodology for carrying out the cost-benefit analysis should be developed based on recognised best practices and with a view to ensuring consistency, quality and rigour, both in carrying out the analysis and in its assessment by the Commission or independent experts. The cost-benefit analysis of major projects should show that the project is desirable from an economic point of view and that the contribution from the ERDF and the Cohesion Fund is needed for the project to be financially viable.\n(6)\nTo ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of Article 106 of Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013 it is necessary to set out a format of the model for the joint action plan. Taking into account that all information exchanges between Member States and the Commission should take place electronically through a system established for that purpose, the model should also define the technical characteristics of each field, including the format of the data, the input method and the character limits.\n(7)\nAs the reporting requirements for the Investment for growth and jobs goal and for the European territorial cooperation goal are not identical, it is necessary to set out two models for the implementation reports, one for operational programmes under the Investment for growth and jobs goal and one for cooperation programmes under the European territorial cooperation goal. Nevertheless it should be ensured that where reporting requirements are the same or similar for the two goals, the content of the models is harmonised to the extent possible.\n(8)\nA model for the annual and final implementation reports should set out uniform conditions for presenting the information required in each part of the reports. This will ensure that the information provided is consistent and comparable, and can, where necessary, be aggregated. To this end and taking into account that all information exchanges between Member States and the Commission should take place electronically through a system established for that purpose, the model should also define the technical characteristics of each field, including the format of the data, the input method and the character limits. The character limits proposed for the text fields are based on the needs of the most comprehensive reports.\n(9)\nIn order to comply with the requirements of Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013 for the annual implementation report under the Investment in growth and jobs goal, whereby different types of information are to be reported depending on the year in question, the model is divided into three parts in order to set out clearly the information required for each year's report. Part A sets out the information required every year starting from 2016, Part B sets out additional information to be provided in the reports submitted in 2017 and 2019 and in the final reports and Part C sets out information to be provided in the report submitted in 2019 and in the final report, in addition to the information set out in Parts A and B. In accordance with the third subparagraph of Article 111(4) of Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013, Member States with no more than one operational programme per Fund may include certain information in the progress report instead of the annual implementation reports submitted in 2017 and 2019 and the final implementation report. It is necessary to identify this information in the model to ensure uniform application of those provisions.\n(10)\nPursuant to Article 50(9) of Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013, a citizen's summary of the content of the annual and final implementation reports should be made available to the public. It should be uploaded as a separate file in the form of an annex to the annual and final implementation reports. No specific model is envisaged for the citizen's summary, thus allowing Member States to use the structure and formatting they consider most appropriate.\n(11)\nTo harmonise standards for the preparation and presentation of the management declaration for which a managing authority is responsible pursuant to point (e) of the first subparagraph of Article 125(4) of Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013, it is necessary to set out uniform conditions for its content in the form of a standard model.\n(12)\nTo harmonise standards for the preparation and presentation of the audit strategy, the audit opinion and the annual control report for which an audit authority is responsible pursuant to Article 127(4) and the first subparagraph of Article 127(5) of Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013, a model should be provided setting out uniform conditions for the structure, and specifying the nature and the quality of the information to be used in their preparation.\n(13)\nIn order to allow for the prompt application of the measures provided for in this Regulation, this Regulation should enter into force on the day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nArticle 1\nModel for the progress report\nThe progress report on implementation of the Partnership Agreement referred to in Article 52(1) of Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013 shall be drawn up in accordance with the model set out in Annex I to this Regulation.\nArticle 2\nFormat for submission of the information on a major project\nThe information required for the approval of a major project, as referred to in points (a) to (i) of the first paragraph of Article 101 of Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013 shall be submitted in accordance with the format set out in Annex II to this Regulation.\nArticle 3\nMethodology for carrying out the cost-benefit analysis\nThe cost-benefit analysis referred to in point (e) of the first paragraph of Article 101 of Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013 shall be carried out in accordance with the methodology set out in Annex III to this Regulation.\nArticle 4\nFormat of the model for the joint action plan\nThe content of the joint action plan referred to in the first paragraph of Article 106 of Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013 shall be determined in accordance with the model set out in Annex IV to this Regulation.\nArticle 5\nModel for the implementation reports for the Investment for growth and jobs goal\nThe annual and final implementation reports for the Investment for growth and jobs goal, as referred to in Article 111 of Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013 shall be drawn up in accordance with the model set out in Annex V to this Regulation.\nArticle 6\nModel for the management declaration\nThe management declaration referred to in point (e) of the first subparagraph of Article 125(4) of Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013 shall be submitted for each operational programme in accordance with the model set out in Annex VI to this Regulation.\nArticle 7\nModels for the audit strategy, the audit opinion and the annual control report\n1.

GENERAL PRINCIPLES\n1.1.   The objective of a cost benefit analysis (hereinafter referred to as ‘CBA’) in the context of Cohesion Policy is to support the major project assessment in order to:\n—\nassess whether the major project \nis worth\nco-financing (from an economic point of view);\n—\nassess whether the major project \nneeds\nco-financing (from a financial point of view).\n1.2.   A CBA shall be:\n—\ncarried out as soon as possible in the project preparation phase, usually at the end of the preliminary design stage of the project;\n—\nviewed as an element of a major project application to be taken into consideration in conjunction with other documents prepared for major projects including those containing other information referred to in Article 101 (1) of Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013.\n1.3.   A CBA shall comply with the following principles:\n—\nCBA must be performed against predetermined policy objectives;\n—\nCBA requires to define the relevant social context and perspective (local, regional, national, transboundary, global);\n—\nCBA requires a common measurement unit (usually monetary);\n—\nCBA requires a comparison of a scenario of the new investment with a scenario without the new investment (incremental analysis (1));\n—\nCBA requires to state a reference period relevant for the project;\n—\nCBA requires consideration of residual values of investment;\n—\nCBA requires a risk assessment to deal with uncertainty.\n1.4.   A CBA for a major project shall include the elements set out below:\n(1)\nPresentation of the context;\n(2)\nDefinition of objectives;\n(3)\nIdentification of the project;\n(4)\nResults of feasibility studies with demand and option analysis;\n(5)\nFinancial analysis;\n(6)\nEconomic analysis;\n(7)\nRisk assessment.\n2.   ELEMENTS OF THE COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS\n2.1.   Presentation of the context and definition of objectives, identification of the project, feasibility of the project with demand and option analysis\n2.1.1.   Presentation of the context\nThis assessment requires the definition of the social, economic, political and institutional context. The key features to be described relate to:\n(1)\nthe socio-economic conditions of the country/region that are relevant for the project;\n(2)\nthe policy and institutional aspects, including existing economic policies and development plans with their policy objectives;\n(3)\nthe current infrastructure endowment and service provision;\n(4)\nthe perception and expectations of the population with relation to the service to be provided.\n2.1.2.   Definition of project's objectives\nClear objectives shall be defined for the project in order to verify that the investment responds to an existing need and to assess the results and the impact of the project. As far as possible the objectives should be quantified through indicators with baselines and target values.\nThe definition of the objectives shall be used to identify, where possible and appropriate, the project benefits in order to assess contribution of the project to welfare and to achieving the specific objectives of the priority axes of the operational programme(s).\n2.1.3.   Identification of the project\nThe identification of the major project shall take place taking into account the definition of a major project set out in Article 100 of Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013 and as well as the following principles:\n(1)\nthe project needs to be clearly identified as a self-sufficient unit of analysis, that is, technical lots, administrative or financial phases that cannot be regarded as being operational in themselves, shall be analysed within the CBA together with other phases comprising a major project.\n(2)\nthe impact area, final beneficiaries (2) and relevant stakeholders whose welfare counts in the aggregation of net benefits shall be taken into account.\n(3)\nthe body responsible for implementation is identified and its technical, financial and institutional capacities analysed.\n2.1.4.   Feasibility of the project with demand and option analysis\nFeasibility studies, which normally cover the following aspects: demand analysis; option analysis; available technology; the production plan (including the utilisation rate of the infrastructure); personnel requirements; the scale of the project, location, physical inputs, timing and implementation, phases of expansion and financial planning; environmental aspects, climate change mitigation aspects (GHG emissions), resource efficiency and resilience to climate change impacts and natural disasters, shall be considered in the cost benefit analysis (where applicable).\nIt shall be taken into account that:\n(1)\nFeasibility analysis identifies the potential constraints and related solutions with respect to technical, economic, environmental and climate change mitigation and adaptation, regulatory and institutional aspects. A project is feasible when its design satisfies the technical, legal, financial and other constraints relevant to the nation, region or specific site. Several project options may be feasible.\nA summary of results of feasibility studies must be presented in the CBA. CBA must be consistent with the information presented in feasibility studies.\n(2)\nDemand analysis identifies and quantifies the social need for an investment and considers as a minimum:\n—\nthe current demand, by the use of models and actual data;\n—\nthe forecast demand, from macroeconomic and sector forecasts and elasticity estimates of demand to relevant prices, income, and other core determinants;\n—\nsupply side aspects including the analysis of existing supply and expected (infrastructure) developments;\n—\nnetwork effect (if any).\n(3)\nOption analysis is performed to assess and compare different alternative options which are found generally feasible to meet the existing and future demand for the project and to find the best solution. Options should be compared against different criteria, including for example technical, institutional, economic, environmental and climate change aspects.\nThe option analysis should be carried out in two steps; the first step looks at basic strategic options (i.e. type of infrastructure and location for the project) and the second step at specific solutions at the technological level. If the project is implemented as a Public Private Partnership this second step of the analysis should focus on the range of output specifications that may or may not be included in the output specifications of the Public Private Partnership project. The first step is usually based on (mainly qualitative) multi-criteria analyses while the second step normally uses mainly quantitative methods.\nKey aspects of selecting the best option:\n—\nto properly justify the solution sought, evidence is provided that the selected option is the optimal one of the various options considered during the technical feasibility study;\n—\nif different alternatives have the same, unique objective and the same or very similar externalities, it is recommended that the selection should be based on the least cost solution per unit of output produced taking into account the long term operating and maintenance costs associated with the option;\n—\nif the output and externalities are different in different options (assuming all share the same objective), the Member State is encouraged to undertake a simplified CBA for all main options to select the best option by determining which option is more favourable from a socio-economic point of view and the selection should be based on economic parameters of a project, including its Economic Net Present Value (ENPV). The simplified CBA shall be carried out based on approximate estimates of key financial and economic data, including demand, investment cost and operating costs, revenues, direct benefits and externalities, where relevant.\n2.2.   Financial analysis\nAs set out in Article 101(1)(e) of Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013, a financial analysis must be included in the CBA.\nThe financial analysis shall include:\n(a)\nassessment of the financial profitability of the investment and of national capital;\n(b)\ndetermining the appropriate (maximum) contribution from the Funds;\n(c)\nchecking the financial viability (sustainability) of the project.\nFinancial analysis should, where possible and appropriate, be carried out from the point of view of the project owner and/or operator allowing to verify cash flows and guarantee positive cash balance in order to verify the financial sustainability and to calculate the indices of financial return on the investment project and on capital based on the discounted cash flows.\nIf the owner and the operator are not the same entity, a consolidated financial analysis, which excludes cash flows between the owner and the operator, should be undertaken.\nWhere possible and appropriate, the financial analysis should be carried out in constant prices (prices fixed at a base-year), but expected changes in relative prices should be considered as part of the risk assessment.\n2.2.1.   Discounted cash flow methodology, incremental method and other principles of financial analysis\nThe financial analysis of major projects shall be carried out taking into account the rules set out in section III (Method for calculating the discounted net revenue of operations generating net revenue) of Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 480/2014, including: method for calculating discounted net revenue (including the reference period and the incremental method) and discounting of cash flow (including the financial discount rate in real terms).\nThe data required to perform a financial analysis are as follows:\n(1)\ninvestment costs, including fixed investments, non-fixed investments including start-up costs, and, where appropriate, changes in working capital;\n(2)\nreplacement costs as defined in Article 17 (a) of Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 480/2014;\n(3)\noperating costs as defined in Article 17 (b) and (c) of Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 480/2014;\n(4)\nrevenues as defined in Article 16 of Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 480/2014;\n(5)\nsource of funding including equity capital of the investor (either public or private), capital from loans (in this case loan repayment and interests are a project outflow in sustainability analysis) and any additional financial resources such as grants.\nIn sectors where this is relevant, including the environmental sector, tariffs shall be fixed in compliance with the polluter-pays principle taking into account affordability, as set out in Section III (Method for calculating the discounted net revenue of operations generating net revenue) of Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 480/2014, and the full-cost recovery\n (3).\nCompliance with the full-cost recovery principle includes that:\n(1)\ntariffs should aim as far as possible to recover the capital cost, the operating and maintenance cost, including environmental and resource costs;\n(2)\nthe tariff structure maximises the project's revenues before public subsidies, while taking affordability into account.\nLimitations of the polluter-pays principle and full-cost recovery principle in user charges and fees should:\n(1)\nnot jeopardize the financial sustainability of the project;\n(2)\nas a general rule, be seen as temporary restrictions and maintained only as long as the issue of affordability of users exists.\n2.2.2.   Results of the financial analysis\n(a)   Evaluation of financial profitability of the investment and national capital\nFinancial Net Present Value (FNPV) is the sum that results when the expected investment and operating and replacement costs of the project (discounted) are deducted from the discounted value of the expected revenues.\nFinancial Rate of Return (FRR) is the discount rate that produces a zero FNPV.\nThe financial profitability of an investment is assessed by estimating the financial net present value and the financial rate of return of the investment (FNPV(C) and FRR(C)). These indicators compare investment costs to net revenues and measure the extent to which the project's net revenues are able to repay the investment, regardless of the sources of financing. In some cases (in the context of State Aid and private operators) the calculation of FRR(Kp) is required. Interest payments shall not be included in the calculation FNPV(C).\nFor a project to require the contribution of the Funds:\nFNPV(C) before the EU contribution should be negative and FRR(C) should be lower than the discount rate used for the analysis (except for some projects falling under State aid rules for which this may not be relevant).\nIf a major project shows high financial profitability (i.e. FRR(C) is substantially higher than the financial discount rate) it will, as a general rule, be considered sufficient for an investor to implement the project without Union contribution. A Union contribution may be justified only if it is demonstrated that the investment is not bankable on its own considering that the risks for an investor to implement the project e.g. highly innovative project may be too high to carry out the investment without a public grant.\nThe financial profitability of national capital is assessed by estimating the financial net present value and the financial rate of return on capital (FNPV(K) and FRR(K)). These indicators measure the extent to which the project's net revenues are able to repay the financial resources provided by the national funds (both private and public sources).\nCalculation of FNPV(K) and FRR(K) requires that:\n—\nthe financial resources — net of EU support — invested in the project are treated as outflows disregarding investment costs;\n—\ncapital contributions are considered at the moment they are actually paid out for the project or reimbursed (in the case of loans);\n—\ninterest payments are included in the table for the analysis of the return on capital (FNPV(K));\n—\noperating subsidies are not included in the table for the analysis of the return on capital (FNPV(K)).\nFor a project to require the contribution of the Funds:\nFNPV(K) with Union assistance should be negative or equal to zero, and FRR(K) should be lower or equal to the discount rate, otherwise appropriate justification has to be provided.\nWhen relevant, the return on the project promoter's capital (FRR(Kp)) should also be calculated. This compares the net revenues of the investment with the resources provided by the promoter: i.e. the investment cost minus the non-reimbursable grants received from the EU and/or the national/regional authorities. This exercise can be particularly useful in the context of State aid in order to verify that the intensity of the aid (EU and national assistance) provides the best value-for-money with the objective of limiting public financial support to what is necessary for the project to be economically or financially viable. If the project expects a substantial positive return (i.e. significantly above the national benchmarks on expected profitability in the given sector) it shows that the grant received would bring supra-normal profits to the beneficiary and therefore the Union contribution may not be justified.\n(b)   Determination of the appropriate (maximum) contribution from the Funds\nDetermination of the appropriate (maximum) contribution from the Funds for revenue generating projects shall be done in accordance with one of the methods for determining the potential net revenue in accordance with Article 61 (Operations generating net revenue after completion) of Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013 and Annex V to Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013 and Section III of Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 480/2014 setting out rules for calculation of the discounted net revenue of operations generating net revenue.\n(c)   Ensuring financial viability (sustainability)\nThe financial sustainability analysis is based on undiscounted cash-flow projections. It is mainly used to show that the project will have year by year sufficient cash resources at its disposition enabling it to always cover expenditures for investment and operations throughout the entire reference period.\nKey aspects of financial sustainability analysis are as follows:\n(1)\nfinancial sustainability of the project is verified by checking that the cumulated (undiscounted) net cash flow is positive (or zero) on an annual basis and over the entire reference period considered;\n(2)\nthe net cash flows to be considered for this purpose should:\n—\ntake into account investment costs, all (national and EU) financial resources and cash revenues and operating and replacement costs at the moment they are paid, repayments of entity's financial obligations as well as capital contributions, interests and direct taxes;\n—\nexclude VAT unless VAT is not recoverable;\n—\nnot take into account the residual value unless the asset is actually liquidated in the last year of analysis considered;\n(3)\nin the case of an operation not subject to the requirements set out in Article 61 of Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013, or whenever negative cash-flows are projected in the future, it must be indicated how costs will be covered with a clear long-term commitment of the beneficiary/operator to provide adequate funding from other sources to ensure the sustainability of the project;\n(4)\nif projects fall within a pre-existing infrastructure, such as capacity extension projects, the overall financial sustainability of the system operator in the ‘with-project scenario’ (more than the capacity of the single extended segment) must be checked and a sustainability analysis at a system operator level must be performed and results must be taken into account in the risk assessment.\n2.2.3.   Financial analysis in Public Private Partnership (PPP)\nThe following aspects shall be taken into consideration when the financial analysis is carried out for major projects implemented as PPPs:\n(1)\nThe financial discount rate may be increased above the standard rate set out in Section III (Method for calculation of the discounted net revenue of operations generating net revenue after completion) of the Commission Delegated Regulation to reflect a higher opportunity cost of capital to the private investor. This higher opportunity cost should be justified by the beneficiary on a case-by-case basis, providing evidence, where possible, of the private partner's past returns on similar projects, or other relevant factual evidence.\n(2)\nIn case of PPP schemes where the owner of the infrastructure is different from the operator a consolidated financial analysis, covering both the owner and operator, must be carried out.\n(3)\nUnless private partner is chosen in a fair, transparent and open competitive procedure assuring the best ‘value for money’ for public partner (4), in order to check the financial profitability of the private capital and avoid unduly high profit generated by EU support an indicator measuring the financial profitability of the invested capital to the private investor (FRR(Kp)) shall be calculated (5), comparing the net revenues accrued by the private partner with the resources provided during investment (either through equity or loans). The resulting FRR(Kp) shall be compared with national or international benchmarks on expected profitability in the given sector.\n2.3.   Economic analysis\nAs provided for by Article 101(1)(e) of Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013, an economic analysis must be included in the CBA.\nEconomic analysis is an analysis that is undertaken using economic values, reflecting the social opportunity cost of goods and services.\n2.3.1.   Key steps of economic analysis\nThe economic analysis should be carried out in constant accounting (shadow) prices and shall be undertaken taking the financial analysis cash flows as a starting point.\nEconomic analysis includes the following steps:\n1.\nFiscal corrections to exclude indirect taxes (e.g. VAT, excise duties), subsidies and pure transfer payments granted by a public entity (e.g. payments from national healthcare systems) from the economic analysis. Where indirect taxes/subsidies are intended to correct for externalities, these shall be included in the economic analysis, if considered to adequately reflect the social marginal value of the related externalities and provided that there is no double-counting with other economic costs/benefits.\n2.\nConversion of market to accounting (shadow) prices by applying conversion factors to financial prices to correct for market distortions. If conversion factors are not available from a national planning office and in the absence of significant market distortion for simplification the conversion factor can be set at one (CF=1). Conversion factors may be higher (or lower) than unity when accounting prices are greater (or smaller) than market prices.\n3.\nMonetisation of non-market impacts (corrections for externalities): externalities shall be estimated and valued, as appropriate, using stated or revealed preference method (e.g. hedonic pricing) or other methods.\nEconomic analysis shall consider direct effects only in order to avoid double-counting while generally shadow pricing and monetisation of externalities account for indirect effects.\nFinancial revenues in the form of user fees, charges and tariffs shall be excluded from the economic analysis, and replaced with estimation of the direct effects on users, either through ‘willingness to pay’ or accounting prices. User fees, charges and tariffs especially in sectors not exposed to market competition, in regulated sectors or strongly influenced by political considerations should not be used as a proxy for ‘willingness to pay’ of user.\n4.\nDiscounting of the estimated costs and benefits: once the stream of economic costs and benefits is estimated, the standard discounted cash flow methodology shall be applied using a social discount rate (SDR).\nOn the basis of Social Rate of Time Preference (SRTP) the following benchmarks for social discount rate are estimated: 4,95 % for Cohesion Member States and 2,77 % for other Member States. For simplification as a general rule a social discount rate of 5 % shall be used as a benchmark in Cohesion Member States (Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Estonia, Greece, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia) and 3 % in other Member States (Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, United Kingdom).\nMember States may establish a benchmark for the social discount rate which is different from 5 % or 3 %, on the condition that they:\n(1)\nprovide justification for this reference on the basis of economic growth forecast and other parameters determining the SDR under the SRTP approach; and\n(2)\nensure its consistent application across similar projects in the same country, region or sector.\nInformation on the different benchmark shall be made available to beneficiaries and the Commission at the start of the operational programme.\n2.3.2.   Calculation of the economic performance indicators\nThe following economic performance indicators (as defined below) are the key indicators of the economic analysis:\n(1)\nEconomic Net Present Value (ENPV) is the main reference indicator for project appraisal. It is defined as the difference between the discounted total social benefits and costs.\n(2)\nFor a major project to be acceptable from an economic standpoint the project's economic net present value should be positive (ENPV>0) demonstrating that the society in a given region or country gains from the project because the project's benefits exceed its costs and therefore, the project should be implemented.\n(3)\nEconomic rate of return (ERR) is the internal rate of return calculated using the economic values and expressing the socio-economic profitability of a project.\n(4)\nEconomic rate of return should be greater than the social discount rate (ERR>SDR) to justify EU support to a major project.\n(5)\nBenefit/Cost ratio (B/C) is defined as the net present value of project benefits divided by the net present value of project costs.\n(6)\nBenefit/Cost ratio should be greater than one (B/C>1) to justify EU support to a major project.\nThe main economic benefits per sector to be considered in the economic analysis are set out in table 1. Additional economic benefits can be added if needed and justified. In some specific cases those benefits may become economic costs e.g. increased vehicle operating costs in certain road projects.\nTable 1\nSector/Subsector\nEconomic benefits\nWater supply and sanitation\n(i)\nimproved access to drinking water and wastewater treatment services in terms of availability, reliability and quality of the service\n(ii)\nimproved drinking water quality\n(iii)\nimproved quality of surface waters and preservation of ecosystem services due to pollution abatement\n(iv)\nresource cost savings for both producers and customers\n(v)\nimproved health\n(vi)\nreduction of GHG emissions\nWaste management\n(i)\nreduction of health and environmental hazards (reduced contamination of air, water, soils)\n(ii)\nreduction of landfill space/costs (for waste treatment facilities)\n(iii)\nrecovery of materials, energy and production of compost (avoided cost of alternative production/generation, including externalities)\n(iv)\nreduction of GHG emissions (i.e. CO2, CH4)\n(v)\nreduction of visual disamenities, noise and odours\nEnergy\nEnergy Efficiency projects\n(i)\nenergy savings (expressed by the economic value of energy including externalities)\n(ii)\nincrease of comfort\n(iii)\nreduction of GHG and non-GHG emissions\nRenewable Energy Sources projects\n(i)\nreduction of energy costs for substitution of the energy source e.g. by displacement of fossil fuels alternatives (expressed by the economic value of energy generated by likely displaced alternative, including externalities)\n(ii)\nreduction of GHG emissions\nElectricity/gas grids and infrastructure\n(i)\nincrease and diversification of energy supply (value of incremental gas/electricity supplied, including externalities)\n(ii)\nincrease of security and reliability of energy supply (reduction in supply disruptions)\n(iii)\nreduction of energy costs for substitution of the energy source\n(iv)\nmarket integration: variation in surpluses stemming from price alignment effects across places (for transmission) or time (for storage)\n(v)\nimproved energy efficiency\n(vi)\nreduction of GHG and non-GHG emissions\nRoads, Railways, Public Transport\n(i)\nreduction in generalised costs (for movement of goods/people):\n—\ntime savings\n—\nvehicle operating costs savings\n(ii)\naccident savings\n(iii)\nreduction of GHG emissions\n(iv)\nreduction of non-GHG emissions (i.e. local air pollution impacts)\n(v)\nreduction of noise emissions (e.g. some urban projects)\nAirports, Seaports, Intermodal\n(i)\nreduction in generalised costs (for movement of goods/people)\n—\ntime savings\n—\nvehicle operating costs savings\n(ii)\nquality of service improvements (e.g. provision of airport contact gates)\n(iii)\nreduction of GHG emissions\n(iv)\nreduction of non-GHG emissions\n(v)\nreduction of noise emissions\nResearch & Innovation\n(i)\nbenefits to businesses (establishment of spin-offs and start-ups, development of new/improved products and processes; knowledge spillovers)\n(ii)\nbenefit to researchers and students (new research, human capital formation, social capital development)\n(iii)\nbenefits to the general public (reduction of environmental risks, reduction of health risks, cultural effects for visitors)\nBroadband\n(i)\nIncreased take-up and improved quality of digital services, including e-Commerce, for citizens and businesses (especially in rural areas);\n(ii)\nIncreased take-up and improved quality of digital services, including e-Government and e-Health, for public administration.\n2.3.3.   Climate change mitigation and adaptation in the economic analysis\nThe CBA must take into account costs and benefits of the project in the context of Greenhouse Gas emissions and climate change. The quantification of the project's Greenhouse Gas emissions and the estimate of economic cost of carbon (or CO2) emissions used to monetise the externalities of such emissions shall be based on a transparent methodology aligned with the EU 2050 decarbonisation objectives. As for climate adaptation, costs of measures aiming at enhancing the resilience of the project to climate change impacts that are duly justified in feasibility studies should be included in the economic analysis. The benefits of those measures, e.g. measures taken to limit the emissions of GHG or enhance the resilience to climate change and weather extremes and other natural disasters, should also be assessed and included in the economic analysis, if possible quantified, otherwise they should be properly described.\n2.3.4.   Simplified economic analysis in special cases\nIn certain limited cases where the benefits of a major project are very difficult or impossible to quantify and monetise, but where costs can be predicted with reasonable confidence, notably for major projects driven by necessity to ensure compliance with EU legislation, a cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) can be performed. In such cases the appraisal shall focus on verifying that the project is the most efficient solution for the society to supply a given, necessary service at the pre-defined conditions set out. In addition, qualitative description of main economic benefits should be provided.\nCEA is carried out by calculating the cost per unit of ‘non monetised’ benefit and is required to quantify benefits but not to attach a monetary price or economic value to the benefits.\nThe conditions for applying CEA are as follows:\n—\nthe project produces only one project output which is homogenous and easily measurable;\n—\nthis output is a crucial supply, entailing that action to secure it is essential;\n—\nthe aim of the major project is to achieve the output at minimum cost;\n—\nthere are no significant externalities;\n—\nthere is a wide evidence of appropriate benchmarks to verify that the chosen technology meets the minimum required cost performance criteria.\n2.4.   Risk assessment\nAs set out in Article 101(1)(e) of Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013, a risk assessment must be included in the CBA. This is required to deal with the uncertainty that always permeates investment projects. Risk assessment enables the project promoter to better understand the way the estimated impacts are likely to change should some key project variables turn out to be different from those expected. A thorough risk analysis constitutes the basis for a sound risk-management strategy, which in turn feeds back into the project design. Particular attention should be paid to climate change and environmental aspects.\nThe risk assessment shall comprise two steps:\n(1)\nSensitivity analysis, which determines the ‘critical’ variables or parameters of the model i.e. those whose variations, positive or negative, have the greatest impact on the project's performance indicators, shall take the following aspects into consideration:\n—\nthe critical variables are the ones whose 1 % variation results in more than 1 % variation of the NPV;\n—\nthe analysis is carried out by varying one element at a time and determining the effect of that change on the NPV;\n—\nthe switching values are defined as the percentage change the critical variable should assume to make the NPV equal to zero;\n—\nscenario analysis allowing the study of the combined impact of determined sets of critical values and in particular, the combination of optimistic and pessimistic values of a group of variables to build different scenarios, which may hold under certain hypotheses.\n(2)\nQualitative risk analysis including risk prevention and mitigation, which shall include the following elements:\n—\na list of risks to which the project is exposed;\n—\na risk matrix showing for each identified risk:\n—\nthe possible causes of failure,\n—\nthe link with the sensitivity analysis, where applicable,\n—\nthe negative effects generated on the project,\n—\nthe ranked (e.g. very unlikely, unlikely, about as likely as not, likely, very likely) levels of probability of occurrence and of the severity of impact,\n—\nthe risk level (i.e. combination of probability and impact).\n—\nidentification of prevention and mitigation measures, including the entity in charge of preventing and mitigating the main risks, standard procedures, where appropriate and taking into account best practices, where possible, to be applied to reduce risk exposure, where considered necessary.\n—\ninterpretation of risk matrix including an assessment of the residual risks after the application of prevention and mitigation measures;\n—\nIn addition the risk assessment may, where appropriate (depending on project size, data availability), and should, where the residual risk exposure is still significant, include the probabilistic risk analysis, which involves the following steps:\n(1)\nProbability distributions for critical variables informing about the likelihood of occurring a given percentage change in the critical variables. Computing the probability distribution of critical variables is necessary to carry out a quantitative risk analysis.\n(2)\nQuantitative risk analysis based on Montecarlo simulation, providing probability distributions and statistical indicators for expected result, STD, etc. of project financial and economic performance indicators.\nThe main risks per sector to be taken into account in the risk assessment are set out in Table 2.\nIn order to assist the project promoters in preparation of qualitative risk analysis in line with this Regulation, Member States are encouraged (if they consider this appropriate and/or feasible) to develop national guidelines on valuation of certain standard project risks, and list of mitigation and prevention measures across sectors.\nTable

INTRODUCTION\nI, the undersigned, representing the[name of the audit authority designated by Member State], independent in the sense of Article 123(4) [and (5), where applicable] of Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013, have audited the accounts for the accounting year started on 1 July … [year] and ended 30 June … [year] (1) and dated … [date of the accounts submitted to the Commission] (hereafter ‘the accounts’), the legality and regularity of the expenditure for which reimbursement has been requested from the Commission in reference to the accounting year (and included in the accounts), the functioning of the management and control system, and verified the management declaration for the purpose of Article 59(5)(b) of Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 966/2012\nin relation to the operational programme[name of operational programme, CCI number] (hereafter ‘the programme’),\nin order to issue an audit opinion in accordance with Article 127(5)(a) of Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013.\n2.   RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE MANAGING AND CERTIFYING AUTHORITIES\n[name of the managing authority], designated as the managing authority of the programme, and the[name of the certifying authority], designated as the certifying authority of the programme, are responsible to ensure a proper functioning of the management and control system in regard to the functions established by the Articles 125 and 126 of Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013 (and Article 23 of Regulation (EU) No 1299/2013) (2).\nIn particular, it is responsibility of the[name of the certifying authority], designated as the certifying authority of the programme, to draw up the accounts (in accordance with Article 137 of the Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013) and certify their completeness, accuracy and veracity, as required in Article 126(b) and (c) of Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013.\nMoreover, in accordance with Article 126(c) of Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013 it is the responsibility of the certifying authority to certify that the expenditure entered in the accounts complies with applicable law and has been incurred in respect of operations selected for funding in accordance with the criteria applicable to the programme and complying with applicable law (3).\n3.   RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE AUDIT AUTHORITY\nAs established by Article 127(5)(a) of Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013, my responsibility is to independently express an opinion on whether the accounts give a true and fair view, whether expenditure for which reimbursement has been requested from the Commission and which are declared in the accounts is legal (3) and regular, and whether the management and control system put in place functions properly. My responsibility is also to include in the opinion a statement as to whether the audit work puts in doubt the assertions made in the management declaration (4).\nThe audits in respect of the programme were carried out in accordance with the audit strategy and took account of internationally accepted audit standards. These standards require that the audit authority complies with ethical requirements, plans and performs the audit work in order to obtain reasonable assurance for the purpose of the audit opinion.\nAn audit involves performing procedures to obtain sufficient appropriate evidence to support the opinion set out below. The procedures performed depend on the auditor's professional judgement, including assessing the risk of material non-compliance, whether due to fraud or error. The audit procedures performed are those I believe are appropriate in the circumstances.\nI believe that the audit evidence gathered is sufficient and appropriate to provide the basis for my opinion, [in case there are any scope limitation:] except those which are mentioned in the paragraph ‘Scope limitation’.\nThe main findings drawn from the audits in respect of the programme are reported in the attached annual control report pursuant to Article 127(5)(b) of Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013.\n4.   SCOPE LIMITATION\nEither\nThere were no limitations on the audit scope.\nOr\nThe audit scope was limited by the following factors:\n(a)\n…\n(b)\n…\n(c)\n….\n[Indicate any limitation on the audit scope, for example any lack of supporting documentation, cases under legal proceedings, and estimate under ‘Qualified opinion’ below, the amounts of expenditure and the Union contribution affected and the impact of the scope limitation on the audit opinion. Further explanations in this regard shall be provided in the annual control report, as appropriate.]\n5.   OPINION\nEither\n(Unqualified opinion)\nIn my opinion, and based on the audit work performed:\n—\nthe accounts give a true and fair view, as established by Article 29(5) of Regulation (EU) No 480/2014;\n—\nthe expenditure in the accounts for which reimbursement has been requested from the Commission is legal and regular,\n—\nthe management and control system put in place functions properly.\nThe audit work carried out does not put in doubt the assertions made in the management declaration.\nOr\n(Qualified opinion)\nIn my opinion, and based on the audit work performed:\n—\nthe accounts give a true and fair view, as established by Article 29(5) of Regulation (EU) No 480/2014;\n—\nthe expenditure in the accounts for which reimbursement has been requested from the Commission is legal and regular;\n—\nthe management and control system put in place functions properly,\nexcept in the following aspects:\n—\nin relation to material matters related to the accounts:\nand/or [delete as appropriate]\n—\nin relation to material matters related to the legality and regularity of the expenditure in the accounts for which reimbursement has been requested from the Commission:\n—\nand/or [delete as appropriate] in relation to material matters related to the functioning of the management and control system (5):\nTherefore, I estimate that the impact of the qualification(s) is [limited]/[significant]. [delete as appropriate]\nThis impact corresponds to[amount in € and %] of the total expenditure declared. The Union contribution affected is thus[amount in €].\nThe audit work carried out does not put/puts [delete as appropriate] in doubt the assertions made in the management declaration.\n[Where the audit work carried out puts in doubt the assertions made in the management declaration, the Audit Authority shall disclose in this paragraph the aspects leading to this conclusion.]\nOr\n(Adverse opinion)\nIn my opinion, and based on the audit work performed:\n—\nthe accounts give/do\nnot\ngive [delete as appropriate] a true and fair view, as established by Article 29(5) of Regulation (EU) No 480/2014;\n—\nthe expenditure in the accounts for which reimbursement has been requested from the Commission is/is\nnot\n [delete as appropriate] legal and regular;\n—\nthe management and control system put in place functions/does\nnot\nfunction [delete as appropriate] properly.\nThis adverse opinion is based on the following aspects:\n—\nin relation to material matters related to the accounts:\nand/or [delete as appropriate]\n—\nin relation to material matters related to the legality and regularity of the expenditure in the accounts for which reimbursement has been requested from the Commission:\nand/or [delete as appropriate]\n—\nin relation to material matters related to the functioning of the management and control system: (6)\nThe audit work carried out puts in doubt the assertions made in the management declaration for the following aspects:\n[The audit authority may also include emphasis of matter, not affecting its opinion, as established by internationally accepted auditing standards. A disclaimer of opinion can be foreseen in exceptional cases (7).]\nDate:\nSignature:\n(1)  Accounting year means the period from 1 July to 30 June, except for the first accounting year, in respect of which it means the period from the start date for eligibility of expenditure until 30 June 2015.

The format in Annex I of the regulation is divided into five parts and allows for easy aggregation of data from different programmes to make an effective assessment of overall progress in the partnership agreement* for each EU country.\nMajor projects represent a large part of EU spending and are significant in achieving growth and jobs. The standard reporting format in Annex II sets out the information needed by the Commission to approve a major project. The information requested seeks to establish that a project will not displace existing jobs from other locations within the EU.\nCost-benefit analysis, including an economic analysis, a financial analysis and a risk assessment are essential for the approval of a major project. Using the approach set out in Annex III, the cost-benefit analysis of major projects should show that the project is desirable from an economic point of view.\nJoint action plans can be submitted by managing authorities using the template set out in Annex IV that represent a minimum of € 10 million or 20 % of the public support of the programme or programmes. They are a package of projects that do not include infrastructure which contribute to a programme or programmes in a more streamlined way for the grant beneficiaries.\nProgrammes are required to submit annual implementation reports from 31 May 2016 up until 2023. The template in Annex V sets out the information needed by the Commission to assess progress towards the goal of growth and jobs. The template in Annex X sets out the information needed by the Commission to assess the progress of territorial cooperation programmes*.\nManagement declarations are required from managing authorities for each of the programmes under their responsibility using the format set out in Annex VI. These refer to the correct and intended use of funds and their audit.\nTemplates for audit authorities presenting audit strategies (Annex VII), audit opinions (Annex VIII) and annual control reports (Annex IX) are clearly prescribed.\nFROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?\n              \nIt has applied since 14 February 2015.\nBACKGROUND\n              \nCohesion policy funding is the main investment arm of the EU and supports the EU’s strategic objective of investing in jobs, in close alignment with Europe 2020 targets.\nFor more information, see:\nfinancial management on the European Commission’s website.\n* KEY TERMS\n              \nManaging authority: the official body that is responsible for running the programme, selecting projects, monitoring budget implementation and providing information to the Commission, the partners and the public.\nPartnership agreement: EU countries are required to draw up and implement strategic plans with investment priorities covering all Structural and Investment Funds. Partnership agreements are negotiated at the beginning of the 7-year period between the European Commission and national authorities, following consultation of interest groups, civil society and local and regional representatives.\nEuropean territorial cooperation: European territorial cooperation programmes seek to encourage regions and cities from different EU countries to work together, share knowledge and learn from each other to improve integration and quality of life across borders through joint programmes, projects and networks.\nMAIN DOCUMENT\n            \nCommission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2015/207 of 20 January 2015 laying down detailed rules implementing Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards the models for the progress report, submission of the information on a major project, the joint action plan, the implementation reports for the investment for growth and jobs goal, the management declaration, the audit strategy, the audit opinion and the annual control report and the methodology for carrying out the cost-benefit analysis and pursuant to Regulation (EU) No 1299/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards the model for the implementation reports for the European territorial cooperation goal (OJ L 38, 13.2.2015, pp. 1-122)\nRELATED DOCUMENTS\n            \nRegulation (EU) No 1303/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 December 2013 laying down common provisions on the European Regional Development Fund, the European Social Fund, the Cohesion Fund, the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development and the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund and laying down general provisions on the European Regional Development Fund, the European Social Fund, the Cohesion Fund and the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund and repealing Council Regulation (EC) No 1083/2006 (OJ L 347, 20.12.2013, pp. 320-469)\nSuccessive amendments to Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013 have been incorporated in the original text.
