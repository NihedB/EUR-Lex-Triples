In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Directive does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve that objective,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:\nArticle 1\nScope and procedure\n1.   Interest or royalty payments arising in a Member State shall be exempt from any taxes imposed on those payments in that State, whether by deduction at source or by assessment, provided that the beneficial owner of the interest or royalties is a company of another Member State or a permanent establishment situated in another Member State of a company of a Member State.\n2.   A payment made by a company of a Member State or by a permanent establishment situated in another Member State shall be deemed to arise in that Member State, hereafter referred to as the ‘source State’.\n3.   A permanent establishment shall be treated as the payer of interest or royalties only insofar as those payments represent a tax-deductible expense for the permanent establishment in the Member State in which it is situated.\n4.   A company of a Member State shall be treated as the beneficial owner of interest or royalties only if it receives those payments for its own benefit and not as an intermediary, such as an agent, trustee or authorised signatory, for some other person.\n5.   A permanent establishment shall be treated as the beneficial owner of interest or royalties:\n(a)\nif the debt-claim, right or use of information in respect of which interest or royalty payments arise is effectively connected with that permanent establishment; and\n(b)\nif the interest or royalty payments represent income in respect of which that permanent establishment is subject in the Member State in which it is situated to one of the taxes mentioned in Article 3(a)(iii) or in the case of Belgium to the ‘impôt des non-résidents/belasting der niet-verblijfhouders’ or in the case of Spain to the ‘Impuesto sobre la Renta de no Residentes’ or to a tax which is identical or substantially similar and which is imposed after the date of entry into force of this Directive in addition to, or in place of, those existing taxes.\n6.   Where a permanent establishment of a company of a Member State is treated as the payer, or as the beneficial owner, of interest or royalties, no other part of the company shall be treated as the payer, or as the beneficial owner, of that interest or those royalties for the purposes of this Article.\n7.   This Article shall apply only if the company which is the payer, or the company whose permanent establishment is treated as the payer, of interest or royalties is an associated company of the company which is the beneficial owner, or whose permanent establishment is treated as the beneficial owner, of that interest or those royalties.\n8.   This Article shall not apply where interest or royalties are paid by or to a permanent establishment situated in a third State of a company of a Member State and the business of the company is wholly or partly carried on through that permanent establishment.\n9.   Nothing in this Article shall prevent a Member State from taking interest or royalties received by its companies, by permanent establishments of its companies or by permanent establishments situated in that State into account when applying its tax law.\n10.   A Member State shall have the option of not applying this Directive to a company of another Member State or to a permanent establishment of a company of another Member State in circumstances where the conditions set out in Article 3(b) have not been maintained for an uninterrupted period of at least two years.\n11.   The source State may require that fulfilment of the requirements laid down in this Article and in Article 3 be substantiated at the time of payment of the interest or royalties by an attestation. If fulfilment of the requirements laid down in this Article has not been attested at the time of payment, the Member State shall be free to require deduction of tax at source.\n12.   The source State may make it a condition for exemption under this Directive that it has issued a decision currently granting the exemption following an attestation certifying the fulfilment of the requirements laid down in this Article and in Article 3. A decision on exemption shall be given within three months at most after the attestation and such supporting information as the source State may reasonably ask for have been provided, and shall be valid for a period of at least one year after it has been issued.\n13.   For the purposes of paragraphs 11 and 12, the attestation to be given shall, in respect of each contract for the payment, be valid for at least one year but for not more than three years from the date of issue and shall contain the following information:\n(a)\nproof of the receiving company's residence for tax purposes and, where necessary, the existence of a permanent establishment certified by the tax authority of the Member State in which the receiving company is resident for tax purposes or in which the permanent establishment is situated;\n(b)\nbeneficial ownership by the receiving company in accordance with paragraph 4 or the existence of conditions in accordance with paragraph 5 where a permanent establishment is the recipient of the payment;\n(c)\nfulfilment of the requirements in accordance with Article 3(a)(iii) in the case of the receiving company;\n(d)\na minimum holding or the criterion of a minimum holding of voting rights in accordance with Article 3(b);\n(e)\nthe period for which the holding referred to in (d) has existed.\nMember States may request in addition the legal justification for the payments under the contract (e.g. loan agreement or licensing contract).\n14.   If the requirements for exemption cease to be fulfilled, the receiving company or permanent establishment shall immediately inform the paying company or permanent establishment and, if the source State so requires, the competent authority of that State.\n15.   If the paying company or permanent establishment has withheld tax at source to be exempted under this Article, a claim may be made for repayment of that tax at source. The Member State may require the information specified in paragraph 13. The application for repayment must be submitted within the period laid down. That period shall last for at least two years from the date when the interest or royalties are paid.\n16.   The source State shall repay the excess tax withheld at source within one year following due receipt of the application and such supporting information as it may reasonably ask for. If the tax withheld at source has not been refunded within that period, the receiving company or permanent establishment shall be entitled on expiry of the year in question to interest on the tax which is refunded at a rate corresponding to the national interest rate to be applied in comparable cases under the domestic law of the source State.\nArticle 2\nDefinition of interest and royalties\nFor the purposes of this Directive:\n(a)\nthe term ‘interest’ means income from debt-claims of every kind, whether or not secured by mortgage and whether or not carrying a right to participate in the debtor's profits, and in particular, income from securities and income from bonds or debentures, including premiums and prizes attaching to such securities, bonds or debentures; penalty charges for late payment shall not be regarded as interest;\n(b)\nthe term ‘royalties’ means payments of any kind received as a consideration for the use of, or the right to use, any copyright of literary, artistic or scientific work, including cinematograph films and software, any patent, trade mark, design or model, plan, secret formula or process, or for information concerning industrial, commercial or scientific experience; payments for the use of, or the right to use, industrial, commercial or scientific equipment shall be regarded as royalties.\nArticle 3\nDefinition of company, associated company and permanent establishment\nFor the purposes of this Directive:\n(a)\nthe term ‘company of a Member State’ means any company:\n(i)\ntaking one of the forms listed in the Annex hereto; and\n(ii)\nwhich in accordance with the tax laws of a Member State is considered to be resident in that Member State and is not, within the meaning of a Double Taxation Convention on Income concluded with a third state, considered to be resident for tax purposes outside the Community; and\n(iii)\nwhich is subject to one of the following taxes without being exempt, or to a tax which is identical or substantially similar and which is imposed after the date of entry into force of this Directive in addition to, or in place of, those existing taxes:\n—\nimpôt des sociétés/vennootschapsbelasting in Belgium,\n—\nselskabsskat in Denmark,\n—\nKörperschaftsteuer in Germany,\n—\nΦόρος εισοδήματος νομικών προσώπων in Greece,\n—\nimpuesto sobre sociedades in Spain,\n—\nimpôt sur les sociétés in France,\n—\ncorporation tax in Ireland,\n—\nimposta sul reddito delle persone giuridiche in Italy,\n—\nimpôt sur le revenu des collectivités in Luxembourg,\n—\nvennootschapsbelasting in the Netherlands,\n—\nKörperschaftsteuer in Austria,\n—\nimposto sobre o rendimento da pessoas colectivas in Portugal,\n—\nyhteisöjen tulovero/inkomstskatten för samfund in Finland,\n—\nstatlig inkomstskatt in Sweden,\n—\ncorporation tax in the United Kingdom;\n(b)\na company is an ‘associated company’ of a second company if, at least:\n(i)\nthe first company has a direct minimum holding of 25 % in the capital of the second company, or\n(ii)\nthe second company has a direct minimum holding of 25 % in the capital of the first company, or\n(iii)\na third company has a direct minimum holding of 25 % both in the capital of the first company and in the capital of the second company.\nHoldings must involve only companies resident in Community territory.\nHowever, Member States shall have the option of replacing the criterion of a minimum holding in the capital with that of a minimum holding of voting rights;\n(c)\nthe term ‘permanent establishment’ means a fixed place of business situated in a Member State through which the business of a company of another Member State is wholly or partly carried on.\nArticle 4\nExclusion of payments as interest or royalties\n1.

Where, by reason of a special relationship between the payer and the beneficial owner of interest or royalties, or between one of them and some other person, the amount of the interest or royalties exceeds the amount which would have been agreed by the payer and the beneficial owner in the absence of such a relationship, the provisions of this Directive shall apply only to the latter amount, if any.\nArticle 5\nFraud and abuse\n1.   This Directive shall not preclude the application of domestic or agreement-based provisions required for the prevention of fraud or abuse.\n2.

During a transitional period of six years starting on the aforementioned date, the rate of tax on payments of royalties made to an associated company of another Member State or to a permanent establishment situated in another Member State of an associated company of a Member State must not exceed 10 %.\nThese transitional rules shall, however, remain subject to the continued application of any rate of tax lower than those referred to in the first and second subparagraphs provided by bilateral agreements concluded between Greece, Spain or Portugal and other Member States. Before the end of any of the transitional periods mentioned in this paragraph the Council may decide unanimously, on a proposal from the Commission, on a possible extension of the said transitional periods.\n2.

It applies to:\ninterest payments*;\nroyalty payments*\nKEY POINTS\n              \nThe purpose of the directive is to abolish taxes levied at the EU country of source, while the EU country of receipt taxes the same payment.\nTherefore, the main aim is to ensure that the payments are not taxed in more than one country (double taxation).\nInterest and royalty payments arising in an EU country are exempt from any taxes imposed on those payments in that country provided that the beneficial owner* of the interest or royalties is:\na company of another EU country*\nor a permanent establishment* situated in another EU country.\nThe annex to the directive includes a list of the types of companies to which the directive applies. The directive has been amended to take into account the types of companies in the countries that joined the EU in 2004, 2007 and 2013.\nWhere an associated company or permanent establishment pays excess tax on interest or royalties in an EU country that is not its own, it must apply for a refund. The country must repay the excess tax withheld within 1 year following receipt of an application and any supporting information that it may reasonably ask for from the company or permanent establishment. If the tax withheld has not been refunded within that period, the company or permanent establishment is entitled (on expiry of the year in question) to interest on the tax which is refunded. This interest is calculated at a rate corresponding to the national interest rate to be applied in comparable cases under the domestic law of the country in question.\nThis directive will not rule out the application of domestic or agreement-based rules required for the prevention of fraud or abuse. EU countries may withdraw the benefits of this directive or refuse to apply it in the case of transactions for which the principal motive or one of the principal motives is tax evasion, tax avoidance or abuse.\nCertain countries benefited for a period from transitional rules whereby the application of the directive was delayed.\nThe International Bureau of Fiscal Documentation conducted a survey on the directive’s implementation for the European Commission in 2006 and the Commission published its own report on its operation in 2009. In 2011, the Commission adopted a proposal to recast the directive with a view to expanding its scope and to avoid situations where tax relief is granted but the corresponding income is not effectively subject to tax (double non-taxation).\nFROM WHEN DOES THE DIRECTIVE APPLY?\n              \nThe directive has applied since 26 June 2003 and had to become law in the EU countries by 1 January 2004.\nBACKGROUND\n              \nFor more information, see:\nTaxation of cross-border interest and royalty payments in the EU (European Commission).\nKEY TERMS\n              \nInterest payment: income from debt-claims of every kind, whether or not they are secured by mortgage and whether or not carrying a right to participate in the debtor’s profits. Examples include income from bonds or debentures (long-term bonds which yield a fixed rate of interest, issued by a company and secured against assets), and premiums and prizes relating to those bonds or debentures. Penalty charges for late payment are not regarded as interest.\nRoyalty payment: payments of any kind received for the use of or the right to use any copyright of literary, artistic or scientific work, including:cinematograph films and software,any patent,trade mark,design or model,plan,secret formula or process or for information concerning industrial, commercial or scientific experience.Payments for the use of, or the right to use, industrial, commercial or scientific equipment are regarded as royalties.\nAssociated companies: 2 companies are regarded as associated companies:when one has a direct minimum holding of 25% in the capital of the other, orwhen a third company has a direct minimum holding of 25% in the capital of both companies.\nBeneficial owner: the company that receives those payments for its own benefit and not as an intermediary, such as an agent, trustee or authorised signatory, for some other person.In case of a permanent establishment, when the payment is effectively connected with that permanent establishment.\nCompany of another EU country: this company must meet the 3 following criteria:it was formed in accordance with the law of an EU country (i.e. it has its registered office, central administration or principal place of business within the EU and its activities present an effective and continuous link with the economy of that country);it is resident in that EU country;it is subject to corporation tax.\nPermanent establishment: a fixed place of business situated in a Member State through which the business of a company of another Member State is wholly or partly carried on.\nMAIN DOCUMENT\n            \nCouncil Directive 2003/49/EC of 3 June 2003 on a common system of taxation applicable to interest and royalty payments made between associated companies of different Member States (OJ L 157, 26.6.2003, pp. 49-54)\nSuccessive amendments and changes to Directive 2003/49/EC have been incorporated in the original text.
