{"celex_id": "32013R1257", "reference": "10.12.2013\nEN\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\nL 330/1\nREGULATION (EU) No 1257/2013 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL\nof 20 November 2013\non ship recycling and amending Regulation (EC) No 1013/2006 and Directive 2009/16/EC\n(Text with EEA relevance)\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 192(1) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee (1),\nAfter consulting the Committee of the Regions,\nActing in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure (2),\nWhereas:\n(1)\nShips which constitute waste and which are subject to a transboundary movement for recycling are regulated by the Basel Convention of 22 March 1989 on the Control of the Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and their Disposal (‘the Basel Convention’) and Regulation (EC) No 1013/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council (3). Regulation (EC) No 1013/2006 implements the Basel Convention as well as an amendment (4) to that Convention adopted in 1995, which has not yet entered into force at international level, and which establishes a ban on exports of hazardous waste to countries that are not members of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). Such ships are generally classified as hazardous waste and prohibited from being exported from the Union for recycling in facilities in countries that are not members of the OECD.\n(2)\nThe mechanisms for monitoring the application of, and enforcing the current Union and international law are not adapted to the specificities of ships and international shipping. Efforts involving inter-agency cooperation between the International Labour Organisation (ILO), the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) and the Secretariat of the Basel Convention have been successful in reaching agreement on the introduction of mandatory requirements, at global level, aimed at ensuring an efficient and effective solution to unsafe and unsound ship recycling practices in the form of the Hong Kong International Convention for the Safe and Environmentally Sound Recycling of Ships (‘the Hong Kong Convention’).\n(3)\nCurrent ship recycling capacity in OECD countries which is legally accessible to ships flying the flag of a Member State is insufficient. Current safe and environmentally sound ship recycling capacity in countries which are not members of the OECD is sufficient to treat all ships flying the flag of a Member State and is expected to expand further by 2015 as the results of actions taken by recycling countries to meet the requirements of the Hong Kong Convention.\n(4)\nThe Hong Kong Convention was adopted on 15 May 2009 under the auspices of the International Maritime Organization. The Hong Kong Convention will enter into force only 24 months after the date of ratification by at least 15 states representing a combined merchant fleet of at least 40 per cent of the gross tonnage of the world’s merchant shipping and whose combined maximum annual ship recycling volume during the preceding 10 years constitutes not less than three per cent of the gross tonnage of the combined merchant shipping of the same states. That Convention covers the design, the construction, the operation and the preparation of ships with a view to facilitating safe and environmentally sound recycling without compromising ship safety and operational efficiency. It also covers the operation of ship recycling facilities in a safe and environmentally sound manner, and the establishment of an appropriate enforcement mechanism for ship recycling.\n(5)\nThis Regulation is aimed at facilitating early ratification of the Hong Kong Convention both within the Union and in third countries by applying proportionate controls to ships and ship recycling facilities on the basis of that Convention.\n(6)\nThe Hong Kong Convention provides explicitly for its Parties to take more stringent measures consistent with international law, with respect to the safe and environmentally sound recycling of ships, in order to prevent, reduce or minimise any adverse effects on human health and the environment. Taking that into account, this Regulation should provide protection from the possible adverse effects of hazardous materials on board all ships calling at a port or anchorage of a Member State while ensuring compliance with the provisions applicable to those materials under international law. In order to ensure the monitoring of compliance with the requirements relating to hazardous materials under this Regulation, Member States should apply national provisions to implement Directive 2009/16/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (5). Currently, port State control inspectors are tasked with the inspection of certification and with active testing for hazardous materials, including asbestos, under the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (‘SOLAS’). The Paris Memorandum of Understanding on Port State Control provides a harmonised approach for those activities.\n(7)\nThe purpose of this Regulation is also to reduce disparities between operators in the Union, in OECD countries and in relevant third countries in terms of health and safety at the workplace and environmental standards and to direct ships flying the flag of a Member State to ship recycling facilities that practice safe and environmentally sound methods of dismantling ships instead of directing them to substandard sites as is currently the practice. The competitiveness of safe and environmentally sound recycling and treatment of ships in ship recycling facilities located in a Member State would thereby also be increased. The establishment of a European List of ship recycling facilities (‘the European List’) fulfilling the requirements set out in this Regulation would contribute to those objectives as well as to better enforcement by facilitating the control of ships going for recycling by the Member State whose flag the ship is flying. Those requirements for ship recycling facilities should be based on the requirements of the Hong Kong Convention. In this regard, ship recycling facilities approved in accordance with this Regulation should meet the necessary requirements to ensure protection of the environment, the health and safety of workers and the environmentally sound management of the waste recovered from recycled ships. For ship recycling facilities located in a third country, the requirements should achieve a high level of protection of human health and the environment that is broadly equivalent to that in the Union. Ship recycling facilities which do not meet those minimum requirements should therefore not be included in the European List.\n(8)\nThe principle of equality in Union law should be applied and its application monitored, in particular when establishing and updating the European List in respect of ship recycling facilities located in a Member State and ship recycling facilities located in a third country fulfilling the requirements set out in this Regulation.\n(9)\nMember States are encouraged to adopt appropriate measures to ensure that ships excluded from the scope of this Regulation act in a manner that is consistent with this Regulation, in so far as is reasonable and practicable.\n(10)\nIn order to avoid duplication, it is necessary to exclude ships flying the flag of a Member State falling under the scope of this Regulation from the scope of application of Regulation (EC) No 1013/2006 and of Directive 2008/98/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (6) respectively. Regulation (EC) No 1013/2006 applies to shipments of waste from the Union, subject to exclusions for certain categories of waste where an alternative regime applies. This Regulation subjects ships within its scope to controls throughout their life-cycle and aims to secure recycling of those ships in an environmentally sound manner. It is therefore appropriate to specify that a ship subject to the alternative control regime throughout its life-cycle under this Regulation should not be subject to Regulation (EC) No 1013/2006. Ships neither covered by the scope of the Hong Kong Convention nor by this Regulation, and any waste on board of a ship other than operationally generated waste, should continue to be subject to Regulation (EC) No 1013/2006 and to Directives 2008/98/EC and 2008/99/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (7), respectively.\n(11)\nIt is also acknowledged that ships continue to be subject to other international conventions to ensure their safe operation at sea during the operational part of their life-cycle and, although they can exercise certain navigational rights and freedoms, ships are required to provide prior notice of entry into ports. Member States should be able to choose to apply further controls in accordance with other international treaties. Additional transit controls are therefore not considered necessary under this Regulation.\n(12)\nWhen interpreting the requirements of this Regulation, consideration should be given to the guidelines developed by the IMO (‘IMO guidelines’) to support the Hong Kong Convention.\n(13)\nFor the purposes of this Regulation, the term ‘recycling’ should not have the same meaning as defined in Directive 2008/98/EC. This Regulation should therefore introduce a specific definition for the term ‘ship recycling’.\n(14)\nRegulation (EC) No 1272/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council (8) implements at Union level the Globally Harmonised System for the classification and labelling of chemicals. That Regulation, together with Council Directive 67/548/EEC (9) and Directive 1999/45/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (10), provides useful guidance in determining what constitutes a hazardous material.\n(15)\nKeeping an inventory of hazardous materials on board a ship throughout its life-cycle is a key requirement laid down in the Hong Kong Convention and in this Regulation. In accordance with Regulation 8(2) of the Hong Kong Convention, a ship destined to be recycled should minimise the amounts of operationally generated waste in the period prior to entering the ship recycling facility. If the operationally generated waste is intended for delivery with the ship to a ship recycling facility, the approximate quantities and locations of that waste should be listed in Part II of the inventory.\n(16)\nMember States should take measures to prevent circumvention of ship recycling rules and to enhance transparency of ship recycling. As provided for in the Hong Kong Convention, Member States should report information concerning ships to which an inventory certificate has been issued, ships for which a statement of completion has been received and information regarding illegal ship recycling and follow-up actions that they have undertaken.\n(17)\nMember States should lay down rules on penalties applicable to infringements of this Regulation and ensure that those penalties are applied so as to prevent circumvention of ship recycling rules. The penalties, which may be of a civil or administrative nature, should be effective, proportionate and dissuasive.\n(18)\nIn accordance with the case-law of the Court of Justice, the courts of the Member States are required to interpret, to the fullest extent possible, the procedural rules relating to the conditions to be met in order to bring administrative or judicial proceedings in accordance with the objectives of Article 9(3) of the Aarhus Convention.\n(19)\nIn the interest of protecting human health and the environment and having regard to the ‘polluter pays’ principle, the Commission should assess the feasibility of establishing a financial mechanism applicable to all ships calling at a port or anchorage of a Member State, irrespective of the flag they are flying, to generate resources that would facilitate the environmentally sound recycling and treatment of ships without creating an incentive to out-flag.\n(20)\nIn order to take into account developments regarding the Hong Kong Convention, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union should be delegated to the Commission in respect of the updating of Annexes I and II to this Regulation. It is of particular importance that the Commission carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level. The Commission, when preparing and drawing up delegated acts, should ensure a simultaneous, timely and appropriate transmission of relevant documents to the European Parliament and to the Council.\n(21)\nIn order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of this Regulation, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission. Those powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council (11).\n(22)\nSince the objective of this Regulation, namely to prevent, reduce or eliminate adverse effects on human health and the environment caused by the recycling, operation and maintenance of ships flying the flag of a Member State, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States due to the international character of shipping and ship recycling, but can rather by reason of its scale and effects, be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve that objective,\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nTITLE I\nSUBJECT-MATTER, SCOPE AND DEFINITIONS\nArticle 1\nSubject matter and purpose\nThe purpose of this Regulation is to prevent, reduce, minimise and, to the extent practicable, eliminate accidents, injuries and other adverse effects on human health and the environment caused by ship recycling. The purpose of this Regulation is to enhance safety, the protection of human health and of the Union marine environment throughout a ship′s life-cycle, in particular to ensure that hazardous waste from such ship recycling is subject to environmentally sound management.\nThis Regulation also lays down rules to ensure the proper management of hazardous materials on ships.\nThis Regulation also aims to facilitate the ratification of the Hong Kong International Convention for the Safe and Environmentally Sound Recycling of Ships, 2009 (‘the Hong Kong Convention’).\nArticle 2\nScope\n1.

The notification shall include at least:\n(i)\nthe inventory of hazardous materials; and\n(ii)\nall ship-relevant information provided under point (a).\n2.   Ship owners shall ensure that ships destined to be recycled:\n(a)\nare only recycled at ship recycling facilities that are included in the European List;\n(b)\nconduct operations in the period prior to entering the ship recycling facility in such a way as to minimise the amount of cargo residues, remaining fuel oil, and ship generated waste remaining on board;\n(c)\nhold a ready for recycling certificate issued by the administration or a recognised organisation authorised by it prior to any recycling of the ship and after the receipt of the ship recycling plan approved in accordance with Article 7(3).\n3.   Ship owners shall ensure that tankers arrive at the ship recycling facility with cargo tanks and pump rooms in a condition ready for certification as safe-for-hot work.\n4.   Ship owners shall provide the operator of the ship recycling facility with a copy of the ready for recycling certificate issued in accordance with Article 9.\n5.   Ship owners shall be responsible for the ship and shall make arrangements to maintain that ship in compliance with the requirements of the administration of the Member State whose flag the ship is flying up until such time as the operator of the ship recycling facility accepts responsibility for that ship. The operator of the ship recycling facility may decline to accept the ship for recycling if the condition of the ship does not correspond substantially with the particulars of the inventory certificate, including where Part I of the inventory of hazardous materials has not been properly maintained and updated, reflecting changes in the ship’s structure and equipment. In such circumstances, the ship owner shall retain responsibility for that ship and shall inform the administration thereof without delay.\nArticle 7\nShip recycling plan\n1.   A ship-specific ship recycling plan shall be developed prior to any recycling of a ship. The ship recycling plan shall address any ship-specific considerations that are not covered in the ship recycling facility plan or that require special procedures.\n2.   The ship recycling plan shall:\n(a)\nbe developed by the operator of the ship recycling facility in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Hong Kong Convention and taking into account the relevant IMO guidelines and the ship-relevant information provided by the ship owner in accordance with Article 6(1)(a) so that its contents are consistent with the information contained in the inventory of hazardous materials;\n(b)\nclarify whether and to what extent any preparatory work, such as pre-treatment, identification of potential hazards and removal of stores, is to take place at a location other than the ship recycling facility identified in the ship recycling plan. The ship recycling plan should include the location where the ship will be placed during recycling operations and a concise plan for the arrival and safe placement of the specific ship to be recycled;\n(c)\ninclude information concerning the establishment, maintenance and monitoring of the safe-for-entry and safe-for-hot work conditions for the specific ship, taking into account features such as its structure, configuration and previous cargo, and other necessary information on how the ship recycling plan is to be implemented;\n(d)\ninclude information on the type and amount of hazardous materials and of waste to be generated by the recycling of the specific ship, including the materials and the waste identified in the inventory of hazardous materials, and on how they will be managed and stored in the ship recycling facility as well as in subsequent facilities; and\n(e)\nbe prepared separately, in principle, for each ship recycling facility involved where more than one ship recycling facility is to be used, and identify the order of use and the authorised activities that will occur at those facilities.\n3.   The ship recycling plan shall be tacitly or explicitly approved by the competent authority in accordance with the requirements of the state where the ship recycling facility is located, where applicable.\nExplicit approval shall be given when the competent authority sends a written notification of its decision on the ship recycling plan to the operator of the ship recycling facility, the ship owner and the administration.\nTacit approval shall be deemed given, if no written objection to the ship recycling plan is communicated by the competent authority to the operator of the ship recycling facility, the ship owner and the administration within a review period laid down in accordance with the requirements of the state where the ship recycling facility is located, where applicable, and notified in accordance with Article 15(2)(b).\n4.   Member States may require their administration to send to the competent authority of the state where the ship recycling facility is located the information provided by the ship owner pursuant to Article 6(1)(b) and the following details:\n(i)\nthe date on which the ship was registered within the State whose flag it flies;\n(ii)\nthe ship’s identification number (IMO number);\n(iii)\nthe hull number on new-building delivery;\n(iv)\nthe name and type of the ship;\n(v)\nthe port at which the ship is registered;\n(vi)\nthe name and address of the ship owner as well as the IMO registered owner identification number;\n(vii)\nthe name and address of the company;\n(viii)\nthe name of any classification societies with which the ship is classed;\n(ix)\nthe ship’s main particulars (Length overall (LOA), Breadth (Moulded), Depth (Moulded), LDT, Gross and Net tonnage, and engine type and rating).\nArticle 8\nSurveys\n1.   Surveys of ships shall be carried out by officers of the administration, or of a recognised organisation authorised by it, taking into account the relevant IMO guidelines.\n2.   Where the administration uses recognised organisations to conduct surveys, as described in paragraph 1, it shall, as a minimum, empower such recognised organisations to:\n—\nrequire a ship that they survey to comply with this Regulation; and\n—\ncarry out surveys if requested by the appropriate authorities of a Member State.\n3.   Ships shall be subject to the following surveys:\n(a)\nan initial survey;\n(b)\na renewal survey;\n(c)\nan additional survey;\n(d)\na final survey.\n4.   The initial survey of a new ship shall be conducted before the ship is put in service, or before the inventory certificate is issued. For existing ships, an initial survey shall be conducted by 31 December 2020. The survey shall verify that Part I of the inventory of hazardous materials complies with the requirements of this Regulation.\n5.   The renewal survey shall be conducted at intervals specified by the administration, which shall not exceed five years. The renewal survey shall verify that Part I of the inventory of hazardous materials complies with the requirements of this Regulation.\n6.   The additional survey, either general or partial depending on the circumstances, shall be conducted if requested by the ship owner after a change, replacement or significant repair of the structure, equipment, systems, fittings, arrangements and material, which has an impact on the inventory of hazardous materials. The survey shall be such as to ensure that any change, replacement, or significant repair has been made in a manner that ensures that the ship continues to comply with the requirements of this Regulation, and that Part I of the inventory of hazardous materials is amended as necessary.\n7.   The final survey shall be conducted prior to the ship being taken out of service and before the recycling of the ship has started.\nThat survey shall verify that:\n(a)\nthe inventory of hazardous materials complies with the requirements of Article 5;\n(b)\nthe ship recycling plan properly reflects the information contained in the inventory of hazardous materials and complies with the requirements of Article 7;\n(c)\nthe ship recycling facility where the ship is to be recycled is included in the European List.\n8.   For existing ships intended for ship recycling, the initial survey and the final survey may be conducted at the same time.\nArticle 9\nIssuance and endorsement of certificates\n1.   After successful completion of an initial or renewal survey, the administration or a recognised organisation authorised by it shall issue an inventory certificate. That certificate shall be supplemented by Part I of the inventory of hazardous materials, referred to in Article 5(5)(a).\nWhere the initial survey and the final survey are conducted at the same time as provided for in Article 8(8), only the ready for recycling certificate referred to in paragraph 9 of this Article shall be issued.\nThe Commission shall adopt implementing acts to establish the format of the inventory certificate to ensure it is consistent with Appendix 3 to the Hong Kong Convention. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 25 of this Regulation.\n2.   An inventory certificate shall be endorsed at the request of the ship owner either by the administration or by a recognised organisation authorised by it after successful completion of an additional survey conducted in accordance with Article 8(6).\n3.   Subject to paragraph 4, the administration or recognised organisation authorised by it shall issue or endorse, as appropriate, an inventory certificate, where the renewal survey is successfully completed:\n(a)\nin the three month period before the expiry date of the existing inventory certificate, and the new certificate shall be valid from the date of completion of the renewal survey to a date not exceeding five years from the date of expiry of the existing one;\n(b)\nafter the expiry date of the existing inventory certificate, and the new certificate shall be valid from the date of completion of the renewal survey to a date not exceeding five years from the date of expiry of the existing one;\n(c)\nmore than three months before the expiry date of the existing inventory certificate, and the new certificate shall be valid from the date of completion of the renewal survey to a date not exceeding five years from the date of completion of the renewal survey.\n4.   Where a renewal survey has been successfully completed and a new inventory certificate cannot be issued or placed on board before the expiry date of the existing certificate, the administration or recognised organisation authorised by it shall endorse the existing certificate and such a certificate shall be accepted as valid for a further period which shall not exceed five months from the date of expiry.\n5.   In case of an inventory certificate issued for a period of less than five years, the administration or the recognised organisation authorised by it may extend the validity of the existing certificate for a further period which shall not exceed five years.\n6.   In special circumstances as determined by the administration, a new inventory certificate need not be dated from the date of expiry of the existing certificate as required by points (a) and (b) of paragraph 3 and paragraphs 7 and 8. In those circumstances, the new certificate shall be valid for a period not exceeding five years from the date of completion of the renewal survey.\n7.   Where a ship is not at the port or anchorage where it is to be surveyed when the inventory certificate expires, the administration may, if it is proper to do so, extend the period of validity of the inventory certificate for a period not exceeding three months to enable the ship to complete its voyage to the port in which it is to be surveyed. Any such extension granted shall be conditional on the survey being completed at that port before the ship leaves. A ship to which an extension is granted shall not, on its arrival in the port in which it is to be surveyed, be entitled, by virtue of such extension, to leave the port without having a new certificate. When the renewal survey is completed, the new inventory certificate shall be valid for a period not exceeding five years from the date of expiry of the existing certificate before the extension was granted.\n8.   An inventory certificate for a ship engaged on short voyages and which has not been extended under the conditions referred to in paragraph 7 may be extended by the administration for a period of grace of up to one month from its expiry. When the renewal survey is completed, the new inventory certificate shall be valid for a period not exceeding five years from the date of expiry of the existing certificate before the extension was granted.\n9.   After successful completion of a final survey in accordance with Article 8(7), the administration or a recognised organisation authorised by it shall issue a ready for recycling certificate. That certificate shall be supplemented by the inventory of hazardous materials and the ship recycling plan.\nThe Commission shall adopt implementing acts to establish the format of the ready for recycling certificate to ensure it is consistent with Appendix 4 to the Hong Kong Convention. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 25 of this Regulation. A ready for recycling certificate issued after a final survey in accordance with the first subparagraph of this paragraph shall be accepted by the other Member States and regarded for the purposes of this Regulation as having the same validity as a ready for recycling certificate issued by them.\nArticle 10\nDuration and validity of certificates\n1.   Subject to Article 9, an inventory certificate shall be issued for a period specified by the administration, which shall not exceed five years.\n2.   An inventory certificate issued or endorsed under Article 9 shall cease to be valid in any of the following cases:\n(a)\nif the condition of the ship does not correspond substantially with the particulars of that inventory certificate, including where Part I of the inventory of hazardous materials has not been properly maintained and updated, reflecting changes in ship structure and equipment, taking into account the relevant IMO guidelines;\n(b)\nwhere the renewal survey is not completed within the intervals specified in Article 8(5).\n3.   A ready for recycling certificate shall be issued by the administration or by a recognised organisation authorised by it for a period not exceeding three months.\n4.   A ready for recycling certificate issued under Article 9(9) shall cease to be valid where the condition of the ship does not correspond substantially with the particulars of the inventory certificate.\n5.   By way of derogation from paragraph 3, the ready for recycling certificate may be extended by the administration or by a recognised organisation authorised by it for a single point to point voyage to the ship recycling facility.\nArticle 11\nPort State control\n1.   Member States shall apply control provisions for ships in accordance with their national law having regard to Directive 2009/16/EC. Subject to paragraph 2, any such inspection shall be limited to checking that either an inventory certificate or a ready for recycling certificate is kept on board, which, if valid, shall be considered sufficient for the inspection to be approved.\n2.   A detailed inspection may be carried out by the relevant authority involved in port State control activities, taking into account the relevant IMO guidelines, where a ship does not carry a valid certificate or there are clear grounds for believing either that:\n(a)\nthe condition of the ship or its equipment does not correspond substantially with the particulars of that certificate, Part I of the inventory of hazardous materials, or both; or\n(b)\nthere is no procedure implemented on board the ship for the maintenance of Part I of the inventory of hazardous materials.\n3.   A ship may be warned, detained, dismissed or excluded from the ports or offshore terminals under the jurisdiction of a Member State in the event that it fails to submit to the relevant authorities of that Member State a copy of the inventory certificate or the ready for recycling certificate, as appropriate and on request of those authorities, without prejudice to Article 9. A Member State taking such action shall immediately inform the administration concerned. Failure to update the inventory of hazardous materials shall not constitute a detainable deficiency, but any inconsistencies in the inventory of hazardous materials shall be reported to the administration concerned and shall be rectified at the time of the next survey.\n4.   Access to a specific port or anchorage may be permitted by the relevant authority of a Member State in the event of force majeure or overriding safety considerations, or to reduce or minimise the risk of pollution or to have deficiencies rectified, provided that adequate measures to the satisfaction of the relevant authority of that Member State have been implemented by the owner, the operator or the master of the ship to ensure safe entry.\nArticle 12\nRequirements for ships flying the flag of a third country\n1.   Subject to point (b) of Article 32(2), when calling at a port or anchorage of a Member State, a ship flying the flag of a third country shall have on board an inventory of hazardous materials that complies with Article 5(2).\nNotwithstanding the first subparagraph, access to a specific port or anchorage may be permitted by the relevant authority of a Member State in the event of force majeure or overriding safety considerations, or to reduce or minimise the risk of pollution or to have deficiencies rectified, provided that adequate measures to the satisfaction of the relevant authority of that Member State have been implemented by the owner, the operator or the master of the ship to ensure safe entry.\n2.   The installation of hazardous materials referred to in Annex I on ships flying the flag of a third country, whilst in a port or anchorage of a Member State, shall be prohibited or restricted as specified in Annex I.\nThe use of hazardous materials referred to in Annex I on ships flying the flag of a third country, whilst in a port or anchorage of a Member State, shall be prohibited or restricted as specified in Annex I, without prejudice to the exemptions and transitional arrangements applicable to those materials under international law.\n3.   The inventory of hazardous materials shall be specific to each ship, be compiled taking into account the relevant IMO guidelines and serve to clarify that the ship complies with paragraph 2 of this Article. When the inventory of hazardous materials is developed it shall identify, at least, the hazardous materials listed in Annex I. A plan shall be established by the ship flying the flag of a third country describing the visual/sampling check by which the inventory of hazardous materials is developed taking into account the relevant IMO guidelines.\n4.   The inventory of hazardous materials shall be properly maintained and updated throughout the operational life of the ship, reflecting new installations containing any hazardous materials referred to in Annex II and relevant changes in the structure and equipment of the ship, taking into account the exemptions and transitional arrangements applicable to those materials under international law.\n5.   A ship flying the flag of a third country may be warned, detained, dismissed or excluded from the ports or offshore terminals under the jurisdiction of a Member State in the event that it fails to submit to the relevant authorities of that Member State a copy of the statement of compliance in accordance with paragraphs 6 and 7, together with the inventory of hazardous materials, as appropriate and on request from those authorities. A Member State taking such action shall immediately inform the relevant authorities of the third country whose flag the ship concerned is flying. Failure to update the inventory of hazardous materials shall not constitute a detainable deficiency, but any inconsistencies in the inventory of hazardous materials shall be reported to the relevant authorities of the third country whose flag that ship is flying.\n6.   The statement of compliance shall be issued after verification of the inventory of hazardous materials by the relevant authorities of the third country whose flag the ship is flying or an organisation authorised by them, in accordance with the national requirements. The statement of compliance may be modelled on the basis of Appendix 3 to the Hong Kong Convention.\n7.   The statement of compliance and the inventory of hazardous materials shall be drawn up in an official language of the issuing relevant authorities of the third country whose flag the ship is flying and where the language used is not English, French or Spanish, the text shall include a translation into one of those languages.\n8.   Subject to point (b) of Article 32(2), ships flying the flag of a third country applying to be registered under the flag of a Member State shall ensure that an inventory of hazardous materials, as provided for in Article 5(2), is kept on board or is established within six months of the registration under the flag of that Member State or during any of the next surveys under Article 8(3), whichever comes first.\nTITLE III\nSHIP RECYCLING FACILITIES\nArticle 13\nRequirements necessary for ship recycling facilities to be included in the European List\n1.   In order to be included in the European List, a ship recycling facility shall comply with the following requirements, in accordance with the relevant Hong Kong Convention provisions and taking into account the relevant guidelines of the IMO, the ILO, the Basel Convention and of the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants and of other international guidelines:\n(a)\nit is authorised by its competent authorities to conduct ship recycling operations;\n(b)\nit is designed, constructed and operated in a safe and environmentally sound manner;\n(c)\nit operates from built structures;\n(d)\nit establishes management and monitoring systems, procedures and techniques which have the purpose of preventing, reducing, minimising and to the extent practicable eliminating:\n(i)\nhealth risks to the workers concerned and to the population in the vicinity of the ship recycling facility, and\n(ii)\nadverse effects on the environment caused by ship recycling;\n(e)\nit prepares a ship recycling facility plan;\n(f)\nit prevents adverse effects on human health and the environment, including the demonstration of the control of any leakage, in particular in intertidal zones;\n(g)\nit ensures safe and environmentally sound management and storage of hazardous materials and waste, including:\n(i)\nthe containment of all hazardous materials present on board during the entire ship recycling process so as to prevent any release of those materials into the environment; and in addition, the handling of hazardous materials, and of waste generated during the ship recycling process, only on impermeable floors with effective drainage systems;\n(ii)\nthat all waste generated from the ship recycling activity and their quantities are documented and are only transferred to waste management facilities, including waste recycling facilities, authorised to deal with their treatment without endangering human health and in an environmentally sound manner;\n(h)\nit establishes and maintain an emergency preparedness and response plan; ensures rapid access for emergency response equipment, such as fire-fighting equipment and vehicles, ambulances and cranes, to the ship and all areas of the ship recycling facility;\n(i)\nit provides for worker safety and training, including ensuring the use of personal protective equipment for operations requiring such use;\n(j)\nit establishes records on incidents, accidents, occupational diseases and chronic effects and, if requested by its competent authorities, reports any incidents, accidents, occupational diseases or chronic effects causing, or with the potential for causing, risks to workers’ safety, human health and the environment;\n(k)\nit agrees to comply with the requirements of paragraph 2.\n2.   The operator of a ship recycling facility shall:\n(a)\nsend the ship recycling plan, once approved in accordance with Article 7(3), to the ship owner and the administration or a recognised organisation authorised by it;\n(b)\nreport to the administration that the ship recycling facility is ready in every respect to start the recycling of the ship;\n(c)\nwhen the total or partial recycling of a ship is completed in accordance with this Regulation, within 14 days of the date of the total or partial recycling in accordance with the ship recycling plan, send a statement of completion to the administration which issued the ready for recycling certificate for the ship. The statement of completion shall include a report on incidents and accidents damaging human health and/or the environment, if any.\n3.   The Commission shall adopt implementing acts to establish the format of:\n(a)\nthe report required by point (b) of paragraph 2 of this Article to ensure it is consistent with Appendix 6 to the Hong Kong Convention; and\n(b)\nthe statement required by point (c) of paragraph 2 of this Article to ensure it is consistent with Appendix 7 to the Hong Kong Convention.\nThose implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 25 of this Regulation.\nArticle 14\nAuthorisation of ship recycling facilities located in a Member State\n1.   Without prejudice to other relevant provisions of Union law, competent authorities shall authorise ship recycling facilities located on their territory that comply with the requirements set out in Article 13 to conduct ship recycling. That authorisation may be granted to the respective ship recycling facilities for a maximum period of five years and renewed accordingly.\nProvided that the requirements of this Regulation are complied with, any permit produced pursuant to other relevant national or Union law provisions may be combined with the authorisation under this Article to form a single permit, where such a format obviates the unnecessary duplication of information and the duplication of work by the operator of the ship recycling facility or the ship recycling company or the competent authority. In those cases the authorisation may be extended in accordance with the permit regime referred to in the first subparagraph, but not exceeding a maximum period of five years.\n2.   Member States shall establish and update a list of the ship recycling facilities that they have authorised in accordance with paragraph 1.\n3.   The list referred to in paragraph 2 shall be communicated to the Commission without delay and not later than 31 March 2015.\n4.   Where a ship recycling facility ceases to comply with the requirements set out in Article 13, the Member State where that ship recycling facility is located shall suspend or withdraw the authorisation given to it or require corrective actions by the ship recycling company concerned and shall inform the Commission thereof without delay.\n5.   Where a ship recycling facility has been authorised in accordance with paragraph 1, the Member State concerned shall inform the Commission thereof without delay.\nArticle 15\nShip recycling facilities located in a third country\n1.   A ship recycling company owning a ship recycling facility located in a third country and intending to recycle ships flying the flag of a Member State shall submit an application to the Commission for inclusion of that ship recycling facility in the European List.\n2.

recycling\nSUMMARY OF:\nRegulation (EU) No 1257/2013 on ship recycling\nWHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?\n              \nIt aims to prevent, reduce and minimise accidents, injuries and other negative effects on human health and the environment when ships are recycled and the hazardous waste they contain is removed.\nKEY POINTS\nThe legislation applies to all ships flying the flag of an EU country and to vessels with non-EU flags that call at an EU port or anchorage. The only exceptions are warships, other vessels on non-commercial government service and ships below 500 gross tonnes. It sets out responsibilities for ship owners and for recycling facilities both in the EU and in other countries.\nEvery new ship has to have on board an inventory of the hazardous materials (such as asbestos, lead or mercury) it contains in either its structure or equipment. The use of certain hazardous materials is forbidden.\nBefore a ship is recycled, its owner must provide the company carrying out the work with specific information about the vessel and prepare a ship recycling plan. This, for instance, identifies the type and amount of hazardous materials and waste that will be generated from the obsolete vessel.\nRecycling may only take place at facilities listed on the EU List of facilities, which was launched by Commission Implementing Decision (EU) 2016/2323. The facilities may be located in the EU or in non-EU countries. They must comply with a series of requirements related to workers' safety and environmental protection.\nThese requirements are designed to prevent health risks to the workers involved and the neighbouring population and to minimise any adverse effects on the environment. They also provide for specific training and protective equipment for employees dismantling the vessels and require a record to be kept of any incidents or accidents.\nThe legislation contains an authorisation process for ship recycling yards within the EU. Those in other countries must submit an application to the European Commission and demonstrate that they fulfil all the criteria in the regulation.\nIn 2014, the Council Decision 2014/241/EU was adopted, authorising EU countries having ships flying their flag or registered under their flag to ratify or to accede to the Hong Kong International Convention for the Safe and Environmentally Sound Recycling of Ships. The Convention covers the design and construction of ships so as to facilitate safe and environmentally-sound recycling without compromising ship safety and operational efficiency. It also requires ship recycling facilities to operate in a safe and environmentally-friendly manner, and for mechanisms to be set up to ensure that ship recycling rules are complied with.\nEU countries must submit reports on ship recycling every 3 years, including information such as lists of ships to which a ready for recycling certificate has been issued and information on illegal ship recycling. Amending Decision (EU) 2018/853 establishes that reports should cover three years.\nFROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?\n              \nIt has applied since 31 December 2014. However, some rules apply from 31 December 2020.\nBACKGROUND\n              \nFor more information, see:\nShip recycling (European Commission).\nMAIN DOCUMENT\n            \nRegulation (EU) No 1257/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 November 2013 on ship recycling and amending Regulation (EC) No 1013/2006 and Directive 2009/16/EC (OJ L 330, 10.12.2013, pp. 1-20)\nSuccessive amendments to Regulation (EU) No 1257/2013 have been incorporated into the original text.
