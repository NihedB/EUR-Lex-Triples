{"celex_id": "32009R1107", "reference": "24.11.2009\nEN\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\nL 309/1\nREGULATION (EC) No 1107/2009 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL\nof 21 October 2009\nconcerning the placing of plant protection products on the market and repealing Council Directives 79/117/EEC and 91/414/EEC\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 37(2), Article 95 and Article 152(4)(b) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the Commission,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee (1),\nHaving regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions (2),\nActing in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty (3),\nWhereas:\n(1)\nCouncil Directive 91/414/EEC of 15 July 1991 concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market (4) provides for rules governing plant protection products and the active substances contained in those products.\n(2)\nFollowing the progress report presented by the Commission under Directive 91/414/EEC, the European Parliament by its Resolution of 30 May 2002 (5) and the Council in its Conclusions of 12 December 2001 asked the Commission to review Directive 91/414/EEC and identified a number of issues for the Commission to address.\n(3)\nIn the light of the experience gained from the application of Directive 91/414/EEC and of recent scientific and technical developments, that Directive should be replaced.\n(4)\nBy way of simplification, the new act should also repeal Council Directive 79/117/EEC of 21 December 1978 prohibiting the placing on the market and use of plant protection products containing certain active substances (6).\n(5)\nTo simplify application of the new act and to ensure consistency throughout the Member States, it should take the form of a Regulation.\n(6)\nPlant production has a very important place in the Community. One of the most important ways of protecting plants and plant products against harmful organisms, including weeds, and of improving agricultural production is the use of plant protection products.\n(7)\nPlant protection products can however also have non-beneficial effects on plant production. Their use may involve risks and hazards for humans, animals and the environment, especially if placed on the market without having been officially tested and authorised and if incorrectly used.\n(8)\nThe purpose of this Regulation is to ensure a high level of protection of both human and animal health and the environment and at the same time to safeguard the competitiveness of Community agriculture. Particular attention should be paid to the protection of vulnerable groups of the population, including pregnant women, infants and children. The precautionary principle should be applied and this Regulation should ensure that industry demonstrates that substances or products produced or placed on the market do not have any harmful effect on human or animal health or any unacceptable effects on the environment.\n(9)\nIn order to remove as far as possible obstacles to trade in plant protection products existing due to the different levels of protection in the Member States, this Regulation should also lay down harmonised rules for the approval of active substances and the placing on the market of plant protection products, including the rules on the mutual recognition of authorisations and on parallel trade. The purpose of this Regulation is thus to increase the free movement of such products and availability of these products in the Member States.\n(10)\nSubstances should only be included in plant protection products where it has been demonstrated that they present a clear benefit for plant production and they are not expected to have any harmful effect on human or animal health or any unacceptable effects on the environment. In order to achieve the same level of protection in all Member States, the decision on acceptability or non-acceptability of such substances should be taken at Community level on the basis of harmonised criteria. These criteria should be applied for the first approval of an active substance under this Regulation. For active substances already approved, the criteria should be applied at the time of renewal or review of their approval.\n(11)\nThe development of non-animal test methods should be promoted in order to produce safety data relevant to humans and to replace animal studies currently in use.\n(12)\nIn the interest of predictability, efficiency and consistency, a detailed procedure should be laid down for assessing whether an active substance can be approved. The information to be submitted by interested parties for the purposes of approval of a substance should be specified. In view of the amount of work connected with the approval procedure, it is appropriate that the evaluation of such information be performed by a Member State acting as a rapporteur for the Community. To ensure consistency in evaluation, an independent scientific review should be performed by the European Food Safety Authority established by Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 28 January 2002 laying down the general principles and requirements of food law, establishing the European Food Safety Authority and laying down procedures in matters of food safety (7) (the Authority). It should be clarified that the Authority performs a risk assessment whilst the Commission should perform the risk management role and take the final decision on an active substance. Provisions should be included to ensure the transparency of the evaluation process.\n(13)\nFor ethical reasons, the assessment of an active substance or a plant protection product should not be based on tests or studies involving the deliberate administration of the active substance or plant protection product to humans with the purpose of determining a human ‘no observed effect level’ of an active substance. Similarly, toxicological studies carried out on humans should not be used to lower the safety margins for active substances or plant protection products.\n(14)\nTo speed up the approval of active substances, strict deadlines should be established for the different procedural steps.\n(15)\nIn the interest of safety, the approval period for active substances should be limited in time. The approval period should be proportionate to the possible risks inherent in the use of such substances. Experience gained from the actual use of plant protection products containing the substances concerned and any developments in science and technology should be taken into account when any decision regarding the renewal of an approval is taken. The renewal of the approval should be for a period not exceeding 15 years.\n(16)\nThe possibility of amending or withdrawing the approval of an active substance in cases where the criteria for approval are no longer satisfied, or where compliance with Directive 2000/60/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 October 2000 establishing a framework for Community action in the field of water policy (8) is compromised, should be provided for under certain conditions.\n(17)\nThe evaluation of an active substance may reveal that it presents considerably less of a risk than other substances. In order to favour the inclusion of such a substance in plant protection products, it is appropriate to identify such substances and to facilitate the placing on the market of plant protection products containing them. Incentives should be given for the placing on the market of low-risk plant protection products.\n(18)\nCertain substances which are not predominantly used as plant protection products may be of value for plant protection, but the economic interest of applying for approval may be limited. Therefore, specific provisions should ensure that such substances, as far as their risks are acceptable, may also be approved for plant protection use.\n(19)\nSome active substances with certain properties should be identified at Community level as candidates for substitution. Member States should regularly examine plant protection products containing such active substances with the aim of replacing them by plant protection products containing active substances which require less risk mitigation or by non-chemical control or prevention methods.\n(20)\nIn certain Member States non-chemical control or prevention methods, which are significantly safer for human and animal health and for the environment, have been established and generally applied for certain uses. In exceptional cases Member States should also be able to apply the comparative assessment when granting authorisation for plant protection products.\n(21)\nIn addition to active substances, plant protection products may contain safeners or synergists for which similar rules should be provided. The technical rules necessary for the evaluation of such substances should be established. Substances currently on the market should only be evaluated after those rules have been established.\n(22)\nPlant protection products may also contain co-formulants. It is appropriate to provide a list of co-formulants which should not be included in plant protection products.\n(23)\nPlant protection products containing active substances can be formulated in many ways and used on a variety of plants and plant products, under different agricultural, plant health and environmental (including climatic) conditions. Authorisations for plant protection products should therefore be granted by Member States.\n(24)\nThe provisions governing authorisation must ensure a high standard of protection. In particular, when granting authorisations of plant protection products, the objective of protecting human and animal health and the environment should take priority over the objective of improving plant production. Therefore, it should be demonstrated, before plant protection products are placed on the market, that they present a clear benefit for plant production and do not have any harmful effect on human or animal health, including that of vulnerable groups, or any unacceptable effects on the environment.\n(25)\nIn the interest of predictability, efficiency and consistency, criteria, procedures and conditions for the authorisation of plant protection products should be harmonised, account being taken of the general principles of protection of human and animal health and the environment.\n(26)\nWhere the decision on approval cannot be finalised within the period provided for due to reasons not falling under the responsibility of the applicant, Member States should be able to grant the provisional authorisations for a limited period in order to facilitate the transition to the approval procedure provided for under this Regulation. In the light of the experience gained from the approval of the active substances under this Regulation, the provisions on provisional authorisations should cease to apply or be extended after the period of five years, if necessary.\n(27)\nThe active substances contained in a plant protection product can be produced by different manufacturing processes, leading to differences in specifications. Such differences may have safety implications. For efficiency reasons, a harmonised procedure at Community level should be provided for the assessment of those differences.\n(28)\nGood administrative cooperation between Member States should be increased during all steps of the authorisation procedure.\n(29)\nThe principle of mutual recognition is one of the means of ensuring the free movement of goods within the Community. To avoid any duplication of work, to reduce the administrative burden for industry and for Member States and to provide for more harmonised availability of plant protection products, authorisations granted by one Member State should be accepted by other Member States where agricultural, plant health and environmental (including climatic) conditions are comparable. Therefore, the Community should be divided into zones with such comparable conditions in order to facilitate such mutual recognition. However, environmental or agricultural circumstances specific to the territory of one or more Member States might require that, on application, Member States recognise or amend an authorisation issued by another Member State, or refuse to authorise the plant protection product in their territory, where justified as a result of specific environmental or agricultural circumstances or where the high level of protection of both human and animal health and the environment required by this Regulation cannot be achieved. It should also be possible to impose appropriate conditions having regard to the objectives laid down in the National Action Plan adopted in accordance with Directive 2009/128/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 October 2009 establishing a framework for Community action to achieve a sustainable use of pesticides (9).\n(30)\nThe economic incentive for industry to apply for an authorisation is limited for certain uses. In order to ensure that diversification of agriculture and horticulture is not jeopardised by the lack of availability of plant protection products, specific rules should be established for minor uses.\n(31)\nWhere identical plant protection products are authorised in different Member States, a simplified procedure for granting a parallel trade permit should be provided for in this Regulation, in order to facilitate the trade between Member States of such products.\n(32)\nIn exceptional cases, Member States should be permitted to authorise plant protection products not complying with the conditions provided for in this Regulation, where it is necessary to do so because of a danger or threat to plant production or ecosystems which cannot be contained by any other reasonable means. Such temporary authorisations should be reviewed at Community level.\n(33)\nCommunity seeds legislation provides for free movement of seeds within the Community but does not contain a specific provision concerning seeds treated with plant protection products. Such a provision should therefore be included in this Regulation. If treated seeds constitute a serious risk to human or animal health or to the environment, Member States should have the possibility of taking protective measures.\n(34)\nTo promote innovation, special rules should be established permitting the use of plant protection products in experiments even where they have not yet been authorised.\n(35)\nTo ensure a high level of protection of human and animal health and the environment, plant protection products should be used properly, in accordance with their authorisation, having regard to the principles of integrated pest management and giving priority to non-chemical and natural alternatives wherever possible. The Council should include in the statutory management requirement referred to in Annex III to Council Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 of 29 September 2003 establishing common rules for direct support schemes under the common agricultural policy and establishing certain support schemes for farmers (10), the principles of integrated pest management, including good plant protection practice and non-chemical methods of plant protection and pest and crop management.\n(36)\nIn addition to this Regulation and Directive 2009/128/EC, a thematic strategy on the sustainable use of pesticides was adopted. In order to achieve coherence between these instruments, the user should know from the product label where, when and under what circumstances a plant protection product may be used.\n(37)\nA system of exchange of information should be established. Member States should make available to each other, the Commission and the Authority the particulars and scientific documentation submitted in connection with applications for authorisation of plant protection products.\n(38)\nAdjuvants may be used to increase the efficacy of a plant protection product. Their placing on the market or use should be forbidden where they contain a co-formulant which has been prohibited. The technical rules necessary for the authorisation should be established.\n(39)\nStudies represent a major investment. This investment should be protected in order to stimulate research. For this reason, tests and studies, other than those involving vertebrate animals, which will be subject to obligatory data sharing, lodged by one applicant with a Member State should be protected against use by another applicant. This protection should, however, be limited in time in order to allow competition. It should also be limited to studies which are genuinely necessary for regulatory purposes, to avoid applicants artificially extending the period of protection by submitting new studies which are not necessary. Business operators, in particular small and medium sized enterprises, should have the same opportunities in respect of market access.\n(40)\nThe use of non-animal test methods and other risk assessment strategies should be promoted. Animal testing for the purposes of this Regulation should be minimised and tests on vertebrates should be undertaken as a last resort. In accordance with Council Directive 86/609/EEC of 24 November 1986 on the approximation of laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States regarding the protection of animals used for experimental and other scientific purposes (11), tests on vertebrate animals must be replaced, restricted or refined. Therefore, rules should be laid down to avoid duplicative testing and duplication of tests and studies on vertebrates should be prohibited. For the purpose of developing new plant protection products, there should be an obligation to allow access to studies on vertebrates on reasonable terms and the results and the costs of tests and studies on animals should be shared. In order to allow operators to know what studies have been carried out by others, Member States should keep a list of such studies even where they are not covered by the above system of compulsory access.\n(41)\nAs different rules are applied by Member States, the Commission and the Authority in relation to access to and confidentiality of documents, it is appropriate to clarify the provisions concerning access to information contained in the documents in the possession of these authorities and the confidentiality of these documents.\n(42)\nDirective 1999/45/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 31 May 1999 concerning the approximation of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States relating to the classification, packaging and labelling of dangerous preparations (12) applies to the classification, packaging and labelling of plant protection products. However, to improve further the protection of users of plant protection products, of consumers of plants and plant products and of the environment, further specific rules are appropriate which take account of the specific conditions of use of plant protection products.\n(43)\nTo ensure that advertisements do not mislead users of plant protection products or the public, it is appropriate to lay down rules on the advertising of those products.\n(44)\nProvisions on record-keeping and information about the use of plant protection products should be established in order to raise the level of protection of human and animal health and the environment by ensuring the traceability of potential exposure, to increase the efficiency of monitoring and control and to reduce the costs of monitoring water quality.\n(45)\nProvisions on control and inspection arrangements with regard to the marketing and use of plant protection products should ensure correct, safe and harmonised implementation of the requirements laid down in this Regulation in order to achieve a high level of protection of both human and animal health and the environment.\n(46)\nRegulation (EC) No 882/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on official controls performed to ensure the verification of compliance with feed and food law, animal health and animal welfare rules (13) provides for control measures for the use of plant protection products at all stages of the production of food, including record-keeping on the use of plant protection products. Similar rules on monitoring and controls relating to the storage and use of plant protection products not covered by Regulation (EC) No 882/2004 should be adopted by the Commission. The bureaucratic burden on farmers should be as limited as possible.\n(47)\nThe measures provided for in this Regulation should apply without prejudice to other Community legislation, in particular Directive 2009/128/EC, Directive 2000/60/EC, Regulation (EC) No 396/2005 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 February 2005 on maximum residue levels of pesticides in or on food and feed of plant and animal origin (14) and Community legislation on the protection of workers and anyone concerned with the contained use and deliberate release of genetically modified organisms.\n(48)\nIt is necessary to establish procedures for the adoption of emergency measures in situations where an approved active substance, a safener, a synergist or a plant protection product is likely to constitute a serious risk to human or animal health or the environment.\n(49)\nMember States should lay down rules on penalties applicable to infringements of this Regulation and should take the measures necessary to ensure that they are implemented.\n(50)\nGeneral civil and criminal liability in the Member States of the manufacturer and, where applicable, of the person responsible for placing the plant protection product on the market or using it should remain applicable.\n(51)\nMember States should have the possibility of recovering the costs of the procedures associated with the application of this Regulation from those seeking to place, or placing, plant protection products or adjuvants on the market and from those applying for the approval of active substances, safeners or synergists.\n(52)\nMember States should designate the necessary national competent authorities.\n(53)\nThe Commission should facilitate the application of this Regulation. Therefore, it is appropriate to provide for the necessary financial resources and the possibility of amending certain provisions of this Regulation in the light of experience or of developing technical notes for guidance.\n(54)\nThe measures necessary for the implementation of this Regulation should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission (15).\n(55)\nIn particular, the Commission should be empowered to adopt harmonised methods to determine the nature and quantity of active substances, safeners and synergists, and where appropriate of relevant impurities and co-formulants, and maximum quantities of plant protection products to be released, and to adopt Regulations concerning labelling requirements, controls and rules for adjuvants, establishing a work programme for safeners and synergists, including their data requirements, postponing the expiry of the approval period, extending the date for provisional authorisations, setting the information requirements for parallel trade and on inclusion of co-formulants, as well as amendments to the Regulations on data requirements and on uniform principles for evaluation and authorisation and to the Annexes. Since those measures are of general scope and are designed to amend non-essential elements of this Regulation, inter alia, by supplementing it with new non-essential elements, they must be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny provided for in Article 5a of Decision 1999/468/EC.\n(56)\nOn grounds of efficiency, the normal time limits for the regulatory procedure with scrutiny should be curtailed for the adoption of a Regulation postponing the expiry of the approval period for a period sufficient to examine the application.\n(57)\nFurthermore, it is appropriate to transfer certain current provisions set out in the Annexes to Directive 91/414/EEC into separate legal instruments to be adopted by the Commission within 18 months after the entry into force of this Regulation. Since these current provisions should be, as a first step, transferred into new legal instruments and thus be adopted without any substantial modification, the advisory procedure is the most appropriate.\n(58)\nIt is also appropriate to use the advisory procedure to adopt some purely technical measures, in particular technical guidelines in view of their non-binding character.\n(59)\nCertain provisions of Directive 91/414/EEC should remain applicable during the transitional period,\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nCHAPTER I\nGENERAL PROVISIONS\nArticle 1\nSubject matter and purpose\n1.   This Regulation lays down rules for the authorisation of plant protection products in commercial form and for their placing on the market, use and control within the Community.\n2.   This Regulation lays down both rules for the approval of active substances, safeners and synergists, which plant protection products contain or consist of, and rules for adjuvants and co-formulants.\n3.   The purpose of this Regulation is to ensure a high level of protection of both human and animal health and the environment and to improve the functioning of the internal market through the harmonisation of the rules on the placing on the market of plant protection products, while improving agricultural production.\n4.   The provisions of this Regulation are underpinned by the precautionary principle in order to ensure that active substances or products placed on the market do not adversely affect human or animal health or the environment. In particular, Member States shall not be prevented from applying the precautionary principle where there is scientific uncertainty as to the risks with regard to human or animal health or the environment posed by the plant protection products to be authorised in their territory.\nArticle 2\nScope\n1.   This Regulation shall apply to products, in the form in which they are supplied to the user, consisting of or containing active substances, safeners or synergists, and intended for one of the following uses:\n(a)\nprotecting plants or plant products against all harmful organisms or preventing the action of such organisms, unless the main purpose of these products is considered to be for reasons of hygiene rather than for the protection of plants or plant products;\n(b)\ninfluencing the life processes of plants, such as substances influencing their growth, other than as a nutrient;\n(c)\npreserving plant products, in so far as such substances or products are not subject to special Community provisions on preservatives;\n(d)\ndestroying undesired plants or parts of plants, except algae unless the products are applied on soil or water to protect plants;\n(e)\nchecking or preventing undesired growth of plants, except algae unless the products are applied on soil or water to protect plants.\nThese products are referred to as ‘plant protection products’.\n2.   This Regulation shall apply to substances, including micro-organisms having general or specific action against harmful organisms or on plants, parts of plants or plant products, referred to as ‘active substances’.\n3.   This Regulation shall apply to the following:\n(a)\nsubstances or preparations which are added to a plant protection product to eliminate or reduce phytotoxic effects of the plant protection product on certain plants, referred to as ‘safeners’;\n(b)\nsubstances or preparations which, while showing no or only weak activity as referred to in paragraph 1, can give enhanced activity to the active substance(s) in a plant protection product, referred to as ‘synergists’;\n(c)\nsubstances or preparations which are used or intended to be used in a plant protection product or adjuvant, but are neither active substances nor safeners or synergists, referred to as ‘co-formulants’;\n(d)\nsubstances or preparations which consist of co-formulants or preparations containing one or more co-formulants, in the form in which they are supplied to the user and placed on the market to be mixed by the user with a plant protection product and which enhance its effectiveness or other pesticidal properties, referred to as ‘adjuvants’.\nArticle 3\nDefinitions\nFor the purposes of this Regulation, the following definitions shall apply:\n1.\n‘residues’ means one or more substances present in or on plants or plant products, edible animal products, drinking water or elsewhere in the environment and resulting from the use of a plant protection product, including their metabolites, breakdown or reaction products;\n2.\n‘substances’ means chemical elements and their compounds, as they occur naturally or by manufacture, including any impurity inevitably resulting from the manufacturing process;\n3.\n‘preparations’ means mixtures or solutions composed of two or more substances intended for use as a plant protection product or as an adjuvant;\n4.\n‘substance of concern’ means any substance which has an inherent capacity to cause an adverse effect on humans, animals or the environment and is present or is produced in a plant protection product in sufficient concentration to present risks of such an effect.\nSuch substances include, but are not limited to, substances meeting the criteria to be classified as hazardous in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 December 2008 on classification, labelling and packaging of substances and mixtures (16), and present in the plant protection product at a concentration leading the product to be regarded as dangerous within the meaning of Article 3 of Directive 1999/45/EC;\n5.\n‘plants’ means live plants and live parts of plants, including fresh fruit, vegetables and seeds;\n6.\n‘plant products’ means products of plant origin in an unprocessed state or having undergone only simple preparation, such as milling, drying or pressing, but excluding plants;\n7.\n‘harmful organisms’ means any species, strain or biotype belonging to the animal kingdom or plant kingdom or pathogenic agent injurious to plants or plant products;\n8.\n‘non-chemical methods’ means alternative methods to chemical pesticides for plant protection and pest management, based on agronomic techniques such as those referred to in point 1 of Annex III to Directive 2009/128/EC, or physical, mechanical or biological pest control methods;\n9.\n‘placing on the market’ means the holding for the purpose of sale within the Community, including offering for sale or any other form of transfer, whether free of charge or not, and the sale, distribution, and other forms of transfer themselves, but not the return to the previous seller.

These include pregnant and nursing women, the unborn, infants and children, the elderly and workers and residents subject to high pesticide exposure over the long term;\n15.\n‘micro-organisms’ means any microbiological entity, including lower fungi and viruses, cellular or non-cellular, capable of replication or of transferring genetic material;\n16.\n‘genetically modified organisms’ means organisms in which the genetic material has been altered within the meaning of Article 2(2) of Directive 2001/18/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 March 2001 on the deliberate release into the environment of genetically modified organisms (17);\n17.\n‘zone’ means a group of Member States as defined in Annex I.\nFor the purpose of use in greenhouses, as post-harvest treatment, for treatment of empty storage rooms and for seed treatment the zone means all zones defined in Annex I;\n18.\n‘good plant protection practice’ means a practice whereby the treatments with plant protection products applied to given plants or plant products, in conformity with the conditions of their authorised uses, are selected, dosed and timed to ensure acceptable efficacy with the minimum quantity necessary, taking due account of local conditions and of the possibilities for cultural and biological control;\n19.\n‘good laboratory practice’ means a practice as defined in point 2.1 of Annex I to Directive 2004/10/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 February 2004 on the harmonisation of laws, regulations and administrative provisions relating to the application of the principles of good laboratory practice and the verification of their applications for tests on chemical substances (18);\n20.\n‘good experimental practice’ means a practice in accordance with the provisions of European and Mediterranean Plant Protection Organisation (EPPO) Guidelines 181 and 152;\n21.\n‘data protection’ means the temporary right of the owner of a test or study report to prevent it being used for the benefit of another applicant;\n22.\n‘rapporteur Member State’ means the Member State which undertakes the task of evaluating an active substance, safener or synergist;\n23.\n‘tests and studies’ means investigations or experiments whose purpose is to determine the properties and behaviour of an active substance or of plant protection products, predict exposure to active substances and/or their relevant metabolites, determine safe levels of exposure and establish conditions for the safe use of plant protection products;\n24.\n‘authorisation holder’ means any natural or legal person holding an authorisation of a plant protection product;\n25.\n‘professional user’ means a professional user as defined in Article 3(1) of Directive 2009/128/EC;\n26.\n‘minor use’ means use of a plant protection product in a particular Member State on plants or plant products which are:\n(a)\nnot widely grown in that Member State; or\n(b)\nwidely grown, to meet an exceptional plant protection need;\n27.\n‘greenhouse’ means a walk-in, static, closed place of crop production with a usually translucent outer shell, which allows controlled exchange of material and energy with the surroundings and prevents release of plant protection products into the environment.\nFor the purpose of this Regulation, closed places of plant production where the outer shell is not translucent (for example, for production of mushrooms or witloof) are also considered as greenhouses;\n28.\n‘post-harvest treatment’ means treatment of plants or plant products after harvest in an isolated space where no run-off is possible, for example in a warehouse;\n29.\n‘biodiversity’ means variability among living organisms from all sources, including terrestrial, marine and other aquatic ecosystems and the ecological complexes of which they are part; this variability may include diversity within species, between species and of ecosystems;\n30.\n‘competent authority’ means any authority or authorities of a Member State responsible for carrying out the tasks established under this Regulation;\n31.\n‘advertisement’ means a means of promoting the sale or use of plant protection products (to anyone other than the authorisation holder, the person placing the plant protection product on the market and their agents) by printed or electronic media;\n32.\n‘metabolite’ means any metabolite or a degradation product of an active substance, safener or synergist, formed either in organisms or in the environment.\nA metabolite is deemed relevant if there is a reason to assume that it has intrinsic properties comparable to the parent substance in terms of its biological target activity, or that it poses a higher or comparable risk to organisms than the parent substance or that it has certain toxicological properties that are considered unacceptable. Such a metabolite is relevant for the overall approval decision or for the definition of risk mitigation measures;\n33.\n‘impurity’ means any component other than the pure active substance and/or variant which is present in the technical material (including components originating from the manufacturing process or from degradation during storage).\nCHAPTER II\nACTIVE SUBSTANCES, SAFENERS, SYNERGISTS AND CO-FORMULANTS\nSECTION 1\nActive substances\nSubsection 1\nRequirements and conditions for approval\nArticle 4\nApproval criteria for active substances\n1.   An active substance shall be approved in accordance with Annex II if it may be expected, in the light of current scientific and technical knowledge, that, taking into account the approval criteria set out in points 2 and 3 of that Annex, plant protection products containing that active substance meet the requirements provided for in paragraphs 2 and 3.\nThe assessment of the active substance shall first establish whether the approval criteria set out in points 3.6.2 to 3.6.4 and 3.7 of Annex II are satisfied. If these criteria are satisfied the assessment shall continue to establish whether the other approval criteria set out in points 2 and 3 of Annex II are satisfied.\n2.

Authorisations may be granted for shorter periods to synchronise the re-evaluation of similar products for the purposes of a comparative assessment of products containing candidates for substitution as provided for in Article 50.\nSubsection 2\nProcedure\nArticle 33\nApplication for authorisation or amendment of an authorisation\n1.   An applicant who wishes to place a plant protection product on the market shall apply for an authorisation or amendment of an authorisation himself, or through a representative, to each Member State where the plant protection product is intended to be placed on the market.\n2.   The application shall include the following:\n(a)\na list of intended uses in each zone as indicated in Annex I and the Member States where the applicant has made or intends to make an application;\n(b)\na proposal as to which Member State the applicant expects to evaluate the application in the zone concerned. In the case of an application for use in greenhouses, as post-harvest treatment, for treatment of empty storage rooms and for seed treatment, only one Member State shall be proposed, which evaluates the application taking account of all zones. In this case the applicant shall send the summary or complete dossier as referred to in Article 8 to other Member States on request;\n(c)\nwhere relevant, a copy of any authorisations already granted for that plant protection product in a Member State;\n(d)\nwhere relevant, a copy of any conclusion of the Member State assessing equivalence as referred to in Article 38(2).\n3.   The application shall be accompanied by the following:\n(a)\nfor the plant protection product concerned, a complete and a summary dossier for each point of the data requirements of the plant protection product;\n(b)\nfor each active substance, safener and synergist contained in the plant protection product, a complete and a summary dossier for each point of the data requirements of the active substance, safener and synergist;\n(c)\nfor each test or study involving vertebrate animals, a justification of the steps taken to avoid animal testing and duplication of tests and studies on vertebrate animals;\n(d)\nthe reasons why the test and study reports submitted are necessary for first authorisation or for amendments to the conditions of the authorisation;\n(e)\nwhere relevant a copy of the application for a maximum residue level as referred to in Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 396/2005 or a justification for not supplying such information;\n(f)\nwhere relevant for an amendment of an authorisation an assessment of all information submitted in accordance with point (h) of Article 8(1);\n(g)\na draft label.\n4.   When submitting the application, the applicant may pursuant to Article 63, request certain information, including certain parts of the dossier, to be kept confidential and shall physically separate that information.\nThe applicant shall at the same time submit the complete list of studies submitted pursuant to Article 8(2) and a list of test and study reports for which any claims for data protection pursuant to Article 59 are requested.\nUpon a request for access to information the Member State examining the application shall decide what information is to be kept confidential.\n5.   Where requested by the Member State the applicant shall submit his application in the national or official languages of that Member State or one of those languages.\n6.   On request, the applicant shall provide the Member State with samples of the plant protection product and analytical standards of its ingredients.\nArticle 34\nExemption from the submission of studies\n1.   Applicants shall be exempted from supplying the test and study reports referred to in Article 33(3) where the Member State to which an application is made has the test and study reports concerned and the applicants demonstrate that they have been granted access in accordance with Article 59, 61 or 62 or that any data protection period has expired.\n2.   However, applicants to whom paragraph 1 applies shall provide the following information:\n(a)\nall necessary data for the identification of the plant protection product including its complete composition as well as a declaration that no unacceptable co-formulants are used;\n(b)\nthe information needed to identify the active substance, safener or synergist, where they have been approved, and to establish whether the conditions for approval are met and comply with point (b) of Article 29(1), where appropriate;\n(c)\non the request of the concerned Member State, the data needed to demonstrate that the plant protection product has comparable effects to the plant protection product for which they show access to the protected data.\nArticle 35\nMember State examining the application\nThe application shall be examined by the Member State proposed by the applicant, unless another Member State in the same zone agrees to examine it. The Member State which will examine the application shall inform the applicant.\nAt the request of the Member State examining the application, the other Member States in the same zone to which an application has been submitted shall cooperate to ensure a fair division of the workload.\nThe other Member States within the zone to which an application has been submitted shall refrain from proceeding with the file pending assessment by the Member State examining the application.\nWhere an application has been made in more than one zone, Member States evaluating the application shall agree on the evaluation of data which are not related to the environmental and agricultural conditions.\nArticle 36\nExamination for authorisation\n1.   The Member State examining the application shall make an independent, objective and transparent assessment in the light of current scientific and technical knowledge using guidance documents available at the time of application. It shall give all Member States in the same zone the opportunity to submit comments to be considered in the assessment.\nIt shall apply the uniform principles for evaluation and authorisation of plant protection products, referred to in Article 29(6), to establish, as far as possible, whether the plant protection product meets the requirements provided for in Article 29 in the same zone, where used in accordance with Article 55, and under realistic conditions of use.\nThe Member State examining the application shall make available its assessment to the other Member States within the same zone. The format of the assessment report shall be established in accordance with the advisory procedure referred to in Article 79(2).\n2.   The Member States concerned shall grant or refuse authorisations accordingly on the basis of the conclusions of the assessment of the Member State examining the application as provided for in Articles 31 and 32.\n3.   By way of derogation from paragraph 2 and subject to Community law, appropriate conditions may be imposed with respect to the requirements referred to in Article 31(3) and (4) and other risk mitigation measures deriving from specific conditions of use.\nWhere the concerns of a Member State relating to human or animal health or the environment cannot be controlled by the establishment of the national risk mitigation measures referred to in the first subparagraph, a Member State may refuse authorisation of the plant protection product in its territory if, due to its specific environmental or agricultural circumstances, it has substantiated reasons to consider that the product in question still poses an unacceptable risk to human or animal health or the environment.\nThat Member State shall immediately inform the applicant and the Commission of its decision and provide a technical or scientific justification therefor.\nMember States shall provide for the possibility of challenging a decision refusing the authorisation of such products before national courts or other instances of appeal.\nArticle 37\nPeriod for examination\n1.   The Member State examining the application shall decide within 12 months of receiving it whether the requirements for authorisation are met.\nWhere the Member State needs additional information, it shall set a period for the applicant to supply it. In that case, the 12-month period shall be extended by the additional period granted by the Member State. That additional period shall be a maximum of 6 months and shall cease at the moment when the additional information is received by the Member State. Where at the end of that period the applicant has not submitted the missing elements, the Member State shall inform the applicant that the application is inadmissible.\n2.   The time limits provided for in paragraph 1 shall be suspended during the application of the procedure set out in Article 38.\n3.   For an application for authorisation of a plant protection product containing an active substance not yet approved, the Member State examining the application shall start the evaluation as soon as it has received the draft assessment report referred to in Article 12(1). In case the application concerns the same plant protection product and the same uses as contained in the dossier referred to in Article 8, the Member State shall decide on the application at the latest within six months of the active substance being approved.\n4.   The other Member States concerned shall at the latest within 120 days of the receipt of the assessment report and the copy of the authorisation of the Member State examining the application decide on the application as referred to in Article 36(2) and (3).\nArticle 38\nAssessment of equivalence under point (b) of Article 29(1)\n1.   Where it is necessary to establish for an active substance, safener or synergist whether a different source or, for the same source a change of the manufacturing process and/or manufacturing location complies with point (b) of Article 29(1), this shall be assessed by the Member State which acted as rapporteur for the active substance, safener or synergist as referred to in Article 7(1) unless the Member State examining the application as referred to in Article 35 agrees to assess the equivalence. The applicant shall submit all necessary data to the Member State assessing equivalence.\n2.   After giving the applicant the opportunity to submit comments, which the applicant shall also communicate to the rapporteur Member State or the Member State examining the application as the case may be, the Member State assessing equivalence shall prepare a report on equivalence within 60 days from receiving the application and shall communicate the report to the Commission, the other Member States and the applicant.\n3.   In the case of a positive conclusion on equivalence and where no objection to this conclusion has been raised, point (b) of Article 29(1) shall be considered to be complied with. However, where a Member State examining the application does not agree with the conclusion of the rapporteur Member State or vice versa, it shall inform the applicant, the other Member States and the Commission stating its reasons.\nThe Member States concerned shall try to reach agreement on whether point (b) of Article 29(1) is complied with. They shall provide the applicant with an opportunity to submit comments.\n4.   Where the Member States concerned do not reach agreement within 45 days, the Member State assessing equivalence shall submit the matter to the Commission. A decision on whether the conditions referred to in point (b) of Article 29(1) are complied with shall be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure referred to in Article 79(3). The 45-day period begins on the date on which the Member State examining the application for authorisation informed the rapporteur Member State or vice versa that it does not agree with the conclusion of the latter, in accordance with paragraph 3.\nBefore such a decision is adopted, the Commission may ask the Authority for an opinion, or for scientific or technical assistance which shall be provided within 3 months of the request.\n5.   Detailed rules and procedures for the implementation of paragraphs 1 to 4 may be established in accordance with the regulatory procedure referred to in Article 79(3), after consultation of the Authority.\nArticle 39\nReporting and exchange of information on applications for authorisation\n1.   Member States shall compile a file on each application. Each file shall contain the following:\n(a)\na copy of the application;\n(b)\na report containing information on the evaluation of and decision on the plant protection product; the format of the report shall be established in accordance with the advisory procedure referred to in Article 79(2);\n(c)\na record of the administrative decisions taken by the Member State concerning the application and of the documentation provided for in Article 33(3) and Article 34 together with a summary of the latter;\n(d)\nthe approved label, where applicable.\n2.   On request, Member States shall, without delay, make available to the other Member States, the Commission and the Authority a file containing the documentation provided for in points (a) to (d) of paragraph 1.\n3.   On request, applicants shall provide a copy of the documentation to be submitted with an application pursuant to Article 33(3) and Article 34 to Member States, the Commission and the Authority.\n4.   Detailed rules for the implementation of paragraphs 2 and 3 may be established in accordance with the regulatory procedure referred to in Article 79(3).\nSubsection 3\nMutual recognition of authorisations\nArticle 40\nMutual recognition\n1.   The holder of an authorisation granted in accordance with Article 29 may apply for an authorisation for the same plant protection product, the same use and under the comparable agricultural practices in another Member State under the mutual recognition procedure, provided for in this subsection, in the following cases:\n(a)\nthe authorisation was granted by a Member State (reference Member State) which belongs to the same zone;\n(b)\nthe authorisation was granted by a Member State (reference Member State) which belongs to a different zone provided that the authorisation for which the application was made is not used for the purpose of mutual recognition in another Member State within the same zone;\n(c)\nthe authorisation was granted by a Member State for use in greenhouses, or as post-harvest treatment, or for treatment of empty rooms or containers used for storing plant or plant products, or for seed treatment, regardless of the zone to which the reference Member State belongs.\n2.   Where a plant protection product is not authorised in a Member State because no application for an authorisation has been submitted in that Member State, official or scientific bodies involved in agricultural activities or professional agricultural organisations may apply, with the consent of the authorisation holder, for an authorisation for the same plant protection product, the same use and under the same agricultural practices in that Member State under the mutual recognition procedure referred to in paragraph 1. In that case the applicant must demonstrate that the use of such a plant protection product is of general interest for the Member State of introduction.\nWhere the authorisation holder refuses its consent, the competent authority of the Member State concerned may accept the application, on grounds of public interest.\nArticle 41\nAuthorisation\n1.   The Member State to which an application under Article 40 is submitted shall, having examined the application and the accompanying documents referred to in Article 42(1), as appropriate with regard to the circumstances in its territory, authorise the plant protection product concerned under the same conditions as the Member State examining the application, except where Article 36(3) applies.\n2.   By way of derogation from paragraph 1, the Member State may authorise the plant protection product where:\n(a)\nan authorisation under point (b) of Article 40(1) was applied for;\n(b)\nit contains a candidate of substitution;\n(c)\nArticle 30 has been applied; or\n(d)\nit contains a substance approved in accordance with Article 4(7).\nArticle 42\nProcedure\n1.   The application shall be accompanied by the following:\n(a)\na copy of the authorisation granted by the reference Member State as well as a translation of the authorisation into an official language of the Member State receiving the application;\n(b)\na formal statement that the plant protection product is identical to that authorised by the reference Member State;\n(c)\na complete or summary dossier as required in Article 33(3) when requested by the Member State;\n(d)\nan assessment report of the reference Member State containing information on the evaluation and decision on the plant protection product.\n2.   The Member State to which an application under Article 40 is submitted shall decide on the application within 120 days.\n3.   Where requested by the Member State, the applicant shall submit the application in the national or official languages of that Member State or one of those languages.\nSubsection 4\nRenewal, withdrawal and amendment\nArticle 43\nRenewal of authorisation\n1.   An authorisation shall be renewed upon application by the authorisation holder, provided that the requirements referred to in Article 29 are still met.\n2.   Within 3 months from the renewal of the approval of an active substance, safener or synergist contained in the plant protection product, the applicant shall submit the following information:\n(a)\na copy of the authorisation of the plant protection product;\n(b)\nany new information required as a result of amendments in data requirements or criteria;\n(c)\nevidence that the new data submitted are the result of data requirements or criteria which were not in force when the authorisation of the plant protection product was granted or necessary to amend the conditions of approval;\n(d)\nany information required to demonstrate that the plant protection product meets the requirements set out in the Regulation on the renewal of the approval of the active substance, safener or synergist contained therein;\n(e)\na report on the monitoring information, where the authorisation was subject to monitoring.\n3.   Member States shall check compliance of all plant protection products containing the active substance, safener or synergist concerned with any conditions and restrictions provided for in the Regulation renewing the approval under Article 20.\nThe Member State referred to in Article 35 within each zone shall coordinate the compliance check and assessment of the information submitted for all Member States within that zone.\n4.   Guidelines on the organisation of compliance checks may be established in accordance with the advisory procedure referred to in Article 79(2).\n5.   Member States shall decide on the renewal of the authorisation of a plant protection product at the latest 12 months after the renewal of the approval of the active substance, safener or synergist contained therein.\n6.   Where, for reasons beyond the control of the holder of the authorisation, no decision is taken on the renewal of the authorisation before its expiry, the Member State in question shall extend the authorisation for the period necessary to complete the examination and adopt a decision on the renewal.\nArticle 44\nWithdrawal or amendment of an authorisation\n1.   Member States may review an authorisation at any time where there are indications that a requirement referred to in Article 29 is no longer satisfied.\nA Member State shall review an authorisation where it concludes that the objectives of Article 4(1)(a)(iv) and (b)(i) and Article 7(2) and (3) of Directive 2000/60/EC may not be achieved.\n2.   Where a Member State intends to withdraw or amend an authorisation, it shall inform the authorisation holder and give him the possibility to submit comments or further information.\n3.   The Member State shall withdraw or amend the authorisation, as appropriate, where:\n(a)\nthe requirements referred to in Article 29 are not or are no longer satisfied;\n(b)\nfalse or misleading information was supplied concerning the facts on the basis of which the authorisation was granted;\n(c)\na condition included in the authorisation has not been met;\n(d)\non the basis of developments in scientific and technical knowledge, the manner of use and amounts used can be modified; or\n(e)\nthe authorisation holder fails to comply with the obligations resulting from this Regulation.\n4.   Where a Member State withdraws or amends an authorisation in accordance with paragraph 3, it shall immediately inform the holder of the authorisation, the other Member States, the Commission and the Authority. The other Member States belonging to the same zone shall withdraw or amend the authorisation accordingly taking into account national conditions and risk mitigation measures except for cases where the second, third or fourth subparagraphs of Article 36(3) have been applied. Article 46 shall apply where appropriate.\nArticle 45\nWithdrawal or amendment of an authorisation at the request of the authorisation holder\n1.   An authorisation may be withdrawn or amended at the request of the holder of the authorisation, who shall state the reasons for his request.\n2.   Amendments may only be granted where it is established that the requirements referred to in Article 29 continue to be met.\n3.   Article 46 shall apply where appropriate.\nArticle 46\nGrace period\nWhere a Member State withdraws or amends an authorisation or does not renew it, it may grant a grace period for the disposal, storage, placing on the market and use of existing stocks.\nWhere the reasons for withdrawal, amendment or non-renewal of the authorisation are not related to the protection of human and animal health or the environment, the grace period shall be limited and shall not exceed 6 months for the sale and the distribution and an additional maximum of 1 year for the disposal, storage, and use of existing stocks of the plant protection products concerned.\nSubsection 5\nSpecial cases\nArticle 47\nPlacing on the market of low-risk plant protection products\n1.   Where all the active substances contained in a plant protection product are low-risk active substances as referred to in Article 22, that product shall be authorised as a low-risk plant protection product provided no specific risk mitigation measures are needed following a risk assessment. This plant protection product shall also meet the following requirements:\n(a)\nthe low-risk active substances, safeners and synergists contained in it have been approved under Chapter II;\n(b)\nit does not contain a substance of concern;\n(c)\nit is sufficiently effective;\n(d)\nit does not cause unnecessary pain and suffering to vertebrates to be controlled;\n(e)\nit complies with points (b), (c) and (f) to (i) of Article 29(1).\nThese products are referred to as ‘low-risk plant protection products’.\n2.   An applicant for authorisation of a low-risk plant protection product shall demonstrate that the requirements set out in paragraph 1 are met and shall submit with the application a complete and a summary dossier for each point of the data requirements of the active substance and the plant protection product.\n3.   The Member State shall decide within 120 days whether to approve an application for authorisation of a low-risk plant protection product.\nWhere the Member State needs additional information, it shall set a time limit for the applicant to supply it. In that case, the period specified shall be extended by the additional time limit granted by the Member State.\nThe additional period shall be of a maximum of 6 months and shall cease at the moment when the additional information is received by the Member State. Where at the end of that period the applicant has not submitted the missing elements, the Member State shall inform the applicant that the application is inadmissible.\n4.   Unless otherwise specified, all provisions relating to authorisations under this Regulation shall apply.\nArticle 48\nPlacing on the market and use of plant protection products containing a genetically modified organism\n1.   A plant protection product which contains an organism falling within the scope of Directive 2001/18/EC shall be examined in respect of the genetic modification in accordance with that Directive, in addition to the assessment under this Chapter.\nAn authorisation under this Regulation shall not be granted for such a plant protection product unless written consent, as referred to in Article 19 of Directive 2001/18/EC, has been granted for it.\n2.   Unless otherwise specified, all provisions relating to authorisations under this Regulation shall apply.\nArticle 49\nPlacing on the market of treated seeds\n1.   Member States shall not prohibit placing on the market and use of seeds treated with plant protection products authorised for that use in at least one Member State.\n2.   Where there are substantial concerns that treated seeds as referred to in paragraph 1 are likely to constitute a serious risk to human or animal health or to the environment and that such risk cannot be contained satisfactorily by means of measures taken by the Member State(s) concerned, measures to restrict or prohibit the use and/or sale of such treated seeds shall be taken immediately in accordance with the regulatory procedure referred to in Article 79(3). Before taking such measures the Commission shall examine the evidence and may request an opinion from the Authority. The Commission may set a time limit within which such an opinion shall be provided.\n3.   Articles 70 and 71 shall apply.\n4.   Without prejudice to other Community legislation concerning the labelling of seeds, the label and documents accompanying the treated seeds shall include the name of the plant protection product with which the seeds were treated, the name(s) of the active substance(s) in that product, standard phrases for safety precautions as provided for in Directive 1999/45/EC and risk mitigation measures set out in the authorisation for that product where appropriate.\nArticle 50\nComparative assessment of plant protection products containing candidates for substitution\n1.   A comparative assessment shall be performed by Member States when evaluating an application for authorisation for a plant protection product containing an active substance approved as a candidate for substitution. Member States shall not authorise or shall restrict the use of a plant protection product containing a candidate for substitution for use on a particular crop where the comparative assessment weighing up the risks and benefits, as set out in Annex IV, demonstrates that:\n(a)\nfor the uses specified in the application an authorised plant protection product, or a non-chemical control or prevention method, already exists which is significantly safer for human or animal health or the environment;\n(b)\nthe substitution by plant protection products or non-chemical control or prevention methods referred to in point (a) does not present significant economic or practical disadvantages;\n(c)\nthe chemical diversity of the active substances, where relevant, or methods and practices of crop management and pest prevention are adequate to minimise the occurrence of resistance in the target organism; and\n(d)\nthe consequences on minor use authorisations are taken into account.\n2.   By way of derogation from Article 36(2) Member States may in exceptional cases also apply the provisions of paragraph 1 of this Article when evaluating an application for authorisation of a plant protection product not containing a candidate for substitution or a low-risk active substance, if a non-chemical control or prevention method exists for the same use and it is in general use in that Member State.\n3.   By way of derogation from paragraph 1, a plant protection product containing a candidate for substitution shall be authorised without comparative assessment in cases where it is necessary to acquire experience first through using that product in practice.\nSuch authorisations shall be granted once for a period not exceeding five years.\n4.   For plant protection products containing a candidate for substitution Member States shall perform the comparative assessment provided for in paragraph 1 regularly and at the latest at renewal or amendment of the authorisation.\nBased on the results of that comparative assessment, Member States shall maintain, withdraw or amend the authorisation.\n5.   Where a Member State decides to withdraw or amend an authorisation pursuant to paragraph 4, that withdrawal or amendment shall take effect 3 years after the decision of the Member State or at the end of the approval period of the candidate for substitution where that period ends earlier.\n6.   Unless otherwise specified, all provisions relating to authorisations under this Regulation shall apply.\nArticle 51\nExtension of authorisations for minor uses\n1.   The authorisation holder, official or scientific bodies involved in agricultural activities, professional agricultural organisations or professional users may ask for the authorisation of a plant protection product already authorised in the Member State concerned to be extended to minor uses not yet covered by that authorisation.\n2.   Member States shall extend the authorisation provided that:\n(a)\nthe intended use is minor in nature;\n(b)\nthe conditions referred to in points (b), (d) and (e) of Article 4(3) and Article 29(1)(i) are satisfied;\n(c)\nthe extension is in the public interest; and\n(d)\nthe documentation and information to support the extension of use has been submitted by the persons or bodies referred to in paragraph 1, especially data on the magnitude of residues and where necessary on the risk assessment to the operator, worker and bystander.\n3.   Member States may take measures to facilitate or encourage the submission of applications to extend the authorisation of already authorised plant protection products to minor uses.\n4.   The extension may take the form of an amendment to the existing authorisation or may be a separate authorisation, in accordance with the administrative procedures of the Member State concerned.\n5.   When Member States grant an extension of authorisation for a minor use, they shall inform if necessary the authorisation holder and request him to change the labelling accordingly.\nWhere the authorisation holder declines, the Member States shall ensure that users are fully and specifically informed as to instructions for use, by means of an official publication or an official website.\nThe official publication or where applicable the label shall include a reference to the liability of the person using the plant protection product with respect to failures concerning the efficacy or to phytotoxicity of the product for which the minor use was granted. The minor use extension shall be separately identified in the label.\n6.   Extensions on the basis of this Article shall be separately identified and separate reference shall be made to liability restrictions.\n7.   The applicants referred to in paragraph 1 may also apply for authorisation of a plant protection product for minor uses in accordance with Article 40(1) provided that a plant protection product concerned is authorised in that Member State. Member States shall authorise such uses in accordance with the provisions of Article 41 provided that those uses are also considered minor in the Member States of application.\n8.   Member States shall establish and regularly update a list of minor uses.\n9.   By 14 December 2011, the Commission shall present a report to the European Parliament and the Council on the establishment of a European fund for minor uses, accompanied, if appropriate, by a legislative proposal.\n10.   Unless otherwise specified, all provisions relating to authorisations under this Regulation shall apply.\nArticle 52\nParallel trade\n1.   A plant protection product that is authorised in one Member State (Member State of origin) may, subject to granting a parallel trade permit, be introduced, placed on the market or used in another Member State (Member State of introduction), if this Member State determines that the plant protection product is identical in composition to a plant protection product already authorised in its territory (reference product). The application shall be submitted to the competent authority of the Member State of introduction.\n2.   From receiving a complete application, a parallel trade permit shall be granted in a simplified procedure within 45 working days if the plant protection product to be introduced is identical in terms of paragraph 3. Member States shall on request provide each other with the information necessary to assess whether the products are identical within 10 working days of receiving the request. The procedure for granting a parallel trade permit is interrupted from the day the request for information is sent to the competent authority of the Member State of origin until the complete information required is delivered to the competent authority of the Member State of introduction.\n3.   Plant protection products shall be considered as identical to the reference products if:\n(a)\nthey have been manufactured by the same company or by an associated undertaking or under licence in accordance with the same manufacturing process;\n(b)\nthey are identical in specification and content to the active substances, safeners and synergists, and in the type of formulation; and\n(c)\nthey are either the same or equivalent in the co-formulants present and the packaging size, material or form, in terms of the potential adverse impact on the safety of the product with regard to human or animal health or the environment.\n4.   The application for a parallel trade permit shall include the following information:\n(a)\nthe name and registration number of the plant protection product in the Member State of origin;\n(b)\nthe Member State of origin;\n(c)\nthe name and address of the authorisation holder in the Member State of origin;\n(d)\nthe original label and instructions for use with which the plant protection product to be introduced is distributed in the Member State of origin if it is considered as necessary for the examination by the competent authority of the Member State of introduction. This competent authority may require a translation of the relevant parts of the original instructions for use;\n(e)\nthe name and address of the applicant;\n(f)\nthe name to be given to the plant protection product to be distributed in the Member State of introduction;\n(g)\na draft label for the product intended to be placed on the market;\n(h)\na sample of the product which is intended to be introduced if it is considered as necessary by the competent authority of the Member State of introduction;\n(i)\nthe name and registration number of the reference product.\nThe information requirements may be amended or completed and further details and specific requirements shall be established in cases of application for a plant protection product for which a parallel trade permit has already been granted and in cases of an application for a plant protection product for a personal use in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny referred to in Article 79(4).\n5.   A plant protection product for which a parallel trade permit has been issued shall be placed on the market and used only in accordance with the provisions of the authorisation of the reference product. To facilitate monitoring and controls the Commission shall set out specific control requirements for the product to be introduced in a Regulation referred to in Article 68.\n6.   The parallel trade permit shall be valid for the duration of authorisation of the reference product. If the authorisation holder of the reference product applies for a withdrawal of authorisation in accordance with Article 45(1) and the requirements of Article 29 are still fulfilled, the validity of the parallel trade permit shall expire by the date on which the authorisation of the reference product would normally have expired.\n7.   Without prejudice to specific provisions of this Article, Articles 44, 45, 46, and 55 and Article 56(4) and Chapters VI to X shall apply to parallel traded plant protection products correspondingly.\n8.   Without prejudice to Article 44, a parallel trade permit may be withdrawn if the authorisation of the introduced plant protection product is withdrawn in the Member State of origin because of safety or efficacy reasons.\n9.   Where the product is not identical, in terms of paragraph 3, to the reference product, the Member State of introduction may only grant the authorisation required for placing on the market and use in accordance with Article 29.\n10.   The provisions of this Article shall not apply to plant protection products which are authorised in the Member State of origin in accordance with Article 53 or 54.\n11.   Without prejudice to Article 63, Member State authorities shall make publicly available information about parallel trade permits.\nSubsection 6\nDerogations\nArticle 53\nEmergency situations in plant protection\n1.   By way of derogation from Article 28, in special circumstances a Member State may authorise, for a period not exceeding 120 days, the placing on the market of plant protection products, for limited and controlled use, where such a measure appears necessary because of a danger which cannot be contained by any other reasonable means.\nThe Member State concerned shall immediately inform the other Member States and the Commission of the measure taken, providing detailed information about the situation and any measures taken to ensure consumer safety.\n2.   The Commission may ask the Authority for an opinion, or for scientific or technical assistance.\nThe Authority shall provide its opinion or the results of its work to the Commission within 1 month of the date of the request.\n3.   If necessary, a decision shall be taken, in accordance with the regulatory procedure referred to in Article 79(3), as to when and under what conditions the Member State:\n(a)\nmay or may not extend the duration of the measure or repeat it; or\n(b)\nshall withdraw or amend its measure.\n4.   Paragraphs 1 to 3 shall not apply to plant protection products containing or composed of genetically modified organisms unless such release has been accepted in accordance with Directive 2001/18/EC.\nArticle 54\nResearch and development\n1.   By way of derogation from Article 28, experiments or tests for research or development purposes involving the release into the environment of an unauthorised plant protection product or involving unauthorised use of a plant protection product may be carried out if the Member State in whose territory the experiment or test is to be carried out has assessed the available data and granted a permit for trial purposes. The permit may limit the quantities to be used and the areas to be treated and may impose further conditions to prevent any harmful effects on human or animal health or any unacceptable adverse effect on the environment, such as the need to prevent entry into the food chain of feed and food containing residues unless a relevant provision has already been established under Regulation (EC) No 396/2005.\nThe Member State may authorise a programme of experiments or tests in advance or require a permit for each experiment or test.\n2.   An application shall be submitted to the Member State in whose territory the experiment or test is to be conducted, together with a dossier containing all the available data to permit an assessment of possible effects on human or animal health or the possible impact on the environment.\n3.   A permit for trial purposes shall not be granted for experiments or tests involving the release into the environment of a genetically modified organism unless such release has been accepted under Directive 2001/18/EC.\n4.   Paragraph 2 shall not apply if the Member State has granted the person concerned the right to undertake certain experiments and tests and has determined the conditions under which the experiments and tests have to be undertaken.\n5.   Detailed rules for the implementation of this Article, in particular the maximum quantities of plant protection products that may be released during experiments or tests and the minimum data to be submitted in accordance with paragraph 2, may be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny referred to in Article 79(4).\nSECTION 2\nUse and information\nArticle 55\nUse of plant protection products\nPlant protection products shall be used properly.\nProper use shall include the application of the principles of good plant protection practice and compliance with the conditions established in accordance with Article 31 and specified on the labelling.

An adjuvant shall not be placed on the market or used unless it has been authorised in the Member State concerned in accordance with the conditions established in the Regulation referred to in paragraph 2.\n2.   Detailed rules for the authorisation of adjuvants, including data requirements, notification, evaluation, assessment and decision making procedures shall be set out in a Regulation to be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny referred to in Article 79(4).\n3.   Article 81(3) shall apply.\nCHAPTER V\nDATA PROTECTION AND DATA SHARING\nArticle 59\nData protection\n1.   Test and study reports shall benefit from data protection under the conditions laid down in this Article.\nThe protection shall apply to test and study reports concerning the active substance, safener or synergist, adjuvants and the plant protection product as referred to in Article 8(2) when they are submitted to a Member State by an applicant for authorisation under this Regulation, (the first applicant), provided that those test and study reports were:\n(a)\nnecessary for the authorisation or an amendment of an authorisation in order to allow the use on another crop; and\n(b)\ncertified as compliant with the principles of good laboratory practice or of good experimental practice.\nWhere a report is protected, it may not be used by the Member State which received it for the benefit of other applicants for authorisation of plant protection products, safeners or synergists and adjuvants, except as provided in paragraph 2 of this Article, in Article 62 or in Article 80.\nThe period of data protection is 10 years starting at the date of first authorisation in that Member State, except as provided in paragraph 2 of this Article or in Article 62. That period is extended to 13 years for plant protection products covered by Article 47.\nThose periods shall be extended by 3 months for each extension of authorisation for minor uses as defined in Article 51(1), except where the extension of authorisation is based on extrapolation, if the applications for such authorisations are made by the authorisation holder at the latest 5 years after the date of the first authorisation in that Member State. The total period of data protection may in no case exceed 13 years. For plant protection products covered by Article 47 the total period of data protection may in no case exceed 15 years.\nThe same data protection rules as for the first authorisation shall also apply to test and study reports submitted by third parties for the purpose of extension of authorisation for minor uses as referred to in Article 51(1).\nA study shall also be protected if it was necessary for the renewal or review of an authorisation. The period for data protection shall be 30 months. The first to fourth subparagraphs shall apply mutatis mutandis.\n2.   Paragraph 1 shall not apply:\n(a)\nto test and study reports for which the applicant has submitted a letter of access; or\n(b)\nwhere any period of data protection granted for the test and study reports concerned in relation to another plant protection product has expired.\n3.   Data protection under paragraph 1 shall only be granted where the first applicant has claimed data protection for test and study reports concerning the active substance, safener or synergist, adjuvant and the plant protection product at the time of submitting the dossier and has provided to the Member State concerned for each test or study report the information referred to in point (f) of Article 8(1) and in point (d) of Article 33(3) as well as confirmation that a period of data protection has never been granted for the test or study report or that any period granted has not expired.\nArticle 60\nList of test and study reports\n1.   For each active substance, safener and synergist and adjuvant, rapporteur Member States shall prepare a list of the test and study reports necessary for first approval, amendment of approval conditions or renewal of the approval and make it available to the Member States and the Commission.\n2.   For each plant protection product which they authorise, Member States shall keep and make available to any interested party upon request:\n(a)\na list of the test and study reports concerning the active substance, safener or synergist, adjuvant and the plant protection product necessary for first authorisation, amendment of the authorisation conditions or renewal of the authorisation; and\n(b)\na list of test and study reports for which the applicant claimed data protection under Article 59 and any reasons submitted in accordance with that Article.\n3.   The lists provided for in paragraphs 1 and 2 shall include information on whether those test and study reports were certified as compliant with the principles of good laboratory practice or of good experimental practice.\nArticle 61\nGeneral rules on avoidance of duplicative testing\n1.   In order to avoid duplicative testing, any persons intending to seek an authorisation for a plant protection product shall, before carrying out tests or studies, consult the information referred to in Article 57 to ascertain if and to whom an authorisation has already been granted for a plant protection product containing the same active substance, safener or synergist or for an adjuvant. The competent authority shall on request from the prospective applicant provide him with the list of test and study reports prepared in accordance with Article 60 for that product.\nThe prospective applicant shall submit all data regarding the identity and impurities of the active substance he proposes to use. The enquiry shall be supported by evidence that the prospective applicant intends to apply for an authorisation.\n2.   The competent authority of the Member State, where satisfied that the prospective applicant intends to apply for an authorisation, or the renewal or review thereof, shall provide him with the name and address of the holder or holders of previous relevant authorisations and shall at the same time inform the holders of the authorisations of the name and address of the applicant.\n3.   The prospective applicant for the authorisation, or the renewal or review thereof, and the holder or holders of relevant authorisations shall take all reasonable steps to reach agreement on the sharing of any test and study reports protected under Article 59, in a fair, transparent and non-discriminatory way.\nArticle 62\nSharing of tests and studies involving vertebrate animals\n1.   Testing on vertebrate animals for the purposes of this Regulation shall be undertaken only where no other methods are available. Duplication of tests and studies on vertebrates undertaken for the purposes of this Regulation shall be avoided in accordance with paragraphs 2 to 6.\n2.   Member States shall not accept duplication of tests and studies on vertebrate animals or those initiated where conventional methods described in Annex II to Directive 1999/45/EC could reasonably have been used, in support of applications for authorisations. Any person intending to perform tests and studies involving vertebrate animals shall take the necessary measures to verify that those tests and studies have not already been performed or initiated.\n3.   The prospective applicant and the holder or holders of the relevant authorisations shall make every effort to ensure that they share tests and studies involving vertebrate animals. The costs of sharing the test and study reports shall be determined in a fair, transparent and non-discriminatory way. The prospective applicant is only required to share in the costs of information he is required to submit to meet the authorisation requirements.\n4.   Where the prospective applicant and the holder or holders of the relevant authorisations of plant protection products containing the same active substance, safener or synergist, or of adjuvants cannot reach agreement on the sharing of test and study reports involving vertebrate animals, the prospective applicant shall inform the competent authority of the Member State referred to in Article 61(1).\nThe failure to reach agreement, as provided in paragraph 3, shall not prevent the competent authority of that Member State from using the test and study reports involving vertebrate animals for the purpose of the application of the prospective applicant.\n5.   By 14 December 2016, the Commission shall report on the effects of the provisions in this Regulation concerning data protection of tests and studies involving vertebrate animals. The Commission shall submit this report to the European Parliament and the Council accompanied, if necessary, by an appropriate legislative proposal.\n6.   The holder or holders of the relevant authorisation shall have a claim on the prospective applicant for a fair share of the costs incurred by him. The competent authority of the Member State may direct the parties involved to resolve the matter by formal and binding arbitration administered under national law. Otherwise the parties may resolve the matter through litigation in the courts of the Member States. Awards from arbitration or litigation shall have regard to the principles determined in paragraph 3 and shall be enforceable in the courts of the Member States.\nCHAPTER VI\nPUBLIC ACCESS TO INFORMATION\nArticle 63\nConfidentiality\n1.   A person requesting that information submitted under this Regulation is to be treated as confidential shall provide verifiable evidence to show that the disclosure of the information might undermine his commercial interests, or the protection of privacy and the integrity of the individual.\n2.   Disclosure of the following information shall normally be deemed to undermine the protection of the commercial interests or of privacy and the integrity of the individuals concerned:\n(a)\nthe method of manufacture;\n(b)\nthe specification of impurity of the active substance except for the impurities that are considered to be toxicologically, ecotoxicologically or environmentally relevant;\n(c)\nresults of production batches of the active substance including impurities;\n(d)\nmethods of analysis for impurities in the active substance as manufactured except for methods for impurities that are considered to be toxicologically, ecotoxicologically or environmentally relevant;\n(e)\nlinks between a producer or importer and the applicant or the authorisation holder;\n(f)\ninformation on the complete composition of a plant protection product;\n(g)\nnames and addresses of persons involved in testing on vertebrate animals.\n3.

Evaluation\n1.1.\nDuring the process of evaluation and decision-making provided for in Articles 4 to 21, the rapporteur Member State and the Authority shall cooperate with applicants to resolve any questions on the dossier quickly or to identify at an early stage any further explanations or additional studies necessary for the evaluation of the dossier, including information to eliminate the need for a restriction of the approval, or to amend any proposed conditions for the use of the plant protection product or to modify its nature or its composition in order to ensure full satisfaction of the requirements of this Regulation.\n1.2.\nThe evaluation by the Authority and the rapporteur Member State must be based on scientific principles and be made with the benefit of expert advice.\n1.3.\nDuring the process of evaluation and decision-making provided for in Articles 4 to 21, Member States and the Authority shall take into consideration any further guidance developed in the framework of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health for the purposes of refining, where relevant, the risk assessments.\n2.   General decision-making criteria\n2.1.   Article 4 shall only be considered as complied with, where, on the basis of the dossier submitted, authorisation in at least one Member State is expected to be possible for at least one plant protection product containing that active substance for at least one of the representative uses.\n2.2.   Submission of further information\nIn principle an active substance, safener or synergist shall only be approved where a complete dossier is submitted.\nIn exceptional cases an active substance, safener or synergist may be approved even though certain information is still to be submitted where:\n(a)\nthe data requirements have been amended or refined after the submission of the dossier; or\n(b)\nthe information is considered to be confirmatory in nature, as required to increase confidence in the decision.\n2.3.   Restrictions on approval\nWhere necessary, the approval may be subject to conditions and restrictions as referred to in Article 6.\nWhere the rapporteur Member State considers that the dossier provided lacks certain information, to the effect that the active substance could only be approved subject to restrictions, it shall contact the applicant at an early stage to obtain more information which may possibly enable these restrictions to be removed.\n3.   Criteria for the approval of an active substance\n3.1.   Dossier\nThe dossiers submitted pursuant to Article 7(1) shall contain the information needed to establish, where relevant, Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI), Acceptable Operator Exposure Level (AOEL) and Acute Reference Dose (ARfD).\nIn the case of an active substance, safener or synergist for which one or more representative uses includes use on feed or food crops or leads indirectly to residues in food or feed, the dossier submitted pursuant to Article 7(1) shall contain the information necessary to carry out a risk assessment and for enforcement purposes.\nThe dossier shall in particular:\n(a)\npermit any residue of concern to be defined;\n(b)\nreliably predict the residues in food and feed, including succeeding crops;\n(c)\nreliably predict, where relevant, the corresponding residue level reflecting the effects of processing and/or mixing;\n(d)\npermit a maximum residue level to be defined and to be determined by appropriate methods in general use for the commodity and, where appropriate, for products of animal origin where the commodity or parts of it is fed to animals;\n(e)\npermit, where relevant, concentration or dilution factors due to processing and/or mixing to be defined.\nThe dossier submitted pursuant to Article 7(1) shall be sufficient to permit, where relevant, an estimate of the fate and distribution of the active substance in the environment, and its impact on non-target species.\n3.2.   Efficacy\nAn active substance alone or associated with a safener or synergist shall only be approved where it has been established for one or more representative uses that the plant protection product, consequent on application consistent with good plant protection practice and having regard to realistic conditions of use is sufficiently effective. This requirement shall be evaluated in accordance with the uniform principles for evaluation and authorisation of plant protection products referred to in Article 29(6).\n3.3.   Relevance of metabolites\nWhere applicable the documentation submitted shall be sufficient to permit the establishment of the toxicological, ecotoxicological or environmental relevance of metabolites.\n3.4.

However, where necessary for reasons of protection of human or animal health or the environment, stricter specifications may be adopted.\n3.5.   Methods of analysis\n3.5.1.\nThe methods of analysis of the active substance, safener or synergist as manufactured and of determination of impurities of toxicological, ecotoxicological or environmental concern or which are present in quantities greater than 1 g/kg in the active substance, safener or synergist as manufactured, shall have been validated and shown to be sufficiently specific, correctly calibrated, accurate and precise.\n3.5.2.\nThe methods of residue analysis for the active substance and relevant metabolites in plant, animal and environmental matrices and drinking water, as appropriate, shall have been validated and shown to be sufficiently sensitive with respect to the levels of concern.\n3.5.3.\nThe evaluation has been carried out in accordance with the uniform principles for evaluation and authorisation of plant protection products referred to in Article 29(6).\n3.6.   Impact on human health\n3.6.1.\nWhere relevant, an ADI, AOEL and ARfD shall be established. When establishing such values an appropriate safety margin of at least 100 shall be ensured taking into account the type and severity of effects and the vulnerability of specific groups of the population. When the critical effect is judged of particular significance, such as developmental neurotoxic or immunotoxic effects, an increased margin of safety shall be considered, and applied if necessary.\n3.6.2.\nAn active substance, safener or synergist shall only be approved if, on the basis of assessment of higher tier genotoxicity testing carried out in accordance with the data requirements for the active substances, safeners or synergists and other available data and information, including a review of the scientific literature, reviewed by the Authority, it is not or has not to be classified, in accordance with the provisions of Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008, as mutagen category 1A or 1B.\n3.6.3.\nAn active substance, safener or synergist shall only be approved, if, on the basis of assessment of carcinogenicity testing carried out in accordance with the data requirements for the active substances, safener or synergist and other available data and information, including a review of the scientific literature, reviewed by the Authority, it is not or has not to be classified, in accordance with the provisions of Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008, as carcinogen category 1A or 1B, unless the exposure of humans to that active substance, safener or synergist in a plant protection product, under realistic proposed conditions of use, is negligible, that is, the product is used in closed systems or in other conditions excluding contact with humans and where residues of the active substance, safener or synergist concerned on food and feed do not exceed the default value set in accordance with Article 18(1)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 396/2005.\n3.6.4.\nAn active substance, safener or synergist shall only be approved if, on the basis of assessment of reproductive toxicity testing carried out in accordance with the data requirements for the active substances, safeners or synergists and other available data and information, including a review of the scientific literature, reviewed by the Authority, it is not or has not to be classified, in accordance with the provisions of Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008, as toxic for reproduction category 1A or 1B, unless the exposure of humans to that active substance, safener or synergist in a plant protection product, under realistic proposed conditions of use, is negligible, that is, the product is used in closed systems or in other conditions excluding contact with humans and where residues of the active substance, safener or synergist concerned on food and feed do not exceed the default value set in accordance with point (b) of Article 18(1) of Regulation (EC) No 396/2005.\n3.6.5.\nAn active substance, safener or synergist shall only be approved if, on the basis of the assessment of Community or internationally agreed test guidelines or other available data and information, including a review of the scientific literature, reviewed by the Authority, it is not considered to have endocrine disrupting properties that may cause adverse effect in humans, unless the exposure of humans to that active substance, safener or synergist in a plant protection product, under realistic proposed conditions of use, is negligible, that is, the product is used in closed systems or in other conditions excluding contact with humans and where residues of the active substance, safener or synergist concerned on food and feed do not exceed the default value set in accordance with point (b) of Article 18(1) of Regulation (EC) No 396/2005.\nBy 14 December 2013, the Commission shall present to the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health a draft of the measures concerning specific scientific criteria for the determination of endocrine disrupting properties to be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny referred to in Article 79(4).\nPending the adoption of these criteria, substances that are or have to be classified, in accordance with the provisions of Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008, as carcinogenic category 2 and toxic for reproduction category 2, shall be considered to have endocrine disrupting properties.\nIn addition, substances such as those that are or have to be classified, in accordance with the provisions of Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008, as toxic for reproduction category 2 and which have toxic effects on the endocrine organs, may be considered to have such endocrine disrupting properties.\n3.7.

Candidate for substitution\nAn active substance shall be approved as a candidate for substitution pursuant to Article 24 where any of the following conditions are met:\n—\nits ADI, ARfD or AOEL is significantly lower than those of the majority of the approved active substances within groups of substances/use categories,\n—\nit meets two of the criteria to be considered as a PBT substance,\n—\nthere are reasons for concern linked to the nature of the critical effects (such as developmental neurotoxic or immunotoxic effects) which, in combination with the use/exposure patterns, amount to situations of use that could still cause concern, for example, high potential of risk to groundwater; even with very restrictive risk management measures (such as extensive personal protective equipment or very large buffer zones),\n—\nit contains a significant proportion of non-active isomers,\n—\nit is or is to be classified, in accordance with the provisions of Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008, as carcinogen category 1A or 1B, if the substance has not been excluded in accordance with the criteria laid down in point 3.6.3,\n—\nit is or is to be classified, in accordance with the provisions of Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008, as toxic for reproduction category 1A or 1B if the substance has not been excluded in accordance with the criteria laid down in point 3.6.4,\n—\nif, on the basis of the assessment of Community or internationally agreed test guidelines or other available data and information, reviewed by the Authority, it is considered to have endocrine disrupting properties that may cause adverse effects in humans if the substance has not been excluded in accordance with the criteria laid down in point 3.6.5.\n5.   Low-risk active substances\nAn active substance shall not be considered of low risk where it is or has to be classified in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008 as at least one of the following:\n—\ncarcinogenic,\n—\nmutagenic,\n—\ntoxic to reproduction,\n—\nsensitising chemicals,\n—\nvery toxic or toxic,\n—\nexplosive,\n—\ncorrosive.\nIt shall also not be considered as of low risk if:\n—\npersistent (half-life in soil is more than 60 days),\n—\nbioconcentration factor is higher than 100,\n—\nit is deemed to be an endocrine disrupter, or\n—\nit has neurotoxic or immunotoxic effects.\nANNEX III\nList of co-formulants which are not accepted for inclusion in plant protection products as referred to in Article 27\nANNEX IV\nComparative assessment pursuant to Article 50\n1.   Conditions for comparative assessment\nWhere refusal or withdrawal of an authorisation of a plant protection product in favour of an alternative plant protection product or a non-chemical control or prevention method is considered, referred to as ‘substitution’, the alternative must, in the light of scientific and technical knowledge, show significantly lower risk to health or the environment. An assessment of the alternative shall be performed to demonstrate whether it can be used with similar effect on the target organism and without significant economic and practical disadvantages to the user or not.\nFurther conditions for refusal or withdrawal of an authorisation are as follows:\n(a)\nsubstitution shall be applied only where other methods or the chemical diversity of the active substances is sufficient to minimise the occurrence of resistance in the target organism;\n(b)\nsubstitution shall be applied only to plant protection products where their use presents a significantly higher level of risk to human health or the environment; and\n(c)\nsubstitution shall be applied only after allowing for the possibility, where necessary, of acquiring experience from use in practice, where not already available.\n2.   Significant difference in risk\nA significant difference in risk shall be identified on a case-by-case basis by the competent authorities. The properties of the active substance and plant protection product, and the possibility of exposure of different population subgroups (professional or non-professional users, bystanders, workers, residents, specific vulnerable groups or consumers) directly or indirectly through food, feed, drinking water or the environment shall be taken into account. Other factors such as the stringency of imposed restrictions on use and prescribed personal protective equipment shall also be considered.\nFor the environment, if relevant, a factor of at least 10 for the toxicity/exposure ratio (TER) of different plant protection products is considered a significant difference in risk.\n3.   Significant practical or economic disadvantages\nSignificant practical or economic disadvantage to the user is defined as a major quantifiable impairment of working practices or business activity leading to inability to maintain sufficient control of the target organism. Such a major impairment might be, for example, where no technical facilities for the use of the alternative are available or economically feasible.\nWhere a comparative assessment indicates that restrictions on and/or prohibitions of use of a plant protection product could cause such disadvantage, then this shall be taken into account in the decision-making process. This situation shall be substantiated.\nThe comparative assessment shall take authorised minor uses into account.\nANNEX V\nRepealed Directives and their successive amendments as referred to in Article 83\nA.

Standardising rules on the sale of plant protection products helps to achieve this, ensures the smooth working of the single market and improves agricultural production.\nWHAT DOES THE REGULATION DO?\n              \nIt lays down rules for authorising the sale, use and control of plant protection products in the EU. It recognises the precautionary principle which EU countries may apply if there is scientific uncertainty about the risks a plant protection product might pose to human or animal health or the environment.\nKEY POINTS\n              \n—\n              The legislation applies to products used to protect or preserve plants, influence their growth or destroy and stunt undesired plants.\n            \n—\n              To secure approval, an active substance (any chemical, plant extract or micro-organism that acts against pests or on plants) must not have any harmful effects on human health, including vulnerable groups, or any unacceptable effect on the environment.\n            \n—\n              Plant protection products must be effective, have no immediate or delayed harmful effect on human health, no unacceptable effects on plants or the environment and not cause unnecessary suffering or pain to vertebrates.\n            \n—\n              The competent national authority in each EU country may attach criteria and restrictions such as minimum degree of purity, type of preparation and manner and conditions of use, when approving a pesticide*.\n            \n—\n              The authority gives its first approval for a period not exceeding 10 years. Approval of a renewal request may be for no more than 15 years.\n            \n—\n              Applications for approval of an active substance, accompanied by the necessary scientific information, must be submitted to national authorities. They have a maximum of 12 months to examine the request.\n            \n—\n              Holders of an authorisation in one EU country may use the mutual recognition procedure to request its use in another.\nKEY TERM\n*Pesticide: something that prevents, destroys or controls a harmful organism (pest) or disease, or protects plants or plant products during production, storage and transport. Pesticide is a broader term than plant protection product since it covers non-plant/crop uses like biocides.\nBACKGROUND\n              \nFor more information:\n—\nPesticides on the European Commission's website\nACT\n            \nRegulation (EC) No 1107/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 October 2009 concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market and repealing Council Directives 79/117/EEC and 91/414/EEC (OJ L 309 of 24.11.2009, pp. 1–50)\nThe successive amendments to Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 have been incorporated into the original text.
