{"celex_id": "32014R1333", "reference": "16.12.2014\nEN\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\nL 359/97\nREGULATION (EU) No 1333/2014 OF THE EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK\nof 26 November 2014\nconcerning statistics on the money markets\n(ECB/2014/48)\nTHE GOVERNING COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK,\nHaving regard to the Statute of the European System of Central Banks and of the European Central Bank, and in particular Article 5 thereof,\nHaving regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 2533/98 of 23 November 1998 concerning the collection of statistical information by the European Central Bank (1), and in particular Articles 5(1) and 6(4) thereof,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European Commission (2),\nWhereas:\n(1)\nThe European System of Central Banks (ESCB) requires, for the fulfilment of its tasks, the production of statistics on money market transactions, namely on secured, unsecured and certain derivatives money market transactions, as further specified in this Regulation, concluded by monetary financial institutions (MFIs), with the exception of central banks and money market funds (MMFs), with other MFIs, and between MFIs and other financial institutions, general government or non-financial corporations, but excluding intra-group transactions.\n(2)\nThe main purpose of collecting such statistics is to provide the European Central Bank (ECB) with comprehensive, detailed and harmonised statistical information on the money markets in the euro area. The data derived from the transactions collected in respect of the abovementioned market segments provide information on the transmission mechanism of monetary policy decisions. They are therefore a necessary set of statistics for monetary policy purposes in the euro area.\n(3)\nThe collection of statistical data is also necessary to enable the ECB to provide analytical and statistical support to the single supervisory mechanism (SSM) in accordance with Council Regulation (EU) No 1024/2013 (3). Within this framework, the collection of statistical data is also necessary to support the ECB's tasks in the field of financial stability.\n(4)\nNational central banks (NCBs) should inform the ECB in the event that the NCB decides not to collect the data required under this Regulation, in which case the ECB will take over the task of collecting the data directly from the reporting agents.\n(5)\nThe ECB is required, in accordance with the Treaties and under the conditions laid down in the Statute of the European System of Central Banks and of the European Central Bank (hereinafter the ‘Statute of the ESCB’), to make regulations to the extent necessary to implement the ESCB's tasks as defined in the Statute of the ESCB and in some cases laid down in the provisions adopted by the Council pursuant to Article 129(4) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.\n(6)\nTo minimise the reporting burden on MFIs while ensuring the availability of timely and high quality statistics, the ECB will initially require the reporting of data by the largest euro area MFIs, based on the size of their total main balance sheet assets in comparison to the total main balance sheet assets for all euro area MFIs. From 1 January 2017 the Governing Council of the ECB may expand the number of reporting MFIs by also taking into account other criteria, such as the significance of the MFI's activities in the money markets and its relevance to the stability and functioning of the financial system. The ECB will ensure that there are at least three reporting MFIs per Member State whose currency is the euro (hereinafter ‘euro area Member State’) to ensure a minimum level of geographical representation. NCBs may also collect data from MFIs which are not part of the actual reporting population based on their national statistical reporting requirements, in which case such data will be reported and verified pursuant to this Regulation.\n(7)\nTo further minimise the reporting burden on MFIs by avoiding making them subject to duplicate reporting requirements while ensuring the availability of timely and high quality statistics, the ECB should be able to exempt them from reporting data relating to securities financing transactions or derivative contracts if such data have already been reported to a trade repository, provided that the ECB has effective access to timely and standardised data in accordance with the requirements specified in this Regulation.\n(8)\nArticle 5(1) of Council Regulation (EC) No 2533/98 provides that the ECB may adopt regulations for the definition and imposition of its statistical reporting requirements on the actual reporting population of euro area Member States. Article 6(4) provides that the ECB may adopt regulations specifying the conditions under which the right to verify or to carry out the compulsory collection of statistical information may be exercised.\n(9)\nArticle 4 of Regulation (EC) No 2533/98 provides that Member States must organise themselves in the field of statistics and cooperate fully with the ESCB in order to ensure the fulfilment of the obligations arising from Article 5 of the Statute of the ESCB.\n(10)\nTo the extent that any data collected under this Regulation contains confidential statistical information, the applicable standards for the protection and use of such information will be those laid down in Articles 8 and 8c of Regulation (EC) No 2533/98.\n(11)\nArticle 7(1) of Regulation (EC) No 2533/98 provides that the ECB has the power to impose sanctions on reporting agents which fail to comply with statistical reporting requirements set out in ECB regulations or decisions.\n(12)\nWhile it is recognised that regulations adopted by the ECB under Article 34.1 of the Statute of the ESCB do not confer any rights or impose any obligations on Member States whose currency is not the euro (hereinafter ‘non-euro area Member States’), Article 5 thereof applies to both euro area and non-euro area Member States. Regulation (EC) No 2533/98 observes that Article 5 of the Statute of the ESCB, together with Article 4(3) of the Treaty on European Union, implies an obligation to design and implement at national level all the measures that the non-euro area Member States consider appropriate in order to carry out the collection of the statistical information needed to fulfil the ECB's statistical reporting requirements and timely preparations in the field of statistics in order for them to become euro area Member States.\n(13)\nThe reporting requirements under this Regulation are without prejudice to the reporting requirements set out in other ECB legal acts and instruments which may, at least partly, also cover transaction-by-transaction or aggregated reporting of statistical information on the money markets,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nArticle 1\nDefinitions\nFor the purpose of this Regulation:\n(1)\n‘reporting agents’, ‘resident’ and ‘residing’ have the same meaning as defined in

The actual reporting population shall consist of the euro area resident MFIs from the reference reporting population that are identified by the Governing Council as reporting agents pursuant to paragraph 2 or 3, as applicable, or MFIs identified as reporting agents pursuant to paragraph 4 on the basis of the criteria stated therein, and that are notified of their reporting obligations pursuant to paragraph 5 (hereinafter ‘reporting agents’).\n2.   Upon the date of entry into force of this Regulation, the Governing Council may decide that an MFI is a reporting agent if the MFI has total main balance sheet assets larger than 0,35 % of the total main balance sheet assets of all the euro area MFIs on the basis of the most recent data available to the ECB, i.e.:\n(a)\ndata with reference to the end of December of the calendar year preceding notification pursuant to paragraph 5; or\n(b)\nif the data under (a) are not available, data with reference to the end of December of the previous year.\nFor the purpose of this decision the calculation of the total main balance sheet assets of the respective MFI shall exclude branches outside the host country of the respective MFI.\n3.   From 1 January 2017 the Governing Council may decide to classify any other MFI as a reporting agent on the basis of the size of its total main balance sheet assets in comparison to the total main balance sheet assets of all euro area MFIs, the significance of the MFI's activities in the trading of money market instruments and its relevance to the stability and functioning of the financial system in the euro area and/or individual Member States.\n4.   From 1 January 2017 the Governing Council may also decide that, for each euro area Member State, at least three MFIs shall be identified as reporting agents. Accordingly, if on the basis of Governing Council decisions taken pursuant to paragraph 2 or paragraph 3, fewer than three MFIs are selected in a particular euro area Member State, the actual reporting population will also comprise other MFIs from that euro area Member State which are deemed representative by the relevant NCB (hereinafter ‘representative reporting agents’), so that at minimum three reporting agents are identified as reporting agents for that euro area Member State.\nThe representative reporting agents shall be selected from the largest credit institutions resident in the euro area Member State concerned, based on the total main balance sheet assets of the institutions, unless alternative criteria are suggested by the NCBs and agreed in writing by the ECB.\n5.   The ECB or the relevant NCB shall notify the MFIs concerned of any Governing Council decision taken pursuant to paragraphs 2, 3 or 4 and of their obligations under this Regulation. The notification shall be sent in writing at least four months before the start of first reporting.\n6.   Notwithstanding any Governing Council decisions taken pursuant to paragraphs 2, 3 or 4, NCBs may also collect money market statistics from MFIs resident in their Member State which are not reporting agents pursuant to paragraph 2, 3 or 4, based on their national statistical reporting requirements (hereinafter ‘additional reporting agents’). If an NCB identifies additional reporting agents in this manner it shall promptly notify them.\nArticle 3\nStatistical reporting requirements\n1.   For the purposes of the regular production of money market statistics, the reporting agents shall report to the NCB of the Member State where they are resident on a consolidated basis, including for all their Union and EFTA-located branches, daily statistical information relating to money market instruments. The required statistical information is specified in Annexes I, II and III. The NCB shall transmit the statistical information it receives from the reporting agents to the ECB in accordance with Article 4(2) of this Regulation.\n2.   The NCBs shall define and implement the reporting arrangements to be followed by the reporting agents relating to money market instruments. These reporting arrangements shall ensure the provision of the statistical information required and allow accurate checking of the fulfilment of the minimum standards for transmission, accuracy, compliance with concepts and revisions as set out in Annex IV.\n3.   Notwithstanding the reporting requirement specified in paragraph 1, an NCB may decide that reporting agents selected pursuant to Article 2(2), (3) and (4) resident in the Member State of the NCB shall report the statistical information specified in Annexes I, II, III to the ECB. The NCB shall inform the ECB and the reporting agents accordingly, whereupon the ECB shall define and implement the reporting arrangements to be followed by the reporting agents and take over the task of collecting the required data directly from the reporting agents.\n4.   If an NCB has selected additional reporting agents and notified them as referred to in Article 2(6) they shall report daily statistical information relating to money market instruments to the NCB. The NCB shall transmit the statistical information they receive from the additional reporting agents to the ECB upon the ECB's request in accordance with Article 4(2) of this Regulation.\n5.   The NCBs shall define and implement the reporting arrangements to be followed by additional reporting agents in accordance with their national statistical reporting requirements. The NCBs shall ensure that the national reporting arrangements require additional reporting agents to comply with requirements that are equivalent to Articles 6 to 8, 10(3), 11 and 12 of this Regulation. The NCBs shall ensure that these reporting arrangements provide the statistical information required and allow accurate checking of the fulfilment of the minimum standards for transmission, accuracy, compliance with concepts and revisions as set out in Annex IV.\nArticle 4\nTimeliness\n1.   In the event that an NCB decides pursuant to Article 3(3) that reporting agents shall report the statistical information specified in Annexes I, II, III directly to the ECB, the reporting agents shall transmit such information to the ECB as follows.\n(a)\nData collected from reporting agents selected pursuant to Article 2(2) shall be transmitted once per day to the ECB between 6 p.m. on the trade date and 7 a.m. CET on the first TARGET2 settlement day after the trade date.\n(b)\nData collected from reporting agents selected pursuant to Article 2(3) and (4) shall be transmitted once per day to the ECB between 6 p.m. on the trade date and 1 p.m. CET on the first TARGET2 settlement day after the trade date.\n(c)\nData in respect of which the NCB has a derogation pursuant to Article 5 shall be transmitted to the ECB once a week between 6 p.m. on the trade date and 1 p.m. CET on the first TARGET2 settlement day after the end of the week to which the data relate.\n2.   In any case other than that in paragraph 1, the NCBs shall transmit the daily money market statistical information, as specified in Annexes I, II and III that they receive from reporting agents to the ECB as follows.\n(a)\nData collected from reporting agents selected pursuant to Article 2(2) shall be transmitted once per day to the ECB before 7 a.m. CET on the first TARGET2 settlement day after the trade date.\n(b)\nData collected from reporting agents selected pursuant to Article 2(3) and (4) shall be transmitted once per day to the ECB before 1 p.m. CET on the first TARGET2 settlement day after the trade date.\n(c)\nData collected from additional reporting agents selected pursuant to Article 2(6) shall be transmitted to the ECB once per day before 1 p.m. CET on the first TARGET2 settlement day after the trade date, once a week before 1 p.m. CET on the first TARGET2 settlement day after the end of the week to which the data relate, or once a month before 1 p.m. CET on the first TARGET2 settlement day after the end of the month to which the data relate. The NCBs shall decide on the reporting frequency and promptly inform the ECB accordingly. The NCBs may review the reporting frequency annually.\n(d)\nData in respect of which the NCB has a derogation pursuant to Article 5 shall be transmitted to the ECB once a week before 1 p.m. CET on the first TARGET2 settlement day after the end of the week to which the data relate.\n3.   NCBs shall decide by when they need to receive data from reporting agents in order to meet their reporting deadlines as specified in paragraph 2 and shall inform the reporting agents accordingly.\n4.   Where a deadline referred to in paragraph 1 or 2 falls on a TARGET2 closing day, the deadline shall be extended to the following TARGET2 operating day, as announced on the ECB's website.\nArticle 5\nDerogation\nWhere reporting agents have been selected pursuant to Article 2(3) or (4), an NCB may decide that the reporting agents may transmit daily money market statistics to the NCB once a week before 1 p.m. (CET) on the first TARGET2 settlement day after the end of the week to which the data relate if for operational reasons they cannot meet the daily reporting frequency requirement. The ECB may impose conditions on the application of the derogation by NCBs.\nArticle 6\nMergers, divisions, reorganisations and insolvencies\n1.   In the event of a merger, division, spin off, or any other reorganisation that might affect the fulfilment of its statistical obligations, the reporting agent concerned shall inform the ECB and the relevant NCB, once the intention to implement such an operation has become public and within a reasonable time before it takes effect, of the procedures that are planned to fulfil the statistical reporting requirements set out in this Regulation. The reporting agent shall also notify the ECB and the relevant NCB within 14 days of the completion of such an operation.\n2.   If a reporting agent merges with another entity by way of acquisition as defined in Directive 2011/35/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council (12) and one of the merging entities was a reporting agent the merged entity shall continue reporting under this Regulation.\n3.   If a reporting agent merges with another entity by way of formation of a new company as defined in Directive 2011/35/EU and one of the merging entities was a reporting agent the resulting entity shall report under this Regulation if it fulfils the definition of a reporting agent.\n4.   If a reporting agent divides into two or more entities either by way of acquisition or by formation of new companies as defined in Sixth Council Directive 82/891/EEC (13) and one of the new entities is a reporting agent, the new entity shall report under this Regulation. Division shall also include a spin off operation whereby a reporting agent transfers all or part of its assets and liabilities to a new company in return for shares in the new company.\n5.   If a reporting agent becomes insolvent, loses its banking licence or otherwise ceases to carry on banking business, as confirmed by the competent supervisory authority, it shall no longer be obliged to report under this Regulation.\n6.   For the purposes of paragraph 5, a reporting agent shall be considered insolvent if any one or more of the following occurs:\n(a)\nit makes a general assignment for the benefit of creditors, or for the purpose of entering into a reorganisation, arrangement, or composition with creditors;\n(b)\nit admits in writing that it is unable to pay its debts as they become due;\n(c)\nit files for, consents to or acquiesces in the appointment of any trustee, administrator, receiver, liquidator or analogous officer to it or over all or any material part of its property;\n(d)\nthe presentation of a petition before a court or the filing of a petition with another competent body or authority for insolvency in respect of it (other than by a counterparty in respect of any obligation by the reporting agent to that counterparty);\n(e)\nit is wound-up or becomes insolvent (or enters into any analogous proceedings), or it or any public authority or other entity or person files for its reorganisation, arrangement, composition, re-adjustment, administration, liquidation, dissolution or similar relief under any present or future statute, law or regulation, such a petition (except in the case of a petition for winding-up or any analogous proceeding, in respect of which no 30 day period shall apply) not having been stayed or dismissed within 30 days of its filing;\n(f)\nthe appointment of a trustee, administrator, receiver, liquidator or analogous officer to it or over all or any material part of its property; or\n(g)\nthe convening of any meeting of its creditors for the purposes of considering a voluntary arrangement (or any analogous proceeding).\nArticle 7\nConfidentiality provisions\n1.   When receiving and handling data under this Regulation which contains confidential information, including sharing such data with other euro area NCBs, the ECB and the NCBs shall apply the standards for the protection and use of confidential statistical information laid down in Articles 8 and 8c of Regulation (EC) No 2533/98.\n2.   Subject to paragraph 1, any confidential information contained in statistical data collected by the ECB or an NCB under this Regulation shall not be transmitted to or otherwise shared with any authority or other third party other than the ECB and the euro area NCBs unless the reporting agent concerned has given the ECB or the relevant NCB its express written consent in advance and the ECB or the relevant NCB, where applicable, has signed an appropriate confidentiality agreement with such reporting agent.\nArticle 8\nVerification and compulsory collection\nThe ECB and the NCBs, as the case may be, shall have the right to verify and, if necessary, to collect compulsorily the information which reporting agents provide in compliance with the statistical reporting requirements set out in Article 3 of, and Annexes I, II and III to, this Regulation. This right may be exercised in particular if a reporting agent does not fulfil the standards for transmission, accuracy, compliance with concepts and revisions as set out in Annex IV. Article 6 of Regulation (EC) No 2533/98 shall also apply.\nArticle 9\nSimplified amendment procedure\nTaking account of the views of the ESCB Statistics Committee, the Executive Board of the ECB may make technical amendments to the annexes to this Regulation, provided they neither change the underlying conceptual framework nor affect the reporting burden on the reporting agents. The Executive Board shall inform the Governing Council of any such amendment without undue delay.\nArticle 10\nFirst reporting\n1.   In the case of reporting agents selected pursuant to Article 2(2), first reporting under this Regulation, subject to the transitional provisions in Article 12, shall start with data for 1 April 2016.\n2.   In the case of reporting agents selected pursuant to Article 2(3) and (4), first reporting under this Regulation shall start on the date communicated to the reporting agent by the ECB or the relevant NCB pursuant to Article 2(5), and in any case not earlier than 12 months after the adoption of the Governing Council decision pursuant to Article 2(3) or (4).\n3.   Furthermore, when representative reporting agents are selected pursuant to Article 2(4), a representative reporting agent may submit a written request to the ECB or the relevant NCB for a temporary postponement of the first reporting date, stating the grounds for such a delay. The requested postponement may be granted for up to six months with further possible extensions of up to six months. The ECB or the relevant NCB may agree to postpone the first reporting date in respect of the applicant representative reporting agent if they consider such a delay to be justified. Furthermore, if the representative reporting agent does not have any data to report or only data which is considered not to be representative by both the ECB and the NCB upon the first reporting date, the NCB may agree to exempt it from the application of the first reporting date. Such an exemption may only be granted by the NCB in liaison with the ECB if both the ECB and the NCB consider the request justified and it does not endanger the representativeness of the reporting sample.\n4.   In the case of MFIs selected as additional reporting agents pursuant to Article 2(6), first reporting under this Regulation shall start on the date communicated to the additional reporting agent by the NCB pursuant to Article 2(6).\nArticle 11\nPeriodic review clause\nThe ECB shall review the operation of this Regulation 12 months after first reporting and issue a report thereon. Pursuant to the recommendations in the report it may increase or reduce the number of reporting agents and/or the statistical reporting requirements. After this initial review, regular updates of the actual reporting population will take place every second year.\nArticle 12\nTransitional provision\nIn the period from 1 April 2016 to 1 July 2016 reporting agents will be permitted to report money market statistics for some but not all relevant days to the ECB or the relevant NCB. The ECB or the relevant NCB may specify the days for which reporting shall be required.\nArticle 13\nFinal provisions\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on 1 January 2015.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in the Member States in accordance with the Treaties.\nDone at Frankfurt am Main, 26 November 2014.\nFor the Governing Council of the ECB\nThe

Revisions deviating from regular revisions must be accompanied by explanatory notes.", "summary": "Statistics on the money markets\nStatistics on the money markets\nSUMMARY OF:\nRegulation (EU) No 1333/2014 concerning statistics on the money markets\nWHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?\n              \nThe regulation sets out the requirements placed on monetary financial institutions (MFIs)* in the euro area to supply the European Central Bank (ECB) with daily statistical data on money market transactions on a transaction-by-transaction basis.\nThe regulation has been amended twice:\nin 2015, by Regulation (EU) 2015/1599\nin 2018, by Regulation (EU) 2019/113.\nKEY POINTS\nFrom 1 April 2016, only the largest euro-area MFIs were required to provide statistical data on the money market. These are the institutions whose total main balance sheet assets were larger than 0.35% of the total main balance sheets of all the MFIs in the euro area.\nFrom 1 April 2016 to 1 July 2016, the reporting agents had to report money market statistics for some but not all relevant days or segments of the money market. After that transitional period, they must report statistics for all relevant days in full accordance with the requirements set out in the regulation.\nAs of 1 January 2017, the reporting requirements may be extended to other MFIs. The MFIs will be selected mostly from the remaining significant MFIs at national level with the aim of ensuring an appropriate coverage of all euro-area countries. The MFIs will be selected and informed a year in advance.\nThe MFIs transmit their money market data, which also covers their EU- and European Free Trade Association-located* branches, on a daily basis to the national central bank of the EU country where they reside on a consolidated basis. The technical details of the reporting system and the required statistical information are specified in Annexes I, II and III. Annex IV contains the minimum standards to be applied by the reporting agents.\nNational central banks may decide that an MFI transmit the data directly to the ECB. In such cases, clear reporting arrangements and deadlines must be respected. These deadlines have been updated in amending Regulation (EU) 2019/113.\nAmending Regulation (EU) 2019/113 requires the mandatory use of the Legal Entity Identifier* in reporting. It also ensures that: statistical information is collected, compiled and transmitted by reporting agents in a way that protects its integrity;reporting agents make sure that any errors in reported statistical information are corrected and communicated to the ECB and to the relevant national central bank at the earliest possible date.\nThe amending 2019 regulation also replaces all the annexes to the regulation.\nAn MFI which has been selected as a reporting agent must inform the ECB and its national central bank if it becomes involved in a merger, division or other form of reorganisation that could affect its statistical obligations. When an MFI becomes insolvent, loses its banking licence or otherwise ceases to carry on banking business, its reporting obligations are terminated.\nThe ECB and the national central banks have the right to verify and, if necessary, compulsorily collect the information provided by MFIs.\nPreviously, the ECB had to review the operation of the regulation and issue a report a year after the system had been in place. It could then decide to increase or reduce the number of reporting agents and/or the statistical data requested. Since the ECB’s initial report, reviews take place every second year.\nReporting instructions\nThe ECB has also published detailed reporting instructions which further clarify the implementation of the reporting requirements set out in the regulation.\nFROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?\n              \nRegulation (EU) No 1333/2014 has applied since 1 January 2015, and amending Regulation (EU) 2019/113 has applied since 15 March 2019.\nBACKGROUND\n              \nThe ECB needs accurate, harmonised and up-to-date statistics on money market transactions to support the operation and transmission of its monetary policy and to carry out various other tasks in the euro area. It also uses the data to provide analytical and statistical support to the Single Supervisory Mechanism, which supervises the banking sector in the EU.For more information, see:\nEuro money market: money market statistical reporting (European Central Bank).\nKEY TERMS\n              \nMonetary financial institutions (MFIs): institutions which together form the money-issuing sector of the euro area. These include the European Central Bank, the national central banks of the euro-area countries, and credit institutions and money market funds located in the euro area.\nEuropean Free Trade Association: Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland.\nLegal Entity Identifier: a 20-character, alpha-numeric code based on the ISO 17442 standard developed by the International Organisation for Standardisation. It connects to key reference information that enables the clear and unique identification of legal entities participating in financial transactions.\nMAIN DOCUMENT\n            \nRegulation (EU) No 1333/2014 of the European Central Bank of 26 November 2014 concerning statistics on the money markets (ECB/2014/48) (OJ L 359, 16.12.2014, pp. 97-116)\nSuccessive amendments to Regulation (EU) No 1333/2014 have been incorporated in the original text.
