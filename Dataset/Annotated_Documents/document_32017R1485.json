The rules for system operation provided for in this Regulation require an institutional framework for enhanced coordination between TSOs, including the mandatory participation of TSOs in regional security coordinators (‘RSCs’). The common requirements for the establishment of RSCs and for their tasks set out in this Regulation constitute a first step towards further regional coordination and integration of system operation and should facilitate the achievement of the aims of Regulation (EC) No 714/2009 and ensure higher security of supply standards in the Union.\n(7)\nThis Regulation should set out a framework for the mandated cooperation of TSOs via the appointment of RSCs. RSCs should issue recommendations to the TSOs of the capacity calculation region for which it is appointed. TSOs should, individually, decide whether to follow or not the recommendations of the RSC. The TSO should remain responsible for maintaining operational security of its control area.\n(8)\nRules on operational training and certification are required in order to guarantee that system operator employees and other operational staff are skilled and well trained and that the system operator employees in real-time operation are certified to operate the transmission system in a secure way during all operational situations. The rules on training and certification strengthen and formalise existing best practices amongst TSOs and ensure that minimum standards are applied by all TSOs in the Union.\n(9)\nOperational testing and monitoring requirements aim at ensuring the correct functioning of the elements of the transmission system, the distribution system and of the grid users' equipment. Planning for and the coordination of operational tests are necessary to minimise disruptions in the stability, operation and economic efficiency of the interconnected system.\n(10)\nIn view that planned outages impact grid stability also outside of a TSO's control area, each TSO should, within the scope of operational planning, monitor the feasibility of planned outages for each time-frame and where necessary, coordinate outages with and between TSOs, DSOs and SGUs when those outages have an impact on cross-border flows affecting the operational security of the transmission systems.\n(11)\nThe operational and scheduling processes required to anticipate real-time operational security difficulties and develop relevant remedial measures involve timely and adequate data exchange. Therefore, such exchange should not be hampered by any barriers between the different actors involved.\n(12)\nOne of the most critical processes in ensuring operational security with a high level of reliability and quality is the load-frequency control (‘LFC’). Effective LFC can be made possible only if there is an obligation for the TSOs and the reserve connecting DSOs to cooperate for the operation of the interconnected transmission systems as one entity and for providers' power generating modules and providers' demand facilities to meet the relevant minimum technical requirements.\n(13)\nThe provisions on LFC and reserves, aim at setting out clear, objective and harmonised requirements for TSOs, reserve connecting DSOs, providers' power generating modules and providers' demand facilities in order to ensure system security and to contribute to non-discrimination, effective competition and the efficient functioning of the internal electricity market. The provisions on LFC and reserves provide the technical framework necessary for the development of cross-border balancing markets.\n(14)\nIn order to ensure the quality of the common system frequency, it is essential that a common set of minimum requirements and principles for Union-wide LFC and reserves are defined as a basis for both the cross-border cooperation between the TSOs and, where relevant, for utilising characteristics of the connected generation, consumption and distribution systems. To that end, this Regulation addresses the LFC structure and operational rules, the quality criteria and targets, the reserve dimensioning, the reserve exchange, sharing and distribution and the monitoring related to LFC.\n(15)\nSynchronous areas do not stop at the Union's borders and can include the territory of third countries. The Union, Member States and TSOs should aim for secure system operation inside all synchronous areas across the Union. They should support third countries in applying similar rules to those contained in this Regulation. ENTSO for Electricity should facilitate cooperation between Union TSOs and third country TSOs concerning secure system operation.\n(16)\nIn accordance with Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 713/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council (2), the Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (‘the Agency’) should take a decision if the competent regulatory authorities are not able to reach an agreement on common terms and conditions or methodologies.\n(17)\nThis Regulation has been developed in close cooperation with the Agency, ENTSO for Electricity and stakeholders, in order to adopt effective, balanced and proportionate rules in a transparent and participative manner. In accordance with Article 18(3) of Regulation (EC) No 714/2009, the Commission will consult the Agency, ENTSO for Electricity and other relevant stakeholders before proposing any amendment to this Regulation.\n(18)\nThe measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee referred to in Article 23(1) of Regulation (EC) No 714/2009,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nPART I\nGENERAL PROVISIONS\nArticle 1\nSubject matter\nFor the purpose of safeguarding operational security, frequency quality and the efficient use of the interconnected system and resources, this Regulation lays down detailed guidelines on:\n(a)\nrequirements and principles concerning operational security;\n(b)\nrules and responsibilities for the coordination and data exchange between TSOs, between TSOs and DSOs, and between TSOs or DSOs and SGUs, in operational planning and in close to real-time operation;\n(c)\nrules for training and certification of system operator employees;\n(d)\nrequirements on outage coordination;\n(e)\nrequirements for scheduling between the TSOs' control areas; and\n(f)\nrules aiming at the establishment of a Union framework for load-frequency control and reserves.\nArticle 2\nScope\n1.

The TSOs of GB and IE/NI synchronous areas shall notify this instance to ENTSO for Electricity.\n5.   A transmission system shall be in the restoration state when a TSO, being in the emergency or blackout state, has started to activate measures of its restoration plan.\nArticle 19\nMonitoring and determination of system states by TSOs\n1.   Each TSO shall, in real-time operation, determine the system state of its transmission system.\n2.   Each TSO shall monitor the following transmission system parameters in real-time in its control area, based on real-time telemetry measurements or on calculated values from its observability area, taking into account the structural and real-time data in accordance with Article 42:\n(a)\nactive and reactive power flows;\n(b)\nbusbar voltages;\n(c)\nfrequency and frequency restoration control error of its LFC area;\n(d)\nactive and reactive power reserves; and\n(e)\ngeneration and load.\n3.

If its transmission system is not in normal state and if that system state is qualified as a wide area state the TSO shall:\n(a)\ninform all TSOs about the system state of its transmission system via an IT tool for the exchange of real-time data at pan-European level; and\n(b)\nprovide with additional information on its transmission system elements which are part of the observability area of other TSOs, to those TSOs.\nArticle 20\nRemedial actions in system operation\n1.   Each TSO shall endeavour to ensure that its transmission system remains in the normal state and shall be responsible for managing operational security violations. To achieve that objective, each TSO shall design, prepare and activate remedial actions taking into account their availability, the time and resources needed for their activation and any conditions external to the transmission system which are relevant for each remedial action.\n2.   The remedial actions used by TSOs in system operation in accordance with paragraph 1 and with Articles 21 to 23 of this Regulation shall be consistent with the remedial actions taken into account in capacity calculation in accordance with Article 25 of Regulation (EU) 2015/1222.\nArticle 21\nPrinciples and criteria applicable to remedial actions\n1.   Each TSO shall apply the following principles when activating and coordinating remedial actions in accordance with Article 23:\n(a)\nfor operational security violations which do not need to be managed in a coordinated way, a TSO shall design, prepare and activate remedial actions to restore the system to the normal state and to prevent the propagation of the alert or emergency state outside of the TSO's control area from the categories defined in Article 22;\n(b)\nfor operational security violations which need to be managed in a coordinated way, a TSO shall design, prepare and activate remedial actions in coordination with other concerned TSOs, following the methodology for the preparation of remedial actions in a coordinated way under Article 76(1)(b) and taking into account the recommendation of a regional security coordinator in accordance with Article 78(4).\n2.   When selecting the appropriate remedial actions, each TSO shall apply the following criteria:\n(a)\nactivate the most effective and economically efficient remedial actions;\n(b)\nactivate remedial actions as close as possible to real-time taking into account the expected time of activation and the urgency of the system operation situation they intend to resolve;\n(c)\nconsider the risks of failures in applying the available remedial actions and their impact on operational security such as:\n(i)\nthe risks of failure or short-circuit caused by topology changes;\n(ii)\nthe risks of outages caused by active or reactive power changes on power generating modules or demand facilities; and\n(iii)\nthe risks of malfunction caused by equipment behaviour;\n(d)\ngive preference to remedial actions which make available the largest cross-zonal capacity for capacity allocation, while satisfying all operational security limits.\nArticle 22\nCategories of remedial actions\n1.   Each TSO shall use the following categories of remedial actions:\n(a)\nmodify the duration of a planned outage or return to service transmission system elements to achieve the operational availability of those transmission system elements;\n(b)\nactively impact power flows by means of:\n(i)\ntap changes of the power transformers;\n(ii)\ntap changes of the phase-shifting transformers;\n(iii)\nmodifying topologies;\n(c)\ncontrol voltage and manage reactive power by means of:\n(i)\ntap changes of the power transformers;\n(ii)\nswitching of the capacitors and reactors;\n(iii)\nswitching of the power-electronics-based devices used for voltage and reactive power management;\n(iv)\ninstructing transmission-connected DSOs and significant grid users to block automatic voltage and reactive power control of transformers or to activate on their facilities the remedial actions set out in points (i) to (iii) if voltage deterioration jeopardises operational security or threatens to lead to a voltage collapse in a transmission system;\n(v)\nrequesting the change of reactive power output or voltage setpoint of the transmission-connected synchronous power generating modules;\n(vi)\nrequesting the change of reactive power output of the converters of transmission-connected non-synchronous power generating modules;\n(d)\nre-calculate day-ahead and intraday cross-zonal capacities in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2015/1222;\n(e)\nredispatch transmission or distribution-connected system users within the TSO's control area, between two or more TSOs;\n(f)\ncountertrade between two or more bidding zones;\n(g)\nadjust active power flows through HVDC systems;\n(h)\nactivate frequency deviation management procedures;\n(i)\ncurtail, pursuant to Article 16(2) of Regulation (EC) No 714/2009, the already allocated cross-zonal capacity in an emergency situation where using that capacity endangers operational security, all TSOs at a given interconnector agree to such adjustment, and re-dispatching or countertrading is not possible; and\n(j)\nwhere applicable, include the normal or alert state, manually controlled load-shedding.\n2.   Where necessary and justified in order to maintain operational security, each TSO may prepare and activate additional remedial actions. The TSO shall report and justify those instances to the relevant regulatory authority and, where applicable, the Member State, at least once every year, after the activation of the additional remedial actions. The relevant reports and justifications shall also be published. The European Commission or the Agency may request the relevant regulatory authority to provide additional information concerning the activation of additional remedial actions in those instances where they affect a neighbouring transmission system.\nArticle 23\nPreparation, activation and coordination of remedial actions\n1.   Each TSO shall prepare and activate remedial actions in accordance with the criteria set out in Article 21(2) to prevent the system state from deteriorating on the basis of the following elements:\n(a)\nthe monitoring and determination of system states in accordance with Article 19;\n(b)\nthe contingency analysis in real-time operation in accordance with Article 34; and\n(c)\nthe contingency analysis in operational planning in accordance with Article 72.\n2.   When preparing and activating a remedial action, including redispatching or countertrading pursuant to Articles 25 and 35 of Regulation (EU) 2015/1222, or a procedure of a TSO's system defence plan which affects other TSOs, the relevant TSO shall assess, in coordination with the TSOs concerned, the impact of such remedial action or measure within and outside of its control area, in accordance with Article 75(1), Article 76(1)(b) and Article 78(1), (2) and (4) and shall provide the TSOs concerned with the information about this impact.\n3.   When preparing and activating remedial actions which have an impact on the transmission-connected SGUs and DSOs, each TSO shall, if its transmission system is in normal or alert state, assess the impact of such remedial actions in coordination with the affected SGUs and DSOs and select remedial actions that contribute to maintaining normal state and secure operation of all involved parties. Each affected SGU and DSO shall provide to the TSO all necessary information for this coordination.\n4.   When preparing and activating remedial actions each TSO shall, if its transmission system is not in normal or alert state, coordinate to the extent possible such remedial actions with the affected transmission-connected SGUs and DSOs to maintain the operational security and the integrity of the transmission system.\nWhen a TSO activates a remedial action each impacted transmission-connected significant grid user and DSO shall execute the instructions given by the TSO\n5.   Where constraints have only consequences on the local state within the TSO's control area and the operational security violation does not need to be managed in a coordinated way, the TSO responsible for its management may decide not to activate remedial actions with costs to relieve them.\nArticle 24\nAvailability of TSO's means, tools and facilities\n1.   Each TSO shall ensure the availability, reliability and redundancy of the following items:\n(a)\nfacilities for monitoring the system state of the transmission system, including state estimation applications and facilities for load-frequency control;\n(b)\nmeans to control the switching of circuit breakers, coupler circuit breakers, transformer tap changers and other equipment which serve to control transmission system elements;\n(c)\nmeans to communicate with the control rooms of other TSOs and RSCs;\n(d)\ntools for operational security analysis; and\n(e)\ntools and communication means necessary for TSOs to facilitate cross-border market operations.\n2.

Within 18 months from the entry into force of this Regulation each TSO shall adopt a business continuity plan detailing its responses to a loss of critical tools, means and facilities, containing provisions for their maintenance, replacement and development. Each TSO shall review at least annually its business continuity plan and update it as necessary and in any case following any significant change of the critical tools, means and facilities or of the relevant system operation conditions. The TSO shall share parts of the business continuity plan which affect DSOs and SGUs with the DSOs and SGUs concerned.\nArticle 25\nOperational security limits\n1.   Each TSO shall specify the operational security limits for each element of its transmission system, taking into account at least the following physical characteristics:\n(a)\nvoltage limits in accordance with Article 27;\n(b)\nshort-circuit current limits according to Article 30; and\n(c)\ncurrent limits in terms of thermal rating including the transitory admissible overloads.\n2.   When defining the operational security limits, each TSO shall take into account the capabilities of SGUs to prevent that voltage ranges and frequency limits in normal and alert states lead to their disconnection.\n3.   In case of changes of one of its transmission system elements, each TSO shall validate and where necessary update the operational security limits.\n4.   For each interconnector each TSO shall agree with the neighbouring TSO on common operational security limits in accordance with paragraph 1.\nArticle 26\nSecurity plan for critical infrastructure protection\n1.   Each TSO shall specify, taking into account Article 5 of Council Directive 2008/114/EC (10), a confidential security plan containing a risk assessment of assets owned or operated by the TSO, covering major physical or cyber threat scenarios determined by the Member State.\n2.   The security plan shall consider potential impacts to the European interconnected transmission systems, and include organizational and physical measures aiming at mitigating the identified risks.\n3.   Each TSO shall regularly review the security plan to address changes of threat scenarios and reflect the evolution of the transmission system.\nCHAPTER 2\nVoltage control and reactive power management\nArticle 27\nObligations of all TSOs regarding voltage limits\n1.   In accordance with Article 18, each TSO shall endeavour to ensure that during the normal state the voltage remains in steady-state at the connection points of the transmission system within the ranges specified in the Tables 1 and 2 of Annex II.\n2.   If the relevant TSO in Spain requires in accordance with Article 16(2) of Regulation (EU) 2016/631 that power generating modules connected to nominal voltages between 300 and 400 kV stay connected in the voltage range from 1,05 to 1,0875 per unit for an unlimited time, that additional voltage range shall be considered by the relevant TSO in Spain when complying with paragraph 1.\n3.   Each TSO shall define the voltage base for the per unit values' notation.\n4.   Each TSO shall endeavour to ensure that, during the normal state and after the occurrence of a contingency, the voltage remains, within wider voltage ranges for limited times of operation if there is agreement about those wider voltage ranges with transmission-connected DSOs, power generating facility owners in accordance with Article 16(2) of Regulation (EU) 2016/631 or HVDC system owners in accordance with Article 18 of Regulation (EU) 2016/1447.\n5.   Each TSO shall agree, with the transmission-connected DSOs and the transmission-connected significant grid users, about voltage ranges at the connection points below 110 kV if those voltage ranges are relevant for maintaining operational security limits. Each TSO shall endeavour to ensure that the voltage remains within the agreed range during the normal state and after the occurrence of a contingency.\nArticle 28\nObligations of SGUs concerning voltage control and reactive power management in system operation\n1.   By 3 months after entry into force of this Regulation, all SGUs which are transmission-connected power generating modules not subject to Article 16 of Regulation (EU) 2016/631, or which are HVDC systems not subject to Article 18 of Regulation (EU) 2016/1447, shall inform their TSO about their capabilities compared to the voltage requirements in Article 16 of Regulation (EU) 2016/631 or in Article 18 of Regulation (EU) 2016/1447, declaring their voltage capabilities and the time they can withstand without disconnection.\n2.   SGUs which are demand facilities subject to the requirements of Article 3 of Regulation (EU) 2016/1388 shall not disconnect due to a disturbance within the voltage ranges referred to in Article 27. By 3 months after entry into force of this Regulation, SGUs which are transmission-connected demand facilities and which are not subject to Article 3 of Regulation (EU) 2016/1388 shall inform their TSO about their capabilities in relation to the voltage requirements defined in Annex II of Regulation (EU) 2016/1388 declaring their voltage capabilities and the time they can withstand without disconnection.\n3.   Each SGU which is a transmission-connected demand facility shall maintain the reactive power setpoints, power factor ranges and voltage setpoints for voltage control in the range agreed with its TSO in accordance with Article 27.\nArticle 29\nObligations of all TSOs concerning voltage control and reactive power management in system operation\n1.   If voltage at a connection point to the transmission system is outside the ranges defined in Tables 1 and 2 of Annex II to this Regulation, each TSO shall apply voltage control and reactive power management remedial actions in accordance with Article 22(1)(c) of this Regulation in order to restore voltage at the connection point within the range specified in Annex II and within time range specified in Article 16 of Regulation (EU) 2016/631 and Article 13 of Regulation (EU) 2016/1388.\n2.   Each TSO shall take into account in its operational security analysis the voltage values at which transmission-connected SGUs not subject to the requirements of Regulation (EU) 2016/631 or Regulation (EU) 2016/1388 may disconnect.\n3.   Each TSO shall ensure reactive power reserve, with adequate volume and time response, in order to keep the voltages within its control area and on interconnectors within the ranges set out in Annex II.\n4.   TSOs interconnected by AC interconnectors shall jointly specify the adequate voltage control regime in order to ensure that the common operational security limits established in accordance with Article 25(4) are respected.\n5.   Each TSO shall agree with each transmission-connected DSO on the reactive power setpoints, power factor ranges and voltage setpoints for voltage control at the connection point between the TSO and the DSO in accordance with Article 15 of Regulation (EU) 2016/1388. To ensure that those parameters are maintained, each transmission-connected DSO shall use its reactive power resources and have the right to give voltage control instructions to distribution-connected SGUs.\n6.   Each TSO shall be entitled to use all available transmission-connected reactive power capabilities within its control area for effective reactive power management and maintaining the voltage ranges set out in Tables 1 and 2 of Annex II of this Regulation.\n7.   Each TSO shall, directly or indirectly in coordination with the transmission-connected DSO where applicable, operate reactive power resources within its control area, including the blocking of automatic voltage/reactive power control of transformers, voltage reduction and low voltage demand disconnection, in order to maintain operational security limits and to prevent a voltage collapse of the transmission system.\n8.   Each TSO shall determine the voltage control actions in coordination with the transmission-connected SGUs and DSOs and with neighbouring TSOs.\n9.   When relevant for the voltage control and reactive power management of the transmission system, a TSO may require, in coordination with a DSO, a distribution-connected SGU to follow voltage control instructions.\nCHAPTER 3\nShort-circuit current management\nArticle 30\nShort-circuit current\nEach TSO shall determine:\n(a)\nthe maximum short-circuit current at which the rated capability of circuit breakers and other equipment is exceeded; and\n(b)\nthe minimum short-circuit current for the correct operation of protection equipment.\nArticle 31\nShort-circuit current calculation and related measures\n1.   Each TSO shall perform short-circuit current calculations in order to evaluate the impact of neighbouring TSOs and transmission-connected SGUs and transmission-connected distribution systems including closed distribution systems on the short-circuit current levels in transmission system. Where a transmission-connected distribution system including closed distribution system has an impact on short-circuit current levels, it shall be included in the transmission system short-circuit current calculations.\n2.   While performing short-circuit current calculations, each TSO shall:\n(a)\nuse the most accurate and high quality available data;\n(b)\ntake into account international standards; and\n(c)\nconsider as the basis of the maximum short-circuit current calculation such operational conditions, which provide the highest possible level of short-circuit current, including the short-circuit current from other transmission systems and distribution systems including closed distribution systems.\n3.   Each TSO shall apply operational or other measures to prevent deviation from the maximum and minimum short-circuit current limits referred to in Article 30, at all time-frames and for all protection equipment. If such a deviation occurs, each TSO shall activate remedial actions or apply other measures to ensure that the limits referred to in Article 30 are re-established. A deviation from those limits is allowed only during switching sequences.\nCHAPTER 4\nPower flow management\nArticle 32\nPower flow limits\n1.   Each TSO shall maintain power flows within the operational security limits defined when the system is in normal state and after the occurrence of a contingency from the contingency list referred to in Article 33(1).\n2.   In the (N-1)-situation, in the normal state each TSO shall maintain power flows within the transitory admissible overloads referred to in Article 25(1)(c), having prepared remedial actions to be applied and executed within the time-frame allowed for transitory admissible overloads.\nCHAPTER 5\nContingency analysis and handling\nArticle 33\nContingency lists\n1.   Each TSO shall establish a contingency list, including the internal and external contingencies of its observability area, by assessing whether any of those contingencies endangers the operational security of the TSO's control area. The contingency list shall include both ordinary contingencies and exceptional contingencies identified by application of the methodology developed pursuant to Article 75.\n2.   To establish a contingency list, each TSO shall classify each contingency on the basis of whether it is ordinary, exceptional or out-of-range, taking into account the probability of occurrence and the following principles:\n(a)\neach TSO shall classify contingencies for its own control area;\n(b)\nwhen operational or weather conditions significantly increase the probability of an exceptional contingency, each TSO shall include that exceptional contingency in its contingency list; and\n(c)\nin order to account for exceptional contingencies with high impact on its own or neighbouring transmission systems, each TSO shall include such exceptional contingencies in its contingency list.\n3.   Each transmission-connected DSO and SGU which is a power generating facility shall deliver all information relevant for contingency analysis as requested by the TSO, including forecast and real-time data, with possible data aggregation in accordance with Article 50(2).\n4.   Each TSO shall coordinate its contingency analysis in terms of coherent contingency lists at least with the TSOs from its observability area, in accordance with the Article 75.\n5.   Each TSO shall inform the TSOs in its observability area about the external contingencies included in its contingency list.\n6.   Each TSO shall inform, sufficiently in advance, the TSOs concerned in its observability area of any intended topological changes on its transmission system elements which are included as external contingencies in the contingency lists of the TSOs concerned.\n7.   Each TSO shall ensure that the real-time data is sufficiently accurate to allow the convergence of load-flow calculations which are performed in the contingency analysis.\nArticle 34\nContingency analysis\n1.   Each TSO shall perform contingency analysis in its observability area in order to identify the contingencies which endanger or may endanger the operational security of its control area and to identify the remedial actions that may be necessary to address the contingencies, including mitigation of the impact of exceptional contingencies.\n2.   Each TSO shall ensure that potential violations of the operational security limits in its control area which are identified by the contingency analysis do not endanger the operational security of its transmission system or of interconnected transmission systems.\n3.   Each TSO shall perform contingency analysis based on the forecast of operational data and on real-time operational data from its observability area. The starting point for the contingency analysis in the N-Situation shall be the relevant topology of the transmission system which shall include planned outages in the operational planning phases.\nArticle 35\nContingency handling\n1.   Each TSO shall assess the risks associated with the contingencies after simulating each contingency from its contingency list and after assessing whether it can maintain its transmission system within the operational security limits in the (N-1) situation.\n2.   When a TSO assesses that the risks associated with a contingency are so significant that it might not be able to prepare and activate remedial actions in a timely manner to prevent non-compliance with the (N-1) criterion or that there is a risk of propagation of a disturbance to the interconnected transmission system, the TSO shall prepare and activate remedial actions to achieve compliance with the (N-1) criterion as soon as possible.\n3.   In case of an (N-1) situation caused by a disturbance, each TSO shall activate a remedial action in order to ensure that the transmission system is restored to a normal state as soon as possible and that this (N-1) situation becomes the new N-Situation.\n4.   A TSO shall not be required to comply with the (N-1) criterion in the following situations:\n(a)\nduring switching sequences;\n(b)\nduring the time period required to prepare and activate remedial actions.\n5.   Unless a Member State determines otherwise, a TSO shall not be required to comply with the (N-1) criterion as long as there are only local consequences within the TSO's control area.\nCHAPTER 6\nProtection\nArticle 36\nGeneral requirements on protection\n1.   Each TSO shall operate its transmission system with the protection and backup protection equipment in order to automatically prevent the propagation of disturbances that could endanger the operational security of its own transmission system and of the interconnected system.\n2.   At least once every 5 years, each TSO shall review its protection strategy and concepts and update them where necessary to ensure the correct functioning of the protection equipment and the maintenance of operational security.\n3.   After a protection operation which had an impact outside a TSO's control area including interconnectors, that TSO shall assess whether the protection equipment in its control area worked as planned and shall undertake corrective actions if necessary.\n4.   Each TSO shall specify setpoints for the protection equipment of its transmission system that ensure reliable, fast and selective fault clearing, including backup protection for fault clearing in case of malfunction of the primary protection system.\n5.   Before protection and backup protection equipment entry into service or following any modifications, each TSO shall agree with the neighbouring TSOs on the definition of protection setpoints for the interconnectors and shall coordinate with those TSOs before changing the settings.\nArticle 37\nSpecial protection schemes\nWhere a TSO uses a special protection scheme, it shall:\n(a)\nensure that each special protection scheme acts selectively, reliably and effectively;\n(b)\nevaluate, when designing a special protection scheme, the consequences for the transmission system in the event of its incorrect functioning, taking into account the impact on TSOs concerned;\n(c)\nverify that the special protection scheme has a comparable reliability to the protection systems used for the primary protection of transmission system elements;\n(d)\noperate the transmission system with the special protection scheme within the operational security limits determined in accordance with Article 25; and\n(e)\ncoordinate special protection scheme functions, activation principles and setpoints with neighbouring TSOs and affected transmission-connected DSOs, including closed distribution systems and affected transmission-connected SGUs.\nArticle 38\nDynamic stability monitoring and assessment\n1.   Each TSO shall monitor the dynamic stability of the transmission system by studies conducted offline in accordance with paragraph 6. Each TSO shall exchange the relevant data for monitoring the dynamic stability of the transmission system with the other TSOs of its synchronous area.\n2.   Each TSO shall perform a dynamic stability assessment at least once a year to identify the stability limits and possible stability problems in its transmission system. All TSOs of each synchronous area shall coordinate the dynamic stability assessments, which shall cover all or parts of the synchronous area.\n3.   When performing coordinated dynamic stability assessments, concerned TSOs shall determine:\n(a)\nthe scope of the coordinated dynamic stability assessment, at least in terms of a common grid model;\n(b)\nthe set of data to be exchanged between concerned TSOs in order to perform the coordinated dynamic stability assessment;\n(c)\na list of commonly agreed scenarios concerning the coordinated dynamic stability assessment; and\n(d)\na list of commonly agreed contingencies or disturbances whose impact shall be assessed through the coordinated dynamic stability assessment.\n4.   In case of stability problems due to poorly damped inter-area oscillations affecting several TSOs within a synchronous area, each TSO shall participate in a coordinated dynamic stability assessment at the synchronous area level as soon as practicable and provide the data necessary for that assessment. Such assessment shall be initiated and conducted by the concerned TSOs or by ENTSO for Electricity.\n5.   When a TSO identifies a potential influence on voltage, rotor angle or frequency stability in relation with other interconnected transmission systems, the TSOs concerned shall coordinate the methods used in the dynamic stability assessment, providing the necessary data, planning of joint remedial actions aiming at improving the stability, including the cooperation procedures between the TSOs.\n6.   In deciding the methods used in the dynamic stability assessment, each TSO shall apply the following rules:\n(a)\nif, with respect to the contingency list, steady-state limits are reached before stability limits, the TSO shall base the dynamic stability assessment only on the offline stability studies carried out in the longer term operational planning phase;\n(b)\nif, under planned outage conditions, with respect to the contingency list, steady-state limits and stability limits are close to each other or stability limits are reached before steady-state limits, the TSO shall perform a dynamic stability assessment in the day-ahead operational planning phase while those conditions remain. The TSO shall plan remedial actions to be used in real-time operation if necessary; and\n(c)\nif the transmission system is in the N-situation with respect to the contingency list and stability limits are reached before steady-state limits, the TSO shall perform a dynamic stability assessment in all phases of operational planning and re-assess the stability limits as soon as possible after a significant change in the N-situation is detected.\nArticle 39\nDynamic stability management\n1.   Where the dynamic stability assessment indicates that there is a violation of stability limits, the TSOs in whose control area the violation has appeared shall design, prepare and activate remedial actions to keep the transmission system stable. Those remedial actions may involve SGUs.\n2.   Each TSO shall ensure that the fault clearing times for faults that may lead to wide area state transmission system instability are shorter than the critical fault clearing time calculated by the TSO in its dynamic stability assessment carried out in accordance with Article 38.\n3.   In relation to the requirements on minimum inertia which are relevant for frequency stability at the synchronous area level:\n(a)\nall TSOs of that synchronous area shall conduct, not later than 2 years after entry into force of this Regulation, a common study per synchronous area to identify whether the minimum required inertia needs to be established, taking into account the costs and benefits as well as potential alternatives.

The methods referred to in point (a) of paragraph 1 shall allow the identification of all elements of a TSO's observability area, being grid elements of other TSOs or transmission-connected DSOs, power generating modules or demand facilities. Those methods shall take into account the following transmission system elements and SGUs' characteristics:\n(a)\nconnectivity status or electrical values (such as voltages, power flows, rotor angle) which significantly influence the accuracy of the results of the state estimation for the TSO's control area, above common thresholds;\n(b)\nconnectivity status or electrical values (such as voltages, power flows, rotor angle) which significantly influence the accuracy of the results of the TSO's operational security analysis, above common thresholds; and\n(c)\nrequirement to ensure an adequate representation of the connected elements in the TSO's observability area.\n3.   The values referred to in points (a) and (b) of paragraph 2 shall be determined through situations representative of the various conditions which can be expected, characterised by variables such as generation level and pattern, level of electricity exchanges across the borders and asset outages.\n4.   The methods referred to in point (a) of paragraph 1 shall allow the identification of all elements of a TSO's external contingency list with the following characteristics:\n(a)\neach element has an influence factor on electrical values, such as voltages, power flows, rotor angle, in the TSO's control area greater than common contingency influence thresholds, meaning that the outage of this element can significantly influence the results of the TSO's contingency analysis;\n(b)\nthe choice of the contingency influence thresholds shall minimize the risk that the occurrence of a contingency identified in another TSO's control area and not in the TSO's external contingency list could lead to a TSO's system behaviour deemed not acceptable for any element of its internal contingency list, such as an emergency state;\n(c)\nthe assessment of such a risk shall be based on situations representative of the various conditions which can be expected, characterised by variables such as generation level and pattern, exchange levels, asset outages.\n5.   The principles for common risk assessment referred to in point (b) of paragraph 1 shall set out criteria for the assessment of interconnected system security. Those criteria shall be established with reference to a harmonised level of maximum accepted risk between the different TSO's security analysis. Those principles shall refer to:\n(a)\nthe consistency in the definition of exceptional contingencies;\n(b)\nthe evaluation of the probability and impact of exceptional contingencies; and\n(c)\nthe consideration of exceptional contingencies in a TSO's contingency list when their probability exceeds a common threshold.\n6.   The principles for assessing and dealing with uncertainties referred to in point (c) of paragraph 1 shall provide for keeping the impact of the uncertainties regarding generation or demand below an acceptable and harmonised maximum level for each TSO's operational security analysis. Those principles shall set out:\n(a)\nharmonised conditions where one TSO shall update its operational security analysis. The conditions shall take into account relevant aspects such as the time horizon of the generation and demand forecasts, the level of change of forecasted values within the TSO's control area or within the control area of other TSOs, location of generation and demand, the previous results of its operational security analysis; and\n(b)\nminimum frequency of generation and demand forecast updates, depending on their variability and the installed capacity of non-dispatchable generation.\nArticle 76\nProposal for regional operational security coordination\n1.   By 3 months after the approval of the methodology for coordinating operational security analysis in Article 75(1), all TSOs of each capacity calculation region shall jointly develop a proposal for common provisions for regional operational security coordination, to be applied by the regional security coordinators and the TSOs of the capacity calculation region. The proposal shall respect the methodologies for coordinating operational security analysis developed in accordance with Article 75(1) and complement where necessary the methodologies developed in accordance with Articles 35 and 74 of Regulation (EU) 2015/1222. The proposal shall determine:\n(a)\nconditions and frequency of intraday coordination of operational security analysis and updates to the common grid model by the regional security coordinator;\n(b)\nthe methodology for the preparation of remedial actions managed in a coordinated way, considering their cross-border relevance as determined in accordance with Article 35 of Regulation (EU) 2015/1222, taking into account the requirements in Articles 20 to 23 and determining at least:\n(i)\nthe procedure for exchanging the information of the available remedial actions, between relevant TSOs and the regional security coordinator;\n(ii)\nthe classification of constraints and the remedial actions in accordance with Article 22;\n(iii)\nthe identification of the most effective and economically efficient remedial actions in case of operational security violations referred to in Article 22;\n(iv)\nthe preparation and activation of remedial actions in accordance with Article 23(2);\n(v)\nthe sharing of the costs of remedial actions referred to in Article 22, complementing where necessary the common methodology developed in accordance with Article 74 of Regulation (EU) 2015/1222. As a general principle, costs of non-cross-border relevant congestions shall be borne by the TSO responsible for the given control area and costs of relieving cross-border-relevant congestions shall be covered by TSOs responsible for the control areas in proportion to the aggravating impact of energy exchange between given control areas on the congested grid element.\n2.   In determining whether congestion have cross-border relevance, the TSOs shall take into account the congestion that would appear in the absence of energy exchanges between control areas.\nArticle 77\nOrganisation for regional operational security coordination\n1.

Each TSO shall carry out the assessment concerning the indicative availability plans for internal relevant assets referred to in paragraph 1 every year until the start of the year-ahead outage coordination.\nArticle 94\nProvision of year-ahead availability plan proposals\n1.   Before 1 August of each calendar year, an outage planning agent other than a TSO taking part in an outage coordination region, a DSO or a CDSO, shall submit to the TSO(s) taking part in an outage coordination region, and where relevant to the DSO(s) or CDSO(s), an availability plan covering the following calendar year for each of its relevant assets.\n2.   The TSO(s) referred to in paragraph 1 shall endeavour to examine the requests for amendment of an availability plan when received. Where this is not possible, it shall examine the requests for amendment of an availability plan after the year-ahead outage coordination has been finalised.\n3.   The TSO(s) referred to in paragraph 1 shall examine the requests for amendment of an availability plan after the year-ahead outage coordination has been finalised:\n(a)\nfollowing the order in which the requests were received; and\n(b)\napplying the procedure established in accordance with Article 100.\nArticle 95\nYear-ahead coordination of the availability status of relevant assets for which the outage planning agent is not a TSO taking part in an outage coordination region, nor a DSO or a CDSO\n1.

When a TSO detects outage planning incompatibilities, it shall implement the following process:\n(a)\ninform each affected outage planning agent of the conditions it shall fulfil to mitigate the detected outage planning incompatibilities;\n(b)\nthe TSO may request that one or more outage planning agents submit an alternative availability plan fulfilling the conditions referred to in point (a); and\n(c)\nthe TSO shall repeat the assessment pursuant to paragraph 1 to determine whether any outage planning incompatibilities remain.\n3.   Following a TSO's request in accordance with point (b) of paragraph 2, if the outage planning agent fails to submit an alternative availability plan aimed at mitigating all outage planning incompatibilities, the TSO shall develop an alternative availability plan which shall:\n(a)\ntake into account the impact reported by the affected outage planning agents as well as the DSO or CDSO where relevant;\n(b)\nlimit the changes in the alternative availability plan to what is strictly necessary to mitigate the outage planning incompatibilities; and\n(c)\nnotify its regulatory authority, the affected DSOs and CDSOs if any, and the affected outage planning agents about the alternative availability plan, including the reasons for developing it, as well as the impact reported by the affected outage planning agents and, where relevant, the DSOs or CDSOs.\nArticle 96\nYear-ahead coordination of the availability status of relevant assets for which the outage planning agent is a TSO taking part in an outage coordination region, a DSO or a CDSO\n1.   Each TSO shall plan the availability status of relevant grid elements interconnecting different control areas for which it acts as an outage planning agent in coordination with the TSOs of the same outage coordination region.\n2.   Each TSO, DSO and CDSO shall plan the availability status of the relevant grid elements for which they perform duties of outage planning agents and that are not interconnecting different control areas, using as a basis the availability plans developed in accordance with paragraph 1.\n3.   When establishing the availability status of relevant grid elements in accordance with paragraphs 1 and 2, the TSO, DSO and CDSO shall:\n(a)\nminimize the impact on the market while preserving operational security; and\n(b)\nuse as a basis the availability plans submitted and developed in accordance with Article 94.\n4.   Where a TSO detects an outage planning incompatibility, the TSO shall be entitled to propose a change to the availability plans of the internal relevant assets for which the outage planning agent is neither a TSO taking part in an outage coordination region, nor a DSO or a CDSO and shall identify a solution in coordination with the outage planning agents, DSOs and CDSOs concerned, using the means at its disposal.\n5.   Where the ‘unavailable’ status of a relevant grid element has not been planned after taking the measures in paragraph 4 and the absence of such planning would threaten operational security, the TSO shall:\n(a)\ntake the necessary actions to plan the ‘unavailable’ status while ensuring operational security, taking into account the impact reported to the TSO by affected outage planning agents;\n(b)\nnotify the actions referred to in point (a) to all affected parties; and\n(c)\nnotify the relevant regulatory authorities, the affected DSOs or CDSOs if any and the affected outage planning agents of the actions taken, including the rationale for such actions, the impact reported by affected outage planning agents and the DSOs or CDSOs where relevant.\n6.

An outage planning agent shall be able to launch a procedure for the amendment of the final year-ahead availability plan in the time between the finalisation of the year-ahead outage coordination and its real-time execution.\n2.   The outage planning agent which is not a TSO taking part in an outage coordination region shall be able to submit to the relevant TSO(s) a request for amendment of the final year-ahead availability plan of the relevant assets under its responsibility.\n3.   In case of a request for amendment pursuant to paragraph 2, the following procedure shall be applied:\n(a)\nthe recipient TSO shall acknowledge the request and assess as soon as reasonably practicable whether the amendment leads to outage planning incompatibilities;\n(b)\nwhere outage planning incompatibilities are detected, the involved TSOs of the outage coordination region shall jointly identify a solution in coordination with the outage planning agents concerned and, if relevant, the DSOs and CDSOs, using the means at their disposal;\n(c)\nwhere no outage planning incompatibility has been detected or if no outage planning incompatibility remains, the recipient TSO shall validate the requested amendment, and the TSOs concerned shall consequently notify all affected parties and update the final year-ahead availability plan on the ENTSO for Electricity operational planning data environment; and\n(d)\nwhere no solution is found for outage planning incompatibilities the recipient TSO shall reject the requested amendment.\n4.   When a TSO taking part in an outage coordination region intends to amend the final year-ahead availability plan of a relevant asset for which it acts as the outage planning agent, it shall initiate the following procedure:\n(a)\nthe requesting TSO shall prepare a proposal for amendment to the year-ahead availability plan, including an assessment of whether it could lead to outage planning incompatibilities and shall submit its proposal to all other TSOs of its outage coordination region(s);\n(b)\nwhere outage planning incompatibilities are detected, the involved TSOs of the outage coordination region shall jointly identify a solution in coordination with the concerned outage planning agents and, if relevant, the DSOs and the CDSOs, using the means at their disposal;\n(c)\nwhere no outage planning incompatibility has been detected or if a solution to an outage planning incompatibility is found, the concerned TSOs shall validate the requested amendment and consequently they shall notify all affected parties and update the final year-ahead availability plan on the ENTSO for Electricity operational planning data environment;\n(d)\nwhere no solution to outage planning incompatibilities are found, the requesting TSO shall retract the procedure for amendment.\nCHAPTER 3\nExecution of availability plans\nArticle 101\nManagement of the ‘testing’ status of relevant assets\n1.   The outage planning agent of a relevant asset the availability status of which has been declared as ‘testing’ shall provide the TSO, and, if connected to a distribution system, including closed distribution systems, the DSO or the CDSO within 1 month before the start of the ‘testing’ status, with:\n(a)\na detailed test plan;\n(b)\nan indicative generation or consumption schedule if the concerned relevant asset is a relevant power generating module or a relevant demand facility; and\n(c)\nchanges to the topology of the transmission system or distribution system if the concerned relevant asset is a relevant grid element.\n2.   The outage planning agent shall update the information referred to in paragraph 1 as soon as it is subject to any change.\n3.   The TSO of a relevant asset the availability status of which has been declared as ‘testing’ shall provide the information received in accordance with paragraph 1 to all other TSOs of its outage coordination region(s), upon their request.\n4.   Where the relevant asset referred to in paragraph 1 is a relevant grid element interconnecting two or more control areas, the TSOs of the concerned control areas shall agree on the information to be provided pursuant to paragraph 1.\nArticle 102\nProcedure for handling forced outages\n1.   Each TSO shall develop a procedure to address the case where a forced outage would endanger its operational security. The procedure shall allow the TSO to ensure that the ‘available’ or ‘unavailable’ status of other relevant assets in its control area can be changed to ‘unavailable’ or ‘available’ respectively.\n2.   The TSO shall follow the procedure referred to in paragraph 1 only where no agreement is reached with outage planning agents regarding solutions to forced outages. The TSO shall notify the regulatory authority accordingly.\n3.   When undertaking the procedure, the TSO shall respect, to the extent possible, the technical limits of the relevant assets.\n4.   An outage planning agent shall notify the forced outage of one or more of its relevant assets to the TSO and, if connected to a distribution system or to a closed distribution system, the DSO or the CDSO respectively, as soon as possible following the start of the forced outage.\n5.   When notifying the forced outage, the outage planning agent shall provide the following information:\n(a)\nthe reason for the forced outage;\n(b)\nthe expected duration of the forced outage; and\n(c)\nwhere applicable, the impact of the forced outage on the availability status of other relevant assets for which it is the outage planning agent.\n6.   When the TSO detects that one or several forced outages referred to in paragraph 1 could lead the transmission system out of the normal state, it shall inform the affected outage planning agent(s) about the deadline at which operational security can no longer be maintained unless their relevant asset(s) in forced outage returns to ‘available’ status. The outage planning agents shall inform the TSO whether they are capable of respecting that deadline and shall provide reasoned justifications where they are unable to respect that deadline.\n7.   Following any amendments to the availability plan due to forced outages and in accordance with the time-frame established in Articles 7, 10 and 15 of Regulation (EU) No 543/2013, the concerned TSO shall update the ENTSO for Electricity operational planning data environment with the most recent information.\nArticle 103\nReal-time execution of the availability plans\n1.

All TSOs involved in the exchange of FCR within a synchronous area shall respect the limits and requirements for the exchange of FCR within the synchronous area specified in the Table of Annex VI.\n3.   In case of exchange of FCR, the reserve connecting TSO and reserve receiving TSO shall notify it in accordance with Article 150.\n4.   Any reserve connecting TSO, reserve receiving TSO or affected TSO involved in the exchange of FCR may refuse the exchange of FCR where it would result in power flows that violate the operational security limits when activating the reserve capacity on FCR subject to the exchange of FCR.\n5.   Each affected TSO shall verify that its reliability margin, established in accordance with Article 22 of Regulation (EU) 2015/1222, is sufficient to accommodate the power flows resulting from the activation of the reserve capacity on FCR subject to the exchange of FCR.\n6.

It creates the European Network of Transmission System Operators for electricity (ENTSOE) which, together with the Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators, develops the European network codes and guidelines — i.e. the rules for the operation of the electricity and gas sectors, which are then adopted by the European Commission. These rules seek to ensure that Europe’s energy transmission systems meet the goals of security of supply, increased competitiveness and affordable energy.\nIn introducing a guideline on electricity transmission system operation, Commission Regulation (EU) 2017/1485 is a highly technical regulation and has five sections. This summary focuses on some of the content of the first section which lays down general aspects. It then provides an outline of the content of the technical sections.\nGENERAL ASPECTS\nSubject matter\nThe regulation lays down detailed guidelines on:\nrequirements and principles concerning operational security;\nrules and responsibilities for the coordination and data exchange between TSOs, between TSOs and DSOs, and between TSOs or DSOs and SGUs, in operational planning and in close to real-time operation;\nrules for training and certification of system operator employees;\nrules on operational security analysis, including regional operational security coordination and appointment of regional security coordinators (RSCs);\nrequirements on outage coordination;\nrequirements for scheduling between the control areas for which the TSOs are responsible; and\nrules aiming at the establishment of an EU-wide framework for load-frequency control and reserves.\nScope\nThe regulation applies to all transmission systems, distribution systems and interconnections in the EU and regional security coordinators except those located in islands of EU countries of which the systems are not operated synchronously (i.e. interconnected) with Continental Europe (‘CE’), Great Britain (‘GB’), Nordic, Ireland and Northern Ireland (‘IE/NI’) or Baltic synchronous area.\nDefinitions\nThe regulation contains 159 — mostly technical — definitions.\nTECHNICAL SECTIONS\nThe areas covered by the technical sections of the regulation concern:\n1.Operational security:operational security requirements,data exchange,compliance,training.\n2.\nOperational planning:\ndata for operational security analysis in operational planning,\noperational security analysis (including rules concerning the organisation of regional operational security coordination via the appointment of RSCs),\noutage coordination,\nadequacy,\nancillary services (a service necessary for the operation of a transmission or distribution system),\nscheduling,\nENTSOE operational planning data environment.\n3.\nLoad-frequency control and reserves:\noperational agreements,\nfrequency quality,\nload-frequency control structure,\noperation of load-frequency control,\nfrequency containment reserves,\nfrequency restoration reserves,\nreplacement reserves,\nexchange and sharing of reserves,\ntime control process,\ncooperation with DSOs,\ntransparency of information.\nThe final section of the regulation is mainly concerned with application dates.\nFROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?\n              \nThe general rules introduced by the regulation apply from 14 September 2017. However, Articles 41 to 53 (on data exchange between TSOs, between TSOs and DSOs with the TSO’s control area, between TSOs, DSOs and distribution-connected power generating modules, and between TSOs and transmission-connected demand facilities) apply from 14 March 2019 and Article 54(4) (compliance tests and simulations carried out by SGUs) from 18 August 2019.\nBACKGROUND\n              \nFor more information, see:\nElectricity network codes and guidelines (European Commission).\nKEY TERMS\n              \ntransmission system operator (TSO): an organisation which is responsible for the transport of energy at national or regional level using fixed infrastructure.\ndistribution system operator (DSO): an organisation responsible for providing and operating low, medium and high voltage networks for regional distribution of electricity as well as for supply of lower-level distribution systems and directly connected customers.\nsignificant grid user (SGU): the existing and new power generating facility and demand facility deemed by the TSO as significant because of their impact on the transmission system in terms of the security of supply, including provision of ancillary services.\nMAIN DOCUMENT\n            \nCommission Regulation (EU) 2017/1485 of 2 August 2017 establishing a guideline on electricity transmission system operation (OJ L 220, 25.8.2017, pp. 1-120)\nRELATED DOCUMENTS\n            \nRegulation (EC) No 714/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 July 2009 on conditions for access to the network for cross-border exchanges in electricity and repealing Regulation (EC) No 1228/2003 (OJ L 211, 14.8.2009, pp. 15-35)\nSuccessive amendments to Regulation (EC) No 714/2009 have been incorporated into the original document.
