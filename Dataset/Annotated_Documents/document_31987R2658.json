{"celex_id": "31987R2658", "reference": "7.9.1987\nEN\nOfficial Journal of the European Communities\nL 256/1\nCOUNCIL REGULATION (EEC) No 2658/87\nof 23 July 1987\non the tariff and statistical nomenclature and on the Common Customs Tariff\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,\nHaving regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community and in particular Articles 28, 43, 113 and 235 thereof,\nHaving regard to the Act of Accession of Spain and Portugal,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the Commission (1),\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European Parliament (2),\nHaving regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee (3),\nWhereas the European Economic Community is based on a customs union involving the use of a common customs tariff;\nWhereas the collection and exchange of data on the statistics of external trade of the Community can best be achieved through the use of a combined nomenclature replacing the existing Common Customs Tariff and Nimexe nomenclatures, in order to meet tariff and statistical requirements simultaneously;\nWhereas the Community is a signatory to the International Convention on the Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System, known as the ‘harmonized system’, which is intended to replace the Convention of 15 December 1950 on Nomenclature for the Classification of Goods in Customs Tariffs;\nwhereas, as a consequence, the said combined nomenclature must be established on the basis of the harmonized system;\nWhereas it is appropriate to allow Member States to create national statistical subdivisions;\nWhereas certain specific Community measures cannot be dealt with in the framework of the combined nomenclature; whereas it is therefore necessary to create additional Community subdivisions and to include them in an integrated tariff of the European Communities (Taric); whereas the efficient management of the Taric requires a system for immediate updating; whereas it is therefore necessary that the Commission should be empowered to manage the Taric;\nWhereas Spain and Portugal will not be able to use the Taric layout in the same manner as the other Member States because of the transitional tariff arrangements provided for in the Act of Accession; whereas it is appropriate that these two Member States should be authorized not to apply the Taric for the periods during which the transitional arangements apply;\nWhereas it appears appropriate that Member States should be able to insert further subdivisions after the Taric subheadings in order to meet additional national requirements; whereas these subdivisions should be identified by appropriate code numbers in accordance with the provisions of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2793/86 of 22 July 1986 laying down the codes to be used in the forms laid down in Regulations (EEC) No 678/85, (EEC) No 1900/85 and (EEC) No 222/77 (4);\nWhereas it is essential that the combined nomenclature and any other nomenclature wholly or partly based on it, or which adds subdivisions to it, should be applied in a uniform manner by all the Member States; whereas provisions to this effect must be able to be adopted at Community level; whereas, furthermore, the Community provisions ensuring uniform application of the nomenclature of the Common Customs Tariff contained in Decision 86/98/ECSC (5) are applicable to products falling within the province of the Treaty establishing the European Coal and Steel Community;\nWhereas the preparation and application of these provisions requires close cooperation between the Member States and the Commision; whereas the implementation of these provisions must be carried out rapidly in view of the serious economic consequences that any delay might entail;\nWhereas, in order to ensure uniform application of the combined nomenclature, it is necessary for the Commission to be assisted by a committee responsible for all questions relating to the combined nomenclature, to the Taric and to all other nomenclatures based on the combined nomenclature; whereas this Committee must be operational as soon as possible prior to the date of application of the combined nomenclature;\nWhereas, in order to define the scope of the combined nomenclature, it is desirable to lay down preliminary provisions, additional section and chapter notes and suitable footnotes;\nWhereas the Common Customs Tariff consists not only of the conventional and autonomous duties and other relevant charges fixed in Annex I to this Regulation on the basis of the combined nomenclature, but also of the tariff measures contained in the Taric and other Community legislation;\nWhereas in fixing the conventional rates of duty it is appropriate to take account of GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) negotiations;\nWhereas the transition from the former nomenclature to the combined nomenclature may involve difficulties with the application of origin rules in respect of certain preference systems, in particular where the third country involved has not adopted the harmonized system; whereas it is appropriate in these circumstances to provide for suitable measures intended to remedy these difficulties;\nWhereas, although the nomenclature and the rates of customs duties relating to products covered by the Treaty establishing the European Coal and Steel Community do not form part of the Common Customs Tariff, it is nevertheless appropriate to include the conventional rates for these products for information in this Regulation;\nWhereas, following the setting-up of the combined nomenclature, numerous Community acts in particular in the field of the common agricultural policy must be adapted to take into account the use of this nomenclature; whereas these adaptations do not as a general rule call for any amendment of substance; whereas for purposes of simplification it is appropriate to enable the Commission to adopt the necessary technical amendments to the acts in question;\nWhereas the entry into force of this Regulation involves the repeal of Council Regulation (EEC) No 950/68 of 28 June 1968 on the Common Customs Tariff (6) and of Council Regulation (EEC) No 97/69 of 16 January 1969 on measures to be taken for the uniform application of the nomenclature of the Common Customs Tariff (7), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2055/84 (8),\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nArticle 1\n1.   A goods nomenclature, hereinafter called the ‘combined nomenclature’, or in abbreviated form ‘CN’, is hereby established to meet, at one and the same time, the requirements both of the Common Customs Tariff and of the external trade statistics of the Community.\n2.   The combined nomenclature shall comprise:\n(a)\nthe harmonized system nomenclature;\n(b)\nCommunity subdivisions to that nomenclature, referred to as ‘CN subheadings’ in those cases where a corresponding rate of duty is specified;\n(c)\npreliminary provisions, additional section or chapter notes and footnotes relating to CN subheadings.\n3.   The combined nomenclature is reproduced in Annex I.\nThe autonomous and conventional rates of duty of the Common Customs Tariff and the supplementary statistical units, as well as other necessary information, are laid down in the said Annex.\nArticle 2\nThe Commission shall establish an integrated tariff, of the European Communities, hereinafter referred to as the ‘Taric’, based on the combined nomenclature. It shall comprise:\n(a)\nadditional Community subdivisions, referred to as ‘Taric’ subheadings’, which are needed for the description of goods subject to the specific Community measures listed in Annex II;\n(b)\nthe rates of customs duty and other charges applicable;\n(c)\nthe code numbers mentioned in Article 3 (3) and (4);\n(d)\nany other information necessary for the implementation or management of the Community measures involved.\nArticle 3\n1.   Each CN subheading shall have an eight digit code number:\n(a)\nthe first six digits shall be the code numbers relating to the headings and subheadings of the harmonized system nomenclature;\n(b)\nthe seventh and eighth digits shall identify the CN subheadings. When a heading or subheading of the harmonized system is not further subdivided for Community purposes, the seventh and eight digits shall be ‘00’.\n2.   The ninth digit shall be reserved for the use of the Member States for national statistical subdivisions, to be inserted in accordance with Article 5 (3).\n3.   The Taric subheadings shall be identified by the 10th and 11th digits which, together with the code numbers referred to in paragraph 1, form the Taric code numbers. In the absence of a Community subdivision, the 10th and 11th digits shall be ‘00’.\n4.   Exceptionally, an additional Taric code of four digits may be used for the application of specific Community measures which are not coded, or not entirely coded, at the 10th and 11 th digit level.\nArticle 4\n1.   The combined nomenclature, together with the rates of duty and other relevant charges, and the tariff measures included in the Taric or in other Community arrangements shall constitute the common customs tariff referred to in Article 9 of the Treaty, which shall be applied on the importation of goods into the Community.\n2.   The combined nomenclature, including its code numbers and, where appropriate, the supplementary statistical units relating to it, shall be applied by the Community and by the Member States to the statistics relating to the external trade of the Community.\nArticle 5\n1.   The Taric shall be used by the Commission and the Member States for the application of Community measures concerning imports and, where necessary, exports and trade between Member States.\n2.   The Taric code numbers shall be applied to all importations of goods covered by the corresponding subheadings. They shall, where necessary, be applied to exports and to trade between Member States.\n3.   Member States may insert subdivisions after the CN subheadings for national statistical purposes, and after the Taric subheadings for other national purposes.\nIdentifying code numbers shall be assigned to such subdivisions in accordance with Regulation (EEC) No 2793/86.\n4.   Member States which adopt subdivisions for national purposes other than statistics, may, on informing the Commission, defer the use of Taric subheadings and the corresponding 10th and 11 th digits until 31 December 1989 at the latest.\nArticle 6\nThe Commission shall be responsible for the management and publication of the Taric. It shall, in particular, take the steps necessary to:\n(a)\nintegrate the measures listed in Annex II into the Taric;\n(b)\nattribute Taric code numbers;\n(c)\nupdate the Taric;\n(d)\ninform Member States immediately of changes to Taric subheadings and numeric codes.\nArticle 7\n1.   The Commission shall be assisted by a Committee on Tariff and Statistical Nomenclature, called the ‘Nomenclature Committee’ and hereinafter referred to as the ‘committee’, composed of the representatives of the Member States and chaired by the representatives of the Commission.\n2.   The committee shall adopt its own rules of procedure.\nArticle 8\nThe committee may examine any matter referred to it by its chairman, either on his own initiative or at the request of a representative of a Member State:\n(a)\nconcerning the combined nomenclature;\n(b)\nconcerning the Taric nomenclature and any other nomenclature which is wholly or partly based on the combined nomenclature or which adds any subdivisions to it, and which is established by specific Community provisions with a view to the application of tariff or other measures relating to trade in goods.\nArticle 9\n1.   Measures relating to the matters set out below shall be adopted in accordance with the procedure defined in Article 10:\n(a)\napplication of the combined nomenclature and the Taric concerning in particular:\n—\nthe classification of goods in the nomenclatures referred to in Article 8,\n—\nexplanatory notes;\n(b)\namendments to the combined nomenclature to take account of changes in requirements relating to statistics or to commercial policy;\n(c)\namendments to Annex II;\n(d)\namendments to the combined nomenclature and adjustments to duties in accordance with decisions adopted by the Council or the Commission;\n(e)\namendments to the combined nomenclature intended to adapt it to take account of technological or commercial developments or aimed at the alignment or clarification of texts;\n(f)\namendments to the combined nomenclature resulting from changes to the harmonized system nomenclature;\n(g)\nquestions relating to the application, functioning and management of the harmonized system to be discussed within the Customs Cooperation Council.\n2.   The provisions adopted under paragraph 1 shall not amend:\n—\nthe rates of customs duties,\n—\nagricultural levies, refunds or other amounts applicable within the framework of the common agricultural policy or within that of specific schemes applicable to certain goods resulting from the processing of agricultural products,\n—\nquantitative restrictions laid down under Community provisions,\n—\nnomenclatures adopted within the framework of the common agricultural policy.\n3.   If necessary, amendments to CN subheadings shall be immediately included as Taric subheadings. They shall only be included in the CN under the conditions referrred to in Article 12.\nArticle 10\n1.   The representative of the Commission shall submit to the committee a draft of the measures to be adopted. The committee shall deliver its opinion on the draft within a time limit which the chairman may lay down according to the urgency of the matter. The opinion shall be delivered by the majority laid down in Article 148 (2) of the Treaty in the case of decisions which the Council is required to adopt on a proposal from the Commission. The votes of the representatives of the Member States within the committee shall be weighted in the manner set out in that Article. The chairman shall not vote.\n2.   The Commission shall adopt the measures, which shall apply immediately. However, if those measures are not in accordance with the opinion of the committee, they shall be communicated by the Commission to the Council forthwith. In that event the Commission shall defer application of the measures which it has decided upon for three months from the date of such communication.\n3.   The Council, acting by qualified majority, may take a different decision within the period referred to in paragraph 2.\nArticle 11\n1.   Where Community provisions prescribe conditions concerning the eligibility of goods for a favourable tariff arrangement upon importation, having regard to their nature or end use, those conditions may be fixed according to the procedures laid down in Article 10.\n2.   For the purposes of paragraph 1, ‘favourable tariff arrangement’ means any reduction or suspension, even under a tariff quota, of a customs duty or charge having equivalent effect or of an agricultural levy or other import charge provided for under the common agricultural policy or under the specific arrangements applicable to certain goods resulting from the processing of agricultural products.\nArticle 12\nThe Commission shall adopt each year by means of a Regulation a complete version of the combined nomenclature together with the corresponding autonomous and conventional rates of duty of the Common Customs Tariff, as it results from measures adopted by the Council or by the Commission. The said Regulation shall be published not later than 31 October in the Official Journal of the European Communities and it shall apply from 1 January of the following year.\nArticle 13\nThe Kingdom of Spain and the Portuguese Republic are hereby authorized not to apply the Taric for the periods during which the transitional arrangements pertaining to tariff matters provided for in the Act of Accession to the Community apply.\nArticle 14\nWhere a tariff preference is granted on the basis of rules of origin derived from the nomenclature of the Customs Cooperation Council in force on 31 December 1987, those rules shall remain applicable in accordance with the Community acts in force on that date.\nArticle 15\n1.   The codes and the descriptions of goods established on the basis of the combined nomenclature shall replace those established on the basis of the nomenclatures of the Common Customs Tariff and the Nimexe, without prejudice to international agreements concluded by the Community before the entry into force of this Regulation, and to acts taken in implementation thereof, which refer to the said nomenclatures.\nCommunity acts which include the tariff or statistical nomenclature shall be amended accordingly by the Commission.\n2.   References to the Nimexe in the various Community acts in force shall be deemed to refer to the combined nomenclature.\nArticle 16\nRegulations (EEC) No 950/68 and (EEC) No 97/69 are hereby repealed.\nArticle 17\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.\nArticles 1 to 5 and 12 to 16 shall not apply until 1 January 1988.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.\nDone at Brussels, 23 July 1987.\nFor the Council\nThe President\nK.E.

General rules for the interpretation of the combined nomenclature\nClassification of goods in the combined nomenclature shall be governed by the following principles:\n1.\nThe titles of sections, chapters and sub-chapters are provided for ease of reference only; for legal purposes, classification shall be determined according to the terms of the headings and any relative section or chapter notes and, provided such headings or notes do not otherwise require, according to the following provisions:\n2.\n(a)\nAny reference in a heading to an article shall be taken to include a reference to that article incomplete or unfinished, provided that, as presented, the incomplete or unfinished article has the essential character of the complete or finished article. It shall also be taken to include a reference to that article complete or finished (or falling to be classified as complete or finished by virtue of this rule), presented unassembled or disassembled.\n(b)\nAny reference in a heading to a material or substance shall be taken to include a reference to mixtures or combinations of that material or substance with other materials or substances. Any reference to goods of a given material or substance shall be taken to include a reference to goods consisting wholly or partly of such material or substance. The classification of goods consisting of more than one material or substance shall be according to the principles of rule 3.\n3.\nWhen by application of rule 2 (b) or for any other reason, goods are prima facie classifiable under two or more headings, classification shall be effected as follows:\n(a)\nThe heading which provides the most specific description shall be preferred to headings providing a more general description. However, when two or more headings each refer to part only of the materials or substances contained in mixed or composite goods or to part only of the items in a set put up for retail sale, those headings are to be regarded as equally specific in relation to those goods, even if one of them gives a more complete or precise description of the goods.\n(b)\nMixtures, composite goods consisting of different materials or made up of different components, and goods put up in sets for retail sale, which cannot be classified by reference to 3 (a), shall be classified as if they consisted of the material or component which gives them their essential character in so far as this criterion is applicable.\n(c)\nWhen goods cannot be classified by reference to 3 (a) or (b), they shall be classified under the heading which occurs last in numerical order among those which equally merit consideration.\n4.\nGoods which cannot be classified in accordance with the above rules shall be classified under the heading appropriate to the goods to which they are most akin.\n5.\nIn addition to the foregoing provisions, the following rules shall apply in respect of the goods referred to therein:\n(a)\nCamera cases, musical instrument cases, gun cases, drawing-instrument cases, necklace cases and similar containers, specially shaped or fitted to contain a specific article or set of articles, suitable for long-term use and presented with the articles for which they are intended, shall be classified with such articles when of a kind normally sold therewith. The rule does not, however, apply to containers which give the whole its essential character.\n(b)\nSubject to the provisions of rule 5 (a) above, packing materials and packing containers (1) presented with the goods therein shall be classified with the goods if they are of a kind normally used for packing such goods. However, this provision is not binding when such packing materials or packing containers are clearly suitable for repetitive use.\n6.\nFor legal purposes, the classification of goods in the subheadings of a heading shall be determined according to the terms of those subheadings and any related subheading notes and mutatis mutandis to the above rules, on the understanding that only subheadings at the same level are comparable. For the purposes of the rule the relative section and chapter notes also apply, unless the context otherwise requires.\nB.   General rules concerning duties\n1.\nThe customs duties applicable to imported goods originating in countries which are Contracting Parties to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade or with which the European Economic Community has concluded agreements containing the most-favoured-nation tariff clause shall be the conventional duties shown in column 4 of the schedule of duties. Unless the context otherwise requires, these conventional duties are applicable to goods, other than those referred to above, imported from any third country.\nThe autonomous duties shown in column 3 are applicable:\n—\nwhen they are less than the conventional duties, or\n—\nwhen no conventional duty exists, in which case a dash is shown in column 4.\n2.\nParagraph 1 shall not apply where special autonomous customs duties are provided for in respect of goods originating in certain countries or where preferential customs duties are applicable in pursuance of agreements.\n3.\nParagraphs 1 and 2 shall not preclude the Member States from applying customs duties other than those of the Common Customs Tariff where the application of such other duties is justified by Community law.\n4.\nThe duties expressed as percentage rates in columns 3 and 4 are ad valorem duties.\n5.\nThe symbol ‘(AGR)’ appearing in column 3 opposite certain headings or subheadings denotes that the goods concerned are subject to levies.\nWhen the customs duty is followed by the sign ‘ + ’ and the symbol ‘(AGR)’ for example ‘16 + (AGR)’, the goods are subject to both duty and levy.\nWhen the customs duty is followed by the symbol ‘(AGR)’, for example ‘20 (AGR)’, the figure 20 refers to a rate of duty made obsolete by the introduction of the levy system.\n6.\nThe symbol ‘MOB’ in columns 3 and 4 denotes that the goods concerned are chargeable with a ‘variable component’ determined under the regulations relating to trade in certain goods processed from agricultural products.\n7.\nThe symbol ‘AD S/Z’ or ‘AD F/M’ in column 4 in Chapters 17, 18 and 19 indicates that the maximum rate of duty consists of an ad valorem duty plus an additional duty for certain forms of sugar or for flour. This additional duty is fixed in accordance with the rules concerning trade in certain processed agricultural products.\n8.\nThe symbol ‘AD S/Z’ in column 4 in Chapters 8 and 20 indicates that the Community reserves the right to charge, over and above the bound duty, an additional duty on sugar corresponding to the duty payable on imported sugar and applicable to the quantity of various sugars contained in this product in excess of the percentage by weight laid down in the additional note to Chapter 8 and in additional notes 3 and 5 to Chapter 20, or, in respect of products falling within heading Nos 0811, 2006, 2007 and 2008 which exceed 13 % by weight.\n9.\nIn heading No 2008, column 4, the symbol ‘2 AD S/Z’ indicates that the applicable rate of the additional duty on sugar is fixed at a standard rate of 2 % of the customs value of the goods.\nC.   General rules applicable both to nomenclature and to duties\n1.\nUnless provided otherwise, the provisions relating to customs value shall be applied to determine, in addition to the value for the assessment of ad valorem customs duties, the values by reference to which the scope of certain headings or subheadings is defined.\n2.\nThe dutiable weight, in the case of goods chargeable by weight, and the weights by reference to which the scope of certain headings or subheadings is defined, shall be taken to be:\n(a)\nin the case of a reference to ‘gross weight’, the aggregate weight of the goods and of all the packing materials and packing containers;\n(b)\nin the case of a reference to ‘net weight’ or simply to ‘weight’ without qualification, the weight of the goods themselves without packing materials and packing containers of any kind.\n3.\nPursuant to the first subparagraph of Article 2 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 2779/78 (2), the equivalent in national currencies of the EC U by reference to which certain specific customs duties are expressed, or which is used as a criterion limiting the scope of certain subheadings, shall be that obtaining on the first working day of October 1987 to be published in the Official Journal of the European Communities‘C’ series.\nSECTION II\nSPECIAL PROVISIONS\nA.

Civil aircraft and goods for use in civil aircraft\n1.\nRelief from customs duty is provided for:\n—\ncivil aircraft,\n—\ncertain goods for use in civil aircraft and for incorporation therein in the course of their manufacture, repair, maintenance, rebuilding, modification or conversion,\n—\nground flying-trainers and their parts, for civil use.\nThese goods are covered by subheading (3) with a footnote reference in the following terms:\nEntry under this subheading is subject to conditions laid down in the relevant Community provisions. See also Section II, paragraph B, of the Preliminary Provisions.\n2.\nFor the purposes of paragraph 1, ‘civil aircraft’ means aircraft other than aircraft used in military or similar services in the Member States which carry a military or non-civil registration.\n3.\nFor the application of pargraph 1, second indent, the expression ‘for use in civil aircraft’ in all relevant subheadings (2) shall include goods for use in ground flying trainers for civil use.\nC.   Standard rate of duty\n1.\nCustoms duty shall be charged at the flat rate of 10 % ad valorem on goods:\n—\nsent in small consignments to private individuals, or\n—\ncontained in travellers' personal luggage,\nprovided that such importations are not of a commercial nature and that the total value of such goods does not exceed 115 ECU per consignment or per traveller.\nSuch flat rate assessment shall not apply to goods falling within Chapter 24.\n2.\nAn importation shall be treated as not being of a commercial nature if:\n—\nit is occasional, and\n—\nit consists solely of goods for personal or family use by the consignee or, in the case of travellers, imported goods intended as gifts: such goods shall be of such kind or quality that there is no indication that they are being imported for any commercial purpose.\n3.\nThe flat rate charge shall apply independently of the duty-free admission granted in respect of goods contained in traveller's personal luggage, in accordance with Articles 45 to 49 of Regulation (EEC) No 918/83 (4).\n4.\nThe flat rate of customs duty shall not apply to goods imported under the conditions set out above if the person entitled has, before the said flat rate is applied to them, requested that they be subject to the customs duties appropriate to them. All the goods making up the consignment shall then be subject to the import duties which are appropriate to them, without prejudice to the duty-free admission under Articles 45 to 49 of Regulation (EEC) No 918/83.\nFor the purposes of the first subparagraph, import duties shall mean both customs duties and charges having equivalent effect and agricultural levies and other import charges provided for under the common agricultural policy or under specific arrangements laid down for certain goods resulting from the processing of agricultural products.\n5.\nMember States may round off the amount in national currency resulting from the conversion of the sum of 115 ECU.\n6.\nMember States may maintain unchanged the equivalent in national currency of the sum of 115 ECU if, at the time of the annual adjustment provided for in the first paragraph of Article 2 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 2779/78, as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 289/84 (5), the conversion of this amount, before rounding off provided for in paragraph 5, results in a change of less than 5 % in the equivalent in national currency.\nD.   Containers and packing materials\nThe following provisions are applicable to the containers and packing materials referred to in general interpretative rule 5 (a) and (b) and put into free circulation at the same time as the goods which they contain or with which they are presented:\n1.\nWhen the containers and packing materials are classified with the goods in accordance with the provisions of general interpretative rule 5, they shall be:\n(a)\nchargeable at the same rate of customs duty as the goods:\n—\nwhere such goods are subject to an ad valorem customs duty, or\n—\nwhere they are to be included in the dutiable weight of the goods;\n(b)\nadmitted free of customs duties:\n—\nwhere the goods are free of customs duty, or\n—\nwhere the goods are dutiable otherwise than by reference to weight or value, or\n—\nwhere the weight of the containers and packing materials is not to be included in the dutiable weight of the goods.\n2.\nWhere containers and packing materials covered by the provisions of paragraphs 1 (a) and (b) above contain or are presented with goods of several different tariff descriptions, the weight and value of the containers and packing materials shall, for the purpose of determining their dutiable weight or value, be apportioned between all the goods contained, in proportion to the weight or value of those goods.\nSIGNS, ABBREVIATIONS AND SYMBOLS\nAC\nAlternating current\nAD F/M\nAdditional duty on flour\nAD S/Z\nAdditional duty on sugar\nAGR\nLevy\nMOB\nVariable component\nSUPPLEMENTARY UNITS\nc/k\nCarats (1 metric carat = 2 x 10-4 kg)\nct/l\nCarrying capacity in tonnes (6)\ng\nGram\ngi F/S\nGram of fissile isotopes\nBRT\nGross registered ton (28 316 m3)\n100 p/st\nHundred items\nkg 90 % sdt\nKilogram of substance 90 % dry\nkg K2O\nKilogram of potassium oxide\nkg KOH\nKilogram of potassium hydroxide (caustic potash)\nkg N\nKilogram of nitrogen\nkg NaOH\nKilogram of sodium hydroxide (caustic soda)\nkg P2O5\nKilogram of phosphorus pentoxide (phosphoric anhydride)\nkg U\nKilogram of uranium\n1 000 kWh\n1 000 kilowatt hours\nl\nLitre\nl alc. 100 %\nLitre pure (100 %) alcohol\nm\nMetre\nm2\nSquare metre\nm3\nCubic metre\n1 000 m3\n1 000 cubic metres\np/st\nNumber of items\npa\nNumber of pairs\n1 000 p/st\nThousand items\nPART II\nSCHEDULE OF CUSTOMS DUTIES\nSECTION I\nLIVE ANIMALS;

this section the term ‘pellets’ means products which have been agglomerated either directly by compression or by the addition of a binder in a proportion not exceeding 3 % by weight.\nCHAPTER 16\nPREPARATIONS OF MEAT, OF FISH OR OF CRUSTACEANS, MOLLUSCS OR OTHER AQUATIC INVERTEBRATES\nNotes\n1.\nThis chapter does not cover meat, meat offal, fish, crustaceans, molluscs or other aquatic invertebrates, prepared or preserved by the processes specified in Chapter 2 or 3.\n2.\nFood preparations fall in this chapter provided that they contain more than 20 % by weight of sausage, meat, meat offal, blood, fish or crustaceans, molluscs or other aquatic invertebrates, or any combination thereof. In cases where the preparation contains two or more of the products mentioned above, it is classified within the heading of Chapter 16 corresponding to the component or components which predominate by weight. These provisions do not apply to the stuffed products of heading No 1902 or to the preparations of heading No 2103 or 2104.\nSubheading notes\n1.\nFor the purposes of subheading 1602 10, the expression ‘homogenized preparations’ means preparations of meat, meat offal or blood, finely homogenized, put up for retail sale as infant food or for dietetic purposes, in containers of a net weight content not exceeding 250 g. For the application of this definition no account is to be taken of small quantities of any ingredients which may have been added to the preparation for seasoning, preservation or other purposes. These preparations may contain a small quantity of visible pieces of meat or meat offal. This subheading takes precedence over all other subheadings of heading No 1602.\n2.\nThe fish and crustaceans specified in the subheadings of heading No 1604 or 1605 under their common names only, are of the same species as those mentioned in Chapter 3 under the same name.\nAdditional notes\n1.\nFor the purposes of subheadings 1602 31 11, 1602 39 11, 1602 50 10, 1602 90 61 and 1602 90 71 the term ‘uncooked’ shall apply to products which have not been subjected to any heat treatment or which have been subjected to a heat treatment insufficient to ensure the coagulation of meat proteins in the whole of the product and which therefore, in the case of subheadings 1602 50 10, 1602 90 61 and 1602 90 71 show traces of a pinkish liquid on the cut surface when the product is cut along a line passing through its thickest part.\n2.\nFor the purposes of subheadings 1602 41, 1602 42 and 1602 49 11 to 1602 49 15 the expression ‘parts thereof’ applies only to prepared or preserved meat which, due to the size and the characteristics of the coherent muscle tissue, is identifiable as having been obtained from hams, shoulders, loins, or collars of domestic swine, as the case may be.\nCN

temperature;\n(b)\n‘potential alcoholic strength by volume’ means the number of volumes of pure alcohol at a temperature of 20 oC capable of being produced by total fermentation of the sugars contained in 100 volumes of the product at that temperature;\n(c)\n‘total alcoholic strength by volume’ means the sum of the actual and potential alcoholic strengths;\n(d)\n‘natural alcoholic strength by volume’ means the total alcoholic strength by volume of a product before any enrichment;\n(e)\n‘% vol’ is the symbol for alcoholic strength by volume.\n2.\nFor the purposes of subheading 2204 30 10, ‘grape must in fermentation’ means the product derived from the fermentation of grape must, having an actual alcoholic strength by volume of more than 1 % vol and less than three-fifths of its total alcoholic strength by volume.\n3.\nFor the purposes of subheadings 2204 21 and 2204 29:\nA.\n‘Total dry extract’ means the content in grams per litre of all the substances in a product which, under given physical conditions, do not volatilize.\nThe total dry extract must he determined with the densimeter at 20 oC.\nB.\n(a)\nThe presence in the products falling within subheadings 2204 21 21 to 2204 21 90 and 2204 29 21 to 2204 29 90 of the quantities of total dry extract per litre indicated in I, II, III and IV below does not affect their classification:\nI.\nProducts of an actual

distillation of wine and having a maximum actual alcoholic strength by volume of 86 % vol,\nand\n—\nhaving a maximum volatile acidity of 1,5 g/l, expressed as acetic acid;\n(c)\nliqueur wine, that is to say a product:\n—\nhaving a total alcoholic strength by volume of not less than 17,5 % vol and an actual alcoholic strength by volume of not less than 15 % vol but not more than 22 % vol,\nand\n—\nobtained from grape must or wine, which must come from vine varieties approved in the third country of origin for the production of liqueur wine and have a minimum natural alcoholic strength by volume of 12 % vol,\n—\nby freezing,\nor\n—\nby the addition during or after fermentation:\n—\nof a product derived from the distillation of wine, or\n—\nof concentrated grape must or, in the case of certain quality liqueur wines appearing on a list to be adopted of wines for which such practice is traditional, of grape must concentrated by direct heat, which, apart from this operation, corresponds to the definition of concentrated grape must, or\n—\nof a mixture of these products.\nHowever, certain quality liqueur wines appearing on a list to be adopted may be obtained from unfermented fresh grape must which does not need to have a minimum natural alcoholic strength by volume of 12 % vol.\n5.\nFor the purposes of subheading 2206 00 10, the expression ‘piquette’

which could be included in two or more of the headings of this chapter are to be classified in that one of those headings which occurs last in numerical order.\n4.\nIn heading Nos 2904 to 2906, 2908 to 2911 and 2913 to 2920, any reference to halogenated, sulphonated, nitrated or nitrosated derivatives includes a reference to compound derivatives, such as sulphohalogenated, nitrohalogenated, nitrosulphonated or nitrosulphohalogenated derivatives.\nNitro or nitroso groups are not to be taken as ‘nitrogen-functions’ for the purposes of heading No 2929.\nFor the purposes of heading Nos 2911, 2912, 2914, 2918 and 2922, ‘oxygen-function’ is to be restricted to the functions (the characteristic organic oxygen-containing groups) referred to in heading Nos 2905 to 2920.\n5.\n(a)\nThe esters of acid-function organic compounds of sub-chapters I to VII with organic compounds of these sub-chapters are to be classified with that compound which is classified within the heading which occurs last in numerical order in these sub-chapters.\n(b)\nEsters of ethyl alcohol or glycerol with acid-function organic compounds of sub-chapters I to VII are to be classified within the same heading as the corresponding acid-function compounds.\n(c)\nSubject to note 1 to Section VI and note 2 to Chapter 28:\n(1)\ninorganic salts of organic compounds such as acid-, phenol- or enol-function compounds or organic bases, of sub-chapters I to X or heading No 2942, are to be classified within the heading appropriate to the organic compound; and\n(2)\nsalts formed between organic compounds of sub-chapters I to X or heading No 2942 are to be classified within the heading appropriate to the base or to the acid (including phenol- or enol-function compounds) from which they are formed, whichever occurs last in numerical order in the chapter.\n(d)\nMetal alcoholates are to be classified within the same heading as the corresponding alcohols except in the case of ethanol and glycerol (heading No 2905).\n(e)\nHalides of carboxylic acids are to be classified within the same heading as the corresponding acids.\n6.\nThe compounds of heading Nos 2930 and 2931 are organic compounds the molecules of which contain, in addition to atoms of hydrogen, oxygen or nitrogen, atoms of other non-metals or of metals (such as sulphur, arsenic, mercury or lead) directly linked to carbon atoms.\nHeading No 2930 (organo-sulphur compounds) and heading No 2931 (other organo-inorganic compounds) do not include sulphonated or halogenated derivatives (including compound derivatives) which, apart from hydrogen, oxygen and nitrogen, only have directly linked to carbon the atoms of sulphur or of a halogen which give them their nature of sulphonated or halogenated derivatives (or compound derivatives).\n7.\nHeading Nos 2932, 2933 and 2934 do not include epoxides with a three-membered ring, ketone peroxides, cyclic polymers of aldehydes or of thioaldehydes, anhydrides of polybasic carboxylic acids, cyclic esters of polyhydric alcohols or phenols with polybasic acids, or imides of polybasic acids.\nThese provisions apply only when the ring-position hetero-atoms are those resulting solely from the cyclizing function or functions here listed.\nSubheading note\n1.\nWithin any one heading of this chapter, derivatives of a chemical compound (or group of chemical compounds) are to be classified in the same subheading as that compound (or group of compounds) provided that they are not more specifically covered by any other subheading and that there is no residual subheading named ‘other’ in the series of subheadings concerned.\nCN code\nDescription\nRate of duty\nautonomous (%)\nConventional (%)\nSupplementary unit\n(1)\n(2)\n(3)\n(4)\n(5)\nI.HYDROCARBONS AND

RUBBER AND ARTICLES THEREOF\nNotes\n1.\nGoods put up in sets consisting of two or more separate constituents, some or all of which fall in this section and are intended to be mixed together to obtain a product of Section VI or VII, are to be classified in the heading appropriate to that product, provided that the constituents are:\n(a)\nhaving regard to the manner in which they are put up, clearly identifiable as being intended to be used together without first being repacked;\n(b)\npresented together; and\n(c)\nidentifiable, whether by their nature or by the relative proportions in which they are present, as being complementary one to another.\n2.\nExcept for the goods of heading No 3918 or 3919, plastics, rubber, and articles thereof, printed with motifs, characters or pictorial representations, which are not merely incidental to the primary use of the goods, fall within Chapter 49.\nCHAPTER 39\nPLASTICS AND ARTICLES THEREOF\nNotes\n1.\nThroughout the nomenclature the expression ‘plastics’ means those materials of heading Nos 3901 to 3914 which are or have been capable, either at the moment of polymerization or at some subsequent stage, of being formed under external influence (usually heat and pressure, if necessary with a solvent or plasticizer) by moulding, casting, extruding, rolling or other process into shapes which are retained on the removal of the external influence.\nThroughout the nomenclature any reference to ‘plastics’ also includes vulcanized fibre. The expression, however, does not apply to materials regarded as textile materials of Section XI.\n2.\nThis chapter does not cover:\n(a)\nwaxes of heading No 2712 or 3404;\n(b)\nseparate chemically defined organic compounds (Chapter 29);\n(c)\nheparin or its salts (heading No 3001);\n(d)\nstamping foils of heading No 3212;\n(e)\norganic surface-active agents or preparations of heading No 3402;\n(f)\nrun gums or ester gums (heading No 3806);\n(g)\nsynthetic rubber, as defined for the purposes of Chapter 40, or articles thereof;\n(h)\nsaddlery or harness (heading No 4201) or trunks, suitcases, handbags or other containers of heading No 4202;\n(ij)\nplaits, wickerwork or other articles of Chapter 46;\n(k)\nwall coverings of heading No 4814;\n(l)\ngoods of Section XI (textiles and textile articles);\n(m)\narticles of Section XII (for example, footwear, headgear, umbrellas, sun umbrellas, walking-sticks, whips, riding-crops or parts thereof);\n(n)\nimitation jewellery of heading No 7117;\n(o)\narticles of Section XVI (machines and mechanical or electrical appliances);\n(p)\nparts of aircraft or vehicles of Section XVII;\n(q)\narticles of Chapter 90 (for example, optical elements, spectacle frames, drawing instruments);\n(r)\narticles of Chapter 91 (for example, clock or watch cases);\n(s)\narticles of Chapter 92 (for example, musical instruments or parts thereof);\n(t)\narticles of Chapter 94 (for example, furniture, lamps and lighting fittings, illuminated signs, prefabricated buildings);\n(u)\narticles of Chapter 95 (for example, toys, games, sports requisites); or\n(v)\narticles of Chapter 96 (for example, brushes, buttons, slide fasteners, combs, mouthpieces or stems for smoking pipes, cigarette-holders or the like, parts of vacuum flasks or the like, pens, propelling pencils).\n3.\nHeading Nos 3901 to 3911 apply only to goods of a kind produced by chemical synthesis, falling in the following categories:\n(a)\nliquid synthetic polyolefins of which less than 60 % by volume distils at 300 oC, after conversion to 1013 mbar when a reduced-pressure distillation method is used (heading Nos 3901 and 3902);\n(b)\nresins, not highly polymerized, of the coumarone-indene type (heading No 3911);\n(c)\nother synthetic polymers with an average of at least five monomer units;\n(d)\nsilicones (heading No 3910);\n(e)\nresols (heading No 3909) and other prepolymers.\n4.\nFor the purposes of this chapter, except where the context otherwise requires, copolymers (including co-polycondensates, co-polyaddition products, block copolymers and graft copolymers) and polymer blends are to be classified in the heading covering polymers of that comonomer which predominates by weight over every other single comonomer, comonomers whose polymers fall in the same heading being regarded as constituting a single comonomer.\nIf no single comonomer predominates, copolymers or polymer blends, as the case may be, are to be classified in the heading which occurs last in numerical order among those which equally merit consideration.\nThe expression ‘copolymers’ covers all polymers in which no single monomer contributes 95 % or more by weight to the total polymer content.\n5.\nChemically modified polymers, that is those in which only appendages to the main polymer chain have been changed by chemical reaction, are to be classified in the heading appropriate to the unmodified polymer. This provision does not apply to graft copolymers.\n6.\nIn heading Nos 3901 to 3914, the expression ‘primary forms’ applies only to the following forms:\n(a)\nliquids and pastes, including dispersions (emulsions and suspensions) and solutions;\n(b)\nblocks of irregular shape, lumps, powders (including moulding powders), granules, flakes and similar bulk forms.\n7.\nHeading No 3915 does not apply to waste, parings and scrap of a single thermoplastic material, transformed into primary forms (heading Nos 3901 to 3914).\n8.\nFor the purposes of heading No 3917, the expression ‘tubes, pipes and hoses’ means hollow products, whether semi-manufactured or finished products, of a kind generally used for conveying, conducting or distributing gases or liquids (for example, ribbed garden hose, perforated tubes). This expression also includes sausage casings and other lay-flat tubing. However, except for the last mentioned, those having an internal cross-section other than round, oval, rectangular (in which the length does not exceed one-and-a-half times the width) or in the shape of a regular polygon are not to be regarded as tubes, pipes and hoses but as profile shapes.\n9.\nFor the purposes of heading No 3918, the expression ‘wall or ceiling coverings of plastics’ applies to products in rolls, of a width not less than 45 cm, suitable for wall or ceiling decoration, consisting of plastics fixed permanently on a backing of any material other than paper, the layer of plastics (on the face side) being grained, embossed, coloured, design-printed or otherwise decorated.\n10.\nIn heading Nos 3920 and 3921, the expression ‘plates, sheets, film, foil and strip’ applies only to plates, sheets, film, foil and strip (other than those of Chapter 54) and to blocks of regular geometric shape, whether or not printed or otherwise surface-worked, uncut or cut into rectangles (including squares) but not further worked (even if when so cut they become articles ready for use).\n11.\nHeading No 3925 applies only to the following articles, not being products covered by any of the earlier headings of sub-chapter II:\n(a)\nreservoirs, tanks (including septic tanks), vats and similar containers, of a capacity exceeding 300 litres;\n(b)\nstructural elements used, for example, in floors, walls or partitions, ceilings or roofs;\n(c)\ngutters and fittings therefor;\n(d)\ndoors, windows and their frames and thresholds for doors;\n(e)\nbalconies, balustrades, fencing, gates and similar barriers;\n(f)\nshutters, blinds (including Venetian blinds) and similar articles and parts and fittings thereof;\n(g)\nlarge-scale shelving for assembly and permanent installation, for example, in shops, workshops, warehouses;\n(h)\nornamental architectural features, for example, flutings, cupolas, dovecotes;\n(ij)\nfittings and mountings intended for permanent installation in or on doors, windows, staircases, walls or other parts of buildings, for example, knobs, handles, hooks, brackets, towel rails, switch-plates and other protective plates.\nSubheading note\n1.\nWithin any one heading of this chapter, copolymers (including co-polycondensates, co-polyaddition products, block copolymers and graft copolymers) are to be classified in the same subheading as homopolymers of the predominant comonomer and chemically modified polymers of the kind specified in chapter note 5 are to be classified in the same subheading as the unmodified polymer, provided that such copolymers or chemically modified polymers are not more specifically covered by any other subheading and that there is no residual subheading named ‘Other’ in the series of subheadings concerned. Polymer blends are to be classified in the same subheading as copolymers (or homopolymers, as the case may be) of the same monomers in the same proportions.\nCN code\nDescription\nRate of

bathing caps) of Chapter 65;\n(d)\nmechanical or electrical appliances or parts thereof of Section XVI (including electrical goods of all kinds), of hard rubber;\n(e)\narticles of Chapter 90, 92, 94 or 96; or\n(f)\narticles of Chapter 95 (other than sports gloves and articles of heading Nos 4011 to 4013).\n3.\nIn heading Nos 4001 to 4003 and 4005, the expression ‘primary forms’ applies only to the following forms:\n(a)\nliquids and pastes (including latex, whether or not pre-vulcanized, and other dispersions and solutions);\n(b)\nblocks of irregular shape, lumps, bales, powders, granules, crumbs and similar bulk forms.\n4.\nIn note 1 to this chapter and in heading No 4002, the expression ‘synthetic rubber’ applies to:\n(a)\nunsaturated synthetic substances which can be irreversibly transformed by vulcanization with sulphur into non-thermoplastic substances which, at a temperature between 18 and 29 oC, will not break on being extended to three times their original length and will return, after being extended to twice their original length, within a period of five minutes, to a length not greater than one-and-a-half times their original length. For the purposes of this test, substances necessary for the cross-linking, such as vulcanizing activators or accelerators, may be added; the presence of substances as provided for by note 5 (b) (ii) and (iii) is also permitted. However, the presence of any substances not necessary for the cross-linking, such as extenders, plasticizers and fillers, is not permitted;\n(b)\nthioplasts (TM); and\n(c)\nnatural rubber modified by grafting or mixing with plastics, depolymerized natural rubber, mixtures of unsaturated synthetic substances with saturated synthetic high polymers provided that all the abovementioned products comply with the requirements concerning vulcanization, elongation and recovery in (a) above.\n5.\n(a)\nHeading Nos 4001 and 4002 do not apply to any rubber or mixture of rubbers which has been compounded, before or after coagulation, with:\n(i)\nvulcanizing agents, accelerators, retarders or activators (other than those added for the preparation of pre-vulcanized rubber latex);\n(ii)\npigments or other colouring matter, other than those added solely for the purpose of identification;\n(iii)\nplasticizers or extenders (except mineral oil in the case of oil-extended rubber), fillers, reinforcing agents, organic solvents or any other substances, except those permitted under (b);\n(b)\nThe presence of the following substances in any rubber or mixture of rubbers shall not affect its classification in heading No 4001 or 4002, as the case may be, provided that such rubber or mixture of rubbers retains its essential character as a raw material:\n(i)\nemulsifiers or anti-tack agents;\n(ii)\nsmall amounts of breakdown products of emulsifiers;\n(iii)\nvery small amounts of the following: heat-sensitive agents (generally for obtaining thermosensitive rubber latexes), cationic surface-active agents (generally for obtaining electro-positive rubber latexes), antioxidants, coagulants, crumbling agents, freeze-resisting agents, peptizers, preservatives, stabilizers, viscosity-control agents, or similar special-purpose additives.\n6.\nFor the purposes of heading No 4004, the expression ‘waste, parings and scrap’ means rubber waste, parings and scrap from the manufacture or working of rubber and rubber goods definitely not usable as such because of cutting-up, wear or other reasons.\n7.\nThread wholly of vulcanized rubber, of which any cross-sectional dimension exceeds 5 mm, is to be classified as strip, rods or profile shapes, of heading No 4008.\n8.\nHeading No 4010 includes conveyor or transmission belts or belting of textile fabric impregnated, coated, covered or laminated with rubber or made from textile yarn or cord impregnated, coated, covered or sheathed with rubber.\n9.\nIn heading Nos 4001, 4002, 4003, 4005 and 4008, the expressions ‘plates’, ‘sheets’ and ‘strip’ apply only to plates, sheets and strip and to blocks of regular geometric shape, uncut or simply cut to rectangular (including square) shape, whether or not having the character of articles and whether or not printed or otherwise surface-worked, but not otherwise cut to shape or further worked.\nIn heading No 4008 the expressions ‘rods’ and ‘profile shapes’ apply only to such products, whether or not cut to length or surface-worked but not otherwise worked.\nCN code\nDescription\nRate of duty\nautonomous (%)\nConventional (%)\nSupplementary

fibres’ means staple fibres and filaments of organic polymers produced by manufacturing processes, either:\n(a)\nby polymerization of organic monomers, such as polyamides, polyesters, polyurethanes or polyvinyl derivatives; or\n(b)\nby chemical transformation of natural organic polymers (for example, cellulose, casein, proteins or algae), such as viscose rayon, cellulose acetate, cupro or alginates.\nThe terms ‘synthetic’ and ‘artificial’, used in relation to fibres, mean: synthetic: fibres as defined at (a); artificial: fibres as defined at (b).\nThe terms ‘man-made’, ‘synthetic’ and ‘artificial’ shall have the same meanings when used in relation to ‘textile materials’.\n2.\nHeading Nos 5402 and 5403 do not apply to synthetic or artificial filament tow of Chapter 55.\nCN

or\n(c)\northopaedic appliances, surgical belts, trusses or the like (heading No 9021).\n3.\nFor the purposes of heading Nos 6103 and 6104:\n(a)\nThe term ‘suit’ means a set of garments composed of two or three pieces made up in identical fabric and comprising:\n—\none garment designed to cover the lower part of the body and consisting of trousers, breeches or shorts (other than swimwear), a skirt or a divided skirt, having neither braces nor bibs, and\n—\none suit coat or jacket the outer shell of which, exclusive of sleeves, consists of four or more panels, designed to cover the upper part of the body, possibly with a tailored waistcoat in addition.\nAll of the components of a suit must be of the same fabric construction, style, colour and composition; they must also be of corresponding or compatible size. If several separate components to cover the lower part of the body are presented together (for example trousers and shorts, or a skirt or divided skirt and trousers), the constituent lower part shall be the trousers, or, in the case of women's or girls' suits, the skirt or divided skirt, the other garments being considered separately.\nThe term ‘suit’ includes the following sets of garments, whether or not they fulfil all the above conditions:\n—\nmorning dress, comprising a plain jacket (cutaway) with rounded tails hanging well down at the back and striped trousers,\n—\nevening dress (tailcoat), generally made of black fabric, the jacket of which is relatively short at the front, does not close and has narrow skirts cut in at the hips and hanging down behind,\n—\ndinner jacket suits, in which the jacket is similar in style to an ordinary jacket (though perhaps revealing more of the shirt front), but has shiny silk or imitation silk lapels;\n(b)\nThe term ‘ensemble’ means a set of garments (other than suits and articles of heading No 6107, 6108 or 6109), composed of several pieces made up in identical fabric, put up for retail sale, and comprising:\n—\none garment designed to cover the upper part of the body, with the exception of pullovers which may form a second upper garment in the sole context of twin sets, and of waistcoats which may also form a second upper garment, and\n—\none or two different garments, designed to cover the lower part of the body and consisting of trousers, bib and brace overalls, breeches, shorts (other than swimwear), a skirt or a divided skirt.\nAll of the components of an ensemble must be of the same fabric construction, style, colour and composition; they also must be of corresponding or compatible size. The term ‘ensemble’ does not apply to track suits or ski suits, of heading No 6112.\n4.\nHeading Nos 6105 and 6106 do not cover garments with pockets below the waist, with a ribbed waistband or other means of tightening at the bottom of the garment, or garments having an average of less than 10 stitches per linear centimetre in each direction counted on an area measuring at least 10 cm x 10 cm. Heading No 6105 does not cover sleeveless garments.\n5.\nFor the purposes of heading No 6111:\n(a)\nThe expression ‘babies’ garments and clothing accessories' means articles for young children of a body height not exceeding 86 cm; it also covers babies' napkins;\n(b)\nArticles which are prima facie classifiable both within heading No 6111 and within other headings of this chapter are to be classified within heading No 6111.\n6.\nFor the purposes of heading No 6112 ‘ski suits’ means garments or sets of garments which, by their general appearance and texture, are identifiable as intended to be worn principally for skiing (cross-country or alpine). They consist either of:\n(a)\na ‘ski overall’, that is, a one-piece garment designed to cover the upper and the lower parts of the body; in addition to sleeves and a collar the ski overall may have pockets or footstraps; or\n(b)\na ‘ski ensemble’, that is, a set of garments composed of two or three pieces, put up for retail sale and comprising:\n—\none garment such as an anorak, wind-cheater, wind-jacket or similar article, closed by a slide fastener (zipper), possibly with a waistcoat in addition, and\n—\none pair of trousers whether or not extending above waist level, one pair of breeches or one bib and brace overall.\nThe ‘ski ensemble’ may also consist of an overall similar to the one mentioned in paragraph (a) above and a type of padded, sleeveless jacket worn over the overall.\nAll the components of a ‘ski ensemble’ must be made up in a fabric of the same texture, style and composition whether or not of the same colour; they also must be of corresponding or compatible size.\n7.\nGarments which are prima facie classifiable both within heading No 6113 and within other headings of this chapter, excluding heading No 6111, are to be classified within heading No 6113.\n8.\nArticles of this chapter which cannot be identified as either men's or boys' garments or as women's or girls' garments are to be classified within the headings covering women's or girls' garments.\n9.\nArticles of this chapter may be made of metal thread.\nCN code\nDescription\nRate of duty\nautonomous (%)\nConventional (%)\nSupplementary unit\n(1)\n(2)\n(3)\n(4)\n(5)\n6101\nMen's or

applies only to made-up articles of any textile fabric other than wadding, excluding knitted or crocheted articles (other than those of heading No 6212).\n2.\nThis chapter does not cover:\n(a)\nworn clothing or other worn articles of heading No 6309; or\n(b)\northopaedic appliances, surgical belts, trusses or the like (heading No 9021).\n3.\nFor the purposes of heading Nos 6203 and 6204:\n(a)\nThe term ‘suit’ means a set of garments composed of two or three pieces made up in identical fabric and comprising:\n—\none garment designed to cover the lower part of the body and consisting of trousers, breeches or shorts (other than swimwear), a skirt or a divided skirt, having neither braces nor bibs, and\n—\none suit coat or jacket the outer shell of which, exclusive of sleeves, consists of four or more panels, designed to cover the upper part of the body, possibly with a tailored waistcoat in addition.\nAll of the components of a suit must be of the same fabric construction, style, colour and composition; they must also be of corresponding or compatible size. If several separate components to cover the lower part of the body are presented together (for example, trousers and shorts, or a skirt or divided skirt and trousers), the constituent lower part shall be the trousers, or, in the case of women's or girls' suits, the skirt or divided skirt, the other garments being considered separately.\nThe term ‘suit’ includes the following sets of garments, whether or not they fulfil all the above conditions:\n—\nmorning dress, comprising a plain jacket (cutaway) with rounded tails hanging well down at the back and striped trousers,\n—\nevening dress (tailcoat), generally made of black cloth, the jacket of which is relatively short at the front, does not close and has narrow skirts cut in at the hips and hanging down behind,\n—\ndinner jacket suits, in which the jacket is similar in style to an ordinary jacket (though perhaps revealing more of the shirt front), but has shiny silk or imitation silk lapels.\n(b)\nThe term ‘ensemble’ means a set of garments (other than suits and articles of heading No 6207 or 6208) composed of several pieces made up in identical fabric, put up for retail sale, and comprising:\n—\none garment designed to cover the upper part of the body, with the exception of waistcoats which may also form a second upper garment, and\n—\none or two different garments, designed to cover the lower part of the body and consisting of trousers, bib and brace overalls, breeches, shorts (other than swimwear), a skirt or a divided skirt.\nAll of the components of an ensemble must be of the same fabric construction, style, colour and composition; they also must be of corresponding or compatible size. The term ‘ensemble’ does not apply to track suits or ski suits, of heading No 6211.\n4.\nFor the purposes of heading No 6209:\n(a)\nThe expression ‘babies’ garments and clothing accessories' means articles for young children of a body height not exceeding 86 cm; it also covers babies' napkins;\n(b)\nArticles which are prima facie classifiable both within heading No 6209 and within other headings of this chapter are to be classified within heading No 6209.\n5.\nGarments which are prima facie classifiable both within heading No 6210 and within other headings of this chapter, excluding heading No 6209, are to be classified within heading No 6210.\n6.\nFor the purposes of heading No 6211, ‘ski suits’ means garments or sets of garments which, by their general appearance and texture, are identifiable as intended to be worn principally for skiing (cross-country or alpine). They consist either of:\n(a)\na ‘ski overall’, that is, a one-piece garment designed to cover the upper and the lower parts of the body; in addition to sleeves and a collar the ski overall may have pockets or footstraps; or\n(b)\na ‘ski ensemble’, that is, a set of garments composed of two or three pieces, put up for retail sale and comprising:\n—\none garment such as an anorak, wind-cheater, wind-jacket or similar article, closed by a slide fastener (zipper), possibly with a waistcoat in addition, and\n—\none pair of trousers whether or not extending above waist level, one pair of breeches or one bib and brace overall.\nThe ‘ski ensemble’ may also consist of an overall similar to the one mentioned in paragraph (a) above and a type of padded, sleeveless jacket worn over the overall.\nAll the components of a ‘ski ensemble’ must be made up in a fabric of the same texture, style and composition whether or not of the same colour; they also must be of corresponding or compatible size.\n7.\nScarves and articles of the scarf type, square or approximately square, of which no side exceeds 60 cm, are to be classified as handkerchiefs (heading No 6213). Handkerchiefs of which any side exceeds 60 cm are to be classified within heading No 6214.\n8.\nArticles of this chapter which cannot be identified as either men's or boys' garments or as women's or girls' garments are to be classified within the headings covering women's or girls' garments.\n9.\nArticles of this chapter may be made of metal thread.\nCN code\nDescription\nRate of duty\nautonomous

purposes of headings Nos 7003, 7004 and 7005:\n(a)\nGlass is not regarded as ‘worked’ by reason of any process it has undergone before annealing.\n(b)\nCutting to shape does not affect the classification of glass in sheets.\n(c)\nThe expression ‘absorbent or reflecting layer’ means a microscopically thin coating of metal or of a chemical compound (for example, metal oxide) which absorbs, for example, infra-red light or improves the reflecting qualities of the glass while still allowing it to retain a degree of transparency or translucency.\n3.\nThe products referred to in heading No 7006 remain classified in that heading whether or not they have the character of articles.\n4.\nFor the purposes of heading No 7019, the expression ‘glass wool’ means:\n(a)\nmineral wools with a silica (SiO2) content not less than 60 % by weight;\n(b)\nmineral wools with a silica (SiO2) content less than 60 % but with an alkaline oxide (K2O or Na2O) content exceeding 5 % by weight or a boric oxide (B2O3) content exceeding 2 % by weight.\nMineral wools which do not comply with the above specifications fall within heading No 6806.\n5.\nThroughout the nomenclature, the expression ‘glass’ includes fused quartz and other fused silica.\nSubheading note\n1.\nFor the purposes of subheadings 7013 21, 7013 31 and 7013 91, the expression ‘lead crystal’ means only glass having a minimum lead monoxide (PbO) content by weight of 24 %.\nCN code\nDescription\nRate of duty\nautonomous (%)\nconventional (%)\nSupplementary unit\n(1)\n(2)\n(3)\n(4)\n(5)\n7001 00\nCullet and other

Hollow bars and rods of iron or steel not conforming to this definition are to be classified within heading No 7304.\n2.\nFerrous metals clad with another ferrous metal are to be classified as products of the ferrous metal predominating by weight.\n3.\nIron or steel products obtained by electrolytic deposition, by pressure casting or by sintering are to be classified, according to their form, their composition and their appearance, in the headings of this chapter appropriate to similar hot-rolled products.\nSubheading notes\n1.\nIn this chapter the following expressions have the meanings hereby assigned to them:\n(a)\nAlloy pig iron\nPig iron containing, by weight, separately or together:\n—\nmore than 0,2 % of chromium,\n—\nmore than 0,3 % of copper,\n—\nmore than 0,3 % of nickel,\n—\nmore than 0,1 % of any of the following elements: aluminium, molybdenum, titanium, tungsten (wolfram), vanadium.\n(b)\nNon-alloy free-cutting steel\nNon-alloy steel containing, by weight, one or more of the following elements in the specified proportions:\n—\n0,08 % or more of sulphur,\n—\n0,1 % or more of lead,\n—\nmore than 0,05 % of selenium,\n—\nmore than 0,01 % of tellurium,\n—\nmore than 0,05 % of bismuth.\n(c)\nSilicon-electrical steel\nAlloy steels containing by weight at least 0,6 % but not more than 6 % of silicon and not more than 0,08 % of carbon. They may also contain by weight not more than 1 % of aluminium but no other element in a proportion that would give the steel the characteristics of another alloy steel.\n(d)\nHigh-speed steel\nAlloy steels containing, with or without other elements, at least two of the three elements molybdenum, tungsten and vanadium with a combined content by weight of 7 % or more, 0,6 % or more of carbon and 3 to 6 % of chromium.\n(e)\nSilico-manganese steel\nAlloy steels containing by weight:\n—\n0,35 % or more but not more than 0,7 % of carbon,\n—\n0,5 % or more but not more than 1,2 % of manganese, and\n—\n0,6 % or more but not more than 2,3 % of silicon, but not containing any other element in a proportion that would give the steel the characteristics of another alloy steel.\n2.\nFor the classification of ferro-alloys in the subheadings of heading No 7202, the following rule should be observed:\nA ferro-alloy is considered as binary and classified under the relevant subheading (if it exists) if only one of the alloy elements exceeds the minimum percentage laid down in note 1 (c) to this chapter; by analogy, it is considered respectively as ternary or quaternary if two or three alloy elements exceed the minimum percentage.\nFor the application of this rule the unspecified ‘other elements’ referred to in note 1 (c) to this chapter must each exceed 10 % by weight.\nAdditional note (ECSC)\n1.\nThe following expressions have the meanings hereby assigned to them:\n—\n‘Electrical’: for the purposes of subheadings 7209 12 10, 7209 13 10, 7209 14 10, 7209 22 10, 7209 23 10, 7209

THEREOF\nNote\n1.\nIn this chapter the following expressions have the meanings hereby assigned to them:\n(a)\nrefined copper:\nMetal containing at least 99,85 % by weight of copper;\nor\nMetal containing at least 97,5 % by weight of copper, provided that the content by weight of any other element does not exceed the limit specified in the following table:\nTABLE\nOther elements\nElements\nLimiting content % by weight\nAg\nSilver\n0,25\nAs\nArsenic\n0,5\nCd\nCadmium\n1,3\nCr\nChromium\n1,4\nMg\nMagnesium\n0,8\nPb\nLead\n1,5\nS\nSulphur\n0,7\nSn\nTin\n0,8\nTe\nTellurium\n0,8\nZn\nZinc\n1\nZr\nZirconium\n0,3\nOther elements (93), each\n0,3\n(b)\nCopper alloys:\nMetallic substances other than unrefined copper in which copper predominates by weight over each of the other elements, provided that:\n(i)\nthe content by weight of at least one of the other elements is greater than the limit specified in the foregoing table;\nor\n(ii)\nthe total content by weight of such other elements exceeds 2,5 %.\n(c)\nMaster alloys:\nAlloys containing with other elements more than 10% by weight of copper, not usefully malleable and commonly used as an additive in the manufacture of other alloys or as de-oxidants, de-sulphurizing agents or for similar uses in the metallurgy of non-ferrous metals. However, copper phosphide (phosphor copper) containing more than 15 % by weight of phosphorus falls within heading No 2848.\n(d)\nBars and rods:\nRolled, extruded, drawn or forged products, not in coils, which have a uniform solid cross-section along their whole length in the shape of circles, ovals, rectangles (including squares), equilateral triangles or regular convex polygons (including ‘flattened circles’ and ‘modified rectangles’, of which two opposite sides are convex arcs, the other two sides being straight, of equal length and parallel). Products with a rectangular (including square), triangular or polygonal cross-section may have corners rounded along their whole length. The thickness of such products which have a rectangular (including ‘modified rectangular’) cross-section exceeds one-tenth of the width. The expression also covers cast or sintered products, of the same forms and dimensions, which have been subsequently worked after production (otherwise than by simple trimming or de-scaling), provided that they have not thereby assumed the character of articles or products of other headings.\nWire-bars and billets with their ends tapered or otherwise worked simply to facilitate their entry into machines for converting them into, for example, drawing stock (wire-rod) or tubes, are however to be taken to be unwrought copper of heading No 7403.\n(e)\nProfiles:\nRolled, extruded, drawn, forged or formed products, coiled or not, of a uniform cross-section along their whole length, which do not conform to any of the definitions of bars, rods, wire, plates, sheets, strip, foil, tubes or pipes. The expression also covers cast or sintered products, of the same forms, which have been subsequently worked after production (otherwise than by simple trimming or de-scaling), provided that they have not thereby assumed the character of articles or products of other headings.\n(f)\nWire:\nRolled, extruded or drawn products, in coils, which have a uniform solid cross-section along their whole length in the shape of circles, ovals, rectangles (including squares), equilateral triangles or regular convex polygons (including ‘flattened circles’ and ‘modified rectangles’, of which two opposite sides are convex arcs, the other two sides being straight, of equal length and parallel). Products with a rectangular (including square), triangular or polygonal cross-section may have corners rounded along their whole length. The thickness of such products which have a rectangular (including ‘modified rectangular’) cross-section exceeds one-tenth of the width.\nIn the case of heading No 7414, however, the term ‘wire’ applies only to products, whether or not in coils, of any cross-sectional shape, of which no cross-sectional dimension exceeds 6 mm.\n(g)\nPlates, sheets, strip and foil:\nFlat-surfaced products (other than the unwrought products of heading No 7403), coiled or not, of solid rectangular (other than square) cross-section with or without rounded corners (including ‘modified rectangles’ of which two opposite sides are convex arcs, the other two sides being straight, of equal length and parallel) of a uniform thickness, which are:\n—\nof rectangular (including square) shape with a thickness not exceeding one-tenth of the width,\n—\nof a shape other than rectangular or square, of any size, provided that they do not assume the character of articles or products of other headings.\nHeading Nos 7409 and 7410 apply inter alia to plates, sheets, strip and foil with patterns (for example, grooves, ribs, chequers, tears, buttons, lozenges) and to such products which have been perforated, corrugated, polished or coated, provided that they do not thereby assume the character of articles or products of other headings.\n(h)\nTubes and pipes:\nHollow products, coiled or not, which have a uniform cross-section with only one enclosed void along their whole length in the shape of circles, ovals, rectangles (including squares), equilateral triangles or regular convex polygons, and which have a uniform wall thickness. Products with a rectangular (including square), equilateral triangular or regular convex polygonal cross-section, which may have corners rounded along their whole length, are also to be taken to be tubes and pipes provided the inner and outer cross-sections are concentric and have the same form and orientation. Tubes and pipes of the foregoing cross-sections may be polished, coated, bent, threaded, drilled, waisted, expanded, cone-shaped or fitted with flanges, collars or rings.\nSubheading note\n1.\nIn this chapter the following expressions have the meanings hereby assigned to them:\n(a)\nCopper-zinc base alloys (brasses):\nAlloys of copper and zinc, with or without other elements. When other elements are present:\n—\nzinc predominates by weight over each of such other elements,\n—\nany nickel content by weight is less than 5 % (see copper-nickel-zinc alloys (nickel silvers)), and\n—\nany tin content by weight is less than 3 % (see copper-tin alloys (bronzes)).\n(b)\nCopper-tin base alloys (bronzes):\nAlloys of copper and tin, with or without other elements. When other elements are present, tin predominates by weight over each of such other elements, except that when the tin content is 3 % or more the zinc content by weight may exceed that of tin but must be less than 10 %.\n(c)\nCopper-nickel-zinc base alloys (nickel silvers):\nAlloys of copper, nickel and zinc, with or without other elements. The nickel content is 5 % or more by weight (see copper-zinc alloys (brasses)).\n(d)\nCopper-nickel base alloys:\nAlloys of copper and nickel, with or without other elements but in any case containing by weight not more than 1 % of zinc.

SUCH ARTICLES\nNotes\n1.\nThis chapter does not cover:\n(a)\nelectrically warmed blankets, bed pads, foot-muffs or the like; electrically warmed clothing, footwear or ear pads or other electrically warmed articles worn on or about the person;\n(b)\narticles of glass of heading No 7011; or\n(c)\nelectrically heated furniture of Chapter 94.\n2.\nHeading Nos 8501 to 8504 do not apply to goods described in heading No 8511, 8512, 8540, 8541 or 8542.\nHowever, metal tank mercury arc rectifiers remain classified within heading No 8504.\n3.\nHeading No 8509 covers only the following electro-mechanical machines of the kind commonly used for domestic purposes:\n(a)\nvacuum cleaners, floor polishers, food grinders and mixers, and fruit or vegetable juice extractors, of any weight;\n(b)\nother machines provided the weight of such machines does not exceed 20 kg.\nThe heading does not, however, apply to fans or ventilating or recycling hoods incorporating a fan, whether or not fitted with filters (heading No 8414), centrifugal clothes-dryers (heading No 8421), dish washing machines (heading No 8422), household washing machines (heading No 8450), roller or other ironing machines (heading No 8420 or 8451), sewing machines (heading No 8452), electric scissors (heading No 8508) or to electro-thermic appliances (heading No 8516).\n4.\nFor the purposes of heading No 8534, ‘printed circuits’ are circuits obtained by forming on an insulating base, by any printing process (for example, embossing, plating-up, etching) or by the ‘film circuit’ technique, conductor elements, contacts or other printed components (for example, inductances, resistors, capacitors) alone or interconnected according to a pre-established pattern, other than elements which can produce, rectify, modulate or amplify an electrical signal (for example, semiconductor elements).\nThe term ‘printed circuits’ does not cover circuits combined with elements other than those obtained during the printing process. Printed circuits may, however, be fitted with non-printed connecting elements.\nThin or thick-film circuits comprising passive and active elements obtained during the same technological process are to be classified within heading No 8542.\n5.\nFor the purposes of heading Nos 8541 and 8542:\n(A)\n‘Diodes, transistors and similar semiconductor devices’ are semiconductor devices the operation of which depends on variations in resistivity on the application of an electric field;\n(B)\n‘Electronic integrated circuits and microassemblies’ are:\n(a)\nmonolithic integrated circuits in which the circuit elements (diodes, transistors, resistors, capacitors, interconnections, etc.) are created in the mass (essentially) and on the surface of a semiconductor material (doped silicon, for example) and are inseparably associated;\n(b)\nhybrid integrated circuits in which passive elements (resistors, capacitors, interconnections, etc.), obtained by thinor thick-film technology, and active elements (diodes, transistors, monolithic integrated circuits, etc.), obtained by semiconductor technology, are combined to all intents and purposes indivisibly, on a single insulating substrate (glass, ceramic, etc.). These circuits may also include discrete components;\n(c)\nmicroassemblies of the moulded module, micromodule or similar types, consisting of discrete, active or both active and passive, components which are combined and interconnected.\nFor the classification of the articles defined in this note, heading Nos 8541 and 8542 shall take precedence over any other heading in the nomenclature which might cover them by reference to, in particular, their function.\n6.\nRecords, tapes and other media of heading No 8523 or 8524 remain classified within those headings, whether or not they are presented with the apparatus for which they are intended.\nAdditional notes\n1.\nSubheadings 8519 10 00, 8519 21 00, 8519 29 00, 8519 31 00 and 8519 39 00 are to be taken not to apply to sound reproducing apparatus with laser optical reading system, which fall within subheading 8519 99 10.\n2.\nSubheading 8524 10 00 is to be taken not to apply to ‘compact discs’, which fall within subheading 8524 90 10.\n3.\nHeading No 8521 is to be taken not to apply to video recording or reproducing apparatus incorporating a video tuner, which fall within subheading 8528 10 11, 8528 10 19 or 8528 10 30.\nCN code\nDescription\nRate of duty\nautonomous (%)\nconventional (%)\nSupplementary unit\n(1)\n(2)\n(3)\n(4)\n(5)\n8501\nElectric motors and generators (excluding generating sets)\n8501

It does not contain information relating to national taxes such as VAT.\nThe CN is the result of the merger between the Common Customs Tariff* nomenclature and Nimexe (EU statistical nomenclature).\nTARIC is based on the CN and includes additional subdivisions, referred to as TARIC subheadings, used for goods where specific customs duty rates apply based on their origin or where other trade policy rules apply.\nEach CN subheading has an 8-digit code. The first six digits refer to the harmonised system headings and subheadings, the seventh and eighth digits represent the CN subheadings, and the ninth and tenth digits represent TARIC subheadings.\nAnnex I to the regulation fixes the rates of duty and is regularly updated to take into account:\nchanges agreed at international level;\nchanges relating to statistical requirements, commercial policy and technological and commercial developments; and\nthe need to align or clarify texts.\nThe European Commission publishes and manages TARIC. It attributes code numbers, updates TARIC, and informs EU countries of amendments. Requests to amend the CN can be made by the Commission, EU countries or European trade federations.\nEvery year, the Commission adopts a regulation reproducing a complete version of the CN and Common Customs Tariff duty rates, taking Council and Commission amendments into account. The regulation is published in the Official Journal no later than 31 October, and applies from 1 January of the following year.\nThe Commission is assisted by the Customs Code Committee comprising representatives of the EU countries. The committee is responsible for examining all questions on the CN, TARIC or other nomenclatures.\nFROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nIt has applied since 10 September 1987.\nBACKGROUND\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nTARIC, the integrated tariff of the EU, is a database which brings together commercial and agricultural legislation and customs tariffs. This ensures there is uniform application by EU countries and gives a clear view of all measures to be undertaken by those involved in importing into the EU or exporting goods from the EU.\nFor more information, see:\nTARIC (European Commission).\nKEY TERMS\nCommon Customs Tariff: the combination of the classification of goods and the duty rates which apply to each class of goods, applicable throughout the EU.\nMAIN DOCUMENT\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nCouncil Regulation (EEC) No 2658/87 of 23 July 1987 on the tariff and statistical nomenclature and on the Common Customs Tariff (OJ L 256, 7.9.1987, pp. 1-675)\nSuccessive amendments to Regulation (EEC) No 2658/87 have been incorporated in the original basic text.
