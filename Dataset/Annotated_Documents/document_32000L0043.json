It is also important, in the context of the access to and provision of goods and services, to respect the protection of private and family life and transactions carried out in this context.(5) The European Parliament has adopted a number of Resolutions on the fight against racism in the European Union.(6) The European Union rejects theories which attempt to determine the existence of separate human races. The use of the term \"racial origin\" in this Directive does not imply an acceptance of such theories.(7) The European Council in Tampere, on 15 and 16 October 1999, invited the Commission to come forward as soon as possible with proposals implementing Article 13 of the EC Treaty as regards the fight against racism and xenophobia.(8) The Employment Guidelines 2000 agreed by the European Council in Helsinki, on 10 and 11 December 1999, stress the need to foster conditions for a socially inclusive labour market by formulating a coherent set of policies aimed at combating discrimination against groups such as ethnic minorities.(9) Discrimination based on racial or ethnic origin may undermine the achievement of the objectives of the EC Treaty, in particular the attainment of a high level of employment and of social protection, the raising of the standard of living and quality of life, economic and social cohesion and solidarity. It may also undermine the objective of developing the European Union as an area of freedom, security and justice.(10) The Commission presented a communication on racism, xenophobia and anti-Semitism in December 1995.(11) The Council adopted on 15 July 1996 Joint Action (96/443/JHA) concerning action to combat racism and xenophobia(5) under which the Member States undertake to ensure effective judicial cooperation in respect of offences based on racist or xenophobic behaviour.(12) To ensure the development of democratic and tolerant societies which allow the participation of all persons irrespective of racial or ethnic origin, specific action in the field of discrimination based on racial or ethnic origin should go beyond access to employed and self-employed activities and cover areas such as education, social protection including social security and healthcare, social advantages and access to and supply of goods and services.(13) To this end, any direct or indirect discrimination based on racial or ethnic origin as regards the areas covered by this Directive should be prohibited throughout the Community. This prohibition of discrimination should also apply to nationals of third countries, but does not cover differences of treatment based on nationality and is without prejudice to provisions governing the entry and residence of third-country nationals and their access to employment and to occupation.(14) In implementing the principle of equal treatment irrespective of racial or ethnic origin, the Community should, in accordance with Article 3(2) of the EC Treaty, aim to eliminate inequalities, and to promote equality between men and women, especially since women are often the victims of multiple discrimination.(15) The appreciation of the facts from which it may be inferred that there has been direct or indirect discrimination is a matter for national judicial or other competent bodies, in accordance with rules of national law or practice. Such rules may provide in particular for indirect discrimination to be established by any means including on the basis of statistical evidence.(16) It is important to protect all natural persons against discrimination on grounds of racial or ethnic origin. Member States should also provide, where appropriate and in accordance with their national traditions and practice, protection for legal persons where they suffer discrimination on grounds of the racial or ethnic origin of their members.(17) The prohibition of discrimination should be without prejudice to the maintenance or adoption of measures intended to prevent or compensate for disadvantages suffered by a group of persons of a particular racial or ethnic origin, and such measures may permit organisations of persons of a particular racial or ethnic origin where their main object is the promotion of the special needs of those persons.(18) In very limited circumstances, a difference of treatment may be justified where a characteristic related to racial or ethnic origin constitutes a genuine and determining occupational requirement, when the objective is legitimate and the requirement is proportionate. Such circumstances should be included in the information provided by the Member States to the Commission.(19) Persons who have been subject to discrimination based on racial and ethnic origin should have adequate means of legal protection. To provide a more effective level of protection, associations or legal entities should also be empowered to engage, as the Member States so determine, either on behalf or in support of any victim, in proceedings, without prejudice to national rules of procedure concerning representation and defence before the courts.(20) The effective implementation of the principle of equality requires adequate judicial protection against victimisation.(21) The rules on the burden of proof must be adapted when there is a prima facie case of discrimination and, for the principle of equal treatment to be applied effectively, the burden of proof must shift back to the respondent when evidence of such discrimination is brought.(22) Member States need not apply the rules on the burden of proof to proceedings in which it is for the court or other competent body to investigate the facts of the case. The procedures thus referred to are those in which the plaintiff is not required to prove the facts, which it is for the court or competent body to investigate.(23) Member States should promote dialogue between the social partners and with non-governmental organisations to address different forms of discrimination and to combat them.(24) Protection against discrimination based on racial or ethnic origin would itself be strengthened by the existence of a body or bodies in each Member State, with competence to analyse the problems involved, to study possible solutions and to provide concrete assistance for the victims.(25) This Directive lays down minimum requirements, thus giving the Member States the option of introducing or maintaining more favourable provisions. The implementation of this Directive should not serve to justify any regression in relation to the situation which already prevails in each Member State.(26) Member States should provide for effective, proportionate and dissuasive sanctions in case of breaches of the obligations under this Directive.(27) The Member States may entrust management and labour, at their joint request, with the implementation of this Directive as regards provisions falling within the scope of collective agreements, provided that the Member States take all the necessary steps to ensure that they can at all times guarantee the results imposed by this Directive.(28) In accordance with the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality as set out in Article 5 of the EC Treaty, the objective of this Directive, namely ensuring a common high level of protection against discrimination in all the Member States, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore, by reason of the scale and impact of the proposed action, be better achieved by the Community. This Directive does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives,HAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:CHAPTER IGENERAL PROVISIONSArticle 1PurposeThe purpose of this Directive is to lay down a framework for combating discrimination on the grounds of racial or ethnic origin, with a view to putting into effect in the Member States the principle of equal treatment.Article 2Concept of discrimination1. For the purposes of this Directive, the principle of equal treatment shall mean that there shall be no direct or indirect discrimination based on racial or ethnic origin.2. For the purposes of paragraph 1:(a) direct discrimination shall be taken to occur where one person is treated less favourably than another is, has been or would be treated in a comparable situation on grounds of racial or ethnic origin;(b) indirect discrimination shall be taken to occur where an apparently neutral provision, criterion or practice would put persons of a racial or ethnic origin at a particular disadvantage compared with other persons, unless that provision, criterion or practice is objectively justified by a legitimate aim and the means of achieving that aim are appropriate and necessary.3. Harassment shall be deemed to be discrimination within the meaning of paragraph 1, when an unwanted conduct related to racial or ethnic origin takes place with the purpose or effect of violating the dignity of a person and of creating an intimidating, hostile, degrading, humiliating or offensive environment. In this context, the concept of harassment may be defined in accordance with the national laws and practice of the Member States.4. An instruction to discriminate against persons on grounds of racial or ethnic origin shall be deemed to be discrimination within the meaning of paragraph 1.Article 3Scope1. Within the limits of the powers conferred upon the Community, this Directive shall apply to all persons, as regards both the public and private sectors, including public bodies, in relation to:(a) conditions for access to employment, to self-employment and to occupation, including selection criteria and recruitment conditions, whatever the branch of activity and at all levels of the professional hierarchy, including promotion;(b) access to all types and to all levels of vocational guidance, vocational training, advanced vocational training and retraining, including practical work experience;(c) employment and working conditions, including dismissals and pay;(d) membership of and involvement in an organisation of workers or employers, or any organisation whose members carry on a particular profession, including the benefits provided for by such organisations;(e) social protection, including social security and healthcare;(f) social advantages;(g) education;(h) access to and supply of goods and services which are available to the public, including housing.2. This Directive does not cover difference of treatment based on nationality and is without prejudice to provisions and conditions relating to the entry into and residence of third-country nationals and stateless persons on the territory of Member States, and to any treatment which arises from the legal status of the third-country nationals and stateless persons concerned.Article 4Genuine and determining occupational requirementsNotwithstanding Article 2(1) and (2), Member States may provide that a difference of treatment which is based on a characteristic related to racial or ethnic origin shall not constitute discrimination where, by reason of the nature of the particular occupational activities concerned or of the context in which they are carried out, such a characteristic constitutes a genuine and determining occupational requirement, provided that the objective is legitimate and the requirement is proportionate.Article 5Positive actionWith a view to ensuring full equality in practice, the principle of equal treatment shall not prevent any Member State from maintaining or adopting specific measures to prevent or compensate for disadvantages linked to racial or ethnic origin.Article 6Minimum requirements1. Member States may introduce or maintain provisions which are more favourable to the protection of the principle of equal treatment than those laid down in this Directive.2. The implementation of this Directive shall under no circumstances constitute grounds for a reduction in the level of protection against discrimination already afforded by Member States in the fields covered by this Directive.CHAPTER IIREMEDIES AND ENFORCEMENTArticle 7Defence of rights1. Member States shall ensure that judicial and/or administrative procedures, including where they deem it appropriate conciliation procedures, for the enforcement of obligations under this Directive are available to all persons who consider themselves wronged by failure to apply the principle of equal treatment to them, even after the relationship in which the discrimination is alleged to have occurred has ended.2. Member States shall ensure that associations, organisations or other legal entities, which have, in accordance with the criteria laid down by their national law, a legitimate interest in ensuring that the provisions of this Directive are complied with, may engage, either on behalf or in support of the complainant, with his or her approval, in any judicial and/or administrative procedure provided for the enforcement of obligations under this Directive.3. Paragraphs 1 and 2 are without prejudice to national rules relating to time limits for bringing actions as regards the principle of equality of treatment.Article 8Burden of proof1. Member States shall take such measures as are necessary, in accordance with their national judicial systems, to ensure that, when persons who consider themselves wronged because the principle of equal treatment has not been applied to them establish, before a court or other competent authority, facts from which it may be presumed that there has been direct or indirect discrimination, it shall be for the respondent to prove that there has been no breach of the principle of equal treatment.2. Paragraph 1 shall not prevent Member States from introducing rules of evidence which are more favourable to plaintiffs.3. Paragraph 1 shall not apply to criminal procedures.4. Paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 shall also apply to any proceedings brought in accordance with Article 7(2).5. Member States need not apply paragraph 1 to proceedings in which it is for the court or competent body to investigate the facts of the case.Article 9VictimisationMember States shall introduce into their national legal systems such measures as are necessary to protect individuals from any adverse treatment or adverse consequence as a reaction to a complaint or to proceedings aimed at enforcing compliance with the principle of equal treatment.Article 10Dissemination of informationMember States shall take care that the provisions adopted pursuant to this Directive, together with the relevant provisions already in force, are brought to the attention of the persons concerned by all appropriate means throughout their territory.Article 11Social dialogue1.

Where consistent with national traditions and practice, Member States shall encourage the two sides of the industry without prejudice to their autonomy to conclude, at the appropriate level, agreements laying down anti-discrimination rules in the fields referred to in Article 3 which fall within the scope of collective bargaining. These agreements shall respect the minimum requirements laid down by this Directive and the relevant national implementing measures.Article 12Dialogue with non-governmental organisationsMember States shall encourage dialogue with appropriate non-governmental organisations which have, in accordance with their national law and practice, a legitimate interest in contributing to the fight against discrimination on grounds of racial and ethnic origin with a view to promoting the principle of equal treatment.CHAPTER IIIBODIES FOR THE PROMOTION OF EQUAL TREATMENTArticle 131. Member States shall designate a body or bodies for the promotion of equal treatment of all persons without discrimination on the grounds of racial or ethnic origin. These bodies may form part of agencies charged at national level with the defence of human rights or the safeguard of individuals' rights.2. Member States shall ensure that the competences of these bodies include:- without prejudice to the right of victims and of associations, organisations or other legal entities referred to in Article 7(2), providing independent assistance to victims of discrimination in pursuing their complaints about discrimination,- conducting independent surveys concerning discrimination,- publishing independent reports and making recommendations on any issue relating to such discrimination.CHAPTER IVFINAL PROVISIONSArticle 14ComplianceMember States shall take the necessary measures to ensure that:(a) any laws, regulations and administrative provisions contrary to the principle of equal treatment are abolished;(b) any provisions contrary to the principle of equal treatment which are included in individual or collective contracts or agreements, internal rules of undertakings, rules governing profit-making or non-profit-making associations, and rules governing the independent professions and workers' and employers' organisations, are or may be declared, null and void or are amended.Article 15SanctionsMember States shall lay down the rules on sanctions applicable to infringements of the national provisions adopted pursuant to this Directive and shall take all measures necessary to ensure that they are applied.

It forbids both direct* and indirect* discrimination, harassment*, instructions to discriminate and victimisation*.\nThe directive applies to all persons and to all sectors of activity, regarding:\naccess to employment;\nworking conditions, including promotion, pay and dismissals;\naccess to vocational training;\ninvolvement in workers’ or employers’ organisations, and in any professional organisation;\naccess to social protection and to healthcare;\neducation;\nsocial advantages;\naccess to and supply of goods and services, including housing.\nThe directive does not cover difference of treatment based on nationality, or the conditions of entry and residence for citizens from non-EU countries.\nDerogations from the principle of equal treatment\nIn the field of employment, a derogation may be authorised where race or ethnic origin constitutes a genuine professional requirement. This derogation must be justifiable by the nature of the activity and the conditions under which it is exercised. It must be legitimate and proportionate.\nThe directive does not oppose positive action, namely national measures aimed at preventing or compensating for disadvantages connected with race or ethnic origin.\nRemedies and enforcement\nAnyone who believes themselves to be a victim of discrimination on grounds of racial or ethnic origin must have access to legal and/or administrative proceedings. Associations or other interested legal persons may also undertake proceedings either on behalf of, or in support of the complainant.\nThe victim of discrimination only needs to establish a presumption of discrimination after which it is for the respondent to prove that there has been no discrimination.\nSocial dialogue and civil dialogue\nThe social partners ensure the promotion of equal treatment, specifically by monitoring practices in the workplace, producing codes of conducts and concluding collective agreements. More generally, the directive encourages the conclusion of agreements establishing non-discrimination rules in the fields which fall within the scope of collective bargaining.\nCivil dialogue with the civil society organisations concerned is also encouraged.\nBodies for the promotion of the principle\nEach EU country must establish at least one body dedicated to combating discrimination, which is, in particular, responsible for helping victims and conducting independent studies.\nCouncil Recommendation\nIn 2013, the Council adopted a recommendation calling for measures to be taken in a number of area, including anti-discrimination, to strengthen the integration of Roma people. The recommendation builds upon Directive 2000/43/EC and underlines the importance of its practical enforcement.\nFROM WHEN DOES THE DIRECTIVE APPLY?\n              \nIt has applied since 19 July 2000. EU countries had to incorporate it into national law by 19 July 2003.\nBACKGROUND\n              \nThe Treaty of Lisbon (Article 19 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU) provides the EU with a legal basis to combat all forms of discrimination based on sex, racial or ethnic origin, religion or belief, disability, age or sexual orientation.\n* KEY TERMS\n              \nDirect discrimination: where one person is treated less favourably than another is, has been or would be treated in a comparable situation on grounds of racial or ethnic origin.\nIndirect discrimination: where an apparently neutral rule, criterion or practice would put persons of a racial or ethnic origin at a particular disadvantage compared with other persons, unless that rule, criterion or practice is objectively justified by a legitimate aim and the means of achieving that aim are appropriate and necessary.\nHarrassment: when an unwanted conduct related to racial or ethnic origin takes place with the purpose or effect of violating the dignity of a person and of creating an intimidating, hostile, degrading, humiliating or offensive environment.\nVictimisation: unjust or cruel treatment of someone who complains of discrimination or who assists someone else in a complaint of discrimination.\nMAIN DOCUMENT\n            \nCouncil Directive 2000/43/EC of 29 June 2000 implementing the principle of equal treatment between persons irrespective of racial or ethnic origin (OJ L 180, 19.7.2000, pp. 22-26)\nRELATED DOCUMENTS\n            \nReport from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament — The application of Directive 2000/43/EC of 29 June 2000 implementing the principle of equal treatment between persons irrespective of racial or ethnic origin (COM(2006) 643 final, 30.10.2006)\nCouncil Recommendation of 9 December 2013 on effective Roma integration measures in the Member States (OJ C 378, 24.12.2013, pp. 1-7)\nReport from the Commission to the European Parliament and the Council: Joint Report on the application of Council Directive 2000/43/EC of 29 June 2000 implementing the principle of equal treatment between persons irrespective of racial or ethnic origin (‘Racial Equality Directive’) and of Council Directive 2000/78/EC of 27 November 2000 establishing a general framework for equal treatment in employment and occupation (‘Employment Equality Directive’) (COM(2014) 2 final, 17.1.2014)\nlast update 23.02.2017", "tags": ["European social policy", "anti-discriminatory measure", "ethnic discrimination", "racial discrimination", "equal treatment"], "subjects": ["Protocol on Ireland/Northern Ireland", "Provisions governing the Institutions", "Approximation of laws", "Justice and home affairs", "Human rights"], "split": "train", "reference_annotations": {}, "summary_annotations": {"32000L0043_p1": {"text": "Report from the Commission to the European Parliament and the Council: Joint Report on the application of Council directive 2000/43/ec of 29 June 2000 implementing the principle of equal treatment between persons irrespective of racial or ethnic origin (‘Racial Equality Directive’) and of Council directive 2000/78/ec of 27 November 2000 establishing a general framework for equal treatment in employment and occupation (‘Employment Equality Directive’) (COM(2014) 2 final, 17.1.2014)---last update 23.02.2017", "triples": [" directive 2000/43/ec,  implementing,  directive 2000/78/ec"]}}}
