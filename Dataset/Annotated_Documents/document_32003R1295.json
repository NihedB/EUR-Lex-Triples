The accreditation card is a highly secure document, which gives access to the specific sites where competitions are held and to other events planned during the Olympic and Paralympic Games.(4) Greece is organising the 2004 Olympic and Paralympic Games in Athens, this being the first time that such an event has been organised by a Member State applying in full the provisions of the Schengen acquis.(5) To enable Greece to organise the 2004 Olympic and Paralympic Games and in view of the obligations arising from the Olympic Charter, the Community should establish legislation facilitating the issue of visas to members of the Olympic family.(6) There is therefore a need to provide for a temporary derogation for the duration of the 2004 Olympic and Paralympic Games for members of the Olympic family who are nationals of third countries subject to the visa requirement under Council Regulation (EC) No 539/2001 of 15 March 2001 listing the third countries whose nationals must be in possession of visas when crossing the external borders and those whose nationals are exempt from that requirement(3).(7) The scope of this derogation should be limited to the provisions of the acquis concerning the submission of visa applications, the issuing of visas and their format. Equally, the methods of controlling the external borders should be adapted within the limits necessary to take into account changes in the visa system.(8) Visa applications for members of the Olympic family taking part in the 2004 Olympic or Paralympic Games should be submitted to the Organising Committee of the Olympic Games via the organisations responsible, at the same time as the application for accreditation. The accreditation application form shall contain basic data relating to the persons concerned, such as their full name, sex, date and place of birth and passport number, type and expiry date thereof. These applications shall be forwarded to the Greek services responsible for issuing visas.(9) Irrespective of this Regulation, members of the Olympic family may still submit individual applications for visas in accordance with the relevant acquis communautaire.(10) Where no specific provisions are laid down in this Regulation, the relevant provisions of the acquis communautaire on visas and controls at Member States' external borders should apply. In particular, the provisions of this Regulation relating to the issuing of visas are not applicable to members of the Olympic family who are nationals of third countries subject to a visa requirement but who hold a residence permit or a provisional residence permit issued by one of the Member States applying in full the provisions of the Schengen acquis.(11) The derogation arrangements established by this Regulation should be evaluated in the light of the experience of putting them into practice. Provision should therefore be made for an evaluation after the 2004 Olympic and Paralympic Games in order to assess how well these arrangements have worked in the perspective of the possible organisation of the Olympic Games by other Member States also applying in full the provisions of the Schengen acquis.(12) In accordance with the principle of proportionality, it is necessary and appropriate in order to give effect to the main objective of facilitating the issue of visas to the members of the Olympic family to adopt the temporary derogation established by this Regulation from certain Community provisions. This Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve the objectives pursued, in accordance with the third paragraph of Article 5 of the Treaty.(13) In accordance with Articles 1 and 2 of the Protocol on the position of Denmark annexed to the Treaty on European Union and to the Treaty establishing the European Community, Denmark is not taking part in the adoption of this Regulation, and is not bound by it or subject to its application. Given that this Regulation builds upon the Schengen acquis under the provisions of Title IV of Part Three of the Treaty establishing the European Community, Denmark shall, in accordance with Article 5 of the said Protocol, decide within a period of six months after the Council has adopted this Regulation whether it will implement it in its national law.(14) As regards Iceland and Norway, this Regulation constitutes a development of provisions of the Schengen acquis within the meaning of the Agreement concluded on 18 May 1999 by the Council of the European Union and the Republic of Iceland and the Kingdom of Norway concerning the association of those two States with the implementation, application and development of the Schengen acquis(4), which fall within the area referred to in Article 1, point B of Council Decision 1999/437/EC of 17 May 1999 on certain arrangements for the application of that Agreement(5).(15) This Regulation constitutes a development of provisions of the Schengen acquis in which the United Kingdom does not take part, in accordance with Council Decision 2000/365/EC of 29 May 2000 concerning the request of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland to take part in some of the provisions of the Schengen acquis(6); the United Kingdom is therefore not taking part in its adoption and is not bound by it or subject to its application.(16) This Regulation constitutes a development of provisions of the Schengen acquis in which Ireland does not take part, in accordance with Council Decision 2002/192/EC of 28 February 2002 concerning Ireland's request to take part in some of the provisions of the Schengen acquis(7); Ireland is therefore not taking part in its adoption and is not bound by it or subject to its application.(17) This Regulation constitutes an act building on the Schengen acquis or otherwise related to it within the meaning of Article 3(2) of the 2003 Act of Accession,HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:CHAPTER I PURPOSE AND DEFINITIONSArticle 1PurposeThis Regulation establishes specific provisions introducing a temporary derogation from certain provisions of the Schengen acquis concerning the procedures for applying for and issuing visas as well as for the uniform format for visas for members of the Olympic family for the duration of the 2004 Olympic and Paralympic Games.Apart from these specific provisions, the relevant provisions of the Schengen acquis concerning procedures for applying for and issuing the uniform visa shall remain in force.Article 2DefinitionsFor the purposes of this Regulation:1. \"Responsible organisations\" relating to measures envisaged to facilitate the procedures for applying for and issuing visas for members of the Olympic family taking part in the 2004 Olympic or Paralympic Games means the official organisations, in terms of the Olympic Charter, which are entitled to submit lists of members of the Olympic family to the Organising Committee of the 2004 Olympic Games with a view to the issue of accreditation cards for the Games;2. \"Member of the Olympic family\" means any persons who are members of the International Olympic Committee, the International Paralympic Committee, International Federations, the National Olympic and Paralympic Committees, the Organising Committees of the Olympic Games and the national associations, such as athletes, judges/referees, coaches and other sports technicians, medical personnel attached to teams or individual sportsmen/women and media-accredited journalists, senior executives, donors, sponsors or other official invitees, who agree to be guided by the Olympic Charter, act under the control and supreme authority of the International Olympic Committee, are included on the lists of the responsible organisations and are accredited by the Organising Committee of the 2004 Olympic Games as participants in the 2004 Olympic or Paralympic Games;3. \"Olympic accreditation cards\", issued by the Organising Committee of the 2004 Olympic Games, in accordance with Article 16 of the Greek law 3103/2003, means one of two secure documents, one for the Olympic Games and one for the Paralympic Games, bearing a photograph of its holder, establishing the identity of the member of the Olympic family and authorising access to the facilities at which competitions are held and to other events scheduled during the period of the Games;4. \"Duration of the Olympic Games and Paralympic Games\" means the period from 13 July 2004 to 29 September 2004 for the 2004 Summer Olympic Games and the period from 18 August 2004 to 29 October 2004 for the 2004 Autumn Paralympic Games;5. \"Organising Committee of the 2004 Olympic Games\" means the Committee set up under Article 2 of Greek Law 2598/1998 to organise the 2004 Olympic and Paralympic Games in Athens, which decides on accreditation of members of the Olympic family taking part in those Games;6. \"Services responsible for issuing visas\" means the services designated in Greece to examine applications and issue visas to members of the Olympic family.CHAPTER II ISSUE OF VISASArticle 3ConditionsA visa may be issued pursuant to this Regulation only where the person concerned:(a) has been designated by one of the responsible organisations and accredited by the Organising Committee of the 2004 Olympic Games as a participant in the 2004 Olympic or Paralympic Games;(b) holds a valid travel document authorising the crossing of the external borders, as referred to in Article 5 of the Convention implementing the Schengen Agreement of 14 June 1985, signed at Schengen on 19 June (hereinafter \"the Schengen Convention\");(c) is not a person for whom an alert has been issued for the purposes of refusing entry;(d) is not considered to be a threat to public policy, national security or the international relations of any of the Member States.Article 4Filing of the application1.

The validity of these arrangements, which applied by way of derogation and were designed to avoid additional formalities, was restricted to the duration of the 2004 Olympic and Paralympic Games. They were subsequently evaluated.\nACT\nCouncil Regulation (EC) No 1295/2003 of 15 July 2003 relating to measures envisaged to facilitate the procedures for applying for and issuing visas for members of the Olympic family taking part in the 2004 Olympic or Paralympic Games in Athens.\nSUMMARY\nThe Regulation was not designed to abolish the visa requirement for members of the Olympic family who are subject to it by virtue of their nationality but to lay down measures for adoption by Greece to facilitate their entry into the Schengen area in order to take part in the 2004 Games in Athens.\nThe special procedure for applying for visas is incorporated into accreditation request procedure that members of the Olympic family have to comply with. This means that they do not have to present themselves in person at the consular services either to make the application or to receive the visa, which is formalised instead by the marking of a specific number in the Olympic Games accreditation card.\nOrganisations applying for the Olympic accreditation card * for the persons selected to take part in the Games may, at the same time submit a collective group application for visas as well.\nThe Organising Committee * sends the applications to the consular services as quickly as possible. The services then check that the persons in question:\nhave been accredited by the Organising Committee;\nhold a passport;\nhave not been identified for non-admission in the Schengen Information System;\nare not deemed liable to undermine public order.\nOnce compliance with these conditions has been checked, the services issue a uniform short-stay, multiple-entry visa authorising a stay of up to 90 days for the duration of the Games.\nIf the conditions are not met, the consular services may issue a visa with limited territorial validity.\nThe visa takes the form of two numbers entered on the Olympic accreditation card (visa number and passport number).\nThe visas are issued free of charge.\nWhen members of the Olympic family cross the external borders of the Member States:\nentry checks are limited to verifying compliance with the four conditions set out above;\nthe passports of all members (whether or not they are subject to a visa requirement) are stamped on entry and exit.\nThe Regulation also provides for the Commission to report to the European Parliament and the Council on the functioning of the derogation on the basis of a report transmitted by Greece after the Games with a view to the organisation of the Winter Olympics in Turin.\nBackground\nTo enable the Games to be organised, the Community must establish legislation facilitating the issue of visas to members of the Olympic family. The Regulation meets this requirement.\nGreece is the first Member State to apply the Schengen acquis in its entirety for the organisation of the Olympic Games in Athens in 2004.\nKey terms used in the act\nOlympic accreditation cards: documents issued to members of the Olympic family authorising access to the facilities at which competitions are held for the duration of the Games; these cards are highly secure in order to avoid the occurrence of terrorist attacks;\nOrganising Committee: Committee responsible for organising the 2004 Summer Olympic and Paralympic Games in Athens.\nReferences\nAct\nEntry into force\nDeadline for transposition in the Member States\nOfficial Journal\nRegulation 1295/2003/EC\n04.08.2003\n03.01.2004\nOJ.
