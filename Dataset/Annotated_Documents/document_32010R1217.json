{"celex_id": "32010R1217", "reference": "18.12.2010\nEN\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\nL 335/36\nCOMMISSION REGULATION (EU) No 1217/2010\nof 14 December 2010\non the application of Article 101(3) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union to certain categories of research and development agreements\n(Text with EEA relevance)\nTHE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,\nHaving regard to Regulation (EEC) No 2821/71 of the Council of 20 December 1971 on application of Article 85(3) of the Treaty to categories of agreements, decisions and concerted practices (1),\nHaving published a draft of this Regulation,\nAfter consulting the Advisory Committee on Restrictive Practices and Dominant Positions,\nWhereas:\n(1)\nRegulation (EEC) No 2821/71 empowers the Commission to apply Article 101(3) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (*1) by regulation to certain categories of agreements, decisions and concerted practices falling within the scope of Article 101(1) of the Treaty which have as their object the research and development of products, technologies or processes up to the stage of industrial application, and exploitation of the results, including provisions regarding intellectual property rights.\n(2)\nArticle 179(2) of the Treaty calls upon the Union to encourage undertakings, including small and medium-sized undertakings, in their research and technological development activities of high quality, and to support their efforts to cooperate with one another. This Regulation is intended to facilitate research and development while at the same time effectively protecting competition.\n(3)\nCommission Regulation (EC) No 2659/2000 of 29 November 2000 on the application of Article 81(3) of the Treaty to categories of research and development agreements (2) defines categories of research and development agreements which the Commission regarded as normally satisfying the conditions laid down in Article 101(3) of the Treaty. In view of the overall positive experience with the application of that Regulation, which expires on 31 December 2010, and taking into account further experience acquired since its adoption, it is appropriate to adopt a new block exemption regulation.\n(4)\nThis Regulation should meet the two requirements of ensuring effective protection of competition and providing adequate legal security for undertakings. The pursuit of those objectives should take account of the need to simplify administrative supervision and the legislative framework to as great an extent as possible. Below a certain level of market power it can in general be presumed, for the application of Article 101(3) of the Treaty, that the positive effects of research and development agreements will outweigh any negative effects on competition.\n(5)\nFor the application of Article 101(3) of the Treaty by regulation, it is not necessary to define those agreements which are capable of falling within Article 101(1) of the Treaty. In the individual assessment of agreements under Article 101(1) of the Treaty, account has to be taken of several factors, and in particular the market structure on the relevant market.\n(6)\nAgreements on the joint execution of research work or the joint development of the results of the research, up to but not including the stage of industrial application, generally do not fall within the scope of Article 101(1) of the Treaty. In certain circumstances, however, such as where the parties agree not to carry out other research and development in the same field, thereby forgoing the opportunity of gaining competitive advantages over the other parties, such agreements may fall within Article 101(1) of the Treaty and should therefore be included within the scope of this Regulation.\n(7)\nThe benefit of the exemption established by this Regulation should be limited to those agreements for which it can be assumed with sufficient certainty that they satisfy the conditions of Article 101(3) of the Treaty.\n(8)\nCooperation in research and development and in the exploitation of the results is most likely to promote technical and economic progress if the parties contribute complementary skills, assets or activities to the cooperation. This also includes scenarios where one party merely finances the research and development activities of another party.\n(9)\nThe joint exploitation of results can be considered as the natural consequence of joint research and development. It can take different forms such as manufacture, the exploitation of intellectual property rights that substantially contribute to technical or economic progress, or the marketing of new products.\n(10)\nConsumers can generally be expected to benefit from the increased volume and effectiveness of research and development through the introduction of new or improved products or services, a quicker launch of those products or services, or the reduction of prices brought about by new or improved technologies or processes.\n(11)\nIn order to justify the exemption, the joint exploitation should relate to products, technologies or processes for which the use of the results of the research and development is decisive. Moreover, all the parties should agree in the research and development agreement that they will all have full access to the final results of the joint research and development, including any arising intellectual property rights and know-how, for the purposes of further research and development and exploitation, as soon as the final results become available. Access to the results should generally not be limited as regards the use of the results for the purposes of further research and development. However, where the parties, in accordance with this Regulation, limit their rights of exploitation, in particular where they specialise in the context of exploitation, access to the results for the purposes of exploitation may be limited accordingly. Moreover, where academic bodies, research institutes or undertakings which supply research and development as a commercial service without normally being active in the exploitation of results participate in research and development, they may agree to use the results of research and development solely for the purpose of further research. Depending on their capabilities and commercial needs, the parties may make unequal contributions to their research and development cooperation. Therefore, in order to reflect, and to make up for, the differences in the value or the nature of the parties’ contributions, a research and development agreement benefiting from this Regulation may provide that one party is to compensate another for obtaining access to the results for the purposes of further research or exploitation. However, the compensation should not be so high as to effectively impede such access.\n(12)\nSimilarly, where the research and development agreement does not provide for any joint exploitation of the results, the parties should agree in the research and development agreement to grant each other access to their respective pre-existing know-how, as long as this know-how is indispensable for the purposes of the exploitation of the results by the other parties. The rates of any licence fee charged should not be so high as to effectively impede access to the know-how by the other parties.\n(13)\nThe exemption established by this Regulation should be limited to research and development agreements which do not afford the undertakings the possibility of eliminating competition in respect of a substantial part of the products, services or technologies in question. It is necessary to exclude from the block exemption agreements between competitors whose combined share of the market for products, services or technologies capable of being improved or replaced by the results of the research and development exceeds a certain level at the time the agreement is entered into. However, there is no presumption that research and development agreements are either caught by Article 101(1) of the Treaty or that they fail to satisfy the conditions of Article 101(3) of the Treaty once the market share threshold set out in this Regulation is exceeded or other conditions of this Regulation are not met. In such cases, an individual assessment of the research and development agreement needs to be conducted under Article 101 of the Treaty.\n(14)\nIn order to ensure the maintenance of effective competition during joint exploitation of the results, provision should be made for the block exemption to cease to apply if the parties’ combined share of the market for the products, services or technologies arising out of the joint research and development becomes too great. The exemption should continue to apply, irrespective of the parties’ market shares, for a certain period after the commencement of joint exploitation, so as to await stabilisation of their market shares, particularly after the introduction of an entirely new product, and to guarantee a minimum period of return on the investments involved.\n(15)\nThis Regulation should not exempt agreements containing restrictions which are not indispensable to the attainment of the positive effects generated by a research and development agreement. In principle, agreements containing certain types of severe restrictions of competition such as limitations on the freedom of parties to carry out research and development in a field unconnected to the agreement, the fixing of prices charged to third parties, limitations on output or sales, and limitations on effecting passive sales for the contract products or contract technologies in territories or to customers reserved for other parties should be excluded from the benefit of the exemption established by this Regulation irrespective of the market share of the parties. In this context, field of use restrictions do not constitute limitations of output or sales, and also do not constitute territorial or customer restrictions.\n(16)\nThe market share limitation, the non-exemption of certain agreements and the conditions provided for in this Regulation normally ensure that the agreements to which the block exemption applies do not enable the parties to eliminate competition in respect of a substantial part of the products or services in question.\n(17)\nThe possibility cannot be ruled out that anti-competitive foreclosure effects may arise where one party finances several research and development projects carried out by competitors with regard to the same contract products or contract technologies, in particular where it obtains the exclusive right to exploit the results vis-à-vis third parties. Therefore the benefit of this Regulation should be conferred on such paid-for research and development agreements only if the combined market share of all the parties involved in the connected agreements, that is to say, the financing party and all the parties carrying out the research and development, does not exceed 25 %.\n(18)\nAgreements between undertakings which are not competing manufacturers of products, technologies or processes capable of being improved, substituted or replaced by the results of the research and development will only eliminate effective competition in research and development in exceptional circumstances. It is therefore appropriate to enable such agreements to benefit from the exemption established by this Regulation irrespective of market share and to address any exceptional cases by way of withdrawal of its benefit.\n(19)\nThe Commission may withdraw the benefit of this Regulation, pursuant to Article 29(1) of Council Regulation (EC) No 1/2003 of 16 December 2002 on the implementation of the rules on competition laid down in Articles 81 and 82 of the Treaty (3), where it finds in a particular case that an agreement to which the exemption provided for in this Regulation applies nevertheless has effects which are incompatible with Article 101(3) of the Treaty.\n(20)\nThe competition authority of a Member State may withdraw the benefit of this Regulation pursuant to Article 29(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1/2003 in respect of the territory of that Member State, or a part thereof where, in a particular case, an agreement to which the exemption established by this Regulation applies nevertheless has effects which are incompatible with Article 101(3) of the Treaty in the territory of that Member State, or in a part thereof, and where such territory has all the characteristics of a distinct geographic market.\n(21)\nThe benefit of this Regulation could be withdrawn pursuant to Article 29 of Regulation (EC) No 1/2003, for example, where the existence of a research and development agreement substantially restricts the scope for third parties to carry out research and development in the relevant field because of the limited research capacity available elsewhere, where because of the particular structure of supply, the existence of the research and development agreement substantially restricts the access of third parties to the market for the contract products or contract technologies, where without any objectively valid reason, the parties do not exploit the results of the joint research and development vis-à-vis third parties, where the contract products or contract technologies are not subject in the whole or a substantial part of the internal market to effective competition from products, technologies or processes considered by users as equivalent in view of their characteristics, price and intended use, or where the existence of the research and development agreement would restrict competition in innovation or eliminate effective competition in research and development on a particular market.\n(22)\nAs research and development agreements are often of a long-term nature, especially where the cooperation extends to the exploitation of the results, the period of validity of this Regulation should be fixed at 12 years,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nArticle 1\nDefinitions\n1.   For the purposes of this Regulation, the following definitions shall apply:\n(a)\n‘research and development agreement’ means an agreement entered into between two or more parties which relate to the conditions under which those parties pursue:\n(i)\njoint research and development of contract products or contract technologies and joint exploitation of the results of that research and development;\n(ii)\njoint exploitation of the results of research and development of contract products or contract technologies jointly carried out pursuant to a prior agreement between the same parties;\n(iii)\njoint research and development of contract products or contract technologies excluding joint exploitation of the results;\n(iv)\npaid-for research and development of contract products or contract technologies and joint exploitation of the results of that research and development;\n(v)\njoint exploitation of the results of paid-for research and development of contract products or contract technologies pursuant to a prior agreement between the same parties;

For the purposes of this Regulation, the terms ‘undertaking’ and ‘party’ shall include their respective connected undertakings.\n‘Connected undertakings’ means:\n(a)\nundertakings in which a party to the research and development agreement, directly or indirectly:\n(i)\nhas the power to exercise more than half the voting rights;\n(ii)\nhas the power to appoint more than half the members of the supervisory board, board of management or bodies legally representing the undertaking; or\n(iii)\nhas the right to manage the undertaking’s affairs;\n(b)\nundertakings which directly or indirectly have, over a party to the research and development agreement, the rights or powers listed in point (a);\n(c)\nundertakings in which an undertaking referred to in point (b) has, directly or indirectly, the rights or powers listed in point (a);\n(d)\nundertakings in which a party to the research and development agreement together with one or more of the undertakings referred to in points (a), (b) or (c), or in which two or more of the latter undertakings, jointly have the rights or powers listed in point (a);\n(e)\nundertakings in which the rights or the powers listed in point (a) are jointly held by:\n(i)\nparties to the research and development agreement or their respective connected undertakings referred to in points (a) to (d); or\n(ii)\none or more of the parties to the research and development agreement or one or more of their connected undertakings referred to in points (a) to (d) and one or more third parties.\nArticle 2\nExemption\n1.   Pursuant to Article 101(3) of the Treaty and subject to the provisions of this Regulation, it is hereby declared that Article 101(1) of the Treaty shall not apply to research and development agreements.\nThis exemption shall apply to the extent that such agreements contain restrictions of competition falling within the scope of Article 101(1) of the Treaty.\n2.   The exemption provided for in paragraph 1 shall apply to research and development agreements containing provisions which relate to the assignment or licensing of intellectual property rights to one or more of the parties or to an entity the parties establish to carry out the joint research and development, paid-for research and development or joint exploitation, provided that those provisions do not constitute the primary object of such agreements, but are directly related to and necessary for their implementation.\nArticle 3\nConditions for exemption\n1.   The exemption provided for in Article 2 shall apply subject to the conditions set out in paragraphs 2 to 5.\n2.   The research and development agreement must stipulate that all the parties have full access to the final results of the joint research and development or paid-for research and development, including any resulting intellectual property rights and know-how, for the purposes of further research and development and exploitation, as soon as they become available. Where the parties limit their rights of exploitation in accordance with this Regulation, in particular where they specialise in the context of exploitation, access to the results for the purposes of exploitation may be limited accordingly. Moreover, research institutes, academic bodies, or undertakings which supply research and development as a commercial service without normally being active in the exploitation of results may agree to confine their use of the results for the purposes of further research. The research and development agreement may foresee that the parties compensate each other for giving access to the results for the purposes of further research or exploitation, but the compensation must not be so high as to effectively impede such access.\n3.   Without prejudice to paragraph 2, where the research and development agreement provides only for joint research and development or paid-for research and development, the research and development agreement must stipulate that each party must be granted access to any pre-existing know-how of the other parties, if this know-how is indispensable for the purposes of its exploitation of the results. The research and development agreement may foresee that the parties compensate each other for giving access to their pre-existing know-how, but the compensation must not be so high as to effectively impede such access.\n4.   Any joint exploitation may only pertain to results which are protected by intellectual property rights or constitute know-how and which are indispensable for the manufacture of the contract products or the application of the contract technologies.\n5.   Parties charged with the manufacture of the contract products by way of specialisation in the context of exploitation must be required to fulfil orders for supplies of the contract products from the other parties, except where the research and development agreement also provides for joint distribution within the meaning of point (m)(i) or (ii) of Article 1(1) or where the parties have agreed that only the party manufacturing the contract products may distribute them.\nArticle 4\nMarket share threshold and duration of exemption\n1.   Where the parties are not competing undertakings, the exemption provided for in Article 2 shall apply for the duration of the research and development. Where the results are jointly exploited, the exemption shall continue to apply for 7 years from the time the contract products or contract technologies are first put on the market within the internal market.\n2.   Where two or more of the parties are competing undertakings, the exemption provided for in Article 2 shall apply for the period referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article only if, at the time the research and development agreement is entered into:\n(a)\nin the case of research and development agreements referred to in point (a)(i), (ii) or (iii) of Article 1(1), the combined market share of the parties to a research and development agreement does not exceed 25 % on the relevant product and technology markets; or\n(b)\nin the case of research and agreements referred to in point (a)(iv), (v) or (vi) of Article 1(1), the combined market share of the financing party and all the parties with which the financing party has entered into research and development agreements with regard to the same contract products or contract technologies, does not exceed 25 % on the relevant product and technology markets.\n3.   After the end of the period referred to in paragraph 1, the exemption shall continue to apply as long as the combined market share of the parties does not exceed 25 % on the relevant product and technology markets.\nArticle 5\nHardcore restrictions\nThe exemption provided for in Article 2 shall not apply to research and development agreements which, directly or indirectly, in isolation or in combination with other factors under the control of the parties, have as their object any of the following:\n(a)\nthe restriction of the freedom of the parties to carry out research and development independently or in cooperation with third parties in a field unconnected with that to which the research and development agreement relates or, after the completion of the joint research and development or the paid-for research and development, in the field to which it relates or in a connected field;\n(b)\nthe limitation of output or sales, with the exception of:\n(i)\nthe setting of production targets where the joint exploitation of the results includes the joint production of the contract products;\n(ii)\nthe setting of sales targets where the joint exploitation of the results includes the joint distribution of the contract products or the joint licensing of the contract technologies within the meaning of point (m)(i) or (ii) of Article 1(1);\n(iii)\npractices constituting specialisation in the context of exploitation; and\n(iv)\nthe restriction of the freedom of the parties to manufacture, sell, assign or license products, technologies or processes which compete with the contract products or contract technologies during the period for which the parties have agreed to jointly exploit the results;\n(c)\nthe fixing of prices when selling the contract product or licensing the contract technologies to third parties, with the exception of the fixing of prices charged to immediate customers or the fixing of licence fees charged to immediate licensees where the joint exploitation of the results includes the joint distribution of the contract products or the joint licensing of the contract technologies within the meaning of point (m)(i) or (ii) of Article 1(1);\n(d)\nthe restriction of the territory in which, or of the customers to whom, the parties may passively sell the contract products or license the contract technologies, with the exception of the requirement to exclusively license the results to another party;\n(e)\nthe requirement not to make any, or to limit, active sales of the contract products or contract technologies in territories or to customers which have not been exclusively allocated to one of the parties by way of specialisation in the context of exploitation;\n(f)\nthe requirement to refuse to meet demand from customers in the parties’ respective territories, or from customers otherwise allocated between the parties by way of specialisation in the context of exploitation, who would market the contract products in other territories within the internal market;\n(g)\nthe requirement to make it difficult for users or resellers to obtain the contract products from other resellers within the internal market.\nArticle 6\nExcluded restrictions\nThe exemption provided for in Article 2 shall not apply to the following obligations contained in research and development agreements:\n(a)\nthe obligation not to challenge after completion of the research and development the validity of intellectual property rights which the parties hold in the internal market and which are relevant to the research and development or, after the expiry of the research and development agreement, the validity of intellectual property rights which the parties hold in the internal market and which protect the results of the research and development, without prejudice to the possibility to provide for termination of the research and development agreement in the event of one of the parties challenging the validity of such intellectual property rights;\n(b)\nthe obligation not to grant licences to third parties to manufacture the contract products or to apply the contract technologies unless the agreement provides for the exploitation of the results of the joint research and development or paid-for research and development by at least one of the parties and such exploitation takes place in the internal market vis-à-vis third parties.\nArticle 7\nApplication of the market share threshold\nFor the purposes of applying the market share threshold provided for in Article 4 the following rules shall apply:\n(a)\nthe market share shall be calculated on the basis of the market sales value; if market sales value data are not available, estimates based on other reliable market information, including market sales volumes, may be used to establish the market share of the parties;\n(b)\nthe market share shall be calculated on the basis of data relating to the preceding calendar year;\n(c)\nthe market share held by the undertakings referred to in point (e) of the second subparagraph of Article 1(2) shall be apportioned equally to each undertaking having the rights or the powers listed in point (a) of that subparagraph;\n(d)\nif the market share referred to in Article 4(3) is initially not more than 25 % but subsequently rises above that level without exceeding 30 %, the exemption provided for in Article 2 shall continue to apply for a period of two consecutive calendar years following the year in which the 25 % threshold was first exceeded;\n(e)\nif the market share referred to in Article 4(3) is initially not more than 25 % but subsequently rises above 30 %, the exemption provided for in Article 2 shall continue to apply for a period of one calendar year following the year in which the level of 30 % was first exceeded;\n(f)\nthe benefit of points (d) and (e) may not be combined so as to exceed a period of two calendar years.\nArticle 8\nTransitional period\nThe prohibition laid down in Article 101(1) of the Treaty shall not apply during the period from 1 January 2011 to 31 December 2012 in respect of agreements already in force on 31 December 2010 which do not satisfy the conditions for exemption provided for in this Regulation but which satisfy the conditions for exemption provided for in Regulation (EC) No 2659/2000.\nArticle 9\nPeriod of validity\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on 1 January 2011.\nIt shall expire on 31 December 2022.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.\nDone at Brussels, 14 December 2010.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJosé Manuel BARROSO\n(1)  OJ L 285, 29.12.1971, p. 46.\n(*1)  With effect from 1 December 2009, Article 81 of the EC Treaty has become Article 101 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). The two articles are, in substance, identical. For the purposes of this Regulation, references to Article 101 of the TFEU should be understood as references to Article 81 of the EC Treaty where appropriate. The TFEU also introduced certain changes in terminology, such as the replacement of ‘Community’ by ‘Union’ and ‘common market’ by ‘internal market’. The terminology of the TFEU will be used throughout this Regulation.\n(2)  OJ L 304, 5.12.2000, p. 7.\n(3)  OJ L 1, 4.1.2003, p. 1.", "summary": "Exemption for research and development agreements\nExemption for research and development agreements\nSUMMARY OF:\nRegulation (EU) No 1217/2010 on the application of Article 101(3) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) to certain categories of research and development agreements\nWHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?\nArticle 101 TFEU sets out the rules concerning concerted practices and agreements between companies. As a general rule, such concerted practices and agreements are banned unless they fall within the scope of Article 101(3) when they are exceptions to the rule.\nRegulation (EU) No 1217/2010 states that Article 101 does not apply to research and development (R&D) agreements* when the parties either pursue joint R&D of products or processes and joint exploitation of the results of that R&D, or pursue either of those activities in isolation.\nKEY POINTS\nArticle 101(1) TFEU is not applicable to R&D agreements. Regulation (EEC) No 2821/71, however, provides an exemption for R&D agreements which contain rules relating to the assignment or licensing of intellectual property rights in order to carry out the joint R&D, paid-for R&D or joint exploitation, so long as those provisions are not the primary object of such agreements, but are instead directly related to and necessary for their implementation.\nThe regulation also block exempts the joint exploitation of the results of R&D carried out by the parties under the regulation. This regulation replaces Regulation (EC) No 2659/2000, which expired on 31 December 2010.\nConditions for exemption\nTo be exempted, the agreement must state that all the parties have full access to the final results of the R&D, including any resulting intellectual property rights and know-how, for the purposes of further R&D and exploitation. If the parties limit their rights of exploitation, access to the results for the purposes of exploitation may be limited accordingly.\nWhere the agreement only provides for joint R&D or paid-for R&D, each party must have access to any pre-existing know-how of the other parties concerned, if this know-how is indispensable for the exploitation of the results. This exchange of pre-existing know-how may be compensated, but the compensation must not be so high as to effectively prevent such access.\nAny joint exploitation may only concern results which are protected by intellectual property rights or constitute know-how, and which are indispensable for the manufacture of the contract products or the application of the contract technologies.\nMarket share threshold and duration of exemption\nWhere the parties to the R&D agreement are not competing undertakings, the exemption provided for by this regulation is applicable for the duration of the R&D. Where the results are jointly exploited, the exemption continues to apply for 7 years after the contract products or contract technologies are first put on the European Union (EU) market.\nWhere the parties are competing undertakings, at the time the R&D agreement is entered into, the exemption is applicable only if: in the case of joint R&D agreements, the combined market share of the parties does not exceed 25% on the relevant product and technology markets;in the case of paid-for R&D agreements, the combined market share of the financing party and all the parties with which the financing party has entered into R&D agreements, relating to the same contract products or contract technologies, does not exceed 25% on the relevant product and technology markets.\nAt the end of the 7-year period, the exemption shall continue to apply as long as the combined market share of the parties does not exceed 25% on the relevant markets.\nHardcore restrictions\nThe exemption does not apply to R&D agreements which, directly or indirectly, in isolation or in combination with other factors under the control of the parties, have as their object: the restriction of the freedom of the parties to carry out R&D in an unrelated field;the restriction of the freedom of the parties to pursue R&D in a related field after the completion of the R&D agreement concerned;the limitation of output or sales, with certain exceptions.\nExcluded restrictions\nThe exemption does not apply to the following obligations contained in R&D agreements: the obligation not to challenge the validity of related intellectual property rights after completion of the R&D;the obligation not to grant licences to third parties to manufacture the contract products or to apply to contract technologies, unless the agreement provides for the exploitation of the results by at least one of the parties and such exploitation takes place in the internal market vis-à-vis third parties.\nEuropean Commission guidelines\nIn 2011, the Commission adopted guidelines on the interpretation and applicability of Article 101 TFEU to horizontal cooperation agreements*, which include R&D agreements.\nFROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?\n              \nIt has applied since 1 January 2011 and expires on 31 December 2022.\nBACKGROUND\n              \nIn 2019, the Commission embarked on an evaluation to examine whether to let the EU regulations dealing with horizontal agreements lapse when they expire in December 2022, or whether to extend or amend them (and the guidelines on how to interpret them).
