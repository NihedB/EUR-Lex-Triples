Directive 2001/18/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 March 2001 on the deliberate release into the environment of genetically modified organisms(6) invited the Commission to bring forward a legislative proposal for implementing the procedures laid down in the Protocol and, in accordance with the Protocol, requiring Community exporters to ensure that all requirements of the Advance Informed Agreement Procedure, as set out in Articles 7 to 10, 12 and 14 of the Protocol, are fulfilled.(4) It is important to organise the supervision and control of transboundary movements of GMOs in order to contribute to ensuring the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity, taking also into account risks to human health, and so as to enable citizens to make a free and informed choice in regard to GMOs.(5) Since Community legislation does not contain specific requirements for exports of GMOs to third countries, and in order to ensure compliance with the obligations in the Protocol regarding transboundary movements of GMOs, a common legal framework should be established for such exports.(6) It is necessary to recognise the need to respect the Party or non-Party of import's regulatory biosafety framework, in a manner consistent with the Protocol.(7) Pharmaceuticals for humans that are addressed by other international agreements, to which the Community or the relevant Member State is party, or organisations, of which the Community or the relevant Member State is a member, should be excluded from the scope of this Regulation.(8) Exports of GMOs intended for deliberate release into the environment should be notified to the Party or non-Party of import, allowing it to make an informed decision, based on a risk assessment carried out in a scientifically sound manner.(9) The notification should be ensured by the exporter. The exporter should be responsible for the accuracy of the information provided in the notification.(10) Exporters should await the prior written express consent of the Party or non-Party of import before proceeding with the first transboundary movement of a GMO intended for deliberate release into the environment.(11) Recognising that some developing countries, and some countries with economies in transition, may lack the capacities which would enable them to take such informed decisions, the Commission and Member States should make sustained efforts to enable them to develop and strengthen human resources and institutional capacities.(12) According to the Protocol, the Community or any other Party may take action that is more protective of the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity than that called for in the Protocol, provided that such action is consistent with the objective and the provisions of the Protocol and in accordance with that Party's other obligations under international law.(13) According to the Protocol, the Community may apply its domestic legislation in respect of the movements of GMOs within its customs territory.(14) As existing Community legislation, and in particular Directive 2001/18/EC and sectoral legislation providing for a specific risk assessment to be carried out in accordance with the principles set out in that Directive, already contain rules which are in line with the objective of the Protocol, there is no need to adopt supplementary provisions with regard to imports of GMOs into the Community.(15) It is necessary to ensure the safe transport, handling and packaging of GMOs. As existing Community legislation, in particular Council Directive 94/55/EC of 21 November 1994 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States with regard to the transport of dangerous goods by road(7) and Council Directive 96/49/EC of 23 July 1996 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States with regard to the transport of dangerous goods by rail(8), already contain appropriate rules, there is no need to adopt supplementary provisions in this respect.(16) It is necessary to ensure the identification of GMOs being exported from or imported into the Community. With regard to traceability, labelling and identification of imports into the Community, such GMOs are subject to rules in Community legislation. With regard to exports similar rules should apply.(17) The Commission and Member States support the process with respect to the appropriate elaboration of international rules and procedures in the field of liability and redress for damage resulting from transboundary movements of GMOs, to be agreed, as provided for in Article 27 of the Protocol, at the first meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Protocol.(18) The Commission and the Member States support the further development and the application of the common formats for accompanying documentation on identification of GMOs, which is undertaken in accordance with Article 18 of the Protocol.(19) In order to respond efficiently to unintentional transboundary movements of GMOs that are likely to have a significant adverse effect on the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity, taking into account risks to human health, a Member State should, as soon as it becomes aware of an event under its jurisdiction resulting in a release that may lead to an unintentional transboundary movement of a GMO that is likely to have such effects, take the appropriate measures to inform the public and inform without delay the Commission, all other Member States, affected or potentially affected States, the Biosafety Clearing-House (BCH) and, where appropriate, relevant international organisations. Also, that Member State should consult without delay affected or potentially affected States to enable them to determine appropriate responses and initiate necessary action.(20) In order to help develop the BCH, the Community and its Member States should ensure that relevant information is communicated to the BCH, and that monitoring and reporting on the implementation of the Protocol in the Community are performed.(21) Member States should lay down rules on penalties applicable to infringements of this Regulation and ensure that they are implemented. Those penalties should be effective, proportionate and dissuasive.(22) The precautionary principle should be taken into account when applying this Regulation.(23) This Regulation respects the fundamental rights and observes the principles recognised in particular by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union,HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:CHAPTER I OBJECTIVES, SCOPE AND DEFINITIONSArticle 1ObjectivesIn accordance with the precautionary principle, and without prejudice to the provisions of Directive 2001/18/EC, the objectives of this Regulation are to establish a common system of notification and information for transboundary movements of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) and to ensure coherent implementation of the provisions of the Protocol on behalf of the Community in order to contribute to ensuring an adequate level of protection in the field of the safe transfer, handling and use of GMOs that may have adverse effects on the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity, taking also into account risks to human health.Article 2Scope1.

If the exporter considers that a change in circumstances has occurred that may influence the outcome of the risk assessment upon which the decision was based or that additional relevant scientific or technical information has become available, he may ask the Party or, where appropriate, non-Party of import to review a decision it has made concerning notification pursuant to Article 10 of the Protocol.2. Where a Party or non-Party of import does not respond to such a request within 90 days, the exporter shall send a written reminder to the competent authority of that Party or, where appropriate, non-Party of import, with a copy to the Secretariat, requesting a response within a set period following receipt of the reminder.Article 8Exceptions to Section 1 of this Chapter1. GMOs intended for deliberate release into the environment identified in a decision of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention serving as the Meeting of the Parties to the Protocol as being not likely to have adverse effects on the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity, taking also into account risks to human health, shall be excluded from the scope of section 1 of this Chapter.2. Section 1 of this Chapter shall not apply to GMOs intended for direct use as food or feed, or for processing.3. The obligations referred to in section 1 of this Chapter shall not apply if the Party of import has specified in advance to the BCH, in accordance with Article 13(1)(b) and Article 14(3) of the Protocol, that such imports of GMOs are to be exempted from the Advance Informed Agreement Procedure, as set out in Articles 7 to 10, 12 and 14 of the Protocol, provided that adequate measures are applied to ensure their safe intentional transboundary movement in accordance with the objective of the Protocol.Section 2 GMOs intended for direct use as food or feed, or for processingArticle 9Information to the BCH1. The Commission on behalf of the Community or, where appropriate, the Member State which made the decision shall inform the BCH and other Parties through the BCH of any final decision regarding use, including placing on the market, within the Community or use within a Member State, of a GMO that may be subject to transboundary movements for direct use as food or feed or for processing. This information shall be sent to the BCH within 15 days of the adoption of that decision.This paragraph shall not apply to decisions regarding the deliberate release in accordance with Part B of Directive 2001/18/EC of a GMO which is not intended for direct use as food or feed or for processing in a third country without a subsequent decision.2. The information referred to in paragraph 1 and sent to the BCH shall contain as a minimum the information specified in Annex II.3.

This is because some genetically modified organisms (GMOs) may have adverse effects on the environment and human health.\n            \n—\n              To ensure an adequate level of protection, it creates a system for notifying and exchanging information on the export of GMOs to non-EU countries.\nKEY POINTS\n              \n—\n              This Regulation distinguishes between GMOs intended for deliberate release into the environment (i.e. field tests, or to cultivate, import or transform GMOs into industrial products) and GMOs intended for food or feed, or for processing.\n            \n—\n              Exporters of GMOs intended for deliberate release into the environment must notify the competent national authority of the non-EU country importing the GMOs (and notify it again if there is no reply). The notification must contain the information specified in Annex I to this Regulation. The exporter must keep this notification and acknowledgment of receipt for 5 years, plus send copies to the authorities in their EU country and to the European Commission.\n            \n—\n              The European Commission or the EU country that took the decision must notify the Biosafety Clearing House (BCH) of any decision regarding the use of GMOs intended for food or processing that may be transferred across international borders. The notification must contain the information specified in Annex II to this Regulation. These GMOs may not be moved across boundaries if they have not been authorised within the EU.\n            \n—\n              If an EU country becomes aware of an unintentional export of potentially dangerous GMOs, it must inform the public, notify the European Commission and consult the affected country to enable them to take the necessary remedial action.\n            \n—\n              EU countries must submit reports on the application of this Regulation every 3 years.\nBACKGROUND\n              \nIn 2000, the EU and its countries signed the Cartagena Protocol, which is designed to ensure that movements of GMOs (especially between countries) do not pose a risk to the environment or human health.\nSince then, in 2011, the EU signed the Nagoya-Kuala Lumpur Supplementary Protocol. This elaborates on the international rules and procedures of the Cartagena Protocol to respond to damage caused by GMOs transferred across international borders.\nKEY TERM\n* Genetically modified organisms: organisms to which gene therapy has been applied. This can artificially change their genetic makeup, giving them new properties (e.g. a plant’s resistance to drought, insects or disease). Since the long-term impact of GMOs on the environment and human health remain largely unknown, the EU takes the precautionary approach.\nACT\n            \nRegulation (EC) No 1946/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 July 2003 on transboundary movement of genetically modified organisms (OJ L 287, 5.11.2003, pp. 1–10)\nRELATED ACTS\n            \nCouncil Decision 2002/628/EC of 25 June 2002 concerning the conclusion, on behalf of the European Community, of the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety (OJ L 201, 31.7.2002, pp. 48–49)\nCouncil Decision 2013/86/EU of 12 February 2013 on the conclusion on behalf of the European Union of the Nagoya-Kuala Lumpur Supplementary Protocol on Liability and Redress to the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety (OJ L 46, 19.2.2013, pp. 1–3)\nlast update 24.11.2015", "tags": ["transfrontier pollution", "biotechnology", "environmental risk prevention", "cross-border transport", "genetically modified organism"], "subjects": ["Public health", "Internal market - Principles", "Protocol on Ireland/Northern Ireland", "Environment"], "split": "train", "reference_annotations": {}, "summary_annotations": {}}
