The measures to meet the requirements of Article 10 of the UN Firearms Protocol should be adapted to provide for simplified procedures for firearms for civilian use. Consequently, some facilitation with regard to authorisation for multiple shipments, transit measures and temporary exports for lawful purposes should be ensured.\n(9)\nThis Regulation does not affect the application of Article 346 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, which refers to essential interests of the security of the Member States, nor has this Regulation any impact on Directive 2009/43/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 May 2009 simplifying terms and conditions of transfers of defence-related products within the Community (6), or on Council Directive 91/477/EEC of 18 June 1991 on control of the acquisition and possession of weapons (7). Moreover, the UN Firearms Protocol, and consequently this Regulation, do not apply to State-to-State transactions or to State transfers in cases where the application of the Protocol would prejudice the right of a State Party to take action in the interest of national security consistent with the Charter of the United Nations.\n(10)\nDirective 91/477/EEC addresses transfers of firearms for civilian use within the territory of the Union, while this Regulation focuses on measures in respect of export from the customs territory of the Union to or through third countries.\n(11)\nFirearms, their parts and essential components and ammunition when imported from third countries are subject to Union law and, in particular, to the requirements of Directive 91/477/EEC.\n(12)\nConsistency should be ensured with regard to record-keeping provisions in force under Union law.\n(13)\nIn order to ensure that this Regulation is properly applied, Member States should take measures giving the competent authorities appropriate powers.\n(14)\nIn order to maintain the list of firearms, their parts and essential components and ammunition for which an authorisation is required under this Regulation, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union should be delegated to the Commission in respect of aligning Annex I to this Regulation to Annex I to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2658/87 of 23 July 1987 on the tariff and statistical nomenclature and on the Common Customs Tariff (8), and to Annex I to Directive 91/477/EEC. It is of particular importance that the Commission carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level. The Commission, when preparing and drawing up delegated acts, should ensure a simultaneous, timely and appropriate transmission of relevant documents to the European Parliament and to the Council.\n(15)\nThe Union has adopted a body of customs rules, contained in Council Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 of 12 October 1992 establishing the Community Customs Code (9) and its implementing provisions as laid down in Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93 (10). Consideration should also be given to Regulation (EC) No 450/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 April 2008 laying down the Community Customs Code (Modernised Customs Code) (11) whose provisions are applicable in different phases according to Article 188 thereof. Nothing in this Regulation constrains any powers under and pursuant to the Community Customs Code and its implementing provisions.\n(16)\nMember States should lay down rules on penalties applicable to infringements of this Regulation and ensure that they are implemented. Those penalties should be effective, proportionate and dissuasive.\n(17)\nThis Regulation is without prejudice to the Union regime for the control of exports, transfer, brokering and transit of dual-use items established by Council Regulation (EC) No 428/2009 (12).\n(18)\nThis Regulation is consistent with the other relevant provisions on firearms, their parts, essential components and ammunition for military use, security strategies, illicit trafficking in small arms and light weapons and exports of military technology, including Council Common Position 2008/944/CFSP of 8 December 2008 defining common rules governing control of exports of military technology and equipment (13).\n(19)\nThe Commission and the Member States should inform each other of the measures taken under this Regulation and of other relevant information at their disposal in connection with this Regulation.\n(20)\nThis Regulation does not prevent the Member States from applying their constitutional rules relating to public access to official documents, taking into account Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 30 May 2001 regarding public access to European Parliament, Council and Commission documents (14),\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nCHAPTER I\nSUBJECT, DEFINITIONS AND SCOPE\nArticle 1\nThis Regulation lays down rules governing export authorisation, and import and transit measures for firearms, their parts and essential components and ammunition, for the purpose of implementing Article 10 of the United Nations Protocol against the Illicit Manufacturing of and Trafficking in Firearms, their Parts and Components and Ammunition, supplementing the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organised Crime (the ‘UN Firearms Protocol’).\nArticle 2\nFor the purposes of this Regulation:\n(1)\n‘firearm’ means any portable barrelled weapon that expels, is designed to expel or may be converted to expel, a shot, bullet or projectile by the action of a combustible propellant as referred to in Annex I.\nAn object is considered as capable of being converted to expel a shot, bullet or projectile by the action of a combustible propellant if:\n—\nit has the appearance of a firearm, and\n—\nas a result of its construction or the material from which it is made, it can be so converted;\n(2)\n‘parts’ means any element or replacement element as referred to in Annex I specifically designed for a firearm and essential to its operation, including a barrel, frame or receiver, slide or cylinder, bolt or breech block, and any device designed or adapted to diminish the sound caused by firing a firearm;\n(3)\n‘essential components’ means the breech-closing mechanism, the chamber and the barrel of a firearm which, being separate objects, are included in the category of the firearms on which they are or are intended to be mounted;\n(4)\n‘ammunition’ means the complete round or the components thereof, including cartridge cases, primers, propellant powder, bullets or projectiles that are used in a firearm, as referred to in Annex I, provided that those components are themselves subject to authorisation in the relevant Member State;\n(5)\n‘deactivated firearms’ means objects otherwise corresponding to the definition of a firearm which have been rendered permanently unfit for use by deactivation, ensuring that all essential parts of the firearm have been rendered permanently inoperable and incapable of removal, replacement or modification that would permit the firearm to be reactivated in any way.\nMember States shall make arrangements for these deactivation measures to be verified by a competent authority.

An export authorisation established in accordance with the form set out in Annex II shall be required for the export of firearms, their parts and essential components and ammunition listed in Annex I. Such authorisation shall be granted by the competent authorities of the Member State where the exporter is established and shall be issued in writing or by electronic means.\n2.   Where the export of firearms, their parts, essential components and ammunition requires an export authorisation pursuant to this Regulation and that export is also subject to authorisation requirements in accordance with Common Position 2008/944/CFSP, Member States may use a single procedure to carry out the obligations imposed on them by this Regulation and by that Common Position.\n3.   If the firearms, their parts and essential components and ammunition are located in one or more Member States other than the one where the application for export authorisation has been made, that fact shall be indicated on that application. The competent authorities of the Member State to which the application for export authorisation has been made shall immediately consult the competent authorities of the Member State or States in question and provide the relevant information. The Member State or States consulted shall make known within 10 working days any objections it or they may have to the granting of such an authorisation, which shall bind the Member State in which the application has been made.\nArticle 5\nThe Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 6 to amend Annex I on the basis of the amendments to Annex I to Regulation (EEC) No 2658/87, and on the basis of the amendments to Annex I to Directive 91/477/EEC.\nArticle 6\n1.   The power to adopt delegated acts is conferred on the Commission subject to the conditions laid down in this Article.\n2.   The power to adopt delegated acts referred to in Article 5 shall be conferred on the Commission for an indeterminate period of time.\n3.   The delegation of power referred to in Article 5 may be revoked at any time by the European Parliament or by the Council. A decision to revoke shall put an end to the delegation of the power specified in that decision. It shall take effect the day following the publication of the decision in the Official Journal of the European Union or at a later date specified therein. It shall not affect the validity of any delegated acts already in force.\n4.   As soon as it adopts a delegated act, the Commission shall notify it simultaneously to the European Parliament and to the Council.\n5.   A delegated act adopted pursuant to Article 5 shall enter into force only if no objection has been expressed either by the European Parliament or the Council within a period of two months of notification of that act to the European Parliament and the Council or if, before the expiry of that period, the European Parliament and the Council have both informed the Commission that they will not object. That period shall be extended by two months at the initiative of the European Parliament or of the Council.\nArticle 7\n1.   Before issuing an export authorisation for firearms, their parts and essential components and ammunition, the Member State concerned shall verify that:\n(a)\nthe importing third country has authorised the relevant import; and\n(b)\nthe third countries of transit, if any, have given notice in writing — and at the latest prior to shipment — that they have no objection to the transit. This provision does not apply:\n—\nto shipments by sea or air and through ports or airports of third countries provided that that there is no transhipment or change of means of transport,\n—\nin the case of temporary exports for verifiable lawful purposes, which include hunting, sport shooting, evaluation, exhibitions without sale, and repair.\n2.   Member States may decide that, if no objections to the transit are received within 20 working days from the day of the written request for no objection to the transit submitted by the exporter, the consulted third country of transit shall be regarded as having no objection to the transit.\n3.   The exporter shall supply the competent authority of the Member State responsible for issuing the export authorisation with the necessary documents proving that the importing third country has authorised the import and that the third country of transit had no objection to the transit.\n4.   Member States shall process applications for export authorisations within a period of time to be determined by national law or practice, which shall not exceed 60 working days, from the date on which all required information has been provided to the competent authorities. Under exceptional circumstances and for duly justified reasons, that period may be extended to 90 working days.\n5.   The period of validity of an export authorisation shall not exceed the period of validity of the import authorisation. Where the import authorisation does not specify a period of validity, except under exceptional circumstances and for duly justified reasons, the period of validity of an export authorisation shall be at least nine months.\n6.   Member States may decide to make use of electronic documents for the purpose of processing the applications for export authorisation.\nArticle 8\n1.   For the purpose of tracing, the export authorisation and the import licence or import authorisation issued by the importing third country and the accompanying documentation shall together contain information that includes:\n(a)\nthe dates of issue and expiry;\n(b)\nthe place of issue;\n(c)\nthe country of export;\n(d)\nthe country of import;\n(e)\nwhenever applicable, the third country or countries of transit;\n(f)\nthe consignee;\n(g)\nthe final recipient, if known at the time of the shipment;\n(h)\nparticulars enabling the identification of the firearms, their parts and essential components and ammunition, and the quantity thereof including, at the latest prior to the shipment, the marking applied to the firearms.\n2.   The information referred to in paragraph 1, if contained in the import licence or import authorisation, shall be provided by the exporter in advance to the third countries of transit, at the latest prior to the shipment.\nArticle 9\n1.   Simplified procedures for the temporary export or the re-export of firearms, their parts, essential components and ammunition shall apply as follows:\n(a)\nNo export authorisation shall be required for:\n(i)\nthe temporary export by hunters or sport shooters as part of their accompanied personal effects, during a journey to a third country, provided that they substantiate to the competent authorities the reasons for the journey, in particular by producing an invitation or other proof of the hunting or sport shooting activities in the third country of destination, of:\n—\none or more firearms,\n—\ntheir essential components, if marked, as well as parts,\n—\ntheir related ammunition, limited to a maximum of 800 rounds for hunters and a maximum of 1 200 rounds for sport shooters;\n(ii)\nthe re-export by hunters or sport shooters as part of their accompanied personal effects following temporary admission for hunting or sport shooting activities, provided that the firearms remain the property of a person established outside the customs territory of the Union and the firearms are re-exported to that person.\n(b)\nWhen leaving the customs territory of the Union through a Member State other than the Member State of their residence, hunters and sport shooters shall produce to the competent authorities a European Firearms Pass as provided for in Articles 1 and 12 of Directive 91/477/EEC. In the case of travel by air, the European Firearms Pass shall be produced to the competent authorities where the relevant items are handed over to the airline for transport out of the customs territory of the Union.\nWhen leaving the customs territory of the Union through the Member State of their residence, hunters and sport shooters may, instead of a European Firearms Pass, choose to produce another document considered valid for this purpose by the competent authorities of that Member State.\n(c)\nThe competent authorities of a Member State shall, for a period not exceeding 10 days, suspend the process of export or, if necessary, otherwise prevent firearms, their parts and essential components or ammunition from leaving the customs territory of the Union through that Member State, where they have grounds for suspicion that the reasons substantiated by hunters or sport shooters are not in conformity with the relevant considerations and the obligations laid down in Article 10. In exceptional circumstances and for duly justified reasons, the period referred to in this point may be extended to 30 days.\n2.   Member States shall, in accordance with national law, establish simplified procedures for:\n(a)\nthe re-export of firearms following temporary admission for evaluation or exhibition without sale, or inward processing for repair, provided that the firearms remain the property of a person established outside the customs territory of the Union and the firearms are re-exported to that person;\n(b)\nthe re-export of firearms, their parts and essential components and ammunition if they are held in temporary storage from the moment they enter the customs territory of the Union until their exit;\n(c)\nthe temporary export of firearms for the purpose of evaluation and repair and exhibition without sale, provided that the exporter substantiates the lawful possession of these firearms and exports them under the outward processing or temporary exportation customs procedures.\nArticle 10\n1.   In deciding whether to grant an export authorisation under this Regulation, Member States shall take into account all relevant considerations including, where appropriate:\n(a)\ntheir obligations and commitments as parties to the relevant international export control arrangements or relevant international treaties;\n(b)\nconsiderations of national foreign and security policy, including those covered by Common Position 2008/944/CFSP;\n(c)\nconsiderations as to intended end use, consignee, identified final recipient and the risk of diversion.\n2.   In addition to the relevant considerations set out in paragraph 1, when assessing an application for an export authorisation, Member States shall take into account the application by the exporter of proportionate and adequate means and procedures to ensure compliance with the provisions and objectives of this Regulation and with the terms and conditions of the authorisation.\nIn deciding whether to grant an export authorisation under this Regulation, Member States shall respect their obligations with regard to sanctions imposed by decisions adopted by the Council or by a decision of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) or by a binding resolution of the Security Council of the United Nations, in particular as regards arms embargoes.\nArticle 11\n1.   Member States shall:\n(a)\nrefuse to grant an export authorisation if the applicant has a criminal record concerning conduct constituting an offence listed in Article 2(2) of Council Framework Decision 2002/584/JHA of 13 June 2002 on the European arrest warrant and the surrender procedures between Member States (15), or concerning any other conduct provided that it constituted an offence punishable by a maximum deprivation of liberty of at least four years or a more serious penalty;\n(b)\nannul, suspend, modify or revoke an export authorisation if the conditions for granting it are not met or are no longer met.\nThis paragraph is without prejudice to stricter rules under national legislation.\n2.   Where Member States refuse, annul, suspend, modify or revoke an export authorisation, they shall notify the competent authorities of the other Member States thereof and share the relevant information with them. Where the competent authorities of a Member State have suspended an export authorisation, their final assessment shall be communicated to the other Member States at the end of the period of suspension.\n3.   Before the competent authorities of a Member State grant an export authorisation under this Regulation, they shall take into account all refusals under this Regulation of which they have been notified, in order to ascertain whether an authorisation has been refused by the competent authorities of another Member State or Member States for an essentially identical transaction (concerning an item with essentially identical parameters or technical characteristics and in respect of the same importer or consignee).\nThey may first consult the competent authorities of the Member State or Member States which issued refusals, annulments, suspensions, modifications or revocations under paragraphs 1 and 2. If, following such consultation, the competent authorities of the Member State decide to grant an authorisation, they shall notify the competent authorities of the other Member States, providing all relevant information to explain the decision.\n4.   All information shared in accordance with the provisions of this Article shall be in compliance with the provisions of Article 19(2) concerning its confidentiality.\nArticle 12\nIn accordance with their national law or practice in force, Member States shall keep, for not less than 20 years, all information relating to firearms and, where appropriate and feasible, their parts and essential components and ammunition, which is necessary to trace and identify those firearms, their parts and essential components and ammunition, and to prevent and detect illicit trafficking therein. That information shall include the place, dates of issue and expiry of the export authorisation; the country of export; the country of import; where applicable, the third country of transit; the consignee; the final recipient if known at the time of export; and the description and quantity of the items, including any markings applied to them.\nThis Article shall not apply to exports as referred to in Article 9.\nArticle 13\n1.   Member States shall, in case of suspicion, request the importing third country to confirm receipt of the dispatched shipment of firearms, their parts and essential components or ammunition.\n2.   Upon request of a third country of export which is a Party to the UN Firearms Protocol at the time of the export, Member States shall confirm the receipt within the customs territory of the Union of the dispatched shipment of firearms, their parts and essential components or ammunition, which shall be ensured in principle by producing the relevant customs importation documents.\n3.   Member States shall comply with paragraphs 1 and 2 in accordance with their national law or practice in force. In particular, with regard to exports, the competent authority of the Member State may decide either to address the exporter or to contact the importing third country directly.\nArticle 14\nMember States shall take such measures as may be necessary to ensure that their authorisation procedures are secure and that the authenticity of authorisation documents can be verified or validated.\nVerification and validation may also, where appropriate, be ensured by means of diplomatic channels.\nArticle 15\nIn order to ensure that this Regulation is properly applied, Member States shall take necessary and proportionate measures to enable their competent authorities to:\n(a)\ngather information on any order or transaction involving firearms, their parts and essential components and ammunition; and\n(b)\nestablish that the export control measures are being properly applied, which may, in particular, include the power to enter the premises of persons with an interest in an export transaction.\nArticle 16\nMember States shall lay down the rules on penalties applicable to infringements of this Regulation and shall take all measures necessary to ensure that they are implemented. The penalties provided for must be effective, proportionate and dissuasive.\nCHAPTER III\nCUSTOMS FORMALITIES\nArticle 17\n1.   When completing customs formalities for the export of firearms, their parts and essential components or ammunition at the customs office of export, the exporter shall furnish proof that any necessary export authorisation has been obtained.\n2.   The exporter may be required to provide a translation into an official language of the Member State where the export declaration is presented of any documents furnished as proof.\n3.   Without prejudice to any powers conferred on them under Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92, Member States shall, for a period not exceeding 10 days, suspend the process of export from their territory or, if necessary, otherwise prevent firearms, their parts and essential components or ammunition which are covered by a valid export authorisation from leaving the customs territory of the Union through their territory, where they have grounds for suspicion that:\n(a)\nrelevant information was not taken into account when the authorisation was granted; or\n(b)\ncircumstances have materially changed since the authorisation was granted.\nIn exceptional circumstances and for duly substantiated reasons, that period may be extended to 30 days.\n4.   Within the period or extended period referred to in paragraph 3, Member States shall either release the firearms, their parts and essential components or ammunition, or take action pursuant to Article 11(1)(b).\nArticle 18\n1.   Member States may provide that customs formalities for the export of firearms, their parts and essential components or ammunition can be completed only at customs offices empowered to that end.\n2.   Member States availing themselves of the option set out in paragraph 1 shall inform the Commission of the duly empowered customs offices or of subsequent changes thereto. The Commission shall publish and update that information on a yearly basis in the C series of the Official Journal of the European Union.\nCHAPTER IV\nADMINISTRATIVE COOPERATION\nArticle 19\n1.   Member States shall, in cooperation with the Commission and in accordance with Article 21(2), take all appropriate measures to establish direct cooperation and exchange of information between competent authorities with a view to enhancing the efficiency of the measures established by this Regulation. Such information may include:\n(a)\ndetails of exporters whose application for an authorisation is refused, or of exporters who are the subject of decisions taken by Member States pursuant to Article 11;\n(b)\ndata on consignees or other actors involved in suspicious activities, and, where available, routes taken.\n2.   Council Regulation (EC) No 515/97 (16) on mutual assistance, and in particular the provisions thereof as to the confidentiality of information, shall apply mutatis mutandis to measures under this Article, without prejudice to Article 20 of this Regulation.\nCHAPTER V\nGENERAL AND FINAL PROVISIONS\nArticle 20\n1.   A Firearms Exports Coordination Group (the ‘Coordination Group’) chaired by a representative of the Commission shall be set up. Each Member State shall appoint a representative to it.\nThe Coordination Group shall examine any question concerning the application of this Regulation which may be raised either by the Chair or by a representative of a Member State.

strive to ensure the visibility of the nature of the authorisation on the form issued.\nThis is an export authorisation valid in all Member States of the European Union until its expiry date.", "summary": "Firearms — combating illicit manufacture and trafficking\nFirearms — combating illicit manufacture and trafficking\nSUMMARY OF:\nRegulation (EU) No 258/2012: implementing the United Nations’ Protocol against the illicit manufacturing of and trafficking in firearms\nSUMMARY\nWHAT DOES THIS REGULATION DO?\nIt lays down rules on exporting, importing and transporting firearms, their parts and components, and ammunition.\nIt therefore implements Article 10 (which deals with imports, exports and transit of firearms) of the United Nations Protocol against the Illicit Manufacturing of and Trafficking in Firearms, their Parts and Components and Ammunition.\nKEY POINTS\nAnnex I to this regulation contains a list of the firearms, their parts and ammunition that require export authorisation. The European Commission has the power to amend this list.\nThe relevant authority of the EU country where a prospective exporter is based may grant export authorisation upon receiving an export authorisation form from that exporter.\nWhen exporting firearms, their parts and ammunition outside the EU, an exporter must provide the relevant authority in its own EU country with authorisation from the non-EU country receiving the shipment, and from any non-EU countries through which the shipment will pass. The authority must then process the export authorisation application within 60 days.\nFor traceability purposes, export and import authorisations and their accompanying documentation must contain information including, for example:\nthe place and date of issue,\nthe expiry date,\nboth the country of export and import,\ntransit countries,\nthe final recipient, and\na description of and quantity of the firearms, their parts and ammunition.\nSimplified procedures exist for firearms, their parts and ammunition used for hunting and sports shooting.\nWhen deciding whether to grant an export authorisation, EU countries must take into account considerations such as:\ninternational treaties and\nnational foreign and security policy.\nEU countries also need to take account of considerations covered by Council Common Position 2008/994/CFSP which defines EU rules on the control of exports of military technology and equipment. These include aspects such as:\nrisk that the intended recipient would use the military technology or equipment to be exported aggressively against another country or to assert by force a territorial claim, or\nrisk that the military technology or equipment would be diverted within the buyer country or re-exported under undesirable conditions.\nEU countries must refuse to grant export authorisation if the applicant has a criminal record. In addition, they must annul, suspend, modify or revoke the authorisation if the conditions are no longer met.\nThe regulation does not apply to antique or deactivated firearms, or to firearms intended for military or police use.\nFROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?\n              \nIt has applied since 30 September 2013.\nBACKGROUND\n              \nThe UN’s Protocol against the Illicit Manufacturing of and Trafficking in Firearms, their Parts and Components and Ammunition is the only legally binding instrument on small arms at global level. It establishes a set of rules for countries to control and regulate illicit firearms and arms trafficking, prevent their diversion into crime, and facilitate the investigation and prosecution of related offences without hampering legitimate trade.\nThe Protocol supplements the UN Convention against Transnational Organised Crime.\nFor more information, see ‘Trafficking in firearms’ on the European Commission’s website\nACT\n            \nRegulation (EU) No 258/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 14 March 2012 implementing Article 10 of the United Nations’ Protocol against the illicit manufacturing of and trafficking in firearms, their parts and components and ammunition, supplementing the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organised Crime (UN Firearms Protocol), and establishing export authorisation, and import and transit measures for firearms, their parts and components and ammunition (OJ L 94, 30.3.2012, pp. 1–15)\nRELATED ACTS\n            \nCouncil Common Position 2008/944/CFSP of 8 December 2008 defining common rules governing control of exports of military technology and equipment (OJ L 335, 13.12.2008, p. 99–103)\nlast update 21.04.2016", "tags": ["customs formalities", "export licence", "import licence", "UNO", "protocol to an agreement", "illicit trade", "export (EU)", "import (EU)", "firearms and munitions", "transit"], "subjects": ["Common foreign and security policy", "Protocol on Ireland/Northern Ireland"], "split": "test", "reference_annotations": {"32012R0258_p3": {"text": "(5)  COM(2005) 329.
