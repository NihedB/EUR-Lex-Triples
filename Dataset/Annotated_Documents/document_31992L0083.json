 Whereas Directive 92/84/EEC (5) lays down minimum rates of excise duty to be applied in the Member States to alcohol and alcoholic beverages;  Whereas it is important to the proper functioning of the internal market to determine common definitions for all the products concerned;  Whereas it is useful to base such definitions on those set out in the combined nomenclature in force at the date of the adoption of this Directive;  Whereas, in the case of beer, it is possible to permit alternative methods of calculating the duty on the finished product;  Whereas, in the case of beer, it is possible within certain limits to permit Member States to apply the duty to gravity bands of more than one degree Plato, provided always that no beer is charged at less than the Community minimum rate;  Whereas, in the case of beer produced in small independent breweries and ethyl alcohol produced in small distilleries, common solutions are required permitting Member States to apply reduced rates of duty to those products;  Whereas it is possible to permit variations in the strength at which Member States commence to subject beer to duty, provided that no unacceptable problems are caused in the internal market;  Whereas in the case of beer, wine and other fermented berages it is advisable to permit Member States to exempt from duty home-made products which are not produced for commercial purposes;  Whereas, in principle, Member States should apply a single rate per hectolitre of finished product to all still wine and other still fermented beverages, and a single rate of duty per hectolitre of finished product to all sparkling wine and sparkling  fermented beverages;  Whereas it is advisable to permit Member States to apply reduced rates of duty to all kinds of wine and other fermented beverages provided always that the actual alcoholic strength of the products does not exceed 8,5 % vol.;  Whereas Member States applying a higher rate of duty to certain wines on 1 January 1992 should be permitted to continue to do so;  Whereas in principle, Member States should apply a single rate of duty per hectolitre of finished product to all intermediate products;  Whereas it is advisable to permit Member States to apply a reduced rate of the intermediate products duty, on the one hand to products of strengths not exceeding 15 % vol., and on the other hand to natural sweet wines;  Whereas, in principle, Member States should apply the same rate of duty per hectolitre of pure alcohol to all ethyl alcohol as defined in this Directive;  Whereas it is possible to permit Member States to apply reduced rates or exemptions for certain products of a regional and traditional nature;  Whereas, in the cases where Member States are permitted to apply reduced rates, such reduced rates should not cause distortion of competition within the internal market;  Whereas Member States should be permitted to refund the excise duty on alcoholic drinks which have become unfit for consumption;  Whereas it is necessary to lay down at Community level the exemptions which apply to goods which are transported between Member States;  Whereas, however, it is possible to permit Member States an option to apply exemptions tied to end-uses within their territory;  Whereas it is necessary to provide for a system of notification of the denaturing requirements of each Member State for completely denatured alcohol, and for their acceptance by other Member States;  Whereas Member States should not be deprived of the means of combating any evaision, avoidance or abuse which may arise in the field of exemptions;  Whereas Member States should be permitted to give effect to the exemptions required by this Directive by way of refund;  Whereas, since certain Member States apply a higher rate of duty to 'other sparkling fermented beverages' than to intermediate products, they should be permitted to apply this higher rate to intermediate products having the characteristics of these  'other sparkling fermented beverages',  HAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:  SECTION I  BEER  Scope   Article 1  1. Member States shall apply an excise duty to beer in accordance with this Directive.  2. Member States shall fix their rates in accordance with Directive 92/84/EEC.  Article 2  For the purposes of this Directive, the term 'beer' covers any product falling within CN code 2203 or any product containing a mixture of beer with non-alcoholic drinks falling within CN code 2206, in either case with an actual alcoholic  strength by volume exceeding 0,5 % vol.  Establishment of the duty   Article 3  1. The excise duty levied by Member States on beer shall be fixed by reference either:  - to the number of hectolitre/degrees Plato,  or  - to the number of hectolitre/degrees of actual alcoholic strength by volume  of finished product.  2. In assessing the charge to duty on beer in accordance with the requirements of Directive 92/84/EEC, Member States may ignore fractions of a degree Plato or degree of actual alcoholic strength by volume.  In addition, Member States which levy the duty by reference to the number of hectolitre/degrees Plato may divide beer into categories consisting of no more than four degrees Plato per category and charge the same rate of duty per hectolitre on all beers  falling within each category. Such rates shall invariably equal or exceed the minimum rate laid down in Article 6 of Directive 92/84/EEC, hereinafter referred to as the minimum rate.  Article 4  1. Member States may apply reduced rates of duty, which may be differentiated in accordance with the annual production of the breweries concerned, to beer brewed by independent small breweries within the following limits:  - the reduced rates shall not be applied to undertakings producing more than 200 000 hl of beer per year,  - the reduced rates, which may fall below the minimum rate, shall not be set more than 50 % below the standard national rate of excise duty.  2. For the purposes of the reduced rates the term 'independent small brewery' shall mean a brewery which is legally and economically independent of any other brewery, which uses premises situated physically apart from those of any other brewery and does  not operate under licence. However, where two or more small breweries cooperate, and their combined annual production does not exceed 200 000 hl, those breweries may be treated as a single independent small brewery.  3. Member States shall ensure that any reduced rates they may introduce apply equally to beer delivered into their territory from independent small breweries situated in other Member States. In particular they shall ensure that no individual delivery  from another Member States ever bears more duty than its exact national equivalent.  Article 5  1. Member States may apply reduced rates, which may fall below the minimum rate, for beer with an actual alcoholic strength by volume not exceeding 2,8 % vol.  2. Member States may confine the application of this Article to products containing a mixture of beer with non-alcoholic drinks falling within CN code 2206.  Article 6  Subject to such conditions as they shall lay down to ensure the straigthforward application of the exemption, Member States may exempt from excise duty beer produced by a private individual and consumed by the producer, members of his family  or his guests, provided that no sale is involved.

The term 'sparkling wine' covers all products falling within CN codes 2204 10, 2204 21 10, 2204 29 10 and 2205:  - are contained in bottles with 'mushroom stoppers' held in place by ties or fastenings, or they have an excess pressure due to carbon dioxide in solution of three bar or more,  - have an actual alcoholic strength by volume exceeding 1,2 % vol. but not exceeding 15 % vol., provided that the alcohol contained in the finished product is entirely of fermented origin.  Establishment of the duty   Article 9  1. The excise duty levied by Member States on wine shall be fixed by reference to the number of hectolitres of finished product.  2. Except as provided in paragraphs 3 and 4, Member States shall levy the same rate of excise duty on all products chargeable with the duty on still wine. Similarly, they shall levy the same rate of excise duty on products chargeable with the duty on  sparkling wine. they may apply the same rate of duty to both still and sparkling wine.  3. Member States may apply reduced rates of excise duty to any type of still wine and sparkling wine of an actual alcoholic strength by volume not exceeding 8,5 % vol.  4. Member States which on 1 January 1992 applied a higher rate of duty to still wines as defined in Article (8) (1), second indent, may continue to apply this rate. This higher rate must not be more than the standard national rate applied to  intermediate products.  Article 10  Subject to such conditions as they shall lay down to ensure the straigthforward application of this Article, Member States may exempt from excise duty wine produced by a private individual and consumed by the producer, members of his family  or his guests, provided no sale is involved.

Member States may exempt the products covered by this Directive from the harmonized excise duty under conditions which they shall lay down for the purpose of ensuring the correct and straightforward application of such exemptions and of preventing  any evasion, avoidance or abuse, when used:  (a) as samples for analysis, for necessary production tests, or for scientific purposes;  (b) for scientific research;  (c) for medical purposes in hospitals and pharmacies;  (d) in a manufacturing process provided that the final product does not contain alcohol;  (e) in the manufacture of a component product which is not subject to excise duty under this Directive.  3. Before 1 January 1993 and three months before any intended subsequent change in national law, each Member State shall communicate to the Commission, together with all relevant information, the denaturants which it intends to employ for the purposes  of paragraph 1 (a). The Commission shall transmit the communications to the other Member States within one month of receipt.  4. If, within two months of the other Member States being informed, neither the Commission nor any Member State has requested that the matter be raised in the Council, the Council shall be deemed to have authorized the denaturing processes notified. If  an objection is raised within the time limit, a decision shall be taken in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 24 of Directive 92/12/EEC.  5. If a Member State finds that a product which has been exempted under paragraphs 1 (a) or 1 (b) above gives rise to evasion, avoidance or abuse, it may refuse to grant exemption or withdraw the relief already granted. The Member State shall advise the  Commission forthwith. The Commission shall transmit the communication to the other Member States within one month of receipt. A final decision shall then be taken in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 24 of Directive 92/12/EEC. Member  States shall not be obliged to give retroactive effet to such a decision.  6. Member States shall be free to give effect to the exemptions mentioned above by means of a refund of excise duty paid.  Article 28  The United Kingdom may continue to apply the exemptions which it applied on 1 January 1992 to the following products:  - concentrated malt beverage the worts of which prior to fermentation were of a specific gravity of 1 200 of Original Gravity (47° Plato) or more;  - aromatic bitters of an actual alcoholic strength from 44,2 to 49,2 % vol., containing from 1,5 % to 6 % by weight of gentian, spices and other aromatic ingredients and from 4 to 10 % by weight of sugar, delivered in containers holding 0,2 litres or  less of product.  SECTION VIII  FINAL PROVISIONS   Article 29  1. Member States shall bring into force the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive not later than 31 December 1992. They shall forthwith inform the Commission thereof.  When Member States adopt these measures, they shall contain a reference to this Directive or shall be accompanied by such reference on the occasion of their official publication. The methods of making such reference shall be laid down by the Member  States.  2. Member States shall communicate to the Commission the texts of the main provisions of national law which they adopt in the field governed by this Directive.

(increased to 3.5% vol. from 1 January 2022, by amending Directive (EU) 2020/1151).\nFor sweetened or flavoured beer, amending Directive (EU) 2020/1151 lays down a harmonised approach for measuring the degrees Plato. This is to ensure that the ingredients of the beer added after fermentation are taken into account for the purpose of measuring the degrees Plato. The amending directive allows EU countries which, on 29 July 2020, had not taken into account the ingredients of the beer added after fermentation for the purposes of measuring the degrees Plato, to continue to use the currently applied methodology for a transitional period until 31 December 2030.\nWine, other fermented drinks and intermediate products\nIn relation to these products, Directive 92/83/EEC sets the following rules.\nThe duty levied on still and sparkling wine and other fermented drinks (e.g. cider and perry) and intermediate products (e.g. port and sherry) is based on the number of hectolitres of the finished product.\nEU countries must levy the same rate of duty within each category of drink.\nA reduced rate of excise duty can be applied to any type of wine and other fermented drinks with a maximum alcoholic strength by volume of 8.5% vol.\nEU countries may apply a single reduced rate to intermediate products with a maximum alcoholic strength by volume of 15% vol. if this rate is: not more than 40% below the standard national rate;not less than the standard rate applied to still wine and other still fermented drinks.\nAmending Directive (EU) 2020/1151 allows:\nEU countries to apply reduced rates of duty to wine produced by independent small wine producers within the following limits: the reduced rates must not be applied to undertakings producing on average more than 1,000 hl or, in the case of Malta, on average more than 20,000 hl of wine per yearthe reduced rates must not be set more than 50% below the standard national rate of excise duty;\nEU countries to apply reduced rates of duty to independent small producers within the following limits: up to 15,000 hl for other fermented beverages andup to 250 hl for intermediate products.\nSpirits\nThe main rules under Directive 92/83/EEC are the following.\nThe duty levied on pure alcohol and spirit drinks is calculated per hectolitre of pure alcohol, when measured at a temperature of 20°C.\nReduced rates may be applied to ethyl alcohol (ethanol) produced by small distilleries producing up to 10 hl of pure alcohol per year; however, this may not be more than 50% below the standard national rate of excise duty.\nEU countries must apply any such reduced rates equally to ethanol originating from small distilleries in other EU countries.\nWith regard to spirits, Directive (EU) 2020/1151 amends the rules allowing certain EU countries to apply a reduced rate to ethanol produced in fruit growers’ distilleries from fruit (such as apples, pears, grape marc and berries).\nExemptions\nUnder conditions that EU countries lay down to ensure correct and straightforward application of the exemptions and to prevent any evasion, avoidance or abuse, Directive 92/83/EEC permits products to be exempt from excise duty if they are:\ndenatured* in accordance with the requirements of any EU country;\ndenatured and used to make products not intended for human consumption;\nused to produce vinegar, medicines, foodstuffs or food flavourings.\nFrom 1 January 2022, amending Directive (EU) 2020/1151:\nrequires EU countries to exempt from excise duty completely denatured alcohol which was completely denatured in another EU country, in accordance with the method authorised by that other country;\npermits EU countries, under a number of conditions, to exempt from harmonised excise duty products covered by Directive 92/83/EEC when they are used in the manufacture of food supplements (under Directive 2002/46/EC relating to food supplements — see summary);\nclarifies the procedures for the notification of changes to the requirements for the complete denaturing of alcohol.\nIntroduction of a new common certification system for independent small producers of all types of alcohols and alcoholic drinks\nAmending Directive (EU) 2020/1151:\nintroduces a common certification system in the EU for confirming the status of independent small producers, recognisable in all EU countries;\ngives the European Commission the power to adopt implementing acts setting out the detailed rules concerning this certificate.\nList of excise duties rates\nTwice a year, the Commission publishes a full list of excise duty rates in force in EU countries.\nFROM WHEN DO THE DIRECTIVES APPLY?\nDirective 92/83/EEC has applied since 10 November 1992 and had to become law in the EU countries by 31 December 1992.\nAmending Directive (EU) 2020/1151 has to become law in the EU countries by 31 December 2021.
