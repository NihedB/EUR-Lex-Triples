{"celex_id": "32008R0106", "reference": "13.2.2008\nEN\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\nL 39/1\nREGULATION (EC) No 106/2008 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL\nof 15 January 2008\non a Community energy-efficiency labelling programme for office equipment\n(recast version)\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 175(1) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the Commission,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee (1),\nAfter consulting the Committee of the Regions,\nActing in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty (2),\nWhereas:\n(1)\nA number of substantial amendments are to be made to Regulation (EC) No 2422/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 November 2001 on a Community energy efficiency labelling programme for office equipment (3). For reasons of clarity, that Regulation should be recast.\n(2)\nOffice equipment accounts for a significant share of total electricity consumption. The various models available on the Community market have very different levels of energy consumption for similar functionalities and there is significant potential for optimising their energy efficiency.\n(3)\nImproving the energy efficiency of office equipment should contribute to improving the competitiveness of the Community and the security of its energy supply and to protecting the environment and consumers.\n(4)\nIt is important to promote measures aimed at the proper functioning of the internal market.\n(5)\nIt is desirable to coordinate the national energy-efficiency labelling initiatives to minimise the adverse impact on industry and trade of the measures taken to implement them.\n(6)\nSince the objective of the proposed action, namely to establish the rules for the Community energy-efficiency labelling programme for office equipment, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve this objective.\n(7)\nThe Protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change agreed in Kyoto on 11 December 1997 calls for a reduction in the greenhouse gas emissions of the Community of 8 % at the latest during the period 2008 to 2012. In order to achieve this objective, stronger measures are required to reduce carbon dioxide emissions within the Community.\n(8)\nFurthermore, Decision No 2179/98/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 September 1998 on the review of the European Community programme of policy and action in relation to the environment and sustainable development ‘Towards sustainability’ (4) indicated as a key priority for the integration of environmental requirements in relation to energy the provision of energy efficiency labelling of appliances.\n(9)\nThe Council Resolution of 7 December 1998 on energy efficiency in the European Community (5) called for the increased use of labelling of appliances and equipment.\n(10)\nIt is desirable to coordinate energy-efficiency requirements, labels and test methods wherever appropriate.\n(11)\nMost energy-efficient office equipment is available at little or no extra cost and may therefore in many cases pay for any additional cost through electricity savings within a reasonably short time. Energy-saving and carbon dioxide reduction objectives can therefore be achieved in a cost-effective manner in this area, without disadvantages for consumers or industry.\n(12)\nOffice equipment is traded worldwide. The Agreement of 20 December 2006 between the Government of the United States of America and the European Community on the coordination of energy-efficiency labelling programmes for office equipment (6) (hereinafter the Agreement) should facilitate international trade and environmental protection for this equipment. The Agreement should be implemented in the Community.\n(13)\nThe Energy Star energy-efficiency label is used worldwide. In order to influence the requirements of the Energy Star labelling programme, the Community should participate in the programme and in drawing up the necessary technical specifications. When setting those technical specifications together with the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA), the Commission should aim at ambitious levels of energy efficiency, in view of the Community's policy of energy efficiency and its energy-efficiency targets.\n(14)\nAn effective enforcement system is necessary to ensure that the energy-efficiency labelling programme for office equipment is implemented properly, guarantees fair conditions of competition for producers and protects consumer rights.\n(15)\nThis Regulation should apply only to office equipment.\n(16)\nCouncil Directive 92/75/EEC of 22 September 1992 on the indication by labelling and standard product information of the consumption of energy and other resources by household appliances (7) is not the most appropriate instrument for office equipment. The most cost-effective measure for promoting the energy efficiency of office equipment is a voluntary labelling programme.\n(17)\nThe task of contributing to setting and reviewing the common technical specifications should be assigned to an appropriate body, the European Community Energy Star Board, in order to achieve efficient, neutral implementation of the energy-efficiency labelling programme. That Board should be composed of national representatives and representatives of interested parties.\n(18)\nIt is necessary to ensure that the energy-efficiency labelling programme for office equipment is consistent and coordinated with the priorities of the Community policy and with other Community labelling or quality-certification schemes such as those established by Directive 92/75/EEC and by Council Regulation (EEC) No 880/92 of 23 March 1992 on a Community eco-label award scheme (8).\n(19)\nThe energy-efficiency labelling programme should also complement measures taken in the context of Directive 2005/32/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 July 2005 establishing a framework for the setting of ecodesign requirements for energy-using products (9). It is therefore necessary to ensure that the Energy Star programme and the ecodesign scheme are consistent and coordinated.\n(20)\nIt is desirable to coordinate the Community Energy Star programme based on the Agreement and other voluntary energy-efficiency labelling schemes for office equipment in the Community in order to prevent confusion for consumers and potential market distortion.\n(21)\nIt is necessary to guarantee transparency in implementation of the Energy Star programme and to ensure its consistency with relevant international standards in order to facilitate access to, and participation in, the scheme for manufacturers and exporters from countries outside the Community.\n(22)\nThis Regulation takes into account the experience gained during the initial period of implementation of the Energy Star programme in the Community,\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nArticle 1\nObjective\nThis Regulation establishes the rules for the Community energy-efficiency labelling programme for office equipment (hereinafter referred to as the Energy Star programme) as defined in the Agreement.\nArticle 2\nScope\nThis Regulation shall apply to the office equipment product groups defined in Annex C to the Agreement, subject to any amendment thereof in accordance with Article XII of the Agreement.\nArticle 3\nDefinitions\nFor the purposes of this Regulation the following definitions shall apply:\n(a)\n‘Common Logo’ shall mean the mark depicted in Annex A to the Agreement;\n(b)\n‘programme participants’ shall mean manufacturers, assemblers, exporters, importers, retailers and other persons or bodies that commit themselves to promoting designated energy-efficient office equipment products that meet the Common Specifications defined in point (c) and that have chosen to participate in the Energy Star programme by having registered with the Commission;\n(c)\n‘Common Specifications’ shall mean the energy-efficiency and performance requirements, including testing methods, used to determine qualification of energy-efficient office equipment products for the Common Logo.\nArticle 4\nGeneral principles\n1.

The agreement expired on 20 February 2018.\nKEY POINTS\n              \nThe Energy Star programme contributed to the Union´s energy-efficiency targets in Directive 2012/27/EU, and was coordinated with the mandatory EU energy labelling rules, as well as with voluntary schemes such as the EU Ecolabel award scheme.\nThis coordination included the exchange of evidence and the setting of common levels of specifications and requirements across the different schemes. Other existing and new voluntary energy-efficiency labelling schemes for office equipment products in EU countries co-existed with the Energy Star programme.\nApplicants\nSince the EU-US agreement expired, new applications to the European Commission for the participation in the scheme to display the Energy Start logo on poducts and promotional material are not possible any more. Participants who previously qualified products through the European Union will only be able to have products certified as ENERGY STAR compliant through the US ENERGY STAR program (provided their models are available in the US and/or Canada, Switzerland or Taiwan, or, in Japan and labelled as a result of certification through the Japanese ENERGY STAR Program).\nProducts that were only self-certified under the EU ENERGY STAR Programme can keep the logo on the product and on the packaging until exhaustion of stocks. No new advertisement shall use the logo and it shall be eliminated by websites exhibiting it.\nPromotion of high energy-efficient products in the EU\nHigh energy-efficient performance for office equipment, creation of new jobs and market opportunities for manufacturers are now promoted in the EU in particular by the Ecodesign Directive 2009/125/EC, the Energy Labelling Regulation (EU) 2017/1369 and the Energy Efficiency Directive 2012/27/EU.\nWHEN DOES THIS REGULATION APPLY\n              \nRegulation (EU) No 174/2013[1] amended Regulation (EC) No 106/2008 and was applicable until 20 February 2018.\nBACKGROUND\n              \nFor more information, see:\nEnergy Star Programme (European Commission)\nEnergy-efficient products (European Commission).\nMAIN DOCUMENT\n            \nRegulation (EU) No 174/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 5 February 2013 amending Regulation (EC) No 106/2008 on a Community energy-efficiency labelling programme for office equipment Text with EEA relevance (OJ L 63, 6.3.2013, pp. 1-4)\nRELATED DOCUMENTS\n            \nRegulation (EU) 2017/1369 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 4 July 2017 setting a framework for energy labelling and repealing Directive 2010/30/EU (OJ L 198, 28.7.2017, pp. 1-23)\nCouncil Decision 2013/107/EU of 13 November 2012 on the signing and conclusion of the Agreement between the Government of the United States of America and the European Union on the coordination of energy-efficiency labelling programmes for office equipment Text with EEA relevance (OJ L 63, 6.3.2013, pp. 5-80)\nDirective 2012/27/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 October 2012 on energy efficiency, amending Directives 2009/125/EC and 2010/30/EU and repealing Directives 2004/8/EC and 2006/32/EC (OJ L 315, 14.11.2012, pp. 1-56)\nSee consolidated version.\nRegulation (EC) No 66/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 November 2009 on the EU Ecolabel (OJ L 27, 30.1.2010, pp. 1-19)\nSee consolidated version.\nDirective 2009/125/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 October 2009 establishing a framework for the setting of ecodesign requirements for energy-related products (OJ L 285, 31.10.2009, pp. 10-35)\nSee consolidated version.\nRegulation (EC) No 106/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 January 2008 on a Community energy-efficiency labelling programme for office equipment (recast version) (OJ L 39, 13.2.2008, pp. 1-7)\nCouncil Resolution of 7 December 1998 on energy efficiency in the European Community (OJ C 394, 17.12.1998, pp. 1-3)\nlast update 23.07.2018", "tags": ["energy consumption", "technical specification", "EU programme", "office supplies", "eco-label", "United States", "labelling"], "subjects": ["Consumer protection", "Protocol on Ireland/Northern Ireland", "Information and verification", "Technical barriers", "Internal market - Principles"], "split": "train", "reference_annotations": {}, "summary_annotations": {"32008R0106_p1": {"text": "regulation 174/2013[1] amended regulation 106/2008 and was applicable until 20 February 2018.", "triples": [" regulation 174/2013,  amended,  regulation 106/2008"]}, "32008R0106_p2": {"text": "regulation 174/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 5 February 2013 amending regulation 106/2008 on a Community energy-efficiency labelling programme for office equipment Text with EEA relevance (OJ L 63, 6.3.2013, pp. 1-4)", "triples": [" regulation 174/2013,  amending,  regulation 106/2008"]}, "32008R0106_p3": {"text": "regulation 2017/1369 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 4 July 2017 setting a framework for energy labelling and repealing directive 2010/30/eu (OJ L 198, 28.7.2017, pp. 1-23)", "triples": [" regulation 2017/1369,  repealing,  directive 2010/30/eu"]}, "32008R0106_p4": {"text": "directive 2012/27/eu of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 October 2012 on energy efficiency, amending directive 2009/125/ec directive 2010/30/eu and repealing directive 2004/8/ec directive 2006/32/ec (OJ L 315, 14.11.2012, pp. 1-56)", "triples": [" directive 2012/27/eu,  amending,  directive 2009/125/ec", " directive 2012/27/eu,  amending,  directive 2010/30/eu", " directive 2012/27/eu,  repealing,  directive 2004/8/ec", " directive 2012/27/eu,  repealing,  directive 2006/32/ec"]}}}
