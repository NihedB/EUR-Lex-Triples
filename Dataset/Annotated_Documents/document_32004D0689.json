The Council stressed that this kind of cooperation should cover all forms of social protection and, where necessary, help the Member States to improve and strengthen their social protection systems in accordance with their national priorities. It also recalled the competence of the Member States for the organisation and financing of social protection and endorsed the four broad objectives within the overall challenge of modernising social protection systems as identified by the Commission: namely to make work pay and provide secure income, to make pensions safe and pension systems sustainable, to promote social inclusion and to ensure high quality and sustainable health care; it also underlined that equality between women and men must be mainstreamed in all activities aiming at these four objectives. Finally, the Council recognised that the aspects relating to finance are common to all the objectives.\n(4)\nThe Conclusions of the Lisbon European Council on 23 and 24 March 2000 acknowledged the importance of social protection in further developing and modernising an active and dynamic welfare state in Europe, and called upon the Council to strengthen cooperation between Member States by exchanging experiences and best practice on the basis of improved information networks.\n(5)\nAt Nice and at its subsequent meetings, the European Council has regularly endorsed the work done by the Social Protection Committee in promoting the Community policy exchange on social protection.\n(6)\nThe Social Protection Committee set up by Council Decision 2000/436/EC of 29 June 2000 (3) has clearly demonstrated its utility as an advisory body for both the Council and the Commission and has contributed actively to the development of the Open Method of Coordination, as established in the Lisbon European Council.\n(7)\nFollowing the entry into force of the Treaty of Nice on 1 February 2003, a Social Protection Committee with additional tasks should replace the existing Committee of the same name, in order to permit the work already done by the latter to be continued. Decision 2000/436/EC should therefore be repealed as from the date on which the new Social Protection Committee takes up its functions,\nHAS DECIDED AS FOLLOWS:\nArticle 1\n1.

The aim of this communication was to reflect on the importance of the convergence of social protection objectives and policies and to reaffirm the place of this social protection among the common values of the European Union (EU).\nThe Social Protection Committee was set up to promote cooperation on social protection policies between Member States and the Commission. Its main objectives are to:\nmake work pay and provide secure income;\nmake pensions safe and pension systems sustainable;\npromote social inclusion;\nensure high-quality and sustainable health care.\nThe Social Protection Committee, which has an advisory role, consists of two representatives appointed by each Member State and two representatives of the Commission. It may also establish appropriate contacts with the social partners and social non-governmental organisations.\nThe new Committee retains all the tasks of the former Social Protection Committee, namely:\nmonitoring the social situation and the development of social protection policies in the Member States and the Community;\nexchanges of information, experience and good practice;\npreparing reports, formulating opinions or undertaking other work within its fields of competence, at the request of either the Council or the Commission or on its own initiative.\nIn practice, since its foundation, the Committee's work has been largely determined by the strategic objective which the Union set itself in terms of socio-economic progress at the Lisbon European Council in March 2000: \"to become the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world, capable of sustainable economic growth with more and better jobs and greater social cohesion\".\nBackground\nThe legal basis for the Social Protection Committee is Article 144 of the Treaty of Nice, which provides for the creation of a new Social Protection Committee to promote cooperation on social protection policies between the Member States and the Commission. The purpose of the decision to replace the former committee with this one is essentially procedural - to establish the Committee in line with the new legal basis.\nReferences\nAct\nEntry into force\nDeadline for transposition in the Member States\nOfficial Journal\nDecision 2004/689/EC\n--\n--\nOfficial Journal L 314 of 13.10.2004\nRELATED ACTS\nCouncil Decision 2000/436/EC of 29 June 2000 setting up a Social Protection Committee [COM(2000) 436, Official Journal L 172 of 12.07.2000].\n               On 29 June 2000, the Council approved the Commission's proposal to help Member States to improve and strengthen their social protection systems. In this communication, the Commission proposes to begin a new phase in the process of examining social protection systems at Community level. To this end, the Council supported the Commission's suggestion to establish a mechanism for enhanced cooperation brought about by the work of the group of high-level officials for the improvement of social protection systems. This group of officials laid the foundations of the Social Protection Committee.\nThe Social Protection Committee has clearly shown its usefulness as an advisory body for both the Council and the Commission, and it has been actively involved in developing the open method of coordination as defined by the Lisbon European Council.\nLast updated: 01.03.2005", "tags": ["European social policy", "social security", "committee (EU)"], "subjects": ["Provisions governing the Institutions", "Social provisions"], "split": "train", "reference_annotations": {}, "summary_annotations": {"32004D0689_p1": {"text": "Council decision 2004/689/ec of 4 October 2004 establishing a Social Protection Committee and repealing decision 2000/436/ec [Official Journal L 314 of 13.10.2004].", "triples": [" decision 2004/689/ec,  repealing,  decision 2000/436/ec"]}}}
