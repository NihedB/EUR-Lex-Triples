The special provisions relating to agricultural products are set out in Chapter II of this Decision.Article 31. This Chapter shall apply to goods:- produced in the Community or Turkey, including those wholly or partially obtained or produced from products coming from third countries which are in free circulation in the Community or in Turkey,- coming from third countries and in free circulation in the Community or in Turkey.2. Products from third countries shall be considered to be in free circulation in the Community or in Turkey if the import formalities have been complied with and any customs duties or charges having equivalent effect which are payable have been levied in the Community or in Turkey, and if they have not benefited from a total or partial reimbursement of such duties or charges.3. The customs territory of the Customs Union shall comprise:- the customs territory of the Community as defined in Article 3 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 of 12 October 1992 establishing the Community Customs Code (1),- the customs territory of Turkey.4. This Chapter shall also apply to goods obtained or produced in the Community or in Turkey, in the manufacture of which products coming from third countries and not in free circulation either in the Community or in Turkey were used.These provisions shall, however, apply to those goods only if the import formalities have been complied with and any customs duties or charges having equivalent effect payable on third-country products used in their manufacture have been levied in the exporting State.5. If the exporting State does not apply the provisions of the second subparagraph of paragraph 4, the goods referred to in the first subparagraph of paragraph 4 shall not be considered to be in free circulation and the importing State shall therefore apply the customs legislation applying to goods from third countries.6. The Customs Cooperation Committee set up by Decision No 2/69 of the Association Council shall determine the methods of administrative cooperation to be used in implementing paragraphs 1, 2 and 4.SECTION I Elimination of customs duties and charges having equivalent effect Article 4Import or export customs duties and charges having equivalent effect shall be wholly abolished between the Community and Turkey on the date of entry into force of this Decision. The Community and Turkey shall refrain from introducing any new customs duties on imports or exports or any charges having equivalent effect from that date. These provisions shall also apply to customs duties of a fiscal nature.SECTION II Elimination of quantitative restrictions or measures having equivalent effect Article 5Quantitative restrictions on imports and all measures having equivalent effect shall be prohibited between the Parties.Article 6Quantitative restrictions on exports and all measures having equivalent effect shall be prohibited between the Parties.Article 7The provisions of Articles 5 and 6 shall not preclude prohibitions or restrictions on imports, exports or goods in transit justified on grounds of public morality, public policy or public security; the protection of health and life of humans, animals or plants; the protection of national treasures possessing artistic, historic or archaeological value; or the protection of industrial and commercial property. Such prohibitions or restrictions shall not, however, constitute a means of arbitrary discrimination or a disguised restriction on trade between the Parties.Article 81. Within five years from the date of entry into force of this Decision, Turkey shall incorporate into its internal legal order the Community instruments relating to the removal of technical barriers to trade.2. The list of these instruments and the conditions and detailed arrangements governing their implementation by Turkey shall be laid down by decision of the Association Council within a period of one year from the date of entry into force of this Decision.3. This provision shall not preclude the application by Turkey, with effect from the date of entry into force of this Decision, of Community instruments deemed to be of particular importance.4. The Parties stress the importance of effective cooperation between them in the fields of standardization, metrology and calibration, quality, accreditation, testing and certification.Article 9When Turkey has put into force the provisions of the Community instrument or instruments necessary for the elimination of technical barriers to trade in a particular product, trade in that product between the Parties shall take place in accordance with the conditions laid down by those instruments, without prejudice to the application of the provisions of this Decision.Article 101. With effect from the date of entry into force of this Decision, and during the period required for the application by Turkey of the instruments referred to in Article 9, Turkey shall refrain from impeding the placing on the market or taking into service on its territory of products from the Community the conformity of which with the Community Directives defining the requirements to be met by such products has been attested to, in accordance with the conditions and the procedures laid down in those Directives.2. By way of derogation from paragraph 1, if Turkey finds that a product, the conformity of which with the Community Directives has been attested to in accordance with paragraph 1, and which is used in accordance with its intended purpose, fails to satisfy one of the requirements referred to in Article 7, it may take all appropriate measures, in accordance with the conditions and procedures provided for in paragraph 3, to withdraw the product in question from the market, or to prohibit or restrict its being placed on the market or taken into service.3. (a) If Turkey is considering taking a measure under paragraph 2, it shall, forthwith, notify the Community through the Customs Union Joint Committee and shall provide all relevant information.(b) The Parties shall immediately enter into consultations within the Customs Union Joint Committee to find a mutually acceptable solution.(c) Turkey may not take a measure mentioned in paragraph 2 until one month has elapsed after the date of notification provided for in paragraph 3 (a) unless the consultation procedure under paragraph 3 (b) has been concluded before the expiry of the time limit. When exceptional circumstances requiring immediate action render prior examination impossible, Turkey may apply forthwith the measure strictly necessary to remedy the situation.(d) Turkey shall forthwith inform the Customs Union Joint Committee of the measure it has taken and shall provide all relevant information.(e) The Community may at any time request the Customs Union Joint Committee to review such measure.4. The provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 shall apply, mutatis mutandis, to foodstuffs.Article 11During the period required for the application by Turkey of the instruments referred to in Article 9, the Community will accept the results of the procedures applied in Turkey for assessing the conformity of industrial products with the requirements of Community law, provided that those procedures are in conformity with the requirements in force in the Community, and on the understanding that, in the motor vehicles sector, Council Directive 70/156/EEC of 6 February 1970 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the type-approval of motor vehicles and their trailers (2) shall apply in Turkey.SECTION III Commercial policy Article 121. From the date of entry into force of this Decision, Turkey shall, in relation to countries which are not members of the Community, apply provisions and implementing measures which are substantially similar to those of the Community's commercial policy set out in the following Regulations:- Council Regulation (EC) No 3285/94 (3) common rules for imports),- Council Regulation (EC) No 519/94 (4) (common rules for imports from certain third countries),- Council Regulation (EC) No 520/94 (5) (Community procedure for administering quantitative quotas (implementing provisions: Commission Regulation (EC) No 738/94 (6),- Council Regulations (EC) No 3283/94 (7) and (EC) No 3284/94 (8) (protection against dumped and subsidized imports),- Council Regulation (EC) No 3286/94 (9) (Community procedures in the field of the common commercial policy),- Council Regulation (EEC) No 2603/69 (10) (establishing common rules for exports),- Council Decision 93/112/EEC (11) (officially supported export credits),- Council Regulation (EC) No 3036/94 (12) (outward processing arrangements for textiles and clothing),- Council Regulation (EC) No 3030/93 (13) (textile imports under common rules),- Council Regulation (EC) No 517/94 (14) (textile imports under autonomous arrangements),- Council Regulation (EC) No 3951/92 (15) (textile imports from Taiwan).2. In conformity with the requirements of Article XXIV of the GATT Turkey will apply as from the entry into force of this Decision, substantially the same commercial policy as the Community in the textile sector including the agreements or arrangements on trade in textile and clothing. The Community will make available to Turkey the cooperation necessary for this objective to be reached.3. Until Turkey has concluded these arrangements, the present system of certificates of origin for the exports of textile and clothing from Turkey into the Community will remain in force and such products not originating from Turkey will remain subject to the application of the Communities commercial policy in relation to the third countries in question.4. The provisions of this Decision shall not constitute a hindrance to the implementation by the Community and Japan of their Arrangement relating to trade in motor vehicles, mentioned in the Annex to the Agreement on safeguards attached to the Agreement setting up the World Trade Organization.Before the entry into force of this Decision, Turkey and the Community will define the modalities of cooperation in order to prevent the circumvention of the said Arrangement.In the absence of such modalities, the Community reserves the right to take, in respect of imports into its territory, any measure rendered necessary by the application of the said Arrangement.SECTION IV Common Customs Tariff and preferential tariff policies Article 131. Upon the date of entry into force of this Decision, Turkey shall, in relation to countries which are not members of the Community, align itself on the Common Customs Tariff.2. Turkey shall adjust its customs tariff whenever necessary to take account of changes in the Common Customs Tariff.3. The Customs Cooperation Committee shall determine what measures are appropriate to implement paragraphs 1 and 2.Article 141. Turkey shall be informed of any decisions taken by the Community to amend the Common Customs Tariff, to suspend or reintroduce duties and any decision concerning tariff quotas or ceilings in sufficient time for it simultaneously to align the Turkish customs tariff on the Common Customs Tariff. Prior consultations shall be held within the Customs Union Joint Committee for this purpose.2. Where the Turkish customs tariff cannot be aligned simultaneously on the Common Customs Tariff, the Customs Union Joint Committee may decide to grant a period of time for this to be undertaken. Under no circumstances may the Customs Union Joint Committee authorize Turkey to apply a customs tariff which is lower than the Common Customs Tariff for any product.3. If Turkey wishes to suspend on temporary basis or resume duties other than as envisaged in paragraph 1, Turkey will make a prompt notification to the Community. Consultations on the abovementioned decisions will be held in the Joint Customs Union Committee.Article 15By way of derogation from Article 13 and in accordance with Article 19 of the Additional Protocol, Turkey may retain until 1 January 2001 customs duties higher than the Common Customs Tariff in respect of third countries for products agreed by the Association Council.Article 161. With a view to harmonizing its commercial policy with that of the Community, Turkey shall align itself progressively with the preferential customs regime of the Community within five years as from the date of entry into force of this Decision. This alignment will concern both the autonomous regimes and preferential agreements with third countries. To this end, Turkey will take the necessary measures and negotiate agreements on mutually advantageous basis with the countries concerned. The Association Council shall periodically review the progress made.2. In each of the cases referred to in paragraph 1 the granting of these tariff preferences shall be conditional on complicance with provisions relating to the origin of products identical to those governing the granting of such preferences by the Community.3. (a) Where, during the period referred to in paragraph 1, Turkey maintains a tariff policy different from that of the Community, goods imported from third countries into the Community and released for free circulation with preferential treatment by reason of their country of origin or of exportation shall be subject to the payment of a compensatory levy if they are imported into Turkey, in the following circumstances:- they have been imported from countries to which the same preferential tariff treatment is not granted by Turkey, and- they can be identified as imported from these countries, and- the duty to be paid in Turkey is at least five percentage points higher than that applicable in the Community, and- an important distortion of traffic related to these goods has been observed.(b) The Customs Union Joint Committee shall establish the list of the goods to which the compensatory levy applies, as well as the amount of this levy.SECTION V Processed agricultural products not covered by Annex II to the Treaty establishing the European Community Article 17The provisions of this Section apply to goods listed in Annex 1.Article 18Notwithstanding Article 13, Turkey may apply on imports from third countries of goods listed in Annex 1 an agricultural component. The agricultural component shall be established in accordance with Article 19.Article 191. The agricultural component applicable to goods imported into Turkey shall be obtained by adding together the quantities of basic agricultural products considered to have been used for the manufacture of the goods in question multiplied by the basic amount corresponding to each of these basic agricultural products as defined in paragraph 3.2. (a) The basic agricultural products to be taken into account are listed in Annex 2.(b) The quantities of basic agricultural products to be taken into account are set out in Annex 3.(c) In the case of goods classified under the nomenclature codes for which reference is made in Annex 3 to Annex 4, the amounts of the agricultural component to be taken into account are set out in Annex 4.3. The basic amount corresponding to each basic agricultural product is the amount of the charge applicable on import into Turkey of the agricultural product originating in a non-preferential third country during the reference period applicable to agricultural products. The basic amounts are set out in Annex 5.Article 201. Notwithstanding Article 4, Turkey and the Community may apply agricultural components established in accordance with the provisions below in trade with each other.2. Such agricultural components, reduced in accordance with Article 22 where applicable, shall only apply to goods listed in Annex 1.3. The Community shall apply to Turkey the same specific duties that represent the agricultural component applicable to third countries.4. Turkey shall apply to imports from the Community the agricultural component applied in accordance with Article 19.Article 21Notwithstanding the modalities set out in this Decision a derogation regime is foreseen for the goods listed in the Annex 6/Table 1 and Annex 6/Table 2 in which the import charges in Turkey will be reduced in three steps over a period of three years for the former and one year for the latter. The level of those import charges is set in Annex 6/Table 1 and Annex 6/Table 2.At the end of the relevant periods the provisions of this Section shall apply fully.Article 221. Where, in trade between the Community and Turkey, the duty applicable to a basic agricultural product is reduced, the agricultural component determined in accordance with Article 20 (4) for imports into Turkey or that referred to in Article 20 (3), for imports into the Community, shall be reduced proportionately.2. Where the reductions referred to in paragraph 1 are effected within the limits of a quota, a list of goods and quantities to which the reduced agricultural component is applicable shall be drawn up by the Association Council.3. The provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 above apply to the import charges referred to in Article 21.Article 23If imports of one or more of the products covered by the derogation regime cause or threaten to cause in Turkey serious disturbances which may endanger the objectives of the Customs Union for processed agricultural products, consultations between the Parties shall be held within the Customs Union Joint Committee, with a view to finding a mutually acceptable solution.If such a solution cannot be found, the Customs Union Joint Committee may recommend appropriate ways of maintaining the proper functioning of the Customs Union without prejudice to the provisions of Article 63.CHAPTER II AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS Article 241. The Association Council hereby reaffirms the Parties' common objective to move towards the free movement of agricultural products between themselves as provided for in Articles 32 to 35 of the Additional Protocol.2. The Association Council notes that an additional period is required to put in place the conditions necessary to achieve free movement of these products.Article 251. Turkey shall adjust its policy in such a way as to adopt the common agricultural policy measures required to establish freedom of movement of agricultural products. It shall communicate to the Community the decisions taken in that respect.2. The Community shall take account as far as possible of Turkish agriculture's interests when developing its agricultural policy and shall notify Turkey of the relevant Commission proposals and the decisions taken on the basis of these proposals.3. Consultations may be held within the Association Council on the proposals and decisions referred to in paragraph 2 and on the measures which Turkey intends to take in the agricultural field pursuant to paragraph 1.Article 26The Community and Turkey shall progressively improve, on a mutually advantageous basis, the preferential arrangements which they grant each other for their trade in agricultural products. The Association Council shall regularly examine the improvements made to these preferential arrangements.Article 27The Association Council shall adopt the provisions necessary to achieve the free movement of agricultural products between the Community and Turkey once it has established that Turkey has adopted the common agricultural policy measures referred to in Article 25 (1).CHAPTER III CUSTOMS PROVISIONS Article 281. On the date of entry into force of this Decision, Turkey shall adopt provisions in the following fields, based on Council Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 of 12 October 1992 establishing the Community Customs Code and Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93 of 2 July 1993 (16) laying down the implementing provisions thereof:(a) origin of goods;(b) customs value of goods;(c) introduction of goods into the territory of the Customs Union;(d) customs declaration;(e) release for free circulation;(f) suspensive arrangements and customs procedures with economic impact;(g) movement of goods;(h) customs debt;(i) right of appeal.2.

The Parties confirm the importance they attach to ensuring adequate and effective protection and enforcement of intellectual, industrial and commercial property rights.2. The Parties recognize that the Customs Union can function properly only if equivalent levels of effective protection of intellectual property rights are provided in both constituent parts of the Customs Union. Accordingly, they undertake to meet the obligations set out in Annex 8.SECTION II Competition A. Competition rules of the Customs Union Article 321. The following shall be prohibited as incompatible with the proper functioning of the Customs Union, in so far as they may affect trade between the Community and Turkey: all agreements between undertakings, decisions by associations of undertakings and concerted practices which have as their object or effect the prevention, restriction or distortion of competition, and in particular those which:(a) directly or indirectly fix purchase or selling prices or any other trading conditions;(b) limit or control production, markets, technical development or investment;(c) share markets or sources of supply;(d) apply dissimilar conditions to equivalent transactions with other trading parties, thereby placing them at a competitive disadvantage;(e) make the conclusion of contracts subject to acceptance by the other parties of supplementary obligations which, by their nature or according to commercial usage, have no connection with the subject of such contracts.2. Any agreements or decisions prohibited pursuant to this Article shall automatically be void.3. The provisions of paragraph 1 may, however, be declared inapplicable in the case of:- any agreement or category of agreements between undertakings,- any decision or category of decisions by associations of undertakings,- any concerted practice or category of concerted practiceswhich contributes to improving the production or distribution of goods or to promoting technical or economic progress, which allowing consumers a fair share of the resulting benefit, and which does not:(a) impose on the undertakings concerned restrictions which are not indispensable to the attainment to these objectives;(b) afford such undertakings the possibility of eliminating competition in respect of a substantial part of the products in question.Article 331. Any abuse by one or more undertakings of a dominant position in the territories of the Community and/or of Turkey as a whole or in a substantial part thereof shall be prohibited as incompatible with the proper functioning of the Customs Union, in so far as it may affect trade between the Community and Turkey.2. Such abuse may, in particular, consist in:(a) directly or indirectly imposing unfair purchase or selling prices or other unfair trading conditions;(b) limiting production, markets or technical development to the prejudice of consumers;(c) applying dissimilar conditions to equivalent transactions with other trading parties, thereby placing them at a competitive disadvantage;(d) making the conclusion of contracts subject to acceptance by the other parties of supplementary obligations which, by their nature or according to commercial usage, have no connection with the subject of such contracts.Article 341. Any aid granted by Member States of the Community or by Turkey through State resources in any form whatsoever which distorts or threatens to distort competition by favouring certain undertakings or the production of certain goods shall, in so far as it affects trade between the Community and Turkey, be incompatible with the proper functioning of the Customs Union.2. The following shall be compatible with the functioning of the Customs Union:(a) aid having a social character, granted to individual consumers, provided that such aid is granted without discrimination related to the origin of the products concerned;(b) aid to make good the damage caused by natural disasters or exceptional occurrences;(c) aid granted to the economy of certain areas of the Federal Republic of Germany affected by the division of Germany, in so far as such aid is required in order to compensate for the economic disadvantages caused by that division;(d) for a period of five years from the entry into force of this Decision, aid to promote economic development of Turkey's less developed regions, provided that such aid does not adversely affect trading conditions between the Community and Turkey to an extent contrary to the common interest.3. The following may be considered to be compatible with the functioning of the Customs Union:(a) in conformity with Article 43 (2) of the Additional Protocol, aid to promote the economic development of areas where the standard of living is abnormally low or where there is serious underemployment;(b) aid to promote the execution of an important project of common European interest or to remedy a serious disturbance in the economy of a Member State of the Community or of Turkey;(c) for a period of five years after the entry into force of this Decision, in conformity with Article 43 (2) of the Additional Protocol, aids aiming at accomplishing structural adjustment necessitated by the establishement of the Customs Union.

The Association Council shall, within two years following the entry into force of the Customs Union, adopt by Decision the necessary rules for the implementation of Articles 32, 33 and 34 and related parts of Article 35. These rules shall be based upon those already existing in the Community and shall inter alia specify the role of each competition authority.2. Until these rules are adopted,(a) the authorities of the Community or Turkey shall rule on the admissibility of agreements, decisions and concerted practices and on abuse of a dominant position in accordance with Articles 32 and 33;(b) the provisions of the GATT Subsidies Code shall be applied as the rules for the implementation of Article 34.Article 381. If the Community or Turkey considers that a particular practice is incompatible with the terms of Articles 32, 33 or 34, and- is not adequately dealt with under the implementing rules referred to in Article 37, or- in the absence of such rules, and if such practice causes or threatens to cause serious prejudice to the interest of the other Party or material injury to its domestic industry, it may take appropriate measures after consultation within the Joint Customs Union Committee or after 45 working days following referral for such consultation. Priority shall be given to such measures that will least disturb the functioning of the Customs Union.2. In the case of practices incompatible with Article 34, such appropriate measures may, where the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade applies thereto, only be adopted in conformity with the procedures and under the conditions laid down by the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and any other relevant instrument negotiated under its auspices which are applicable between the Parties.B. Approximation of legislation Article 391. With a view to achieving the economic integration sought by the Customs Union, Turkey shall ensure that its legislation in the field of competition rules is made compatible with that of the European Community, and is applied effectively.2. To comply with the obligations of paragraph 1, Turkey shall(a) before the entry into force of the Customs Union, adopt a law which shall prohibit behaviours of undertakings under the conditions laid down in Articles 85 and 86 of the EC Treaty. It shall also ensure that, within one year after the entry into force of the Customs Union, the principles contained in block exemption Regulations in force in the Community, as well as in the case-law developed by EC authorities, shall be applied in Turkey. The Community shall inform Turkey as soon as possible of any procedure related to the adoption, abolition, or modification of block exemption Regulations by the EC after the entry into force of the Customs Union. After such information has been given, Turkey shall have one year to adapt its legislation, if necessary;(b) before the entry into force of the Customs Union, establish a competition authority which shall apply these rules and principles effectively;(c) before the entry into force of this Decision, adapt all its aids granted to the textile and clothing sector to the rules laid down in the relevant Community frameworks and guidelines under Articles 92 and 93 of the EC Treaty. Turkey shall inform the Community of all its aid schemes to this sector as adapted in accordance with these frameworks and guidelines. The Community shall inform Turkey as soon as possible of any procedure related to the adoption, abolition or modification of such frameworks and guidelines by the Community after the entry into force of the Customs Union. After such information as been given, Turkey shall have one year to adopt its legislation;(d) within two years after the entry into force of this Decision, adapt all aid schemes other than those granted to the textile and clothing sector to the rules laid down in Community frameworks and guidelines under Articles 92 and 93 of the EC Treaty. The Community shall inform Turkey as soon as possible of any procedure related to the adoption, abolition or modification of such frameworks and guidelines by the Community. After such information has been given, Turkey shall have one year to adapt its legislation;(e) within two years after the entry into force of the Customs Union, inform the Community of all aid schemes in force in Turkey as adapted in accordance with point (d). If a new scheme is to be adopted, Turkey shall inform the Community as soon as possible of the content of such scheme;(f) notify the Community in advance of any individual aid to be granted to an enterprise or a group of enterprises that would be notifiable under Community frameworks or guidelines had it been granted by a Member State, or of individual aid awards outside of Community frameworks or guidelines above an amount of ECU 12 million and which would have been notified under EC law had it been granted by a Member State.Regarding individual aids granted by Member States and subject to the analysis by the Commission, on the basis of Article 93 of the EC Treaty, Turkey will be informed on the same basis as the Member States.3. The Community and Turkey shall communicate to each other all amendments to their laws concerning restrictive practices by undertakings. They shall also inform each other of the cases when these laws have been applied.4. In relation to information supplied under paragraph 2, points (c), (e) and (f), the Community shall have the right to raise objections against an aid granted by Turkey which it would have deemed unlawful under EC law had it been granted by a Member State. If Turkey does not agree with the Community's opinion, and if the case is not resolved within 30 days, the Community and Turkey shall each have the right to refer the case to arbitration.5. Turkey shall have the right to raise objections and seize the Association Council against an aid granted by a Member State which it deems to be unlawful under EC law. If the case is not resolved by the Association Council within three months, the Association Council may decide to refer the case to the Court of Justice of the European Communities.Article 401. The Community shall inform Turkey as soon as possible of the adoption of any Decision under Articles 85, 86 and 92 of the EC Treaty which might affect Turkey's interests.2. Turkey shall be entitled to ask information about any specific case decided by the Community under Articles 85, 86 and 92 of the EC Treaty.Article 41With regard to public undertakings and undertakings to which special or exclusive rights have been granted, Turkey shall ensure that, by the end of the first year following the entry into force of the Customs Union, the principles of the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, notably Article 90, as well as the principles contained in the secondary legislation and the case-law developed on this basis, are upheld.Article 42Turkey shall progressively adjust, in accordance with the conditions and the time-table laid down by the Association Council any State monopolies of a commercial character so as to ensure that, by the end of the second year following the entry into force of this Decision, no discrimination regarding the conditions under which goods are procured and marketed exists between nationals of the Member States and of Turkey.Article 431. If the Community or Turkey believes that anti-competitive activities carried out on the territory of the other Party are adversely affecting its interests or the interests of its undertakings, the first Party may notify the other Party and may request that the other Party's competition authority initiate appropriate enforcement action. The notification shall be as specific as possible about the nature of the anti-competitive activities and their effects on the interests of the notifying Party, and shall include an offer for such further information and other cooperation as the notifying Party is able to provide.2. Upon receipt of a notification under paragraph 1 and after such other discussion between the Parties as may be appropriate and useful in the circumstances, the competition authority of the notified Party will consider whether or not to initiate enforcement action, with respect to the anti-competitive activities identified in the notification. The notified Party will advise the notifying Party of its decision. If enforcement action is initiated, the notified Party will advise the notifying Party of its outcome and, to the extent possible, of significant interim developments.3. Nothing in this Article limits the discretion of the notified Party under its competition laws and enforcement policies as to whether or not to undertake enforcement action with respect to the notified anti-competitive activities, or precludes the notifying Party from undertaking enforcement action with respect to such anti-competitive activities.SECTION III Trade defence instruments Article 441. The Association Council shall review upon the request of either Party the principle of application of trade defence instruments other than safeguard by one Party in its relations with the other.
