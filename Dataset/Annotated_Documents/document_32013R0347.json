{"celex_id": "32013R0347", "reference": "25.4.2013\nEN\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\nL 115/39\nREGULATION (EU) No 347/2013 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL\nof 17 April 2013\non guidelines for trans-European energy infrastructure and repealing Decision No 1364/2006/EC and amending Regulations (EC) No 713/2009, (EC) No 714/2009 and (EC) No 715/2009\n(Text with EEA relevance)\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 172 thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee (1),\nHaving regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions (2),\nActing in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure (3),\nWhereas:\n(1)\nOn 26 March 2010, the European Council agreed to the Commission’s proposal to launch a new strategy ‘Europe 2020’. One of the priorities of the Europe 2020 strategy is sustainable growth to be achieved by promoting a more resource-efficient, more sustainable and more competitive economy. That strategy put energy infrastructures at the forefront as part of the flagship initiative ‘Resource efficient Europe’, by underlining the need to urgently upgrade Europe’s networks, interconnecting them at the continental level, in particular to integrate renewable energy sources.\n(2)\nThe target agreed in the conclusions of the March 2002 Barcelona European Council for Member States to have a level of electricity interconnections equivalent to at least to 10 % of their installed production capacity has not yet been achieved.\n(3)\nThe communication from the Commission entitled ‘Energy infrastructure priorities for 2020 and beyond — A Blueprint for an integrated European energy network’, followed by the Council conclusions of 28 February 2011 and the European Parliament resolution (4), called for a new energy infrastructure policy to optimise network development at European level for the period up to 2020 and beyond, in order to allow the Union to meet its core energy policy objectives of competitiveness, sustainability and security of supply.\n(4)\nThe European Council of 4 February 2011 underlined the need to modernise and expand Europe’s energy infrastructure and to interconnect networks across borders, in order to make solidarity between Member States operational, to provide for alternative supply or transit routes and sources of energy and to develop renewable energy sources in competition with traditional sources. It insisted that no Member State should remain isolated from the European gas and electricity networks after 2015 or see its energy security jeopardised by lack of the appropriate connections.\n(5)\nDecision No 1364/2006/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (5) lays down guidelines for trans-European energy networks (TEN-E). Those guidelines have as objectives to support the completion of the Union internal energy market while encouraging the rational production, transportation, distribution and use of energy resources, to reduce the isolation of less-favoured and island regions, to secure and diversify the Union’s energy supplies, sources and routes, including through cooperation with third countries, and to contribute to sustainable development and protection of the environment.\n(6)\nEvaluation of the current TEN-E framework has clearly shown that this framework, while making a positive contribution to selected projects by giving them political visibility, lacks vision, focus, and flexibility to fill identified infrastructure gaps. The Union should therefore increase its efforts to meet future challenges in this field, and due attention should be paid to identifying potential future gaps in energy demand and supply.\n(7)\nAccelerating the refurbishment of existing energy infrastructure and the deployment of new energy infrastructure is vital to achieve the Union’s energy and climate policy objectives, consisting of completing the internal market in energy, guaranteeing security of supply, in particular for gas and oil, reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 20 % (30 % if the conditions are right), increasing the share of renewable energy in final energy consumption to 20 % (6) and achieving a 20 % increase in energy efficiency by 2020 whereby energy efficiency gains may contribute to reducing the need for construction of new infrastructures. At the same time, the Union has to prepare its infrastructure for further decarbonisation of its energy system in the longer term towards 2050. This Regulation should therefore also be able to accommodate possible future Union energy and climate policy objectives.\n(8)\nDespite the fact that Directive 2009/72/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 July 2009 concerning common rules for the internal market in electricity (7) and Directive 2009/73/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 July 2009 concerning common rules for the internal market in natural gas (8) provide for an internal market in energy, the market remains fragmented due to insufficient interconnections between national energy networks and to the suboptimal utilisation of existing energy infrastructure. However, Union-wide integrated networks and deployment of smart grids are vital for ensuring a competitive and properly functioning integrated market, for achieving an optimal utilisation of energy infrastructure, for increased energy efficiency and integration of distributed renewable energy sources and for promoting growth, employment and sustainable development.\n(9)\nThe Union’s energy infrastructure should be upgraded in order to prevent technical failure and to increase its resilience against such failure, natural or man-made disasters, adverse effects of climate change and threats to its security, in particular as regards European critical infrastructures as set out in Council Directive 2008/114/EC of 8 December 2008 on the identification and designation of European critical infrastructures and the assessment of the need to improve their protection (9).\n(10)\nTransporting oil through land pipelines rather than over water can make an important contribution to lowering the environmental risk associated with the transportation of oil.\n(11)\nThe importance of smart grids in achieving the Union’s energy policy objectives has been acknowledged in the communication from the Commission of 12 April 2011 entitled ‘Smart grids: from innovation to deployment’.\n(12)\nEnergy storage facilities and reception, storage and regasification or decompression facilities for liquefied natural gas (LNG) and compressed natural gas (CNG) have an increasingly important role to play in the European energy infrastructure. The expansion of such energy infrastructure facilities forms an important component of a well-functioning network infrastructure.\n(13)\nThe communication from the Commission of 7 September 2011 entitled ‘The EU Energy Policy: Engaging with Partners beyond Our Borders’ underlined the need for the Union to include the promotion of energy infrastructure development in its external relations with a view to supporting socio-economic development beyond the Union borders. The Union should facilitate infrastructure projects linking the Union’s energy networks with third-country networks, in particular with neighbouring countries and with countries with which the Union has established specific energy cooperation.\n(14)\nTo ensure voltage and frequency stability, particular attention should be focused on the stability of the European electricity network under the changing conditions caused by the growing inflow of energy from renewable resources that are variable in nature.\n(15)\nThe investment needs up to 2020 in electricity and gas transmission infrastructures of European relevance have been estimated at about EUR 200 billion. The significant increase in investment volumes compared to past trends and the urgency of implementing the energy infrastructure priorities requires a new approach in the way energy infrastructures, and in particular those of a cross-border nature, are regulated and financed.\n(16)\nThe Commission Staff Working Paper for the Council of 10 June 2011 entitled ‘Energy infrastructure investment needs and financing requirements’ stressed that approximately half of the total investments needed for the decade up to 2020 are at risk of not being delivered at all or not in time due to obstacles related to the granting of permits, regulatory issues and financing.\n(17)\nThis Regulation lays down rules for the timely development and interoperability of trans-European energy networks in order to achieve the energy policy objectives of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) to ensure the functioning of the internal energy market and security of supply in the Union, to promote energy efficiency and energy saving and the development of new and renewable forms of energy, and to promote the interconnection of energy networks. By pursuing these objectives, this Regulation contributes to smart, sustainable and inclusive growth and brings benefits to the entire Union in terms of competitiveness and economic, social and territorial cohesion.\n(18)\nIt is essential for the development of trans-European networks and their effective interoperability to ensure operational coordination between electricity transmission system operators (TSOs). In order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of the relevant provisions of Regulation (EC) No 714/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 July 2009 on conditions for access to the network for cross-border exchanges in electricity (10) in this respect, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission. Those powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 February 2011 laying down the rules and general principles concerning mechanisms for control by Member States of the Commission’s exercise of implementing powers (11). The examination procedure should be used for the adoption of the guidelines on the implementation of operational coordination between electricity TSOs at Union level, given that those guidelines will apply generally to all TSOs.\n(19)\nThe Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (the ‘Agency’) established by Regulation (EC) No 713/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council (12) is allocated important additional tasks under this Regulation and should be given the right to levy fees for some of these additional tasks.\n(20)\nFollowing close consultations with all Member States and stakeholders, the Commission has identified 12 strategic trans-European energy infrastructure priorities, the implementation of which by 2020 is essential for the achievement of the Union’s energy and climate policy objectives. These priorities cover different geographic regions or thematic areas in the field of electricity transmission and storage, gas transmission, storage and liquefied or compressed natural gas infrastructure, smart grids, electricity highways, carbon dioxide transport and oil infrastructure.\n(21)\nProjects of common interest should comply with common, transparent and objective criteria in view of their contribution to the energy policy objectives. For electricity and gas, in order to be eligible for inclusion in the second and subsequent Union lists, projects should be part of the latest available 10-year network development plan. This plan should notably take account of the conclusions of the European Council of 4 February 2011 with regard to the need to integrate peripheral energy markets.\n(22)\nRegional groups should be established for the purpose of proposing and reviewing projects of common interest, leading to the establishment of regional lists of projects of common interest. In order to ensure broad consensus, these regional groups should ensure close cooperation between Member States, national regulatory authorities, project promoters and relevant stakeholders. The cooperation should rely as much as possible on existing regional cooperation structures of national regulatory authorities and TSOs and other structures established by the Member States and the Commission. In the context of this cooperation, national regulatory authorities should, when necessary, advise the regional groups, inter alia on the feasibility of the regulatory aspects of proposed projects and on the feasibility of the proposed timetable for regulatory approval.\n(23)\nIn order to ensure that the Union list of projects of common interest (‘Union list’) is limited to projects which contribute the most to the implementation of the strategic energy infrastructure priority corridors and areas, the power to adopt and review the Union list should be delegated to the Commission in accordance with Article 290 of the TFEU, while respecting the right of the Member States to approve projects of common interest related to their territory. According to analysis carried out in the impact assessment accompanying the proposal that has led to this Regulation, the number of such projects is estimated at some 100 in the field of electricity and 50 in the field of gas. Taking into account this estimate, and the need to ensure the achievement of the objectives of this Regulation, the total number of projects of common interest should remain manageable, and therefore should not significantly exceed 220. The Commission, when preparing and drawing up delegated acts, should ensure the simultaneous, timely and appropriate transmission of relevant documents to the European Parliament and to the Council.\n(24)\nA new Union list should be established every two years. Projects of common interest that are completed or that no longer fulfil the relevant criteria and requirements as set out in this Regulation should not appear on the next Union list. For that reason, existing projects of common interest that are to be included in the next Union list should be subject to the same selection process for the establishment of regional lists and for the establishment of the Union list as proposed projects; however, care should be taken to minimise the resulting administrative burden as much as possible, for example by using to the extent possible information submitted previously, and by taking account of the annual reports of the project promoters.\n(25)\nProjects of common interest should be implemented as quickly as possible and should be closely monitored and evaluated, while keeping the administrative burden for project promoters to a minimum. The Commission should nominate European coordinators for projects facing particular difficulties.\n(26)\nPermit granting processes should neither lead to administrative burdens which are disproportionate to the size or complexity of a project, nor create barriers to the development of the trans-European networks and market access. The conclusions of the Council of 19 February 2009 highlighted the need to identify and remove barriers to investment, including by means of streamlining of planning and consultation procedures. Those conclusions were reinforced by the conclusions of the European Council of 4 February 2011 which again underlined the importance of streamlining and improving permit granting processes while respecting national competences.\n(27)\nThe planning and implementation of Union projects of common interest in the areas of energy, transport and telecommunication infrastructure should be coordinated to generate synergies whenever to do so makes sense from an overall economic, technical, environmental or spatial planning point of view and with due regard to the relevant safety aspects. Thus, when the various European networks are being planned, preference could be given to integrating transport, communication and energy networks in order to ensure that as little land as possible is taken up, whilst ensuring, where possible, that existing or disused routes are reused, in order to reduce to a minimum any negative social, economic, environmental and financial impact.\n(28)\nProjects of common interest should be given ‘priority status’ at national level to ensure rapid administrative treatment. Projects of common interest should be considered by competent authorities as being in the public interest. Authorisation should be given to projects which have an adverse impact on the environment, for reasons of overriding public interest, when all the conditions under Council Directive 92/43/EEC of 21 May 1992 on the conservation of natural habitats and of wild fauna and flora (13) and Directive 2000/60/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 October 2000 establishing a framework for Community action in the field of water policy (14) are met.\n(29)\nThe establishment of a competent authority or authorities integrating or coordinating all permit granting processes (‘one-stop shop’) should reduce complexity, increase efficiency and transparency and help enhance cooperation among Member States. Upon their designation, the competent authorities should be operational as soon as possible.\n(30)\nDespite the existence of established standards for the participation of the public in environmental decision-making procedures, additional measures are needed to ensure the highest possible standards of transparency and public participation for all relevant issues in the permit granting process for projects of common interest.\n(31)\nThe correct and coordinated implementation of Directive 2011/92/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 December 2011 on the assessment of the effects of certain public and private projects on the environment (15), of Directive 2001/42/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 June 2001 on the assessment of the effects of certain plans and programmes on the environment (16), where applicable, of the Convention on access to information, public participation in decision-making and access to justice in environmental matters, signed in Aarhus on 25 June 1998 (17) (the ‘Aarhus Convention’), and of the Espoo Convention on environmental impact assessment in a transboundary context (the ‘Espoo Convention’) should ensure the harmonisation of the main principles for the assessment of environmental effects, including in a cross-border context. Member States should coordinate their assessments for projects of common interest, and provide for joint assessments, where possible. Member States should be encouraged to exchange best practice and administrative capacity-building for permit granting processes.\n(32)\nIt is important to streamline and improve permit granting processes, while respecting — to the extent possible with due regard to the principle of subsidiarity — national competences and procedures for the construction of new infrastructure. Given the urgency of developing energy infrastructures, the simplification of permit granting processes should be accompanied by a clear time-limit for the decision to be taken by the respective authorities regarding the construction of the project. That time limit should stimulate a more efficient definition and handling of procedures, and should under no circumstances compromise the high standards for the protection of the environment and public participation. With regard to the maximum time limits established by this Regulation, Member States could nevertheless strive to further shorten them if feasible. The competent authorities should ensure compliance with the time limits, and Member States should endeavour to ensure that appeals challenging the substantive or procedural legality of a comprehensive decision are handled in the most efficient way possible.\n(33)\nWhere Member States consider it appropriate, they may include in the comprehensive decision decisions taken in the context of: negotiations with individual landowners to granting access to, ownership of, or a right to occupy property; spatial planning which determines the general land use of a defined region, includes other developments such as highways, railways, buildings and nature protection areas, and is not undertaken for the specific purpose of the planned project; granting of operational permits. In the context of the permit granting processes, a project of common interest could include related infrastructure to the extent that it is essential for the construction or functioning of the project.\n(34)\nThis Regulation, in particular the provisions on permit granting, public participation and the implementation of projects of common interest, should apply without prejudice to international and Union law, including provisions to protect the environment and human health, and provisions adopted under the Common Fisheries and Maritime Policy.\n(35)\nThe costs for the development, construction, operation and maintenance of projects of common interest should in general be fully borne by the users of the infrastructure. Projects of common interest should be eligible for cross-border cost allocation when an assessment of market demand or of the expected effects on the tariffs have indicated that costs cannot be expected to be recovered by the tariffs paid by the infrastructure users.\n(36)\nThe basis for the discussion on the appropriate allocation of costs should be the analysis of the costs and benefits of an infrastructure project on the basis of a harmonised methodology for energy-system-wide analysis, in the framework of the 10-year network development plans prepared by the European Networks of Transmission System Operators under Regulation (EC) No 714/2009 and Regulation (EC) No 715/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 July 2009 on conditions for access to the natural gas transmission networks (18), and reviewed by the Agency. That analysis could take into consideration indicators and corresponding reference values for the comparison of unit investment costs.\n(37)\nIn an increasingly integrated internal energy market, clear and transparent rules for cost allocation across borders are necessary in order to accelerate investment in cross-border infrastructure. The European Council of 4 February 2011 recalled the importance of promoting a regulatory framework attractive to investment in networks, with tariffs set at levels consistent with financing needs and the appropriate cost allocation for cross-border investments, while enhancing competition and competitiveness and taking account of the impact on consumers. When deciding on cross-border cost allocation, national regulatory authorities should ensure that its impact on national tariffs does not represent a disproportionate burden for consumers. The national regulatory authorities should also avoid the risks of double support for projects by taking into account actual or estimated charges and revenues. Those charges and revenues should be taken into account only insofar as they are designed to cover the costs concerned and as much as possible related to the projects. When an investment request takes into account benefits beyond the borders of the Member States concerned, the national regulatory authorities should consult the TSOs concerned on the project-specific cost-benefit analysis.\n(38)\nThe existing internal energy market law requires that tariffs for access to gas and electricity networks provide appropriate incentives for investment. When applying the internal energy market law, national regulatory authorities should ensure a stable and predictable regulatory framework with incentives for projects of common interest, including long-term incentives, that are commensurate with the level of specific risk of the project. This applies in particular to innovative transmission technologies for electricity allowing for large scale integration of renewable energy, of distributed energy resources or of demand response in interconnected networks, and to gas transmission infrastructure offering advanced capacity or additional flexibility to the market to allow for short-term trading or back-up supply in case of supply disruptions.\n(39)\nThis Regulation applies only to the granting of permits for, public participation in, and the regulatory treatment of projects of common interest within the meaning set out herein. Member States may nevertheless apply, by virtue of their national law, the same or similar rules to other projects which do not have the status of projects of common interest within the scope of this Regulation. As regards the regulatory incentives, Member States may apply, by virtue of their national law, the same or similar rules to projects of common interest falling under the category of electricity storage.\n(40)\nMember States that currently do not provide for a legal status of the highest national significance possible that is attributable to energy infrastructure projects in the context of permit granting processes should consider introducing such a status, in particular by evaluating if this would lead to a quicker permit granting process.\n(41)\nThe European Energy Programme for Recovery (EEPR), established by Regulation (EC) No 663/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council (19) has demonstrated the added value of leveraging private funding through significant Union financial assistance to allow the implementation of projects of European significance. The European Council of 4 February 2011 recognised that some energy infrastructure projects may require limited public finance to leverage private funding. In the light of the economic and financial crisis and budgetary constraints, targeted support, through grants and financial instruments, should be developed under the next multiannual financial framework, which will attract new investors into the energy infrastructure priority corridors and areas, while keeping the budgetary contribution of the Union to a minimum. The relevant measures should draw on the experience gained during the pilot phase following the introduction of project bonds to finance infrastructure projects.\n(42)\nProjects of common interest in the fields of electricity, gas and carbon dioxide should be eligible to receive Union financial assistance for studies and, under certain conditions, for works as soon as such funding becomes available under the relevant Regulation on a Connecting Europe Facility in the form of grants or in the form of innovative financial instruments. This will ensure that tailor-made support can be provided to those projects of common interest which are not viable under the existing regulatory framework and market conditions. It is important to avoid any distortion of competition, in particular between projects contributing to the achievement of the same Union priority corridor. Such financial assistance should ensure the necessary synergies with the Structural Funds, which will finance smart energy distribution networks of local or regional importance. A three-step logic applies to investments in projects of common interest. First, the market should have the priority to invest. Second, if investments are not made by the market, regulatory solutions should be explored, if necessary the relevant regulatory framework should be adjusted, and the correct application of the relevant regulatory framework should be ensured. Third, where the first two steps are not sufficient to deliver the necessary investments in projects of common interest, Union financial assistance could be granted if the project of common interest fulfils the applicable eligibility criteria.\n(43)\nSince the objective of this Regulation, namely the development and interoperability of trans-European energy networks and connection to such networks, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve that objective.\n(44)\nRegulations (EC) No 713/2009, (EC) No 714/2009 and (EC) No 715/2009 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(45)\nDecision No 1364/2006/EC should therefore be repealed,\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nCHAPTER I\nGENERAL PROVISIONS\nArticle 1\nSubject matter and scope\n1.   This Regulation lays down guidelines for the timely development and interoperability of priority corridors and areas of trans-European energy infrastructure set out in Annex I (‘energy infrastructure priority corridors and areas’).\n2.

This Regulation establishes twelve Regional Groups (‘Groups’) as set out in Annex III.1. The membership of each Group shall be based on each priority corridor and area and their respective geographical coverage as set out in Annex I. Decision-making powers in the Groups shall be restricted to Member States and the Commission, who shall, for those purposes, be referred to as the decision-making body of the Groups.\n2.   Each Group shall adopt its own rules of procedure, having regard to the provisions set out in Annex III.\n3.   The decision-making body of each Group shall adopt a regional list of proposed projects of common interest drawn up according to the process set out in Annex III.2, according to the contribution of each project to implementing the energy infrastructure priority corridors and areas and according to their fulfilment of the criteria set out in Article 4.\nWhen a Group draws up its regional list:\n(a)\neach individual proposal for a project of common interest shall require the approval of the Member States, to whose territory the project relates; if a Member State decides not to give its approval, it shall present its substantiated reasons for doing so to the Group concerned;\n(b)\nit shall take into account advice from the Commission that is aimed at having a manageable total number of projects of common interest.\n4.   The Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 16 that establish the Union list of projects of common interest (‘Union list’), subject to the second paragraph of Article 172 of the TFEU. The Union list shall take the form of an annex to this Regulation.\nIn exercising its power, the Commission shall ensure that the Union list is established every two years, on the basis of the regional lists adopted by the decision-making bodies of the Groups as established in Annex III.1(2), following the procedure set out in paragraph 3 of this Article.\nThe first Union list shall be adopted by 30 September 2013.\n5.

Projects of common interest included on the Union list pursuant to paragraph 4 of this Article shall become an integral part of the relevant regional investment plans under Article 12 of Regulations (EC) No 714/2009 and (EC) No 715/2009 and of the relevant national 10-year network development plans under Article 22 of Directives 2009/72/EC and 2009/73/EC and other national infrastructure plans concerned, as appropriate. Those projects shall be conferred the highest possible priority within each of those plans.\nArticle 4\nCriteria for projects of common interest\n1.   Projects of common interest shall meet the following general criteria:\n(a)\nthe project is necessary for at least one of the energy infrastructure priority corridors and areas;\n(b)\nthe potential overall benefits of the project, assessed according to the respective specific criteria in paragraph 2, outweigh its costs, including in the longer term; and\n(c)\nthe project meets any of the following criteria:\n(i)\ninvolves at least two Member States by directly crossing the border of two or more Member States;\n(ii)\nis located on the territory of one Member State and has a significant cross-border impact as set out in Annex IV.1;\n(iii)\ncrosses the border of at least one Member State and a European Economic Area country.\n2.   The following specific criteria shall apply to projects of common interest falling within specific energy infrastructure categories:\n(a)\nfor electricity transmission and storage projects falling under the energy infrastructure categories set out in Annex II.1(a) to (d), the project is to contribute significantly to at least one of the following specific criteria:\n(i)\nmarket integration, inter alia through lifting the isolation of at least one Member State and reducing energy infrastructure bottlenecks; competition and system flexibility;\n(ii)\nsustainability, inter alia through the integration of renewable energy into the grid and the transmission of renewable generation to major consumption centres and storage sites;\n(iii)\nsecurity of supply, inter alia through interoperability, appropriate connections and secure and reliable system operation;\n(b)\nfor gas projects falling under the energy infrastructure categories set out in Annex II.2, the project is to contribute significantly to at least one of the following specific criteria:\n(i)\nmarket integration, inter alia through lifting the isolation of at least one Member State and reducing energy infrastructure bottlenecks; interoperability and system flexibility;\n(ii)\nsecurity of supply, inter alia through appropriate connections and diversification of supply sources, supplying counterparts and routes;\n(iii)\ncompetition, inter alia through diversification of supply sources, supplying counterparts and routes;\n(iv)\nsustainability, inter alia through reducing emissions, supporting intermittent renewable generation and enhancing deployment of renewable gas;\n(c)\nfor electricity smart grid projects falling under the energy infrastructure category set out in Annex II.1(e), the project is to contribute significantly to all of the following specific criteria:\n(i)\nintegration and involvement of network users with new technical requirements with regard to their electricity supply and demand;\n(ii)\nefficiency and interoperability of electricity transmission and distribution in day-to-day network operation;\n(iii)\nnetwork security, system control and quality of supply;\n(iv)\noptimised planning of future cost-efficient network investments;\n(v)\nmarket functioning and customer services;\n(vi)\ninvolvement of users in the management of their energy usage;\n(d)\nfor oil transport projects falling under the energy infrastructure categories set out in Annex II.3, the project is to contribute significantly to all of the following specific criteria:\n(i)\nsecurity of supply reducing single supply source or route dependency;\n(ii)\nefficient and sustainable use of resources through mitigation of environmental risks;\n(iii)\ninteroperability;\n(e)\nfor carbon dioxide transport projects falling under the energy infrastructure categories set out in Annex II.4, the project is contribute significantly to all of the following specific criteria:\n(i)\nthe avoidance of carbon dioxide emissions while maintaining security of energy supply;\n(ii)\nincreasing the resilience and security of carbon dioxide transport;\n(iii)\nthe efficient use of resources, by enabling the connection of multiple carbon dioxide sources and storage sites via common infrastructure and minimising environmental burden and risks.\n3.   For projects falling under the energy infrastructure categories set out in Annex II.1 to 3, the criteria listed in this Article shall be assessed in accordance with the indicators set out in Annex IV.2 to 5.\n4.   In order to facilitate the assessing of all projects that could be eligible as projects of common interest and that could be included in a regional list, each Group shall assess each project’s contribution to the implementation of the same priority corridor or area in a transparent and objective manner. Each Group shall determine its assessment method on the basis of the aggregated contribution to the criteria referred to in paragraph 2; this assessment shall lead to a ranking of projects for internal use of the Group. Neither the regional list nor the Union list shall contain any ranking, nor shall the ranking be used for any subsequent purpose except as described in Annex III.2(14).\nWhen assessing projects, each Group shall furthermore give due consideration to:\n(a)\nthe urgency of each proposed project in order to meet the Union energy policy targets of market integration, inter alia through lifting the isolation of at least one Member State and competition, sustainability and security of supply;\n(b)\nthe number of Member States affected by each project, whilst ensuring equal opportunities for projects involving peripheral Member States;\n(c)\nthe contribution of each project to territorial cohesion; and\n(d)\ncomplementarity with regard to other proposed projects.\nFor smart grids projects falling under the energy infrastructure category set out in Annex II.1(e), ranking shall be carried out for those projects that affect the same two Member States, and due consideration shall also be given to the number of users affected by the project, the annual energy consumption and the share of generation from non-dispatchable resources in the area covered by these users.\nArticle 5\nImplementation and monitoring\n1.   Project promoters shall draw up an implementation plan for projects of common interest, including a timetable for each of the following:\n(a)\nfeasibility and design studies;\n(b)\napproval by the national regulatory authority or by any other authority concerned;\n(c)\nconstruction and commissioning;\n(d)\nthe permit granting schedule referred to in Article 10(4)(b).\n2.   TSOs, distribution system operators and other operators shall co-operate with each other in order to facilitate the development of projects of common interest in their area.\n3.   The Agency and the Groups concerned shall monitor the progress achieved in implementing the projects of common interest and, if necessary, make recommendations to facilitate the implementation of projects of common interest. The Groups may request that additional information be provided in accordance with paragraphs 4, 5 and 6, convene meetings with the relevant parties and invite the Commission to verify the information provided on site.\n4.   By 31 March of each year following the year of inclusion of a project of common interest on the Union list pursuant to Article 3, project promoters shall submit an annual report, for each project falling under the categories set out in Annex II.1 and 2, to the competent authority referred to in Article 8 and either to the Agency or, for projects falling under the categories set out in Annex II.3 and 4, to the respective Group. That report shall give details of:\n(a)\nthe progress achieved in the development, construction and commissioning of the project, in particular with regard to permit granting and consultation procedures;\n(b)\nwhere relevant, delays compared to the implementation plan, the reasons for such delays and other difficulties encountered;\n(c)\nwhere relevant, a revised plan aiming at overcoming the delays.\n5.   Within three months of the receipt of the annual reports referred to in paragraph 4 of this Article, the Agency shall submit to the Groups a consolidated report for the projects of common interest falling under the categories set out in Annex II.1 and 2, evaluating the progress achieved and make, where appropriate, recommendations on how to overcome the delays and difficulties encountered. That consolidated report shall also evaluate, in accordance with Article 6(8) and (9) of Regulation (EC) No 713/2009, the consistent implementation of the Union-wide network development plans with regard to the energy infrastructure priority corridors and areas.\n6.   Each year, the competent authorities referred to in Article 8 shall report to the respective Group on the progress and, where relevant, on delays in the implementation of projects of common interest located on their respective territory with regard to the permit granting processes, and on the reasons for such delays.\n7.   If the commissioning of a project of common interest is delayed compared to the implementation plan, other than for overriding reasons beyond the control of the project promoter:\n(a)\nin so far as measures referred to in Article 22(7)(a), (b) or (c) of Directives 2009/72/EC and 2009/73/EC are applicable according to respective national laws, national regulatory authorities shall ensure that the investment is carried out;\n(b)\nif the measures of national regulatory authorities according to point (a) are not applicable, the project promoter shall choose a third party to finance or construct all or part of the project. The project promoter shall do so before the delay compared to the date of commissioning in the implementation plan exceeds two years;\n(c)\nif a third party is not chosen according to point (b), the Member State or, when the Member State has so provided, the national regulatory authority may, within two months of the expiry of the period referred to in point (b), designate a third party to finance or construct the project which the project promoter shall accept;\n(d)\nif the delay compared to the date of commissioning in the implementation plan exceeds two years and two months, the Commission, subject to the agreement and with the full cooperation of the Member States concerned, may launch a call for proposals open to any third party capable of becoming a project promoter to build the project according to an agreed timeline;\n(e)\nwhen points (c) or (d) are applied, the system operator in whose area the investment is located shall provide the implementing operators or investors or third party with all the information needed to realise the investment, shall connect new assets to the transmission network and shall generally make its best efforts to facilitate the implementation of the investment and the secure, reliable and efficient operation and maintenance of the project of common interest.\n8.   A project of common interest may be removed from the Union list according to the procedure set out in Article 3(4) if its inclusion in that list was based on incorrect information which was a determining factor for that inclusion, or the project does not comply with Union law.\n9.   Projects which are no longer on the Union list shall lose all rights and obligations linked to the status of project of common interest arising from this Regulation.\nHowever, a project which is no longer on the Union list but for which an application file has been accepted for examination by the competent authority shall maintain the rights and obligations arising from Chapter III, except where the project is no longer on the list for the reasons set out in paragraph 8.\n10.   This Article shall be without prejudice to any Union financial assistance granted to any project of common interest prior to its removal from the Union list.\nArticle 6\nEuropean coordinators\n1.   Where a project of common interest encounters significant implementation difficulties, the Commission may designate, in agreement with the Member States concerned, a European coordinator for a period of up to one year renewable twice.\n2.   The European coordinator shall:\n(a)\npromote the projects, for which he has been designated European coordinator and the cross-border dialogue between the project promoters and all concerned stakeholders;\n(b)\nassist all parties as necessary in consulting concerned stakeholders and obtaining necessary permits for the projects;\n(c)\nif appropriate, advise project promoters on the financing of the project;\n(d)\nensure that appropriate support and strategic direction by the Member States concerned are provided for the preparation and implementation of the projects;\n(e)\nsubmit every year, and if appropriate, upon completion of their mandate, a report to the Commission on the progress of the projects and on any difficulties and obstacles which are likely to significantly delay the commissioning date of the projects. The Commission shall transmit the report to the European Parliament and the Groups concerned.\n3.   The European coordinator shall be chosen on the basis of his experience with regard to the specific tasks assigned to him for the projects concerned.\n4.   The decision designating the European coordinator shall specify the terms of reference, detailing the duration of the mandate, the specific tasks and corresponding deadlines, and the methodology to be followed. The coordination effort shall be proportionate to the complexity and estimated costs of the projects.\n5.   The Member States concerned shall fully cooperate with the European coordinator in his execution of the tasks referred to in paragraphs 2 and 4.\nCHAPTER III\nPERMIT GRANTING AND PUBLIC PARTICIPATION\nArticle 7\n‘Priority status’ of projects of common interest\n1.   The adoption of the Union list shall establish, for the purposes of any decisions issued in the permit granting process, the necessity of these projects from an energy policy perspective, without prejudice to the exact location, routing or technology of the project.\n2.   For the purpose of ensuring efficient administrative processing of the application files related to projects of common interest, project promoters and all authorities concerned shall ensure that the most rapid treatment legally possible is given to these files.\n3.   Where such status exists in national law, projects of common interest shall be allocated the status of the highest national significance possible and be treated as such in permit granting processes — and if national law so provides, in spatial planning — including those relating to environmental assessments, in the manner such treatment is provided for in national law applicable to the corresponding type of energy infrastructure.\n4.   By 16 August 2013, the Commission shall issue non-binding guidance to support Member States in defining adequate legislative and non-legislative measures to streamline the environmental assessment procedures and to ensure the coherent application of environmental assessment procedures required under Union law for projects of common interest.\n5.   Member States shall assess, taking due account of the guidance referred to in paragraph 4, which measures to streamline the environmental assessment procedures and to ensure their coherent application are possible, and shall inform the Commission of the result.\n6.   By nine months from the date of issue of the guidance referred to in paragraph 4, Member States shall take the non-legislative measures that they have identified under paragraph 5.\n7.   By 24 months from the date of issue of the guidance referred to in paragraph 4, Member States shall take the legislative measures that they have identified under paragraph 5. These measures shall be without prejudice to obligations resulting from Union law.\n8.   With regard to the environmental impacts addressed in Article 6(4) of Directive 92/43/EEC and Article 4(7) of Directive 2000/60/EC, projects of common interest shall be considered as being of public interest from an energy policy perspective, and may be considered as being of overriding public interest, provided that all the conditions set out in these Directives are fulfilled.\nShould the opinion of the Commission be required in accordance with Directive 92/43/EEC, the Commission and the competent authority referred to in Article 9 of this Regulation shall ensure that the decision with regard to the overriding public interest of a project is taken within the time limit pursuant to Article 10(1) of this Regulation.\nArticle 8\nOrganisation of the permit granting process\n1.   By 16 November 2013, each Member State shall designate one national competent authority which shall be responsible for facilitating and coordinating the permit granting process for projects of common interest.\n2.   The responsibility of the competent authority referred to in paragraph 1 and/or the tasks related to it may be delegated to, or carried out by, another authority, per project of common interest or per particular category of projects of common interest, provided that:\n(a)\nthe competent authority notifies the Commission of that delegation and the information therein is published by either the competent authority or the project promoter on the website referred to in Article 9(7);\n(b)\nonly one authority is responsible per project of common interest, is the sole point of contact for the project promoter in the process leading to the comprehensive decision for a given project of common interest, and coordinates the submission of all relevant documents and information.\nThe competent authority may retain the responsibility to establish time limits, without prejudice to the time limits set in accordance with Article 10.\n3.   Without prejudice to relevant requirements under international and Union law, the competent authority shall take actions to facilitate the issuing of the comprehensive decision. The comprehensive decision shall be issued within the time limit referred to in Article 10(1) and (2) and according to one of the following schemes:\n(a)   integrated scheme: the comprehensive decision shall be issued by the competent authority and shall be the sole legally binding decision resulting from the statutory permit granting procedure. Where other authorities are concerned by the project, they may, in accordance with national law, give their opinion as input to the procedure, which shall be taken into account by the competent authority;\n(b)   coordinated scheme: the comprehensive decision comprises multiple individual legally binding decisions issued by several authorities concerned, which shall be coordinated by the competent authority. The competent authority may establish a working group where all concerned authorities are represented in order to draw up a permit granting schedule in accordance with Article 10(4)(b), and to monitor and coordinate its implementation. The competent authority shall, in consultation with the other authorities concerned, where applicable in accordance with national law, and without prejudice to time limits set in accordance with Article 10, establish on a case-by-case basis a reasonable time limit within which the individual decisions shall be issued. The competent authority may take an individual decision on behalf of another national authority concerned, if the decision by that authority is not delivered within the time limit and if the delay cannot be adequately justified; or, where provided under national law, and to the extent that this is compatible with Union law, the competent authority may consider that another national authority concerned has either given its approval or refusal for the project if the decision by that authority is not delivered within the time limit. Where provided under national law, the competent authority may disregard an individual decision of another national authority concerned if it considers that the decision is not sufficiently substantiated with regard to the underlying evidence presented by the national authority concerned; when doing so, the competent authority shall ensure that the relevant requirements under international and Union law are respected and shall duly justify its decision;\n(c)   collaborative scheme: the comprehensive decision shall be coordinated by the competent authority. The competent authority shall, in consultation with the other authorities concerned, where applicable in accordance with national law, and without prejudice to time limits set in accordance with Article 10, establish on a case-by-case basis a reasonable time limit within which the individual decisions shall be issued. It shall monitor compliance with the time limits by the authorities concerned.\nIf an individual decision by an authority concerned is not expected to be delivered within the time limit, that authority shall inform the competent authority without delay and include a justification for the delay. Subsequently, the competent authority shall reset the time limit within which that individual decision shall be issued, whilst still complying with the overall time limits set in accordance with Article 10.\nAcknowledging the national specificities in planning and permit granting processes, Member States may choose among the three schemes referred to in points (a), (b) and (c) of the first subparagraph to facilitate and coordinate their procedures and shall opt to implement the most effective scheme. Where a Member State chooses the collaborative scheme, it shall inform the Commission of its reasons therefor. The Commission shall undertake an evaluation of the effectiveness of the schemes in the report referred to in Article 17.\n4.   Member States may apply different schemes as set out in paragraph 3 to onshore and offshore projects of common interest.\n5.   If a project of common interest requires decisions to be taken in two or more Member States, the respective competent authorities shall take all necessary steps for efficient and effective cooperation and coordination among themselves, including as regards the provisions referred to in Article 10(4). Member States shall endeavour to provide for joint procedures, particularly with regard to the assessment of environmental impacts.\nArticle 9\nTransparency and public participation\n1.   By 16 May 2014, the Member State or competent authority shall, where applicable in collaboration with other authorities concerned, publish a manual of procedures for the permit granting process applicable to projects of common interest. The manual shall be updated as necessary and made available to the public. The manual shall at least include the information specified in Annex VI.1. The manual shall not be legally binding, but it may refer to or quote relevant legal provisions.\n2.   Without prejudice to any requirements under the Aarhus and Espoo Conventions and relevant Union law, all parties involved in the permit granting process shall follow the principles for public participation set out in of Annex VI.3.\n3.   The project promoter shall, within an indicative period of three months of the start of the permit granting process pursuant to Article 10(1)(a), draw up and submit a concept for public participation to the competent authority, following the process outlined in the manual referred to in paragraph 1 and in line with the guidelines set out in Annex VI. The competent authority shall request modifications or approve the concept for public participation within three months; in so doing, the competent authority shall take into consideration any form of public participation and consultation that took place before the start of the permit granting process, to the extent that such public participation and consultation has fulfilled the requirements of this Article.\nWhere the project promoter intends to make significant changes to an approved concept, it shall inform the competent authority thereof. In that case the competent authority may request modifications.\n4.   At least one public consultation shall be carried out by the project promoter, or, where required by national law, by the competent authority, before submission of the final and complete application file to the competent authority pursuant to Article 10(1)(a). This shall be without prejudice to any public consultation to be carried out after submission of the request for development consent according to Article 6(2) of Directive 2011/92/EU. The public consultation shall inform stakeholders referred to in Annex VI.3(a) about the project at an early stage and shall help to identify the most suitable location or trajectory and the relevant issues to be addressed in the application file. The minimum requirements applicable to this public consultation are specified in Annex VI.5.\nThe project promoter shall prepare a report summarising the results of activities related to the participation of the public prior to the submission of the application file, including those activities that took place before the start of the permit granting process. The project promoter shall submit that report together with the application file to the competent authority. Due account shall be taken of these results in the comprehensive decision.\n5.   For projects crossing the border of two or more Member States, the public consultations pursuant to paragraph 4 in each of the Member States concerned shall take place within a period of no more than two months from the date on which the first public consultation started.\n6.   For projects likely to have significant adverse cross-border impacts in one or more neighbouring Member States, where Article 7 of Directive 2011/92/EU and the Espoo Convention are applicable, the relevant information shall be made available to the competent authority of the neighbouring Member States. The competent authority of the neighbouring Member States shall indicate, in the notification process where appropriate, whether it, or any other authority concerned, wishes to participate in the relevant public consultation procedures.\n7.   The project promoter, or, where national law so provides, the competent authority, shall establish and regularly update a website with relevant information about the project of common interest, which shall be linked to the Commission website and which shall meet the requirements specified in Annex VI.6. Commercially sensitive information shall be kept confidential.\nProject promoters shall also publish relevant information by other appropriate information means to which the public has open access.\nArticle 10\nDuration and implementation of the permit granting process\n1.   The permit granting process shall consist of two procedures:\n(a)\nThe pre-application procedure, covering the period between the start of the permit granting process and the acceptance of the submitted application file by the competent authority, shall take place within an indicative period of two years.\nThis procedure shall include the preparation of any environmental reports to be prepared by the project promoters.\nFor the purpose of establishing the start of the permit granting process, the project promoters shall notify the project to the competent authority of the Member States concerned in written form, and shall include a reasonably detailed outline of the project. No later than three months following the receipt of the notification, the competent authority shall, including on behalf of other authorities concerned, acknowledge or, if it considers the project as not mature enough to enter the permit granting process, reject the notification in written form. In the event of a rejection, the competent authority shall justify its decision, including on behalf of other authorities concerned. The date of signature of the acknowledgement of the notification by the competent authority shall serve as the start of the permit granting process. Where two or more Member States are concerned, the date of the acceptance of the last notification by the competent authority concerned shall serve as the date of the start of the permit granting process.\n(b)\nThe statutory permit granting procedure, covering the period from the date of acceptance of the submitted application file until the comprehensive decision is taken, shall not exceed one year and six months. Member States may set an earlier date for the time-limit, if considered appropriate.\n2.   The combined duration of the two procedures referred to in paragraph 1 shall not exceed a period of three years and six months. However, where the competent authority considers that one or both of the two procedures of the permit granting process will not be completed before the time limits as set out in paragraph 1, it may decide, before their expiry and on a case by case basis, to extend one or both of those time limits by a maximum of nine months for both procedures combined.\nIn that case, the competent authority shall inform the Group concerned and present to the Group concerned the measures taken or to be taken to conclude the permit granting process with the least possible delay. The Group may request the competent authority to report regularly on progress achieved in this regard.\n3.   In Member States where the determination of a route or location undertaken solely for the specific purpose of a planned project, including the planning of specific corridors for grid infrastructures, cannot be included in the process leading to the comprehensive decision, the corresponding decision shall be taken within a separate period of six months, starting on the date of submission of the final and complete application documents by the promoter.\nIn that case, the extension period referred to in paragraph 2 shall be reduced to six months, including for the procedure referred to in this paragraph.\n4.   The pre-application procedure shall comprise the following steps:\n(a)\nupon the acknowledgement of the notification pursuant to paragraph 1(a), the competent authority shall identify, in close cooperation with the other authorities concerned, and where appropriate on the basis of a proposal by the project promoter, the scope of material and level of detail of information to be submitted by the project promoter, as part of the application file, to apply for the comprehensive decision. The checklist referred to in Annex VI.1(e) shall serve as a basis for this identification;\n(b)\nthe competent authority shall draw up, in close cooperation with the project promoter and other authorities concerned and taking into account the results of the activities carried out under point (a), a detailed schedule for the permit granting process in line with the guidelines set out in Annex VI.(2);\nFor projects crossing the border between two or more Member States, the competent authorities of the Member States concerned shall prepare a joint schedule, in which they endeavour to align their timetables;\n(c)\nupon receipt of the draft application file, the competent authority shall, if necessary, and including on behalf of other authorities concerned, make further requests regarding missing information to be submitted by the project promoter, which may only address subjects identified under point (a). Within three months of the submission of the missing information, the competent authority shall accept for examination the application in written form. Requests for additional information may only be made if they are justified by new circumstances.\n5.   The project promoter shall ensure the completeness and adequate quality of the application file and seek the competent authority’s opinion on this as early as possible during the pre-application procedure. The project promoter shall cooperate fully with the competent authority to meet deadlines and comply with the detailed schedule as defined in paragraph 4(b).\n6.   The time limits laid down in this Article shall be without prejudice to obligations arising from international and Union law, and without prejudice to administrative appeal procedures and judicial remedies before a court or tribunal.\nCHAPTER IV\nREGULATORY TREATMENT\nArticle 11\nEnergy system wide cost-benefit analysis\n1.   By 16 November 2013, the European Network of Transmission System Operators (ENTSO) for Electricity and the ENTSO for Gas shall publish and submit to Member States, the Commission and the Agency their respective methodologies, including on network and market modelling, for a harmonised energy system-wide cost-benefit analysis at Union level for projects of common interest falling under the categories set out in Annex II.1(a) to (d) and Annex II.2. Those methodologies shall be applied for the preparation of each subsequent 10-year network development plan developed by the ENTSO for Electricity or the ENTSO for Gas pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 714/2009 and Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 715/2009. The methodologies shall be drawn up in line with the principles laid down in Annex V and be consistent with the rules and indicators set out in Annex IV.\nPrior to submitting their respective methodologies, the ENTSO for Electricity and the ENTSO for Gas shall conduct an extensive consultation process involving at least the organisations representing all relevant stakeholders — and, if deemed appropriate, the stakeholders themselves — national regulatory authorities and other national authorities.\n2.   Within three months of the day of receipt of the methodologies, the Agency shall provide an opinion to Member States and the Commission on the methodologies and publish it.\n3.   Within three months of the receipt of the opinion of the Agency, the Commission shall, and Member States may, deliver an opinion on the methodologies. The opinions shall be submitted to the ENTSO for Electricity or the ENTSO for Gas.\n4.   Within three months of the day of receipt of the last opinion received under paragraph 3, the ENTSO for Electricity and the ENTSO for Gas shall adapt their methodologies taking due account of the opinions received from Member States, the Commission’s opinion and the Agency’s opinion, and submit them to the Commission for approval.\n5.   Within two weeks of the approval by the Commission, the ENTSO for Electricity and the ENTSO for Gas shall publish their respective methodologies on their websites. They shall transmit the corresponding input data sets as defined in Annex V.1 and other relevant network, load flow and market data in a sufficiently accurate form according to national law and relevant confidentiality agreements to the Commission and the Agency, upon request. The data shall be valid at the date of the request. The Commission and the Agency shall ensure the confidential treatment of the data received, by themselves and by any party carrying out analytical work for them on the basis of those data.\n6.   The methodologies shall be updated and improved regularly in accordance with paragraphs 1 to 5. The Agency, on its own initiative or upon a duly reasoned request by national regulatory authorities or stakeholders, and after formally consulting the organisations representing all relevant stakeholders and the Commission, may request such updates and improvements with due justification and timescales. The Agency shall publish the requests by national regulatory authorities or stakeholders and all relevant non-commercially sensitive documents leading to a request from the Agency for an update or improvement.\n7.   By 16 May 2015, national regulatory authorities cooperating in the framework of the Agency shall establish and make publicly available a set of indicators and corresponding reference values for the comparison of unit investment costs for comparable projects of the infrastructure categories included in Annex II.1 and 2. Those reference values may be used by the ENTSO for Electricity and the ENTSO for Gas for the cost-benefit analyses carried out for subsequent 10-year network development plans.\n8.   By 31 December 2016, the ENTSO for Electricity and the ENTSO for Gas shall jointly submit to the Commission and the Agency a consistent and interlinked electricity and gas market and network model including both electricity and gas transmission infrastructure as well as storage and LNG facilities, covering the energy infrastructure priority corridors and areas and drawn up in line with the principles laid down in Annex V. After approval of this model by the Commission according to the procedure set out in paragraphs 2 to 4, it shall be included in the methodologies.\nArticle 12\nEnabling investments with cross-border impacts\n1.   The efficiently incurred investment costs, which excludes maintenance costs, related to a project of common interest falling under the categories set out in Annex II.1(a), (b) and (d) and Annex II.2 shall be borne by the relevant TSO or the project promoters of the transmission infrastructure of the Member States to which the project provides a net positive impact, and, to the extent not covered by congestion rents or other charges, be paid for by network users through tariffs for network access in that or those Member States.\n2.   For a project of common interest falling under the categories set out in Annex II.1(a), (b) and (d) and Annex II.2, paragraph 1 shall apply only if at least one project promoter requests the relevant national authorities to apply this Article for all or parts of the costs of the project. For a project of common interest falling under the categories set out in Annex II.2, paragraph 1 shall apply only where an assessment of market demand has already been carried out and indicated that the efficiently incurred investment costs cannot be expected to be covered by the tariffs.\nWhere a project has several project promoters, the relevant national regulatory authorities shall without delay request all project promoters to submit the investment request jointly in accordance with paragraph 3.\n3.   For a project of common interest to which paragraph 1 applies, the project promoters shall keep all concerned national regulatory authorities regularly informed, at least once per year, and until the project is commissioned, of the progress of that project and the identification of costs and impacts associated with it.\nAs soon as such a project has reached sufficient maturity, the project promoters, after having consulted the TSOs from the Member States to which the project provides a significant net positive impact, shall submit an investment request. That investment request shall include a request for a cross-border cost allocation and shall be submitted to all the national regulatory authorities concerned, accompanied by the following:\n(a)\na project-specific cost-benefit analysis consistent with the methodology drawn up pursuant to Article 11 and taking into account benefits beyond the borders of the Member State concerned;\n(b)\na business plan evaluating the financial viability of the project, including the chosen financing solution, and, for a project of common interest falling under the category referred to in Annex II.2, the results of market testing; and\n(c)\nif the project promoters agree, a substantiated proposal for a cross-border cost allocation.\nIf a project is promoted by several project promoters, they shall submit their investment request jointly.\nFor projects included in the first Union list, project promoters shall submit their investment request by 31 October 2013.\nA copy of each investment request shall be transmitted for information without delay by the national regulatory authorities to the Agency on receipt.\nThe national regulatory authorities and the Agency shall preserve the confidentiality of commercially sensitive information.\n4.   Within six months of the date on which the last investment request was received by the national regulatory authorities concerned, the national regulatory authorities shall, after consulting the project promoters concerned, take coordinated decisions on the allocation of investment costs to be borne by each system operator for the project, as well as their inclusion in tariffs. The national regulatory authorities may decide to allocate only part of the costs, or may decide to allocate costs among a package of several projects of common interest.\nWhen allocating the costs, the national regulatory authorities shall take into account actual or estimated:\n—\ncongestion rents or other charges,\n—\nrevenues stemming from the inter-transmission system operator compensation mechanism established under Article 13 of Regulation (EC) No 714/2009.\nIn deciding to allocate costs across borders, the economic, social and environmental costs and benefits of the projects in the Member States concerned and the possible need for financial support shall be taken into account.\nIn deciding to allocate costs across borders, the relevant national regulatory authorities, in consultation with the TSOs concerned, shall seek a mutual agreement based on, but not limited to, the information specified in paragraph 3(a) and (b).\nIf a project of common interest mitigates negative externalities, such as loop flows, and that project of common interest is implemented in the Member State at the origin of the negative externality, such mitigation shall not be regarded as a cross-border benefit and shall therefore not constitute a basis for allocating costs to the TSO of the Member States affected by those negative externalities.\n5.   National regulatory authorities shall, based on the cross-border cost allocation as referred to in paragraph 4 of this Article, take into account actual costs incurred by a TSO or other project promoter as a result of the investments when fixing or approving tariffs in accordance with Article 37(1)(a) of Directive 2009/72/EC and Article 41(1)(a) of Directive 2009/73/EC, insofar as these costs correspond to those of an efficient and structurally comparable operator.\nThe cost allocation decision shall be notified, without delay, by the national regulatory authorities to the Agency, together with all the relevant information with respect to the decision. In particular, the information shall contain detailed reasons on the basis of which costs were allocated among Member States, such as the following:\n(a)\nan evaluation of the identified impacts, including concerning network tariffs, on each of the concerned Member States;\n(b)\nan evaluation of the business plan referred to in paragraph 3(b);\n(c)\nregional or Union-wide positive externalities, which the project would generate;\n(d)\nthe result of the consultation of the project promoters concerned.\nThe cost allocation decision shall be published.\n6.   Where the national regulatory authorities concerned have not reached an agreement on the investment request within six months of the date on which the request was received by the last of the national regulatory authorities concerned, they shall inform the Agency without delay.\nIn this case or upon a joint request from the national regulatory authorities concerned, the decision on the investment request including cross-border cost allocation referred to in paragraph 3 as well as the way the cost of the investments are reflected in the tariffs shall be taken by the Agency within three months of the date of referral to the Agency.\nBefore taking such a decision, the Agency shall consult the national regulatory authorities concerned and the project promoters. The three-month period referred to in the second subparagraph may be extended by an additional period of two months where further information is sought by the Agency. That additional period shall begin on the day following receipt of the complete information.\nThe cost allocation decision shall be published. Articles 19 and 20 of Regulation (EC) No 713/2009 shall be applicable.\n7.   A copy of all cost allocation decisions, together with all the relevant information with respect to each decision, shall be notified, without delay, by the Agency to the Commission.

The Commission reserves the right to make proposals in this direction based on the experience gained from the monitoring of the implementation of projects of common interest in the context of the report foreseen in Article 17 of the Regulation on guidelines for trans-European energy infrastructures.\n(1)  See page 39 of this Official Journal.", "summary": "Guidelines for trans-European energy infrastructure\nGuidelines for trans-European energy infrastructure\nThis EU regulation lays down guidelines to develop priority corridors and areas of trans-European energy infrastructure in a timely fashion.\nSUMMARY\n            \nIn April 2013, the EU guidelines for the development of European energy infrastructure were approved.\nOne of the priorities of the Europe 2020 strategy is sustainable growth to be achieved by promoting a more resource-efficient, more sustainable and more competitive economy. That strategy put energy infrastructure at the forefront of this effort by underlining the need to urgently upgrade Europe’s networks, interconnecting them at the continental level, in particular to integrate renewable energy sources.\nThe essential background to this is that EU Member States agreed in 2011 that:\nEurope’s energy infrastructure needs to be modernised and expanded;\nnetworks across borders need to be interconnected;\nthere is a need to provide for alternative supply or transit routes;\nthere is a need for alternative sources of energy, including renewables;\nno EU country should remain isolated from the European gas and electricity networks after 2015 or see its energy security jeopardised by lack of the appropriate connections.\nThe guidelines established 12 regional groups for trans-European energy infrastructure (TEN-E), which selected projects.\nIn October 2013, the Commission adopted a list of 248 key energy infrastructure projects (projects of common interest), which will benefit from faster and more efficient permit granting procedures and improved regulatory treatment.\nThe projects may also have access to financial support from the Connecting Europe Facility(CEF), under which almost EUR 6 billion has been allocated to TEN-E up to 2020.\nFor a project to be included in the list, it has to:\nhave significant benefits for at leasttwoEU Member States ;\ncontribute to market integration and further competition;\nenhance security of supply;\nreduce CO2emissions.\nA new EU list will be established every 2 years.\nThe guidelines state that projects of common interest should be implemented as quickly as possible and closely monitored and evaluated, while keeping the administrative burden for project promoters to a minimum.\nIt adds that the Commission should nominate European coordinators for projects facing particular difficulties.\nACT\n            \nRegulation (EU) No 347/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council on guidelines for trans-European energy infrastructure and repealing Decision No 1364/2006/EC and amending Regulations (EC) No 713/2009, (EC) No 714/2009 and (EC) No 715/2009\nREFERENCES\nAct\nEntry into force\nDeadline for transposition in the Member States\nOfficial Journal\nRegulation (EU) No 347/2013\n-\n-\nOJ L 115 of 25.4.2013\nlast update 04.04.2014", "tags": ["energy cooperation", "project of common interest", "energy grid", "trans-European network"], "subjects": ["Trans-European networks", "Energy"], "split": "test", "reference_annotations": {"32013R0347_p1": {"text": "regulation 347/2013 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL---of 17 April 2013---on guidelines for trans-European energy infrastructure and repealing decision 1364/2006/ec and amending regulation 713/2009 regulation 714/2009 regulation 715/2009", "triples": [" regulation 347/2013,  repealing,  decision 1364/2006/ec", " regulation 347/2013,  amending,  regulation 713/2009", " regulation 347/2013,  amending,  regulation 714/2009", " regulation 347/2013,  amending,  regulation 715/2009"]}}, "summary_annotations": {"32013R0347_p1": {"text": "regulation 347/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council on guidelines for trans-European energy infrastructure and repealing decision 1364/2006/ec and amending regulation 713/2009 regulation 714/2009 regulation 715/2009", "triples": [" regulation 347/2013,  repealing,  decision 1364/2006/ec", " regulation 347/2013,  amending,  regulation 713/2009", " regulation 347/2013,  amending,  regulation 714/2009", " regulation 347/2013,  amending,  regulation 715/2009"]}}}
