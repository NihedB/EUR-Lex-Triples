In this respect, the Union, where necessary, supports and supplements Member States’ action to improve the knowledge and dissemination of the culture and history of the European peoples.\n(2)\nA better understanding and appreciation, especially among young people, of their shared yet diverse heritage would help to strengthen the sense of belonging to the Union and reinforce intercultural dialogue. It is therefore important to promote greater access to cultural heritage and to enhance its European dimension.\n(3)\nThe TFEU also establishes citizenship of the Union, which complements national citizenship of the respective Member States and is an important element in safeguarding and strengthening the process of European integration. For citizens to give their full support to European integration, greater emphasis should be placed on their common values, history and culture as key elements of their membership of a society founded on the principles of freedom, democracy, respect for human rights, cultural and linguistic diversity, tolerance and solidarity.\n(4)\nAn intergovernmental European Heritage Label initiative (‘intergovernmental initiative’) was launched on 28 April 2006 in Granada, Spain.\n(5)\nOn 20 November 2008, the Council adopted conclusions (3) aimed at transforming the intergovernmental initiative into a Union action (‘action’) by inviting the Commission to submit to it a proposal for the creation by the Union of a European Heritage Label (‘label’) and to specify the practical procedures for the implementation of the project.\n(6)\nThe public consultation and the impact assessment carried out by the Commission confirmed the value of the intergovernmental initiative but indicated that it needed to be further developed to reach its full potential, and that the involvement of the Union could provide it with a clear added value and help it to take a qualitative step forward.\n(7)\nThe label should benefit from the experience gained from the intergovernmental initiative.\n(8)\nThe label should seek added value and complementarity with regard to other initiatives such as the Unesco World Heritage List, the Unesco Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity and the Council of Europe’s European Cultural Routes. Its added value should be based on the contribution made by the selected sites to European history and culture, including the building of the Union, on a clear educational dimension reaching out to citizens, especially young people, and on networking between the sites to share experiences and best practices. The main focus of the action should be on the promotion of and access to the sites as well as on the quality of the information and activities offered, as opposed to the preservation of the sites, which should be guaranteed by existing protection regimes.\n(9)\nIn addition to strengthening European citizens’ sense of belonging to the Union and stimulating intercultural dialogue, the action could also contribute to enhancing the value and profile of cultural heritage, to increasing the role of heritage in the economic and sustainable development of regions, in particular through cultural tourism, to fostering synergies between cultural heritage and contemporary creation and creativity and, more generally, to promoting the democratic values and human rights that underpin European integration.\n(10)\nThose objectives are fully in line with the objectives set out in the Commission communication entitled ‘A European agenda for culture in a globalizing world’, which include the promotion of cultural diversity and intercultural dialogue as well as of culture as a catalyst for creativity.\n(11)\nIt is crucial that the label be awarded on the basis of common, clear and transparent criteria and procedures, including during the first two selection years when transitional provisions should apply.\n(12)\nThe procedure for the selection of sites under the action should be carried out in two stages. Sites should initially be pre-selected at national level. Whenever relevant, Member States could involve local and regional authorities. The selection should then take place at Union level. Each site awarded the label should be monitored in order to ensure continued compliance with the criteria as laid down for the label.\n(13)\nIn the course of the first evaluation of the action, the widening of its geographical scope should be examined.\n(14)\nWhere there is a clear thematic link between several sites located in one Member State, the action should allow for joint applications. Such joint applications should comprise a reasonable number of participating sites and demonstrate a European added value compared to individual applications in respect of the same sites.\n(15)\nSimilarly, by reason of the transnational dimension of certain sites, the action should allow for joint applications both in the case of sites which are located in different Member States but focus on one specific theme and in the case of a site located on the territory of at least two Member States.\n(16)\nIn order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of this Decision and, in particular, the provisions concerning the designation of sites to be awarded the label, the withdrawal of the label and the formalisation of the renunciation of the label, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission.\n(17)\nThe administrative arrangements for the label should be light and flexible, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity.\n(18)\nSince the objectives of this Decision cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States by reason of the need, in particular, for new common, clear and transparent criteria and procedures for the label, as well as for stronger coordination between the Member States, and can therefore be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Decision does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives,\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\nArticle 1\nEstablishment\nA European Union action (‘action’) entitled ‘European Heritage Label’ (‘label’) is hereby established.\nArticle 2\nDefinitions\nFor the purposes of this Decision, the following definitions shall apply:\n(1)\n‘sites’ means monuments, natural, underwater, archaeological, industrial or urban sites, cultural landscapes, places of remembrance, cultural goods and objects and intangible heritage associated with a place, including contemporary heritage;\n(2)\n‘transnational site’ means:\n(a)\nseveral sites, located in different Member States, which focus on one specific theme in order to submit a joint application; or\n(b)\none site located on the territory of at least two Member States;\n(3)\n‘national thematic site’ means several sites, located in the same Member State, which focus on one specific theme in order to submit a joint application.\nArticle 3\nObjectives\n1.   The action shall contribute to the following general objectives:\n(a)\nstrengthening European citizens’ sense of belonging to the Union, in particular that of young people, based on shared values and elements of European history and cultural heritage, as well as an appreciation of national and regional diversity;\n(b)\nstrengthening intercultural dialogue.\n2.   In order to achieve the objectives set out in paragraph 1, the action shall seek to attain the following intermediate objectives:\n(a)\nstressing the symbolic value and raising the profile of sites which have played a significant role in the history and culture of Europe and/or the building of the Union;\n(b)\nincreasing European citizens’ understanding of the history of Europe and the building of the Union, and of their common yet diverse cultural heritage, especially in relation to the democratic values and human rights that underpin the process of European integration.\n3.   The sites themselves shall seek to attain the following specific objectives:\n(a)\nhighlighting their European significance;\n(b)\nraising European citizens’ awareness of their common cultural heritage, especially that of young people;\n(c)\nfacilitating the sharing of experiences and exchanges of best practices across the Union;\n(d)\nincreasing and/or improving access for all, especially young people;\n(e)\nincreasing intercultural dialogue, especially among young people, through artistic, cultural and historical education;\n(f)\nfostering synergies between cultural heritage on one hand and contemporary creation and creativity on the other;\n(g)\ncontributing to the attractiveness and the economic and sustainable development of regions, in particular through cultural tourism.\nArticle 4\nParticipation in the action\nThe action shall be open to the participation, on a voluntary basis, of the Member States.\nArticle 5\nAdded value and complementarity of the action with other initiatives\nThe Commission and the Member States shall ensure the added value and complementarity of the action with regard to other initiatives in the field of cultural heritage such as the Unesco World Heritage List, the Unesco Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity and the Council of Europe’s European Cultural Routes.\nArticle 6\nEligibility\nSites within the meaning of Article 2 shall be eligible for the attribution of the label.\nArticle 7\nCriteria\n1.   The attribution of the label shall be based on the following criteria (‘criteria’):\n(a)\nCandidate sites for the label must have a symbolic European value and must have played a significant role in the history and culture of Europe and/or the building of the Union. They must therefore demonstrate one or more of the following:\n(i)\ntheir cross-border or pan-European nature: how their past and present influence and attraction go beyond the national borders of a Member State;\n(ii)\ntheir place and role in European history and European integration, and their links with key European events, personalities or movements;\n(iii)\ntheir place and role in the development and promotion of the common values that underpin European integration.\n(b)\nCandidate sites for the label must submit a project, the implementation of which is to begin by the end of the designation year at the latest, which includes all of the following elements:\n(i)\nraising awareness of the European significance of the site, in particular through appropriate information activities, signposting and staff training;\n(ii)\norganising educational activities, especially for young people, which increase the understanding of the common history of Europe and of its shared yet diverse heritage and which strengthen the sense of belonging to a common space;\n(iii)\npromoting multilingualism and facilitating access to the site by using several languages of the Union;\n(iv)\ntaking part in the activities of networks of sites awarded the label in order to exchange experiences and initiate common projects;\n(v)\nraising the profile and attractiveness of the site on a European scale, inter alia, by using the possibilities offered by new technologies and digital and interactive means and by seeking synergies with other European initiatives.\nThe organisation of artistic and cultural activities which foster the mobility of European culture professionals, artists and collections, stimulate intercultural dialogue and encourage linkage between heritage and contemporary creation and creativity is to be welcomed whenever the specific nature of the site allows this.\n(c)\nCandidate sites for the label must submit a work plan which includes all of the following elements:\n(i)\nensuring the sound management of the site, including defining objectives and indicators;\n(ii)\nensuring the preservation of the site and its transmission to future generations in accordance with the relevant protection regimes;\n(iii)\nensuring the quality of the reception facilities such as the historical presentation, visitors’ information and signposting;\n(iv)\nensuring access for the widest possible public, inter alia, through site adaptations or staff training;\n(v)\naccording special attention to young people, in particular by granting them privileged access to the site;\n(vi)\npromoting the site as a sustainable tourism destination;\n(vii)\ndeveloping a coherent and comprehensive communication strategy highlighting the European significance of the site;\n(viii)\nensuring that the management of the site is as environmentally friendly as possible.\n2.   As regards the criteria laid down in points (b) and (c) of paragraph 1, each site shall be assessed in a proportionate manner, taking into account its characteristics.\nArticle 8\nEuropean panel\n1.

It shall ensure that the criteria are properly applied by the sites across the Member States.\n2.   The European panel shall consist of 13 members, four of whom shall be appointed by the European Parliament, four by the Council, four by the Commission and one by the Committee of the Regions, in accordance with their respective procedures. The European panel shall designate its chairperson.\n3.   The members of the European panel shall be independent experts with substantial experience and expertise in the fields relevant to the objectives of the action. Each institution and body shall seek to ensure that the competences of the experts it appoints are as complementary as possible, and that those experts are drawn from a balanced geographical spectrum.\n4.   The members of the European panel shall be appointed for three years.\nHowever, in 2012 four experts shall be appointed by the European Parliament for two years, four by the Council for three years, four by the Commission for one year and one by the Committee of the Regions for three years.\n5.   The members of the European panel shall declare any actual or potential conflict of interest in respect of a specific site. In the event of such a declaration by a member, or if such a conflict of interest comes to light, that member shall not participate in the evaluation of the site or of any other sites from the Member State(s) concerned.\n6.   All reports, recommendations and notifications of the European panel shall be made public by the Commission.\nArticle 9\nApplication form\nWith a view to keeping procedures as streamlined and light as possible, a common application form (‘application form’) based on the criteria shall be prepared by the Commission and used by all candidate sites.\nArticle 10\nPre-selection at national level\n1.

Applications in respect of transnational sites shall follow the same procedure as that for other sites. Following consultation among the participating sites with the involvement of relevant national authorities, each participating site shall complete an application form and send it to the coordinator. Transnational sites shall be pre-selected by the Member State of the coordinator within the numerical limits of sites laid down in Article 10(2) and proposed on behalf of all the Member States concerned after those Member States have agreed thereon.\n3.   When a transnational site is selected, the label shall be awarded to the transnational site as a whole and under the common name.\n4.   If a transnational site meets all the criteria, priority shall be given to that site during the selection.\nArticle 13\nNational thematic sites\n1.

If the European panel establishes that a site no longer meets the criteria or that it no longer respects the project and work plan submitted in its application, it shall initiate a dialogue with the Member State concerned via the Commission, with a view to facilitating the necessary adjustments to the site.\n2.   If, 18 months after the beginning of the dialogue, the necessary adjustments have not been made to the site, the European panel shall notify the Commission of that fact. The notification shall be accompanied by a statement of reasons and shall include practical recommendations on how to improve the situation.\n3.   If, 18 months after the notification referred to in paragraph 2, the practical recommendations have not been implemented, the European panel shall issue a recommendation to the Commission for the withdrawal of the label from the relevant site.\n4.   If the European panel establishes that a site participating in a transnational site or a national thematic site no longer meets the criteria or that it no longer respects the project and work plan submitted in its application, the procedure set out in paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 shall apply. Withdrawal pursuant to this paragraph shall apply to the transnational site or national thematic site in its entirety. However, in cases where the coherence of the transnational site or national thematic site will not be undermined, the European panel may recommend limiting the withdrawal to the participating site concerned.\n5.   The Commission shall take the decision to withdraw the label having due regard to the recommendation referred to in paragraph 3. The Commission shall inform the European Parliament, the Council and the Committee of the Regions of the withdrawal.\n6.   Sites may at any time renounce the label and, in such cases, they shall notify the Member States concerned which shall in turn inform the Commission of the renunciation. The Commission shall formalise the renunciation and inform the European Parliament, the Council and the Committee of the Regions to that effect.\nArticle 17\nPractical arrangements\n1.

The list is then submitted to a European panel of independent experts that selects a maximum of one site per country. Upon the panel’s recommendations, the European Commission designates the sites that are to be awarded the label.\nThe sites are regularly monitored to ensure that they continue to meet the criteria and that they implement their projects and work plans. If this is not the case, the panel can propose adjustments in collaboration with the country concerned. If the necessary measures are not implemented, the Commission may withdraw the label.\nThe first labels were attributed in 2013.\nFROM WHEN DOES THE DECISION APPLY?\n              \nIt applies since 23 November 2011.\nBACKGROUND\n                \n              \nNow a formal EU initiative and part of the Creative Europe programme (2014-2020), the European Heritage Label was first launched in 2006 in the form of an intergovernmental initiative involving 18 EU countries.\nFor more information, see:\n‘European Heritage Label’ on the European Commission's website\nMAIN DOCUMENT\n            \nDecision No 1194/2011/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 November 2011 establishing a European Union action for the European Heritage Label (OJ L 303, 22.11.2011, pp. 1-9)\nlast update 04.07.2016", "tags": ["European Movement", "cultural heritage", "history of Europe", "European symbol", "public awareness campaign", "cultural promotion"], "subjects": ["Culture", "Citizenship of the Union"], "split": "train", "reference_annotations": {}, "summary_annotations": {}}
