This Directive does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve the said objective.(8) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Directive should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission(7).(9) To avoid creating new barriers to free movement, Member States should refrain from adopting, for the products in question, national provisions not provided for by this Directive,HAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:Article 1This Directive shall apply to the products defined in Part A of the Annex.However, this Directive shall not apply to the products defined in Part A of the Annex when they take the following forms: icing sugars, candy sugars, sugars in loaf form.Article 2Directive 2000/13/EC shall apply to the products defined in Part A of the Annex hereto subject to the following conditions and derogations:1. Without prejudice to point 5 below, the product names listed in Part A of the Annex shall apply only to the products referred to therein and shall be used in trade to designate them.The product name referred to in point 2 of Part A of the Annex may also be used to designate the product referred to in point 3 thereof.However,- the products defined in Part A of the Annex may, in addition to the compulsory product name, also bear qualifying terms commonly used in the various Member States;- the product names may also be used in product names made up to designate other products, in accordance with custom,provided that such names are not liable to mislead the consumer.2. For pre-packaged products weighing less than 20 g, the net weight need not be indicated on the labelling.3. The labelling shall indicate the dry matter and invert sugar content of sugar solution, invert sugar solution and invert sugar syrup.4. The labelling shall include the qualifying term \"crystallised\" for invert sugar syrup incorporating crystals in the solution.5. Where the products referred to in points 7 and 8 of Part A of the Annex contain fructose in proportions greater than 5 % on a dry matter basis, they shall, in respect of their product name and as ingredients, be labelled as \"glucose-fructose syrup\" or \"fructose-glucose syrup\" and \"dried glucose-fructose syrup\" or \"dried fructose-glucose syrup\", respectively, to reflect whether the glucose component or the fructose component is in greater proportion.Article 3For the products defined in the Annex, Member States shall not adopt national provisions not provided for by this Directive.Article 4The measures necessary for the implementation of this Directive relating to the matters referred to below shall be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure set out in Article 5(2):- bringing this Directive into line with general Community legislation on foodstuffs,- adaptations to technical progress.Article 51. The Commission shall be assisted by the Standing Committee on Foodstuffs (hereinafter referred to as \"the Committee\") set up by Article 1 of Decision 69/414/EEC(8).2. Where reference is made to this paragraph, Articles 5 and 7 of Decision 1999/468/EC shall apply.The period laid down in Article 5(6) of Decision 1999/468/EC shall be set at three months.3. The Committee shall adopt its rules of procedure.Article 6Directive 73/437/EEC is hereby repealed with effect from 12 July 2003.References to the repealed Directive shall be construed as references to this Directive.Article 7Member States shall bring into force the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive before 12 July 2003. They shall forthwith inform the Commission thereof.The measures shall be applied so as to:- authorise the marketing of the products defined in Part A of the Annex if they conform to the definitions and rules laid down in this Directive, with effect from 12 July 2003;- prohibit the marketing of products which fail to conform to this Directive, with effect from 12 July 2004;However, the marketing of products which fail to conform to this Directive but which were labelled before 12 July 2004 in accordance with Directive 73/437/EEC shall be permitted until stocks run out.When Member States adopt these measures, these shall contain a reference to this Directive or shall be accompanied by such reference at the time of their official publication. The methods of making such reference shall be adopted by Member States.Article 8This Directive shall enter into force on the day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.Article 9This Directive is addressed to the Member States.Done at Brussels, 20 December 2001.For the CouncilThe PresidentC.

These rules concern the composition, sales name, labelling and presentation of foodstuffs.\nACT\nCouncil Directive 2001/111/EC of 20 December 2001 relating to certain sugars intended for human consumption [Official Journal L 10 of 12.01.2002].\nSUMMARY\nDirective 2001/111/CE improves the labelling of certain edible sugars in order to better inform consumers and to prevent them from being misled by the products they buy. It applies without prejudice to the general provisions relating to the labelling of foodstuffs.\nSugars\nDirective 2001/111/EC defines eleven sugar varieties:\nsemi-white sugar;\nsugar (white sugar);\nextra-white sugar;\nsugar solution;\ninvert sugar solution;\ninvert sugar syrup;\nglucose syrup;\ndried glucose syrup;\ndextrose monohydrate;\ndextrose or dextrose anhydrous;\nfructose.\nEach variety has corresponding compositional characteristics and rules relating to packaging and labelling.\nLabelling\nDirective 2001/111/EC lays down certain specific provisions for pre-packaged products weighing less than 20 g, for sugar solutions, for invert sugar syrup containing crystals as well as for certain products containing more than 5 % fructose. The net weight of pre-packaged products weighing less than 20 g need not be indicated on the labelling. However, the labelling of invert sugar solutions and invert sugar syrup must indicate the levels of dry matter and invert sugar content. Furthermore, the labelling of invert sugar syrup containing crystals must include the qualifying term crystallised. Finally, glucose syrups (including dried glucose syrups) which contain more than 5 % of fructose (dry matter) must be labelled as glucose-fructose syrup or fructose-glucose syrup and dried glucose-fructose syrup or dried fructose-glucose syrup, to reflect whether the glucose component or the fructose component is in greater proportion.\nFor the products defined in the Annex, Member States shall not adopt national provisions not provided for by this Directive.\nContext\nThis Directive forms part of the programme to simplify certain vertical Directives relating to foodstuffs in order to take account only of the essential requirements to be met by the products they cover so that those products may move freely within the internal market.\nREFERENCES\nAct\nEntry into force\nDeadline for transposition in the Member States\nOfficial Journal\nDirective 2001/111/EC\n12.1.2002\n11.7.2003\nOJ L 10 of 12.1.2002\nRELATED ACTS\nRegulation (EU) No 1021/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Directives 1999/4/EC and 2000/36/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council and Council Directives 2001/111/EC, 2001/113/EC and 2001/114/EC as regards the powers to be conferred on the Commission [Official Journal L 287 of 29.10.2013].\nThis regulation aligns the existing Commission implementing powers provided for in the five so-called breakfast directives with the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) and in particular with Article 290 which allows the Commission to adopt delegated acts.\nLast updated: 29.04.2014", "tags": ["human nutrition", "marketing", "consumer information", "sugar", "product designation"], "subjects": ["Protocol on Ireland/Northern Ireland", "Foodstuffs", "Approximation of laws", "Internal market - Principles"], "split": "train", "reference_annotations": {}, "summary_annotations": {"32001L0111_p1": {"text": "regulation 1021/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council amending directive 1999/4/ec directive 2000/36/ec of the European Parliament and of the Council and Council directive 2001/111/ec directive 2001/113/ec directive 2001/114/ec as regards the powers to be conferred on the Commission [Official Journal L 287 of 29.10.2013].", "triples": [" regulation 1021/2013,  amending,  directive 1999/4/ec", " regulation 1021/2013,  amending,  directive 2000/36/ec", " regulation 1021/2013,  amending,  directive 2001/111/ec", " regulation 1021/2013,  amending,  directive 2001/113/ec", " regulation 1021/2013,  amending,  directive 2001/114/ec"]}}}
