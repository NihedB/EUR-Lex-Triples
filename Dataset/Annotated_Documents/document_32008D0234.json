In the interests of clarity, it is appropriate to replace that Committee by a new European Statistical Advisory Committee (the Committee).\n(4)\nThe Committee should contribute to a close cooperation in the programme-planning process in order to improve the governance of the European Statistical System and enhance the quality of Community statistics. To this effect, close collaboration should be maintained with the Statistical Programme Committee established by Council Decision 89/382/EEC, Euratom (4) and with the Committee on Monetary, Financial and Balance of Payments Statistics established by Council Decision 91/115/EEC (5).\n(5)\nA balance should be achieved between the need to reduce membership in order to enable the Committee to work efficiently in an enlarged Community on the one hand, and the need to allow representation of all stakeholders in Community statistics, as requested in the Council conclusions of 8 November 2005, on the other.\n(6)\nIn order to meet the objectives of better assessing and balancing the benefits and costs of Community statistical requirements and rebalancing and reducing the burden of Community statistical legislation, so facilitating compliance with increasing demand, the Committee should play a stronger role in preparing and implementing the Community statistical programme.\n(7)\nThe Committee should serve as a channel for advice from users, respondents and producers of statistical information on the objectives of the Community’s statistical information policy.\n(8)\nDecision 91/116/EEC should therefore be repealed,\nHAVE DECIDED AS FOLLOWS:\nArticle 1\nEuropean Statistical Advisory Committee\n1.
