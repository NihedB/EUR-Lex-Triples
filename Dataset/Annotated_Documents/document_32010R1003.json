It forms part of the implementation of Regulation (EC) No 661/2009 on type-approval for motor vehicles and trailers.\nRequirements for the space for mounting and the fixing of rear registration platesThe space for a rear registration plate must include a flat or virtually flat rectangular surface which must be either:\n520 millimetres wide and 120 millimetres high; or\n340 millimetres wide and 240 millimetres high.\nAmending Regulation (EU) 2015/166 clarifies the requirements concerning the fixing of a rear registration plate:\nthe plate must be at right angles (+/- 5°) to the longitudinal plane of the vehicle;\nthe lower edge of the platemust not be less than 0.30 m from the ground;\nthe plate must be visible in the whole space;\nthe specific rules on the plate’s visibility depend on the height of the upper edge of the plate — whether it is more than or not more than 1.20 m from the ground.\nThe regulation also establishes test procedures to check for compliance.\nRules for EU type-approvalThe vehicle manufacturer must submit an application for EU type-approval to the competent authority. This application must include:\nthe make and type of the vehicle;\nthe range of dimensions for the space for mounting rear registration plates;\nthe height of the edges from the road surface.\nIf the competent authority considers that the vehicle satisfies all of the requirements concerning the space for mounting and the fixing of the rear registration plate, it must grant EU type-approval and issue a type-approval number in accordance with Directive 2007/46/EC.\nFROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?\n              \nIt has applied since 29 November 2010.\nBACKGROUND\n              \nFor more information, see:\nDirectives and regulations on motor vehicles, their trailers, systems and components (European Commission).\nMAIN DOCUMENT\n            \nCommission Regulation (EU) No 1003/2010 of 8 November 2010 concerning type-approval requirements for the space for mounting and the fixing of rear registration plates on motor vehicles and their trailers and implementing Regulation (EC) No 661/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning type-approval requirements for the general safety of motor vehicles, their trailers and systems, components and separate technical units intended therefor (OJ L 291, 9.11.2010, pp. 22-30)\nSuccessive amendments to Regulation (EU) No 1003/2010 have been incorporated into the original text.
