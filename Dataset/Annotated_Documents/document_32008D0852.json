Each country designates one to three organisations as its members. The European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) is also a member. The European Commission also participates in the activities of the network and designates its own representatives. Similarly, Europol and Eurojust may take part in the network. An updated list of contact points is available on the EPAS-EACN website.\nThe tasks of the network consist of:\nsetting up a forum for the exchange of best practices and experiences concerning the prevention and fight against corruption;\nfacilitating and upholding communication between its members.\nFurthermore, the network meets at least once a year in order to carry out its tasks.\nThe establishment of the network does not affect the rules governing police and judicial cooperation between EU countries nor the role of the European Police College.\nThe informal collaboration taking place between the European Partners against Corruption (EPAC) is the basis for the organisation of the network. Each EU country, the Commission, Europol and Eurojust is to bear its own expenses relating to the network.\nBACKGROUND\n              \nAt the AGIS conference of November 2004 on the enhancement of operational cooperation in fighting corruption in the EU, the EPAC supported the establishment of an EU-wide anti-corruption network.
