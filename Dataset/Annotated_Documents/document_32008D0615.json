{"celex_id": "32008D0615", "reference": "6.8.2008\nEN\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\nL 210/1\nCOUNCIL DECISION 2008/615/JHA\nof 23 June 2008\non the stepping up of cross-border cooperation, particularly in combating terrorism and cross-border crime\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on European Union, and in particular Article 30(1)(a) and (b), Article 31(1)(a), Article 32 and Article 34(2)(c) thereof,\nHaving regard to the initiative of the Kingdom of Belgium, the Republic of Bulgaria, the Federal Republic of Germany, the Kingdom of Spain, the French Republic, the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, the Kingdom of the Netherlands, the Republic of Austria, the Republic of Slovenia, the Slovak Republic, the Italian Republic, the Republic of Finland, the Portuguese Republic, Romania and the Kingdom of Sweden,\nHaving regard to the Opinion of the European Parliament (1),\nWhereas:\n(1)\nFollowing the entry into force of the Treaty between the Kingdom of Belgium, the Federal Republic of Germany, the Kingdom of Spain, the French Republic, the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Republic of Austria on the stepping up of cross-border cooperation, particularly in combating terrorism, cross-border crime and illegal migration hereinafter (Prüm Treaty), this initiative is submitted, in consultation with the European Commission, in compliance with the provisions of the Treaty on European Union, with the aim of incorporating the substance of the provisions of the Prüm Treaty into the legal framework of the European Union.\n(2)\nThe conclusions of the European Council meeting in Tampere in October 1999 confirmed the need for improved exchange of information between the competent authorities of the Member States for the purpose of detecting and investigating offences.\n(3)\nIn the Hague Programme for strengthening freedom, security and justice in the European Union of November 2004, the European Council set forth its conviction that for that purpose an innovative approach to the cross-border exchange of law enforcement information was needed.\n(4)\nThe European Council accordingly stated that the exchange of such information should comply with the conditions applying to the principle of availability. This means that a law enforcement officer in one Member State of the Union who needs information in order to carry out his duties can obtain it from another Member State and that the law enforcement authorities in the Member State that holds this information will make it available for the declared purpose, taking account of the needs of investigations pending in that Member State.\n(5)\nThe European Council set 1 January 2008 as the deadline for achieving this objective in the Hague Programme.\n(6)\nCouncil Framework Decision 2006/960/JHA of 18 December 2006 on simplifying the exchange of information and intelligence between law enforcement authorities of the Member States of the European Union (2) already lays down rules whereby the Member States' law enforcement authorities may exchange existing information and intelligence expeditiously and effectively for the purpose of carrying out criminal investigations or criminal intelligence operations.\n(7)\nThe Hague Programme for strengthening freedom, security and justice states also that full use should be made of new technology and that there should also be reciprocal access to national databases, while stipulating that new centralised European databases should be created only on the basis of studies that have shown their added value.\n(8)\nFor effective international cooperation it is of fundamental importance that precise information can be exchanged swiftly and efficiently. The aim is to introduce procedures for promoting fast, efficient and inexpensive means of data exchange. For the joint use of data these procedures should be subject to accountability and incorporate appropriate guarantees as to the accuracy and security of the data during transmission and storage as well as procedures for recording data exchange and restrictions on the use of information exchanged.\n(9)\nThese requirements are satisfied by the Prüm Treaty. In order to meet the substantive requirements of the Hague Programme for all Member States within the time-scale set by it, the substance of the essential parts of the Prüm Treaty should become applicable to all Member States.\n(10)\nThis Decision therefore contains provisions which are based on the main provisions of the Prüm Treaty and are designed to improve the exchange of information, whereby Member States grant one another access rights to their automated DNA analysis files, automated dactyloscopic identification systems and vehicle registration data. In the case of data from national DNA analysis files and automated dactyloscopic identification systems, a hit/no hit system should enable the searching Member State, in a second step, to request specific related personal data from the Member State administering the file and, where necessary, to request further information through mutual assistance procedures, including those adopted pursuant to Framework Decision 2006/960/JHA.\n(11)\nThis would considerably speed up existing procedures enabling Member States to find out whether any other Member State, and if so, which, has the information it needs.\n(12)\nCross-border data comparison should open up a new dimension in crime fighting. The information obtained by comparing data should open up new investigative approaches for Member States and thus play a crucial role in assisting Member States' law enforcement and judicial authorities.\n(13)\nThe rules are based on networking Member States' national databases.\n(14)\nSubject to certain conditions, Member States should be able to supply personal and non-personal data in order to improve the exchange of information with a view to preventing criminal offences and maintaining public order and security in connection with major events with a cross-border dimension.\n(15)\nIn the implementation of Article 12, Member States may decide to give priority to combating serious crime bearing in mind the limited technical capacities available for transmitting data.\n(16)\nIn addition to improving the exchange of information, there is a need to regulate other forms of closer cooperation between police authorities, in particular by means of joint security operations (e.g. joint patrols).\n(17)\nCloser police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters must go hand in hand with respect for fundamental rights, in particular the right to respect for privacy and to protection of personal data, to be guaranteed by special data protection arrangements, which should be tailored to the specific nature of different forms of data exchange. Such data protection provisions should take particular account of the specific nature of cross-border online access to databases. Since, with online access, it is not possible for the Member State administering the file to make any prior checks, a system ensuring post hoc monitoring should be in place.\n(18)\nThe hit/no hit system provides for a structure of comparing anonymous profiles, where additional personal data is exchanged only after a hit, the supply and receipt of which is governed by national law, including the legal assistance rules. This set-up guarantees an adequate system of data protection, it being understood that the supply of personal data to another Member State requires an adequate level of data protection on the part of the receiving Member States.\n(19)\nAware of the comprehensive exchange of information and data resulting from closer police and judicial cooperation, this Decision seeks to warrant an appropriate level of data protection. It observes the level of protection designed for the processing of personal data in the Council of Europe Convention of 28 January 1981 for the Protection of Individuals with regard to Automatic Processing of Personal Data, the Additional Protocol of 8 November 2001 to the Convention and the principles of Recommendation No R (87) 15 of the Council of Europe Regulating the Use of Personal Data in the Police Sector.\n(20)\nThe data protection provisions contained in this Decision also include data protection principles which were necessary due to the lack of a Framework Decision on data protection in the Third Pillar. This Framework Decision should be applied to the entire area of police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters under the condition that its level of data protection is not lower than the protection laid down in the Council of Europe Convention for the Protection of Individuals with regard to automatic Processing of Personal Data of 28 January 1981 and its additional Protocol of 8 November 2001 and takes account of Recommendation No R (87) 15 of 17 September 1987 of the Committee of Ministers to Member States regulating the use of personal data in the police sector, also where data are not processed automatically.\n(21)\nSince the objectives of this Decision, in particular the improvement of information exchange in the European Union, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States in isolation owing to the cross-border nature of crime fighting and security issues so that the Member States are obliged to rely on one another in these matters, and can therefore be better achieved at European Union level, the Council may adopt measures in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty establishing the European Community, to which Article 2 of the Treaty on European Union refers. In accordance with the principle of proportionality pursuant to Article 5 of the EC Treaty, this Decision does not go beyond what is necessary to achieve those objectives.\n(22)\nThis Decision respects the fundamental rights and observes the principles set out in particular in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union,\nHAS DECIDED AS FOLLOWS:\nCHAPTER 1\nGENERAL ASPECTS\nArticle 1\nAim and scope\nBy means of this Decision, the Member States intend to step up cross-border cooperation in matters covered by Title VI of the Treaty, particularly the exchange of information between authorities responsible for the prevention and investigation of criminal offences. To this end, this Decision contains rules in the following areas:\n(a)\nprovisions on the conditions and procedure for the automated transfer of DNA profiles, dactyloscopic data and certain national vehicle registration data (Chapter 2);\n(b)\nprovisions on the conditions for the supply of data in connection with major events with a cross-border dimension (Chapter 3);\n(c)\nprovisions on the conditions for the supply of information in order to prevent terrorist offences (Chapter 4);\n(d)\nprovisions on the conditions and procedure for stepping up cross-border police cooperation through various measures (Chapter 5).\nCHAPTER 2\nONLINE ACCESS AND FOLLOW-UP REQUESTS\nSECTION 1\nDNA profiles\nArticle 2\nEstablishment of national DNA analysis files\n1.

In the case provided for in paragraph 1, the Member State whose officials have caused damage to any person in the territory of another Member State shall reimburse the latter in full any sums it has paid to the victims or persons entitled on their behalf.\n4.   Where officials of a Member State are operating in another Member State pursuant to Article 18, the latter Member State shall be liable in accordance with its national law for any damage caused by them during their operations.\n5.   Where the damage referred to in paragraph 4 results from gross negligence or wilful misconduct, the host Member State may approach the seconding Member State in order to have any sums it has paid to the victims or persons entitled on their behalf reimbursed by the latter.\n6.   Without prejudice to the exercise of its rights vis-à-vis third parties and with the exception of paragraph 3, each Member State shall refrain, in the case provided for in paragraph 1, from requesting reimbursement of damages it has sustained from another Member State.\nArticle 22\nCriminal liability\nOfficers operating within another Member State's territory under this Decision, shall be treated in the same way as officers of the host Member State with regard to any criminal offences that might be committed by, or against them, save as otherwise provided in another agreement which is binding on the Member States concerned.\nArticle 23\nEmployment relationship\nOfficers operating within another Member State's territory, under this Decision, shall remain subject to the employment law provisions applicable in their own Member State, particularly as regards disciplinary rules.\nCHAPTER 6\nGENERAL PROVISIONS ON DATA PROTECTION\nArticle 24\nDefinitions and scope\n1.   For the purposes of this Decision:\n(a)\n‘processing of personal data’ shall mean any operation or set of operations which is performed upon personal data, whether or not by automatic means, such as collection, recording, organisation, storage, adaptation or alteration, sorting, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by supply, dissemination or otherwise making available, alignment, combination, blocking, erasure or destruction of data. Processing within the meaning of this Decision shall also include notification of whether or not a hit exists;\n(b)\n‘automated search procedure’ shall mean direct access to the automated files of another body where the response to the search procedure is fully automated;\n(c)\n‘referencing’ shall mean the marking of stored personal data without the aim of limiting their processing in future;\n(d)\n‘blocking’ shall mean the marking of stored personal data with the aim of limiting their processing in future.\n2.   The following provisions shall apply to data which are or have been supplied pursuant to this Decision, save as otherwise provided in the preceding Chapters.\nArticle 25\nLevel of data protection\n1.   As regards the processing of personal data which are or have been supplied pursuant to this Decision, each Member State shall guarantee a level of protection of personal data in its national law at least equal to that resulting from the Council of Europe Convention for the Protection of Individuals with regard to Automatic Processing of Personal Data of 28 January 1981 and its Additional Protocol of 8 November 2001 and in doing so, shall take account of Recommendation No R (87) 15 of 17 September 1987 of the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe to the Member States regulating the use of personal data in the police sector, also where data are not processed automatically.\n2.   The supply of personal data provided for under this Decision may not take place until the provisions of this Chapter have been implemented in the national law of the territories of the Member States involved in such supply. The Council shall unanimously decide whether this condition has been met.\n3.   Paragraph 2 shall not apply to those Member States where the supply of personal data as provided for in this Decision has already started pursuant to the Treaty of 27 May 2005 between the Kingdom of Belgium, the Federal Republic of Germany, the Kingdom of Spain, the French Republic, the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Republic of Austria on the stepping up of cross-border cooperation, particularly in combating terrorism, cross-border crime and illegal migration (Prüm Treaty).\nArticle 26\nPurpose\n1.   Processing of personal data by the receiving Member State shall be permitted solely for the purposes for which the data have been supplied in accordance with this Decision. Processing for other purposes shall be permitted solely with the prior authorisation of the Member State administering the file and subject only to the national law of the receiving Member State. Such authorisation may be granted provided that processing for such other purposes is permitted under the national law of the Member State administering the file.\n2.   Processing of data supplied pursuant to Articles 3, 4 and 9 by the searching or comparing Member State shall be permitted solely in order to:\n(a)\nestablish whether the compared DNA profiles or dactyloscopic data match;\n(b)\nprepare and submit a police or judicial request for legal assistance in compliance with national law if those data match;\n(c)\nrecord within the meaning of Article 30.\nThe Member State administering the file may process the data supplied to it in accordance with Articles 3, 4 and 9 solely where this is necessary for the purposes of comparison, providing automated replies to searches or recording pursuant to Article 30. The supplied data shall be deleted immediately following data comparison or automated replies to searches unless further processing is necessary for the purposes mentioned under points (b) and (c) of the first subparagraph.\n3.   Data supplied in accordance with Article 12 may be used by the Member State administering the file solely where this is necessary for the purpose of providing automated replies to search procedures or recording as specified in Article 30. The data supplied shall be deleted immediately following automated replies to searches unless further processing is necessary for recording pursuant to Article 30. The searching Member State may use data received in a reply solely for the procedure for which the search was made.\nArticle 27\nCompetent authorities\nPersonal data supplied may be processed only by the authorities, bodies and courts with responsibility for a task in furtherance of the aims mentioned in Article 26. In particular, data may be supplied to other entities only with the prior authorisation of the supplying Member State and in compliance with the law of the receiving Member State.\nArticle 28\nAccuracy, current relevance and storage time of data\n1.   The Member States shall ensure the accuracy and current relevance of personal data. Should it transpire ex officio or from a notification by the data subject, that incorrect data or data which should not have been supplied have been supplied, this shall be notified without delay to the receiving Member State or Member States. The Member State or Member States concerned shall be obliged to correct or delete the data. Moreover, personal data supplied shall be corrected if they are found to be incorrect. If the receiving body has reason to believe that the supplied data are incorrect or should be deleted the supplying body shall be informed forthwith.\n2.   Data, the accuracy of which the data subject contests and the accuracy or inaccuracy of which cannot be established shall, in accordance with the national law of the Member States, be marked with a flag at the request of the data subject. If a flag exists, this may be removed subject to the national law of the Member States and only with the permission of the data subject or based on a decision of the competent court or independent data protection authority.\n3.   Personal data supplied which should not have been supplied or received shall be deleted. Data which are lawfully supplied and received shall be deleted:\n(a)\nif they are not or no longer necessary for the purpose for which they were supplied; if personal data have been supplied without request, the receiving body shall immediately check if they are necessary for the purposes for which they were supplied;\n(b)\nfollowing the expiry of the maximum period for keeping data laid down in the national law of the supplying Member State where the supplying body informed the receiving body of that maximum period at the time of supplying the data.\nWhere there is reason to believe that deletion would prejudice the interests of the data subject, the data shall be blocked instead of being deleted in compliance with national law. Blocked data may be supplied or used solely for the purpose which prevented their deletion.\nArticle 29\nTechnical and organisational measures to ensure data protection and data security\n1.   The supplying and receiving bodies shall take steps to ensure that personal data is effectively protected against accidental or unauthorised destruction, accidental loss, unauthorised access, unauthorised or accidental alteration and unauthorised disclosure.\n2.   The features of the technical specification of the automated search procedure are regulated in the implementing measures as referred to in Article 33 which guarantee that:\n(a)\nstate-of-the-art technical measures are taken to ensure data protection and data security, in particular data confidentiality and integrity;\n(b)\nencryption and authorisation procedures recognised by the competent authorities are used when having recourse to generally accessible networks; and\n(c)\nthe admissibility of searches in accordance with Article 30(2), (4) and (5) can be checked.\nArticle 30\nLogging and recording: special rules governing automated and non-automated supply\n1.   Each Member State shall guarantee that every non-automated supply and every non-automated receipt of personal data by the body administering the file and by the searching body is logged in order to verify the admissibility of the supply. Logging shall contain the following information:\n(a)\nthe reason for the supply;\n(b)\nthe data supplied;\n(c)\nthe date of the supply; and\n(d)\nthe name or reference code of the searching body and of the body administering the file.\n2.   The following shall apply to automated searches for data based on Articles 3, 9 and 12 and to automated comparison pursuant to Article 4:\n(a)\nonly specially authorised officers of the national contact points may carry out automated searches or comparisons. The list of officers authorised to carry out automated searches or comparisons shall be made available upon request to the supervisory authorities referred to in paragraph 5 and to the other Member States;\n(b)\neach Member State shall ensure that each supply and receipt of personal data by the body administering the file and the searching body is recorded, including notification of whether or not a hit exists. Recording shall include the following information:\n(i)\nthe data supplied;\n(ii)\nthe date and exact time of the supply; and\n(iii)\nthe name or reference code of the searching body and of the body administering the file.\nThe searching body shall also record the reason for the search or supply as well as an identifier for the official who carried out the search and the official who ordered the search or supply.\n3.   The recording body shall immediately communicate the recorded data upon request to the competent data protection authorities of the relevant Member State at the latest within four weeks following receipt of the request. Recorded data may be used solely for the following purposes:\n(a)\nmonitoring data protection;\n(b)\nensuring data security.\n4.   The recorded data shall be protected with suitable measures against inappropriate use and other forms of improper use and shall be kept for two years. After the conservation period the recorded data shall be deleted immediately.\n5.   Responsibility for legal checks on the supply or receipt of personal data lies with the independent data protection authorities or, as appropriate, the judicial authorities of the respective Member States. Anyone can request these authorities to check the lawfulness of the processing of data in respect of their person in compliance with national law. Independently of such requests, these authorities and the bodies responsible for recording shall carry out random checks on the lawfulness of supply, based on the files involved.\nThe results of such checks shall be kept for inspection for 18 months by the independent data protection authorities.

It focuses particularly on automated exchanges of information. It also focuses on major events and on fighting terrorism.\nThe decision stems from a multilateral treaty signed in 2005 by Belgium, Germany, Spain, France, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Austria. It has been transformed into a legal instrument binding all EU countries. The Council subsequently adopted the Prüm decision and its implementing rules.\nKEY POINTS\n              \nThe decision sets out rules with regard to:\nthe automated access to DNA profiles, dactyloscopic data* and certain national vehicle registration data;\nsupply of data in relation to major events;\nsupply of information in order to prevent terrorist offences;\nother measures for stepping up cross-border police cooperation.\nEstablishment of national databases and automated access to data\nEU countries must establish national DNA analysis files for the purpose of investigating criminal offences.\nReference data, consisting of the non-coding part of the DNA* and of a reference number that does not enable an individual to be identified, must be made available to other EU countries to carry out automated searches*.\nSearches are performed via national contact points by comparing DNA profiles*, but only on the basis of individual cases and in a hit/no-hit* manner.\nEU countries must also make available reference data from the national automated fingerprint identification systems (AFIS).\nThe searches are carried out by comparing dactyloscopic data and, similarly to DNA searches, only in individual cases on a hit/no-hit basis.\nNational contact points must also be given access to certain national vehicle registration data via automated online searches.\nSupply of data relating to major events\nIn relation to any major events involving more than one EU country, the countries concerned must provide each other with non-personal data*, as required for the purpose of preventing criminal offences and maintaining public order and security.\nPersonal data may be supplied only if the data subjects are considered a threat to public order and security or if it is believed that they will commit criminal offences at the events. The data may only be used in relation to the event it was provided for and must be deleted once it has served its purpose, but no later than 1 year after it was supplied.\nSupply of information to fight terrorism\nIn individual cases and with certain restrictions, EU countries may provide the following data to each other to prevent terrorist attacks:\nsurname and first names;\ndate and place of birth;\ndescription of the conditions leading to the supposition that criminal offences will be committed.\nOther measures for enhancing cross-border police cooperation\nEU countries can carry out joint patrols and other joint operations to prevent criminal offences and to maintain public order and security on a given EU country’s territory.\nEU countries are to provide mutual assistance to each other in cases of mass gatherings and other comparable major events, disasters and serious accidents.\nFROM WHEN DOES THE DECISION APPLY?\n              \nIt has applied since 26 August 2008.\nBACKGROUND\n              \nFor more information, see:\nEuropean information exchange model (EIXM) (European Commission).\n            \nCommunication from the Commission — COVID-19 Guidance on the implementation of the temporary restriction on non-essential travel to the EU, on the facilitation of transit arrangements for the repatriation of EU citizens, and on the effects on visa policy\nKEY TERMS\n              \nDactyloscopic data: fingerprint images, images of fingerprint latents (latents are prints which are invisible to the naked eye and must be professionally analysed), palm prints, palm print latents and templates of such images that are stored and dealt with in an automated database.\nNon-coding part of DNA: chromosome regions that are not expressed genetically, i.e. not known to provide for any functional properties of an organism.\nAutomated searching: an online access procedure for consulting the databases of one, several, or all of the EU countries.\nDNA profile: a letter or number code that represents a set of identification characteristics of the non-coding part of an analysed human DNA sample.\nHit/no-hit procedure: parties grant each other limited access to the reference data in their national DNA and fingerprint databases. They also grant the right to use these data to conduct automated checks of fingerprints and DNA profiles. The personal information related to the reference data is not available to the requesting party.\nNon-personal data: data containing individual DNA profiles which may be used to establish a match or ‘hit’, but which do not reveal the identity of the data subject.\nMAIN DOCUMENT\n            \nCouncil Decision 2008/615/JHA of 23 June 2008 on the stepping up of cross-border cooperation,
