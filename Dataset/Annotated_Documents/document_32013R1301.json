{"celex_id": "32013R1301", "reference": "20.12.2013\nEN\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\nL 347/289\nREGULATION (EU) No 1301/2013 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL\nof 17 December 2013\non the European Regional Development Fund and on specific provisions concerning the Investment for growth and jobs goal and repealing Regulation (EC) No 1080/2006\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Articles 178 and 349 thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee (1),\nHaving regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions (2),\nActing in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure,\nWhereas:\n(1)\nArticle 176 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) provides that the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) is intended to help to redress the main regional imbalances in the Union. Under that Article and the second and third paragraphs of Article 174 TFEU, the ERDF is to contribute to reducing disparities between the levels of development of the various regions and to reducing the backwardness of the least favoured regions, among which particular attention is to be paid to regions which suffer from severe and permanent natural or demographic handicaps such as the northernmost regions with very low population density and island, cross-border and mountain regions.\n(2)\nRegulation (EU) No 1303/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council (3) sets out the provisions common to the ERDF, the European Social Fund (ESF), the Cohesion Fund, the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development and the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund.\n(3)\nSpecific provisions concerning the type of activities which can be supported by the ERDF, in order to contribute to the investment priorities within the thematic objectives set out in Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013, should be laid down. At the same time, activities outside the scope of the ERDF should be defined and clarified, including investment to achieve the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions from activities listed in Annex I to Directive 2003/87/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (4). In order to avoid excessive financing, such investment should not be eligible for support from the ERDF as it already benefits financially from the application of Directive 2003/87/EC. That exclusion should not restrict the possibility of using the ERDF to support activities that are not listed in Annex I to Directive 2003/87/EC even if those activities are implemented by the same economic operators, and include activities such as energy efficiency investments in district heating networks, smart energy distribution, storage and transmission systems and measures aimed at reducing air pollution, even if one of the indirect effects of such activities is the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, or if they are listed in the national plan referred to in Directive 2003/87/EC.\n(4)\nIt is necessary to specify what additional activities can be supported by the ERDF under the European territorial cooperation goal.\n(5)\nThe ERDF should contribute to the Union strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth, thus ensuring greater concentration of ERDF support on the priorities of the Union. Depending on which category of regions is supported, the support from the ERDF under the Investment for growth and jobs goal should be concentrated on research and innovation, information and communication technologies (ICT), small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and promoting a low-carbon economy. That thematic concentration should be attained at national level while allowing for flexibility at the level of operational programmes and between different categories of regions. The thematic concentration should be adjusted, where appropriate, to take into account Cohesion Fund resources allocated to supporting the investment priorities relating to the shift towards a low-carbon economy and referred to in Regulation (EU) No 1300/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council (5). The degree of thematic concentration should take into account the level of development of the region, the contribution of Cohesion Fund resources where applicable, as well as the specific needs of regions whose GDP per capita used as an eligibility criterion for the 2007-2013 programming period was less than 75 % of the average GDP of the EU-25 for the reference period, regions designated with phasing-out status in the 2007-2013 programming period and certain NUTS level 2 regions consisting solely of island Member States or of islands.\n(6)\nIt should be possible for support from the ERDF under the investment priority 'community-led local development' to contribute to all of the thematic objectives referred to in this Regulation.\n(7)\nIn order to address the specific needs of the ERDF, and in line with the Union strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth, it is necessary to set out within each thematic objective laid down in Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013, the ERDF-specific actions as 'investment priorities'. Those investment priorities should set out detailed objectives, which are not mutually exclusive, to which the ERDF is to contribute. Such investment priorities should form the basis for the definition of specific objectives within programmes that take into account the needs and characteristics of the programme area.\n(8)\nIt is necessary to promote innovation and the development of SMEs, in emerging fields linked to European and regional challenges such as creative and cultural industries and innovative services, reflecting new societal demands, or to products and services linked to an ageing population, care and health, eco-innovation, the low-carbon economy and resource efficiency.\n(9)\nIn accordance with Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013, in order to optimise the added value from investments funded wholly or in part through the Union budget in the field of research and innovation, synergies will be sought in particular between the operation of the ERDF and Horizon 2020 - the Framework Programme for Research and Innovation whilst respecting their distinct objectives.\n(10)\nIt is important to ensure that, in promoting risk management investments, specific risks at regional, cross-border and transnational level are taken into account.\n(11)\nIn order to maximise their contribution to the objective of supporting employment-friendly growth, activities supporting sustainable tourism, culture and natural heritage should be part of a territorial strategy for specific areas, including the conversion of declining industrial regions. Support for such activities should also contribute to strengthening innovation and the use of ICT, SMEs, environment and resource efficiency or the promotion of social inclusion.\n(12)\nIn order to promote sustainable regional or local mobility or to reduce air and noise pollution, it is necessary to promote healthy, sustainable and safe modes of transport. Investments in airport infrastructure supported by the ERDF should promote environmentally sustainable air transport when, inter alia, enhancing regional mobility by connecting secondary and tertiary nodes to trans-European transport network (TEN-T) infrastructure, including through multimodal nodes.\n(13)\nIn order to promote the achievement of the energy and climate targets set by the Union as part of the Union strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth, the ERDF should support investment to promote energy efficiency and security of supply in Member States through, inter alia, the development of smart energy distribution, storage and transmission systems, including through the integration of distributed generation from renewable sources. In order to meet their security of supply requirements in a manner that is consistent with their targets under the Union strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth, Member States should be able to invest in energy infrastructure that is consistent with their chosen energy mix.\n(14)\nSMEs, which can include social economy enterprises, should be understood, in accordance with the definition laid down in Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013, as covering micro, small and medium-sized enterprises within the meaning of Commission Recommendation 2003/361/EC (6).\n(15)\nIn order to promote social inclusion and combat poverty, particularly among marginalised communities, it is necessary to improve access to social, cultural and recreational services, through the provision of small-scale infrastructure, taking account of the specific needs of persons with disabilities and the elderly.\n(16)\nCommunity-based services should cover all forms of in-home, family-based, residential and other community services which support the right of all persons to live in the community, with an equality of choices, and which seek to prevent isolation or segregation from the community.\n(17)\nIn order to increase flexibility and reduce the administrative burden through joint implementation, the ERDF and the Cohesion Fund investment priorities under the corresponding thematic objectives should be aligned.\n(18)\nA common set of output indicators to assess the aggregated progress at Union level of the implementation of programmes should be set out in an Annex to this Regulation. Those indicators should correspond to the investment priority and type of action supported in accordance with this Regulation and the relevant provisions of Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013. The common output indicators should be complemented by programme-specific result indicators and, where relevant, by programme-specific output indicators.\n(19)\nWithin the framework of sustainable urban development, it is considered necessary to support integrated actions to tackle the economic, environmental, climate, demographic and social challenges affecting urban areas, including functional urban areas, while taking into account the need to promote urban-rural linkages. The principles for selecting the urban areas where integrated actions for sustainable urban development are to be implemented, and the indicative amounts for those actions, should be set out in the Partnership Agreement with a minimum of 5 % of the ERDF resources allocated at national level for that purpose. The scope of any delegation of tasks to urban authorities should be decided upon by the managing authority in consultation with the urban authority.\n(20)\nIn order to identify or test new solutions which address issues that are related to sustainable urban development and are of relevance at Union level, the ERDF should support innovative actions in the area of sustainable urban development.\n(21)\nIn order to reinforce capacity-building, networking and exchange of experience between programmes and bodies responsible for implementing sustainable urban development strategies and innovative actions in the area of sustainable urban development and to complement existing programmes and bodies, it is necessary to establish an urban development network at Union level.\n(22)\nThe ERDF should address the problems of accessibility to, and remoteness from, large markets, faced by areas with an extremely low population density, as referred to in Protocol No 6 on special provisions for Objective 6 in the framework of the Structural Funds in Finland and Sweden to the 1994 Act of Accession. The ERDF should also address the specific difficulties encountered by certain islands, border regions, mountain regions and sparsely populated areas, the geographical situation of which slows down their development, with a view to supporting their sustainable development.\n(23)\nSpecific attention should be paid to the outermost regions, namely by adopting measures under Article 349 TFEU extending, on an exceptional basis, the scope of support from the ERDF to the financing of operating aid linked to the offsetting of the additional costs resulting from the specific economic and social situation of those regions which is compounded by the handicaps resulting from the factors referred to in Article 349 TFEU, namely remoteness, insularity, small size, difficult topography and climate, economic dependence on a few products, the permanence and combination of which severely restrain their development. Operating aid granted by Member States in that context is exempt from the notification obligation laid down in Article 108(3) TFEU, if, at the time it is granted, it fulfils the conditions laid down by a Regulation declaring certain categories of aid compatible with the internal market in application of Articles 107 and 108 TFEU, and adopted pursuant to Council Regulation (EC) No 994/98 (7).\n(24)\nIn line with the conclusions of the European Council of 7-8 February 2013, and taking into account the special objectives laid down in the TFEU concerning the outermost regions referred to in Article 349 TFEU, the status of Mayotte was changed as a result of European Council Decision 2012/419/EU (8) to become a new outermost region from 1 January 2014. In order to facilitate and to promote focused and rapid infrastructural development of Mayotte, it should be possible on an exceptional basis that at least 50 % of the ERDF part of Mayotte's envelope be allocated to five of the thematic objectives laid down in Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013.\n(25)\nIn order to supplement this Regulation with certain non-essential elements, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 TFEU should be delegated to the Commission in respect of detailed rules for the criteria for the selection and management of innovative actions. Such power should also be delegated to the Commission in respect of amendments to Annex I to this Regulation where justified to ensure the effective assessment of progress in implementation of operational programmes. It is of particular importance that the Commission carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level. The Commission, when preparing and drawing up delegated acts, should ensure a simultaneous, timely and appropriate transmission of relevant documents to the European Parliament and to the Council.\n(26)\nSince the objective of this Regulation, namely to reinforce economic, social and territorial cohesion by redressing the main regional imbalances in the Union, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States but can rather, by reason of the extent of the disparities between the levels of development of the various regions and the backwardness of the least favoured regions and the limit on the financial resources of the Member States and regions, be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve that objective.\n(27)\nThis Regulation replaces Regulation (EC) No 1080/2006 of the European Parliament and the Council (9). In the interests of clarity, Regulation (EC) No 1080/2006 should therefore be repealed. However, this Regulation should not affect either the continuation or modification of assistance approved by the Commission on the basis of Regulation (EC) No 1080/2006 or any other legislation applying to that assistance on 31 December 2013. That Regulation or such other applicable legislation should consequently continue to apply after 31 December 2013 to that assistance or the operations concerned until their closure. Applications to receive assistance made or approved under Regulation (EC) No 1080/2006 should remain valid.\n(28)\nIn order to allow for the prompt application of the measures provided for in this Regulation, this Regulation should enter into force on the day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union,\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nCHAPTER I\nCommon provisions\nArticle 1\nSubject matter\nThis Regulation establishes the tasks of the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), the scope of its support with regard to the Investment for growth and jobs goal and the European territorial cooperation goal and specific provisions concerning ERDF support for the Investment for growth and jobs goal.\nArticle 2\nTasks of the ERDF\nThe ERDF shall contribute to the financing of support which aims to reinforce economic, social and territorial cohesion by redressing the main regional imbalances in the Union through the sustainable development and structural adjustment of regional economies, including the conversion of declining industrial regions and regions whose development is lagging behind.\nArticle 3\nScope of support from the ERDF\n1.

For common and programme-specific output indicators, baselines shall be set at zero. Cumulative quantified target values for those indicators shall be set for 2023.\n3.   For programme-specific result indicators, which relate to investment priorities, baselines shall use the latest available data and targets shall be set for 2023. Targets may be expressed in quantitative or qualitative terms.\n4.   The Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 14 to amend the list of common output indicators set out in Annex I, in order to make adjustments, where justified to ensure effective assessment of progress in the implementation of operational programmes.\nCHAPTER II\nSpecific provisions on the treatment of particular territorial features\nArticle 7\nSustainable urban development\n1.   The ERDF shall support, within operational programmes, sustainable urban development through strategies that set out integrated actions to tackle the economic, environmental, climate, demographic and social challenges affecting urban areas, while taking into account the need to promote urban-rural linkages.\n2.   Sustainable urban development shall be undertaken through Integrated territorial investment as referred to in Article 36 of Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013, or through a specific operational programme, or through a specific priority axis in accordance with point (c) of the first subparagraph of Article 96(1) of Regulation (EU) No 1303 /2013.\n3.   Taking into account its specific territorial situation, each Member State shall establish in its Partnership Agreement the principles for the selection of urban areas where integrated actions for sustainable urban development are to be implemented and an indicative allocation for those actions at national level.\n4.   At least 5 % of the ERDF resources allocated at national level under the Investment for growth and jobs goal shall be allocated to integrated actions for sustainable urban development where cities, sub-regional or local bodies responsible for implementing sustainable urban strategies (\"urban authorities\") shall be responsible for tasks relating, at least, to the selection of operations in accordance with Article 123(6) of Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013, or, where appropriate, in accordance with Article 123(7) of that Regulation. The indicative amount to be dedicated for the purposes of paragraph 2 of this Article shall be set out in the operational programme or programmes concerned.\n5.   The managing authority shall determine, in consultation with the urban authority, the scope of tasks, to be undertaken by urban authorities, concerning the management of integrated actions for sustainable urban development. The managing authority shall formally record its decision in writing. The managing authority may retain the right to undertake a final verification of eligibility of operations before approval.\nArticle 8\nInnovative actions in the area of sustainable urban development\n1.   At the initiative of the Commission, the ERDF may support innovative actions in the area of sustainable urban development in accordance with Article 92(8) of Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013. Such actions shall include studies and pilot projects to identify or test new solutions which address issues that are related to sustainable urban development and are of relevance at Union level. The Commission shall encourage the involvement of relevant partners referred to in Article 5(1) of Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013 in the preparation and implementation of innovative actions.\n2.   By way of derogation from Article 4 of this Regulation, innovative actions may support all activities necessary to achieve the thematic objectives set out in the first paragraph of Article 9 of Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013 and the corresponding investment priorities set out in Article 5 of this Regulation.\n3.   The Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 14 laying down detailed rules concerning the principles for the selection and management of innovative actions to be supported by the ERDF in accordance with this Regulation.\nArticle 9\nUrban development network\n1.   The Commission shall establish, in accordance with Article 58 of Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013 an urban development network to promote capacity-building, networking and exchange of experience at Union level between urban authorities responsible for implementing sustainable urban development strategies in accordance with Article 7(4) and (5) of this Regulation and authorities responsible for innovative actions in the area of sustainable urban development in accordance with Article 8 of this Regulation.\n2.   The activities of the urban development network shall be complementary to those undertaken under interregional cooperation pursuant to point (3)(b) of Article 2 of Regulation (EU) No 1299/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council (11).\nArticle 10\nAreas with natural or demographic handicaps\nIn operational programmes co-financed by the ERDF, covering areas with severe and permanent natural or demographic handicaps as referred to in point 4 of Article 121 of Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013, particular attention shall be paid to addressing the specific difficulties of those areas.\nArticle 11\nNorthernmost regions with very low population density\nArticle 4 shall not apply to the specific additional allocation for the northernmost regions with very low population density. That allocation shall be allocated to the thematic objectives set out in points 1, 2, 3, 4 and 7 of the first paragraph of Article 9 of Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013.\nArticle 12\nOutermost regions\n1.   Article 4 shall not apply to the specific additional allocation for the outermost regions.

Development Fund and on specific rules about the investment for growth and jobs goal\nWHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?\nIt sets up the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) for the period 2014-2020. The ERDF aims to promote the EU’s harmonious, balanced and sustainable development by correcting some of the differences in levels of development between its regions.\nThe regulation has been amended three times by: amending Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2018/1046 — the EU’s financial regulation (see summary) which sets out the rules for drawing up and implementing the EU budget; andamending Regulation (EU) 2020/460, adopted following the COVID-19 outbreak, which contains specific measures to mobilise investments in EU countries’ healthcare systems and in other sectors of their economies (Coronavirus Response Investment Initiative), andamending Regulation (EU) 2020/558, adopted following the COVID-19 outbreak, and containing exceptional flexibility for the use of the European Structural and Investments Funds (ESI Funds).\nKEY POINTS\nEligibility\nAll regions in EU countries are eligible but the aid granted depends on EU priorities and the type of region.\nKey themes\nThe ERDF concentrates its investments on 4 key themes:\ninnovation and research;\ninformation and communication technologies (ICT);\nsupport for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs);\npromoting a low-carbon economy.\nTypes of investment\nin SMEs to create and safeguard sustainable jobs,\nin all types of enterprise in the fields of innovation and research, the low-carbon economy, as well as ICT where SMEs are involved,\nin infrastructure providing basic services in energy, environment, transport, and ICT, but also in social, health and educational infrastructure,\nworking capital in SMEs where necessary as a temporary measure to provide an effective response to a public health crisis (following the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic), and\nin the development of endogenous potential.\nOverall budget\nThe budget for 2014-2020 is over €185 billion.\nPolicy and budget priorities\nThe 4 key themes listed above are very significant for the allocation of ERDF funding which varies depending on the category of region.\nThe regions are defined in terms of their GDP expressed as a percentage of an EU average: more developed regions: GDP more than 90%transition regions: GDP 75%-90%less developed regions: GDP less than 75%\nIn more developed regions, (transition regions), (less developed regions), at least 80% (60%) (50%) of total ERDF funds in each country must be allocated to 2 or more of the 4 key themes, namely innovation and research, SMEs, ICT and a low-carbon economy; because of its importance, at least 20% (15%) (12%) of total ERDF funds in each country must be channelled specifically towards low-carbon economy projects.\nA minimum of 5% of ERDF funding is earmarked for sustainable urban development. An urban development network is to be set up at EU level to promote networking and exchange of experience on sustainable urban development.\nImplementation\nERDF is implemented at national level by means of 7-year programmes as part of a Partnership Agreement between the EU country and the EU which involves the 5 European Structural and Investment Funds (ESI Funds): ERDF,European Social Fund (ESF),Cohesion Fund,European Maritime and Fisheries Fund (EMFF) andEuropean Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD).\nThis agreement is prepared by each EU country with the involvement of partners representing regional and local public authorities, as well as a wide range of social, economic, environmental and other interests.\nCoronavirus Response Investment Initiative\nThe Coronavirus Investment Initiative, introduced by Regulation (EU) 2020/460, offers EU countries access to €37 billion from the ESI Funds to strengthen health systems and support small and medium-sized enterprises, short-time working schemes and community-based services.\nCoronavirus special measures: more flexibility in the use of ESI fund\nAmending Regulation (EU) 2020/558 allows EU countries to transfer resources between the European Regional Development Fund, the European Social Fund and the Cohesion Fund, between the different categories of regions and between the 3 funds’ specific priority areas.\nFrom 1 July 2020 to 30 June 2021, cohesion policy programmes related to COVID-19 can be financed exceptionally through 100% EU funding during the accounting year. The measures also simplify programme approval to speed up implementation, make financial instruments easier to use and simplify audits.\nFROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?\n              \nIt has applied since 21 December 2013.\nBACKGROUND\n              \nFor more information, see:\nEuropean Regional Development Fund (European Commission)\nCohesion policy action against coronavirus (European Commission).\nMAIN DOCUMENT\n            \nRegulation (EU) No 1301/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 December 2013 on the European Regional Development Fund and on specific provisions concerning the Investment for growth and jobs goal and repealing Regulation (EC) No 1080/2006 (OJ L 347, 20.12.2013, pp. 289-302)\nSuccessive amendment to Regulation (EU) No 1301/2013 have been incorporated in the original text.
