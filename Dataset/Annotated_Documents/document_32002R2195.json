Its impact on the quality of notices and the time needed to publish them is a de facto restriction on the access of economic operators to public contracts.(2) In its Recommendation 96/527/EC(5) the Commission invited contracting entities and authorities to use the Common Procurement Vocabulary (CPV), developed on the basis of certain existing classifications with a view to gearing them more closely to the particular features of the public procurement sector, when describing the subjects of their contracts.(3) There is a need to standardise, by means of a single classification system for public procurement, the references used by the contracting authorities and entities to describe the subject of contracts.(4) The Member States need to have a single reference system which uses the same description of goods in the official languages of the Community and the same corresponding alphanumeric code, thus making it possible to overcome the language barriers at Community level.(5) A revised version of the CPV therefore needs to be adopted under this Regulation as a single classification system for public procurement, the implementation of which is covered by the Directives on the coordination of procedures for the award of public contracts.(6) Illustrative tables must also be drawn up showing the correspondence between the CPV and the Statistical Classification of Products by Activity in the EEC (CPA), the Provisional Central Product Classification (CPC Prov.) of the United Nations, the General Industrial Classification of Economic Activities within the European Communities (NACE Rev. 1) and the Combined Nomenclature (CN).(7) The structure and codes of the CPV may need to be adapted or amended, in the light of developments in the markets and users' needs. A suitable revision procedure must therefore be established.(8) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Regulation should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission(6).(9) Since the objective of the proposed action, namely the drawing up of a classification system for public contracts, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore, by reason of the dimensions and effects of the action, be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve that objective.(10) A Regulation has been chosen rather than a Directive as the establishment of a classification system for public contracts does not require implementation by the Member States.(11) With a view to familiarising users with a unified classification system that will eventually be compulsory, the implementation of this CPV Regulation should be preceded by a period of adjustment,HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:Article 11. A single classification system applicable to public procurement, known as the \"Common Procurement Vocabulary\" or \"CPV\" is hereby established.2. The text of the CPV is set out in Annex I.3. The illustrative tables showing the correspondence between the CPV and the Statistical Classification of Products by Activity in the EEC (CPA), the Provisional Central Product Classification (CPC Prov.) of the United Nations, the General Industrial Classification of Economic Activities within the European Communities (NACE Rev. 1) and the Combined Nomenclature (CN) are set out in Annexes II, III, IV and V respectively.Article 2The measures necessary for the revision of the CPV shall be adopted by the Commission in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 3(2).Article 31. The Commission shall be assisted by the Advisory Committee for Public Contracts set up by Article 1 of Council Decision 71/306/EEC(7) (hereinafter referred to as \"the Committee\").2. Where reference is made to this paragraph, Articles 3 and 7 of Decision 1999/468/EC shall apply, having regard to the provisions of Article 8 thereof.3. The Committee shall adopt its rules of procedure.Article 4This Regulation shall enter into force on 16 December 2003.This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.Done at Brussels, 5 November 2002.For the European ParliamentThe PresidentP.

The CPV consists of a main vocabulary and a supplementary vocabulary.2. The main vocabulary is based on a tree structure comprising codes of up to nine digits associated with a wording that describes the supplies, works or services forming the subject of the contract.The numerical code consists of 8 digits, subdivided as follows:- the first two digits identify the divisions;- the first three digits identify the groups;- the first four digits identify the classes;- the first five digits identify the categories.Each of the last three digits gives a greater degree of precision within each category.A ninth digit serves to verify the previous digits.3. The supplementary vocabulary may be used to expand the description of the subject of a contract. The items are made up of an alphanumeric code with a corresponding wording allowing further details to be added regarding the specific nature or destination of the goods to be purchased.The alphanumeric code is made up of:- a first level comprising a letter corresponding to a section;- a second level comprising four digits, the first three of which denote a subdivision and the last one being for verification purposes.>TABLE>SUPPLEMENTARY VOCABULARY>TABLE>ANNEX IICORRESPONDENCE TABLE BETWEEN CPV AND CPA 96>TABLE>ANNEX IIICORRESPONDENCE TABLE BETWEEN CPV AND CPC prov.>TABLE>ANNEX IVCORRESPONDENCE TABLE BETWEEN CPV AND NACE Rev. 1>TABLE>ANNEX VCORRESPONDENCE TABLE BETWEEN CPV AND CN>TABLE>", "summary": "Common procurement vocabulary\nCommon procurement vocabulary\nSUMMARY OF:\nRegulation (EC) No 2195/2002 on the EU’s Common Procurement Vocabulary\nSUMMARY\nWHAT DOES THE REGULATION DO?\nIt seeks to standardise, by means of a single classification system for public procurement, the terms used by contracting authorities and entities to describe the subject of contracts.\nKEY POINTS\nThe regulation establishes a single classification system: the Common Procurement Vocabulary (CPV). This classification endeavours to cover the characteristics for supplies, works and services contracts. By standardising the references used by contracting authorities to describe the subject matter of their contracts, the use of CPV improves the transparency of public procurement covered by the EU directives.\nUse of CPV makes it easier for potential contractors, such as companies, to find business opportunities, and reduces the risk of error in translating notices, since the CPV is available in all the EU’s official languages.\nThe CPV attaches to each numerical code a description of the subject of the contract, for which there is a version in each of the official languages of the EU. The CPV consists of:\na main vocabulary, based on a tree structure, containing a series of numerical codes comprising eight digits and a ninth digit which serves to verify the previous digits;\na supplementary vocabulary expanding the description of the subject of a contract by adding further details regarding the nature or destination of the object of the contract.\nThe list of CPV codes and the tables of correspondence between the CPV and other nomenclatures can be consulted on the Internet site: SIMAP ‘Information about European public procurement’.\nThe current CPV was designed to be more user-friendly by focusing less on materials and more on products. In addition, the CPV’s hierarchy was rationalised.\nThe TED website ensures that notices of public tenders subject to EU directives are published in the Official Journal ‘S’ series. Since 2003, TED has used the CPV codes which became compulsory with the adoption of the Directives 2004/17/EC) and 2004/18/EC (subsequently repealed respectively by Directives  2014/25/EU and 2014/24/EU).\nACT\n            \nRegulation (EC) No 2195/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 5 November 2002 on the Common Procurement Vocabulary (CPV) (OJ L 340, 16.12.2002, pp. 1-562)\nSuccessive amendments and corrections to Regulation (EC) No 2195/2002 have been incorporated in the basic text.
