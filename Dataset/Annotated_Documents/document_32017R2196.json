{"celex_id": "32017R2196", "reference": "28.11.2017\nEN\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\nL 312/54\nCOMMISSION REGULATION (EU) 2017/2196\nof 24 November 2017\nestablishing a network code on electricity emergency and restoration\n(Text with EEA relevance)\nTHE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,\nHaving regard to Regulation (EC) No 714/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 July 2009 on conditions for access to the network for cross-border exchanges in electricity and repealing Regulation (EC) No 1228/2003 (1), and in particular Article 6(11) thereof,\nWhereas:\n(1)\nA fully functioning and interconnected internal energy market is crucial for maintaining security of energy supply, increasing competitiveness and ensuring that all consumers can purchase energy at affordable prices.\n(2)\nRegulation (EC) No 714/2009 sets out non-discriminatory rules governing access to the network for cross-border exchanges in electricity with a view to ensuring the proper functioning of the internal market in electricity.\n(3)\nCommission Regulation (EU) 2017/1485 (2) sets out harmonised rules on system operation for transmission system operators (‘TSOs’), regional security coordinators (‘RSCs’), distribution system operators (‘DSOs’) and significant grid users (‘SGUs’). It identifies different critical system states (normal state, alert state, emergency state, blackout state and restoration). It also includes requirements and principles to ensure the conditions for maintaining operational security throughout the Union and promote the coordination of system operation, requirements and principles for operational planning and scheduling processes required to anticipate real-time operational security difficulties and requirements and principles for Union-wide load frequency control and reserves.\n(4)\nA common set of minimum requirements and principles needs to be developed for the procedures and actions to be carried out specifically when in the emergency, blackout and restoration states.\n(5)\nEven though each TSO is responsible for maintaining operational security in its control area, the secure and efficient operation of the Union's electricity system is a task shared between all the Union TSOs since all national systems are, to a certain extent, interconnected and a fault in one control area could affect other areas. The efficient operation of the Union's electricity system also requires a close collaboration and coordination between stakeholders.\n(6)\nIt is therefore necessary to set out harmonised requirements concerning technical and organisational measures in order to prevent the propagation or deterioration of an incident in the national system and to avoid the spread of the disturbance and blackout state to other systems. It is also necessary to set out harmonised procedures that TSOs should implement in order to restore the alert or normal state after the spread of the disturbance or blackout state.\n(7)\nEach TSO should establish a system defence plan and a restoration plan, through a three steps approach: a design phase, consisting of defining the detailed content of the plan; an implementation phase, consisting in the development and installation of all necessary means and services for the activation of the plan; and an activation phase, consisting of operational use of one or more measure(s) from the plan.\n(8)\nThe harmonisation of the requirements for the establishment by TSOs of their respective system defence plan and restoration plan should ensure the overall efficiency of those plans at Union level.\n(9)\nTSOs should ensure the continuity of energy transactions during emergency, blackout or restoration state and only suspend market activities and market's accompanying processes as a last resort. Clear, objective and harmonised conditions under which energy transactions could be suspended and subsequently restored should be established.\n(10)\nEach TSO should support any other TSO in emergency, blackout or restoration state, upon request, where such support does not lead the system of the requested TSO into emergency or blackout state.\n(11)\nIn Member States where public communication systems are used, TSOs, DSOs, SGUs and restoration service providers should endeavour to obtain telecommunication priority status from their respective telecommunication provider.\n(12)\nOn 20 July 2015, the Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (‘the Agency’) recommended the adoption by the Commission of the Network Code on Electricity Balancing, subject to the requirements contained in the recommendation of the Agency No 3/2015.\n(13)\nIn addition to the general provisions of Regulation (EU) 2017/1485, specific requirements are needed to guarantee the information exchange and communication during the emergency, blackout or restoration states, as well as the availability of critical tools and facilities necessary to operate and restore the system.\n(14)\nThis Regulation has been adopted on the basis of Regulation (EC) No 714/2009 which it supplements and of which it forms an integral part. References to Regulation (EC) No 714/2009 in other legal acts should be understood as also referring to this Regulation.\n(15)\nThe measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee referred to in Article 23(1) of Regulation (EC) No 714/2009,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nCHAPTER I\nGENERAL PROVISIONS\nArticle 1\nSubject matter\nFor the purposes of safeguarding operational security, preventing the propagation or deterioration of an incident to avoid a widespread disturbance and the blackout state as well to allow for the efficient and rapid restoration of the electricity system from the emergency or blackout states, this Regulation establishes a network code which lays down the requirements on:\n(a)\nthe management by TSOs of the emergency, blackout and restoration states;\n(b)\nthe coordination of system operation across the Union in the emergency, blackout and restoration states;\n(c)\nthe simulations and tests to guarantee a reliable, efficient and fast restoration of the interconnected transmission systems to the normal state from the emergency or blackout states;\n(d)\nthe tools and facilities needed to guarantee a reliable, efficient and fast restoration of the interconnected transmission systems to the normal state from the emergency or blackout states.\nArticle 2\nScope\n1.

When the assistance needs to be provided through direct current interconnectors, it may consist in carrying out the following actions, taking into account the technical characteristics and capability of HVDC system:\n(a)\nmanual regulation actions of the transmitted active power to help the TSO in emergency state to bring power flows within operational security limits or frequency of neighbouring synchronous area within system frequency limits for alert state defined pursuant to Article 18(2) of Regulation (EU) 2017/1485;\n(b)\nautomatic control functions of the transmitted active power based on the signals and criteria set out in Article 13 of Regulation (EU) 2016/1447;\n(c)\nautomatic frequency control pursuant to Articles 15 to 18 of Regulation (EU) 2016/1447 in case of islanded operation;\n(d)\nvoltage and reactive power control pursuant to Article 24 of Regulation (EU) 2016/1447, and\n(e)\nany other appropriate action.\n3.   Each TSO may proceed to a manual disconnection of any transmission system element having a significant cross-border impact, including an interconnector, subject to the following requirements:\n(a)\nthe TSO shall coordinate with neighbouring TSOs; and\n(b)\nthis action shall not lead the remaining interconnected transmission system into emergency state or blackout state.\n4.   Notwithstanding paragraph 3, a TSO may manually disconnect any transmission system element having a significant cross-border impact, including an interconnector, without coordination, in exceptional circumstances implying a violation of the operational security limits, to prevent endangering personnel safety or damaging equipment. Within 30 days of the incident, the TSO shall prepare a report at least in English containing a detailed explanation of the rationale, implementation and impact of this action and submit it to the relevant regulatory authority in accordance with Article 37 of Directive 2009/72/EC and neighbouring TSOs, and make it available to the significantly affected system users.\nSECTION 2\nMeasures of the System Defence Plan\nArticle 15\nAutomatic under-frequency control scheme\n1.   The scheme for the automatic control of under-frequency of the system defence plan shall include a scheme for the automatic low frequency demand disconnection and the settings of the limited frequency sensitive mode-underfrequency in the TSO load frequency control (LFC) area.\n2.   In the design of its system defence plan, each TSO shall provide for the activation of the limited frequency sensitive mode-underfrequency prior to the activation of the scheme for the automatic low frequency demand disconnection, where the rate of change of frequency allows it.\n3.   Prior to the activation of the automatic low frequency demand disconnection scheme, each TSO and DSO identified pursuant to Article 11(4) shall foresee that energy storage units acting as load connected to its system:\n(a)\nautomatically switch to generation mode within the time limit and at an active power set-point established by the TSO in the system defence plan; or\n(b)\nwhen the energy storage unit is not capable of switching within the time limit established by the TSO in the system defence plan, automatically disconnect the energy storage unit acting as load.\n4.   Each TSO shall establish in its system defence plan the frequency thresholds at which the automatic switching or disconnection of energy storage units shall occur. These frequency thresholds shall be lower or equal to the system frequency limit defined for the emergency state in Article 18(3) of Regulation (EU) 2017/1485 and higher than the frequency limit for demand disconnection starting mandatory level laid down in the Annex.\n5.   Each TSO shall design the scheme for the automatic low frequency demand disconnection in accordance with the parameters for shedding load in real-time laid down in the Annex. The scheme shall include the disconnection of demand at different frequencies, from a ‘starting mandatory level’ to a ‘final mandatory level’, within an implementation range whilst respecting a minimum number and maximum size of steps. The implementation range shall define the maximum admissible deviation of netted demand to be disconnected from the target netted demand to be disconnected at a given frequency, calculated through a linear interpolation between starting and final mandatory levels. The implementation range shall not allow the disconnection of less netted demand than the amount of netted demand to be disconnected at the starting mandatory level. A step cannot be considered as such if no netted demand is disconnected when this step is reached.\n6.   Each TSO or DSO shall install the relays necessary for low frequency demand disconnection taking into account at least load behaviour and dispersed generation.\n7.   When implementing the scheme for the automatic low frequency demand disconnection pursuant to the notification under Article 12(2), each TSO or DSO shall:\n(a)\navoid setting an intentional time delay in addition to the operating time of the relays and circuit breakers;\n(b)\nminimise the disconnection of power generating modules, especially those providing inertia; and\n(c)\nlimit the risk that the scheme leads to power flow deviations and voltage deviations outside operational security limits.\nIf a DSO cannot fulfil the requirements under points (b) and (c), it shall notify the TSO and propose which requirement shall apply. The TSO, in consultation with the DSO shall establish the applicable requirements based on a joint cost-benefit analysis.\n8.   The scheme for the automatic low frequency demand disconnection of the system defence plan may provide for netted demand disconnection based on frequency gradient provided that:\n(a)\nit is activated only:\n(i)\nwhen the frequency deviation is higher than the maximum steady state frequency deviation and the frequency gradient is higher than the one produced by the reference incident;\n(ii)\nuntil the frequency reaches the frequency of the demand disconnection starting mandatory level;\n(b)\nit complies with the Annex; and\n(c)\nit is necessary and justified in order to maintain efficiently the operational security.\n9.   In case the scheme for the automatic low frequency demand disconnection of the system defence plan includes netted demand disconnection based on frequency gradient, as described in paragraph 8, the TSO shall submit, within 30 days of the implementation, a report containing a detailed explanation of the rationale, implementation and impact of this measure to the national regulatory authority.\n10.   A TSO may include in the scheme for automatic low frequency demand disconnection of its system defence plan additional steps for netted demand disconnection below the final mandatory level of demand disconnection set out in the Annex.\n11.   Each TSO shall be entitled to implement additional system protection schemes that are triggered by a frequency smaller or equal to the frequency of the final mandatory level of demand disconnection and which aim at a faster restoration process. The TSO shall ensure that such additional schemes do not further deteriorate frequency.\nArticle 16\nAutomatic over-frequency control scheme\n1.   The scheme for automatic over-frequency control of the system defence plan shall lead to an automatic decrease of the total active power injected in each LFC area.\n2.   In consultation with the other TSOs of its synchronous area, each TSO shall set out the following parameters of its scheme for automatic over-frequency control:\n(a)\nthe frequency thresholds for its activation; and\n(b)\nthe reduction ratio of injection of active power.\n3.   Each TSO shall design its automatic over-frequency control scheme taking into account the capabilities of the power generating modules concerning the limited frequency sensitive mode — overfrequency and of the energy storage units, in its LFC area. If the limited frequency sensitive mode — overfrequency does not exist or is not sufficient to fulfil the requirements set out in points (a) and (b) of paragraph 2, each TSO shall set up in addition a step-wise linear disconnection of generation in its LFC area. The TSO shall establish the maximum size of the steps for disconnection of power generating modules and/or of HVDC systems in consultation with the other TSOs of its synchronous area.\nArticle 17\nAutomatic scheme against voltage collapse\n1.   The automatic scheme against voltage collapse of the system defence plan may include one or more of the following schemes, depending on the results of a TSO's assessment of system security:\n(a)\na scheme for low voltage demand disconnection according to Article 19(2) of Regulation (EU) 2016/1388;\n(b)\na blocking scheme for on load tap changer according to Article 19(3) of Regulation (EU) 2016/1388; and\n(c)\nsystem protection schemes for voltage management.\n2.   Unless the assessment pursuant to paragraph 1 demonstrates that implementing a blocking scheme for on load tap changer is not necessary to prevent a voltage collapse in the TSO control area, the TSO shall establish the conditions under which the on load tap changer shall block according to Article 19(3) of Regulation (EU) 2016/1388, including at least:\n(a)\nthe blocking method (local or remote from control room);\n(b)\nthe voltage level threshold at the connection point;\n(c)\nthe flow direction of reactive power; and\n(d)\nthe maximum lapse of time between the detection of the threshold and the blocking.\nArticle 18\nFrequency deviation management procedure\n1.   The procedure for the management of frequency deviations of the system defence plan shall contain a set of measures to manage a frequency deviation outside the frequency limits defined for the alert state in Article 18(2) of Regulation (EU) 2017/1485. The frequency deviation management procedure shall be in line with the procedures set out for remedial actions which need to be managed in a coordinated way in accordance with Article 78(4) of Regulation (EU) 2017/1485 and shall fulfil at least the following requirements:\n(a)\na decrease of generation shall be smaller than the decrease of load during under-frequency events; and\n(b)\na decrease of generation shall be greater than the decrease of load during over-frequency events.\n2.   Each TSO shall adapt the operating mode of its LFC in order to prevent interference with manual activation or deactivation of active power as laid down in paragraphs 3 and 5.\n3.   Each TSO shall be entitled to establish an active power set-point that each SGU identified pursuant to point (c) of Article 11(4) shall maintain, provided that the set-point fulfils the technical constraints of the SGU. Each TSO shall be entitled to establish an active power set-point that each defence service provider shall maintain provided this measure applies to them pursuant to the terms and conditions referred to in Article 4(4) and the set-point respects the technical constraints of the defence service provider. The SGUs and defence service providers shall execute without undue delay the instructions given by the TSO directly or indirectly through DSOs and shall remain in that state until further instructions are issued. Where the instructions are given directly, the TSO shall inform the relevant DSOs without undue delay.\n4.   Each TSO shall be entitled to disconnect SGUs and defence service providers, directly or indirectly through DSOs. SGUs and defence service providers shall remain disconnected until further instructions are issued. Where SGUs are directly disconnected, the TSO shall inform the relevant DSOs without undue delay. Within 30 days of the incident, the TSO shall prepare a report containing a detailed explanation of the rationale, implementation and impact of this action and submit it to the relevant regulatory authority in accordance with Article 37 of Directive 2009/72/EC as well as make it available to the significantly affected system users.\n5.   Prior to the activation of the automatic low frequency demand disconnection scheme set out in Article 15 and provided that the rate of change of frequency allows it, each TSO shall, directly or indirectly through DSOs, activate demand response from the relevant defence service providers and:\n(a)\nswitch energy storage units acting as load to generation mode at an active power set-point established by the TSO in the system defence plan; or\n(b)\nwhen the energy storage unit is not capable of switching fast enough to stabilise frequency, manually disconnect the energy storage unit.\nArticle 19\nVoltage deviation management procedure\n1.   The procedure for the management of voltage deviations of the system defence plan shall contain a set of measures to manage voltage deviations outside the operational security limits set out in Article 25 of Regulation (EU) 2017/1485.\n2.   Each TSO shall be entitled to establish a reactive power range or voltage range and instruct the DSOs and SGUs identified for this measure pursuant to Article 11(4) to maintain it, in accordance with Articles 28 and 29 of Regulation (EU) 2017/1485.\n3.   Upon request of neighbouring TSO in emergency state, each TSO shall make available all reactive power capabilities that do not lead its transmission system into emergency state or blackout state.\nArticle 20\nPower flow management procedure\n1.   The procedure for power flow management of the system defence plan shall include a set of measures to manage power flow outside the operational security limits set out in Article 25 of Regulation (EU) 2017/1485.\n2.   Each TSO shall be entitled to establish an active power set-point that each SGU identified pursuant to point (c) Article 11(4) shall maintain provided that the set-point respects the technical constraints of the SGU. Each TSO shall be entitled to establish an active power set-point that each defence service provider shall maintain provided this measure applies to them pursuant to the terms and conditions referred to in Article 4(4) and the set-point respects the technical constraints of the defence service providers. The SGUs and defence service providers shall execute without undue delay the instructions given by the TSO directly or indirectly through DSOs and shall remain in that state until further instructions are issued. Where the instructions are given directly, the TSO shall inform the relevant DSOs without undue delay.\n3.   Each TSO shall be entitled to disconnect SGUs and defence service providers, directly or indirectly through DSOs. SGUs and defence service providers shall remain disconnected until further instructions are issued. Where SGU are directly disconnected, the TSO shall inform the relevant DSOs without undue delay. Within 30 days of the incident, the TSO shall prepare a report containing a detailed explanation of the rationale, implementation and impact of this action and submit it to the relevant regulatory authority in accordance with Article 37 of Directive 2009/72/EC.\nArticle 21\nAssistance for active power procedure\n1.   In case of absence of control area adequacy in the day-ahead or intraday timeframe, identified pursuant to paragraphs 1 and 2 of Article 107 of Regulation (EU) 2017/1485, and prior to any potential suspension of market activities pursuant to Article 35, a TSO shall be entitled to request assistance for active power from:\n(a)\nany balancing service provider, which, upon the TSO request, shall change its availability status to make available all its active power, provided it was not already activated through the balancing market, and conforming to its technical constraints;\n(b)\nany SGU connected in its LFC area, which does not already provide a balancing service to the TSO, and which, upon the TSO request, shall make available all its active power, conforming to its technical constraints; and\n(c)\nother TSOs that are in the normal or alert state.\n2.   A TSO may activate the assistance for active power from a balancing service provider or a SGU, under points (a) and (b) of paragraph 1, only if it has activated all balancing energy bids available, taking into account the available cross zonal capacity at the moment of absence of adequacy of the control area.\n3.   Each TSO who has been subject to a request for assistance for active power pursuant to paragraph 1(c) shall:\n(a)\nmake available its unshared bids;\n(b)\nbe entitled to activate the available balancing energy, in order to provide the corresponding power to the requesting TSO; and\n(c)\nbe entitled to request the assistance for active power from its balancing service providers and from any SGU connected in its LFC area which does not already provide a balancing service to the TSO, in order to provide the corresponding assistance for active power to the requesting TSO.\n4.   When activating the active power requested pursuant to paragraph 1(c), the requesting and the requested TSOs shall be entitled to use:\n(a)\navailable cross-zonal capacity in case the activation is made before the intraday cross-zonal gate closure time and if the provision of concerned cross-zonal capacities has not been suspended pursuant to Article 35;\n(b)\nadditional capacity that may be available due to real-time status of the system in which case the requesting and the requested TSOs shall coordinate with other significantly affected TSOs in accordance with Article 6(5).\n5.   Once the requested and requesting TSOs have agreed on the conditions for the provision of assistance for active power, the agreed amount of active power and timeslot for the provision shall be firm, unless the transmission system of the TSO providing the assistance enters into the emergency or blackout state.\nArticle 22\nManual demand disconnection procedure\n1.   In addition to the measures set out in Articles 18 to 21, each TSO may establish an amount of netted demand to be manually disconnected, directly by the TSO or indirectly through DSOs, when necessary to prevent the propagation or worsening of an emergency state. Where demand is to be directly disconnected, the TSO shall inform the relevant DSOs without delay.\n2.   The TSO shall activate the manual disconnection of the netted demand referred to in paragraph 1 to:\n(a)\nresolve overloads or under voltage situations; or\n(b)\nresolve situations in which assistance for active power pursuant to Article 21 has been requested but is not sufficient to maintain adequacy in day-ahead and intraday timeframes in its control area, pursuant to Article 107 of Regulation (EU) 2017/1485, leading to a risk of frequency deterioration in the synchronous area.\n3.   The TSO shall notify DSOs of the amount of netted demand established pursuant to paragraph 1 to be disconnected on their distribution systems. Each DSO shall disconnect the notified amount of netted demand, without undue delay.\n4.   Within 30 days of the incident, the TSO shall prepare a report containing a detailed explanation of the rationale, implementation and impact of this action and submit it to the relevant regulatory authority in accordance with Article 37 of Directive 2009/72/EC.\nCHAPTER III\nRESTORATION PLAN\nSECTION 1\nGeneral provisions\nArticle 23\nDesign of the restoration plan\n1.   By 18 December 2018, each TSO shall design a restoration plan in consultation with relevant DSOs, SGUs, national regulatory authorities or entities referred to in Article 4(3), neighbouring TSOs and the other TSOs in that synchronous area.\n2.

When provided for in national legislation, the TSO shall notify directly the SGUs identified pursuant to Article 23(4) and restoration service providers and DSOs connected to distribution systems and shall inform the concerned DSO of this notification.\n5.   Where a TSO notifies a DSO in accordance with paragraph 2, the DSO shall notify in turn, without delay, the SGUs, restoration service providers and DSOs connected to its distribution system of the measures of the restoration plan which they have to implement on their respective installations, including the deadlines for implementation, pursuant to point (g) of Article 23(4).\n6.   Each notified DSO, SGUs and restoration service provider shall:\n(a)\nimplement the measures notified no later than 12 months from the date of notification;\n(b)\nconfirm the implementation of the measures to the notifying system operator, who shall, when different from the TSO, notify the TSO; and\n(c)\nmaintain the measures implemented on its installations.\nArticle 25\nActivation of the restoration plan\n1.   Each TSO shall activate the procedures of its restoration plan in coordination with the DSOs and SGUs identified pursuant to Article 23(4) and with restoration service providers in the following cases:\n(a)\nwhen the system is in the emergency state in accordance with the criteria in Article 18(3) of Regulation (EU) 2017/1485, once the system is stabilised following activation of the measures of the system defence plan; or\n(b)\nwhen the system is in the blackout state in accordance with the criteria in Article 18(4) of Regulation (EU) 2017/1485.\n2.   During system restoration, each TSO shall identify and monitor:\n(a)\nthe extent and borders of the synchronised region or synchronised regions to which its control area belongs;\n(b)\nthe TSOs with which it shares a synchronised region or synchronised regions; and\n(c)\nthe available active power reserves in its control area.\n3.

Each TSO shall activate those procedures of its restoration plan that have a significant cross-border impact in coordination with the impacted TSOs.\nSECTION 2\nRe-energisation\nArticle 26\nRe-energisation procedure\n1.   The re-energisation procedure of the restoration plan shall contain a set of measures allowing the TSO to apply:\n(a)\na top-down re-energisation strategy; and\n(b)\na bottom-up re-energisation strategy.\n2.   Regarding the bottom-up re-energisation strategy, the re-energisation procedure shall contain at least measures for:\n(a)\nmanaging voltage and frequency deviations due to re-energisation;\n(b)\nmonitoring and managing island operation; and\n(c)\nresynchronising island operation areas.\nArticle 27\nActivation of the re-energisation procedure\n1.   When activating the re-energisation procedure, each TSO shall set up the strategy to be applied, taking into account:\n(a)\nthe availability of power sources capable of re-energisation in its control area;\n(b)\nthe expected duration and risks of possible re-energisation strategies;\n(c)\nthe conditions of the power systems;\n(d)\nthe conditions of the directly connected systems, including at least the status of interconnectors;\n(e)\nthe high priority significant grid users listed pursuant to Article 23(4); and\n(f)\nthe possibility to combine top-down and bottom-up re-energisation strategies.\n2.   When applying a top-down re-energisation strategy, each TSO shall manage the connection of load and generation with the aim to regulate the frequency towards the nominal frequency with a maximum tolerance of the maximum steady-state frequency deviation. Each TSO shall apply the conditions for connection of load and generation defined by the frequency leader, where appointed in accordance with Article 29.\n3.   When applying a bottom-up re-energisation strategy, each TSO shall manage the connection of load and generation with the aim to regulate the frequency towards the target frequency established in accordance with point (c) of Article 28(3).\n4.   During re-energisation, the TSO shall, after consultation with DSOs, establish and notify the amount of netted demand to be reconnected on distribution networks. Each DSO shall reconnect the notified amount of netted demand, while respecting the block loading and taking into account the automatic re-connection of load and generation in its network.\n5.   Each TSO shall inform its neighbouring TSOs on its capability to support a top-down re-energisation strategy.\n6.   For the activation of a top-down re-energisation strategy, the TSO shall request neighbouring TSOs to support the re-energisation. This support may consist in assistance for active power, in accordance with paragraphs 3 to 5 of Article 21. The requested TSOs shall provide assistance for the re-energisation, unless it would lead their systems to the emergency or blackout states. In this case, the requesting TSO shall use the bottom-up re-energisation strategy.\nSECTION 3\nFrequency management\nArticle 28\nFrequency management procedure\n1.   The frequency management procedure of the restoration plan shall contain a set of measures aiming at restoring system frequency back to the nominal frequency.\n2.

During system restoration, when a synchronous area is split in several synchronised regions, the TSOs of each synchronised region shall appoint a frequency leader, in accordance with paragraph 3.\n2.   During system restoration, when a synchronous area is not split but the system frequency exceeds the frequency limits for the alert state as defined in Article 18(2) of Regulation (EU) 2017/1485, all TSOs of the synchronous area shall appoint a frequency leader, in accordance with paragraph 3.\n3.   The TSO with the highest real-time estimated K-factor shall be appointed as the frequency leader, unless the TSOs of the synchronised region, or of the synchronous area, agree to appoint another TSO as the frequency leader. In that case, the TSOs of the synchronised region, or of the synchronous area, shall consider the following criteria:\n(a)\nthe amount of available active power reserves and especially frequency restoration reserves;\n(b)\nthe capacities available on interconnectors;\n(c)\nthe availability of frequency measurements of TSOs of the synchronised region or of the synchronous area; and\n(d)\nthe availability of measurements on critical elements within the synchronised region or the synchronous area.\n4.

The TSO appointed as frequency leader pursuant to paragraphs 1 and 2 shall inform the other TSOs of the synchronous area of its appointment without delay.\n6.   The appointed frequency leader shall act as such until:\n(a)\nanother frequency leader is appointed for its synchronised region;\n(b)\na new frequency leader is appointed as the result of resynchronisation of its synchronised region with another synchronised region; or\n(c)\nthe synchronous area has been completely resynchronised, the system frequency is within the standard frequency range and the LFC operated by each TSO of the synchronous area is back to its normal operating mode in accordance with Article 18(1) of Regulation (EU) 2017/1485.\nArticle 30\nFrequency management after frequency deviation\n1.   During system restoration, when a frequency leader has been appointed pursuant to Article 29(3), the TSOs of the synchronous area, other than the frequency leader, shall as a first measure suspend the manual activation of frequency restoration reserves and replacement reserves.\n2.   The frequency leader shall establish, after consultation with the other TSOs of the synchronous area, the operating mode to be applied on the LFC operated by each TSO of the synchronous area.\n3.   The frequency leader shall manage the manual activation of frequency restoration reserves and replacement reserves within the synchronous area, aiming at regulating the frequency of the synchronous area towards the nominal frequency and taking into account the operational security limits defined pursuant to Article 25 of Regulation (EU) 2017/1485. Upon request, each TSO of the synchronous area shall support the frequency leader.\nArticle 31\nFrequency management after synchronous area split\n1.   During system restoration, when a frequency leader has been appointed pursuant to Article 29(3), the TSOs of each synchronised region, with the exception of the frequency leader, shall as a first measure suspend the manual activation of frequency restoration reserves and replacement reserves.\n2.   The frequency leader shall establish, after consultation with the other TSOs of the synchronised region, the operating mode to be applied on the LFC operated by each TSO of the synchronised region.\n3.

When no resynchronisation leader is appointed for the synchronised region, the frequency leader shall aim at regulating the frequency towards the nominal frequency. Upon request, each TSO of the synchronised region shall support the frequency leader.\nSECTION 4\nResynchronisation\nArticle 32\nResynchronisation procedure\nThe resynchronisation procedure of the restoration plan shall include, at least:\n(a)\nthe appointment of a resynchronisation leader;\n(b)\nthe measures allowing the TSO to apply a resynchronisation strategy; and\n(c)\nthe maximum limits for phase angle, frequency and voltage differences for connecting lines.\nArticle 33\nAppointment of a resynchronisation leader\n1.   During system restoration, when two synchronised regions can be resynchronised without endangering the operational security of the transmission systems, the frequency leaders of these synchronised regions shall appoint a resynchronisation leader in consultation with at least the TSO(s) identified as the potential resynchronisation leader and in accordance with paragraph 2. Each frequency leader shall inform without delay the TSOs from its synchronised region of the appointed resynchronisation leader.\n2.   For each pair of synchronised regions to be resynchronised, the resynchronisation leader shall be the TSO that:\n(a)\nhas in operation at least one substation equipped with a parallel switching device on the border between the two synchronised regions to be resynchronised;\n(b)\nhas access to the frequency measurements from both synchronised regions;\n(c)\nhas access to the voltage measurements on the substations between which potential resynchronisation points are located; and\n(d)\nis able to control the voltage of potential resynchronisation points.\n3.   Where more than one TSO fulfils the criteria under paragraph 2, the TSO with the highest number of potential resynchronisation points between the two synchronised regions shall be appointed as the resynchronisation leader, unless the frequency leaders of the two synchronised regions agree to appoint another TSO as resynchronisation leader.\n4.   The appointed resynchronisation leader shall act as such until:\n(a)\nanother resynchronisation leader is appointed for the two synchronised regions; or\n(b)\nthe two synchronised regions have been resynchronised, and all the steps in Article 34 have been completed.\nArticle 34\nResynchronisation strategy\n1.

The plans include, for example:\noperational security limits;\nthe needs of high priority significant grid users and the terms and conditions for their disconnection and re-energisation;\nthe conditions under which the plans are activated;\ninstructions to be issued by the TSO under the plans;\nmeasures subject to real-time consultation or coordination;\nmeasures to be implemented by the TSO and DSOs and SGUs;\na list of substations which are essential for its restoration plan procedures;\nthe number of power sources in the TSO’s control area necessary to re-energise its system;\ntechnical and organisational measures such as: system protection schemes;frequency deviation management;voltage deviation management;power flow management;re-energisation procedure;resynchronisation procedure;manual demand disconnection and re-energisation;\nimplementation deadlines for each measure listed.\nSpecific rules apply in the implementation of the system defence and restoration plans.\nEach TSO needs to have in place the apropriate communication tools and to periodically assess and test the proper functioning of all equipment and capabilities involved in the system defence plan and the restoration plan.\nMarket activities\nSubject to some conditions, a TSO may temporarily suspend market activities where:\nthe transmission system is in blackout state, or the continuation would decrease significantly the effectiveness of the restoration process to the normal or alert state; or\nwhere the means to facilitate market activities are not available.\nMonitoring\nImplementation of the regulation is monitored by ENTSO for Electricity.\nCompanion legislation\nThis regulation supplements and is an integral part of Regulation (EC) No 714/2009 on cross-border exchanges in electricity. References to Regulation (EC) No 714/2009 in other legal acts should be understood as also referring to this regulation.\nThe regulation is also a companion to Regulation (EU) 2017/1485: guideline on electricity transmission system operation.\nFROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?\n              \nIt has applied since 18 December 2017.\nBACKGROUND\n              \nSee also:\nElectricity network codes and guidelines\n                (European Commission)\nWhat are network codes?\n                (ENTSO-E).\nKEY TERMS\n              \nElectricity network code: binding rules and procedures relating, for example, to:network security and reliability;data exchanges;capacity allocation and congestion management;trading related to network access services and system balancing;transparency;harmonised transmission tariff structures;energy efficiency regarding electricity networks.\nBlackout state: the electricity system state where the operation of part or all of the transmission system is terminated.\nRestoration state: the system state where the objective of all activities in the transmission system is to re-establish the system operation and maintain operational security after the blackout state or the emergency state.\nEmergency state: the electricity system state where one or more operational security limits are violated.\nBalancing service provider: an electricity market participant who is able to provide balancing reserves of electricity to transmission service operators.\nMAIN DOCUMENT\n            \nCommission Regulation (EU) 2017/2196 of 24 November 2017 establishing a network code on electricity emergency and restoration (OJ L 312, 28.11.2017, pp. 54-85)\nSuccessive amendments to Regulation (EU) 2017/2196 have been incorporated into the original document.
