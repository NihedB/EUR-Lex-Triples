{"celex_id": "32008R0110", "reference": "13.2.2008\nEN\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\nL 39/16\nREGULATION (EC) No 110/2008 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL\nof 15 January 2008\non the definition, description, presentation, labelling and the protection of geographical indications of spirit drinks and repealing Council Regulation (EEC) No 1576/89\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 95 thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the Commission,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee (1),\nActing in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty (2),\nWhereas:\n(1)\nCouncil Regulation (EEC) No 1576/89 of 29 May 1989 laying down general rules on the definition, description and presentation of spirit drinks (3) and Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1014/90 of 24 April 1990 laying down detailed implementing rules on the definition, description and presentation of spirit drinks (4) have proved successful in regulating the spirit drinks sector. However, in the light of recent experience it is necessary to clarify the rules applicable to the definition, description, presentation and labelling of spirit drinks as well as on the protection of geographical indications of certain spirit drinks, while taking into account traditional production methods. Regulation (EEC) No 1576/89 should therefore be repealed and replaced.\n(2)\nThe spirit drinks sector is important for consumers, producers and the agricultural sector in the Community. The measures applicable to the spirit drinks sector should contribute to the attainment of a high level of consumer protection, the prevention of deceptive practices and the attainment of market transparency and fair competition. By doing so, the measures should safeguard the reputation which Community spirit drinks have achieved in the Community and on the world market by continuing to take into account the traditional practices used in the production of spirit drinks as well as increased demand for consumer protection and information. Technological innovation should also be taken into account in the categories where such innovation serves to improve quality, without affecting the traditional character of the spirit drinks concerned.\n(3)\nThe production of spirit drinks constitutes a major outlet for Community agricultural products. This strong link to the agricultural sector should be emphasised by the regulatory framework.\n(4)\nTo ensure a more systematic approach in the legislation governing spirit drinks, this Regulation should set out clearly defined criteria for the production, description, presentation and labelling of spirit drinks as well as on the protection of geographical indications.\n(5)\nIn the interests of consumers, this Regulation should apply to all spirit drinks placed on the market in the Community, whether produced in the Community or in third countries. With a view to the export of high quality spirit drinks and in order to maintain and improve the reputation of Community spirit drinks on the world market, this Regulation should also apply to such drinks produced in the Community for export. This Regulation should also apply to the use of ethyl alcohol and/or distillates of agricultural origin in the production of alcoholic beverages and to the use of the names of spirit drinks in the presentation and labelling of foodstuffs. In exceptional cases where the law of an importing third country so requires, this Regulation should allow for a derogation to be granted from the provisions of Annexes I and II to this Regulation in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny.\n(6)\nIn general, this Regulation should continue to focus on definitions of spirit drinks which should be classified into categories. Those definitions should continue to respect the traditional quality practices but should be completed or updated where previous definitions were lacking or insufficient or where such definitions may be improved in the light of technological development.\n(7)\nTo take into account consumer expectations about the raw materials used for vodka especially in the traditional vodka producing Member States, provision should be made for adequate information to be provided on the raw material used where the vodka is made from raw materials of agricultural origin other than cereals and/or potatoes.\n(8)\nMoreover, the ethyl alcohol used for the production of spirit drinks and other alcoholic beverages should be exclusively of agricultural origin, so as to meet consumer expectations and conform to traditional practices. This should also ensure an outlet for basic agricultural products.\n(9)\nGiven the importance and complexity of the spirit drinks sector, it is appropriate to lay down specific measures on the description and presentation of spirit drinks going beyond the horizontal rules established in Directive 2000/13/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 March 2000 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the labelling, presentation and advertising of foodstuffs (5). Those specific measures should also prevent the misuse of the term ‘spirit drink’ and the names of spirit drinks for products which do not meet the definitions set out in this Regulation.\n(10)\nWhile it is important to ensure that in general the maturation period or age specifies only the youngest alcoholic component, this Regulation should allow for a derogation to take account of traditional ageing processes regulated by the Member States.\n(11)\nIn accordance with the Treaty, in applying a quality policy and in order to allow a high level of quality of spirit drinks and diversity in the sector, Member States should be able to adopt rules stricter than those laid down in this Regulation on the production, description, presentation and labelling of spirit drinks produced in their own territory.\n(12)\nCouncil Directive 88/388/EEC of 22 June 1988 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to flavourings for use in foodstuffs and to source materials for their production (6) applies to spirit drinks. It is only necessary therefore to lay down in this Regulation rules not already provided for in that Directive.\n(13)\nIt is important to have due regard to the provisions of the Agreement on Trade-related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (hereinafter TRIPs Agreement), and in particular Articles 22 and 23 thereof, and of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, which form an integral part of the Agreement establishing the World Trade Organisation approved by Council Decision 94/800/EC (7).\n(14)\nGiven that Council Regulation (EC) No 510/2006 of 20 March 2006 on the protection of geographical indications and designations of origin for agricultural products and foodstuffs (8) does not apply to spirit drinks, the rules for protection of geographical indications on spirit drinks should be laid down in this Regulation. Geographical indications should be registered, identifying spirit drinks as originating in the territory of a country, or a region or locality in that territory, where a given quality, reputation or other characteristic of the spirit drink is essentially attributable to its geographical origin.\n(15)\nA non-discriminatory procedure for the registration, compliance, alteration and possible cancellation of third country and EU geographical indications in accordance with the TRIPs Agreement should be laid down in this Regulation whilst recognising the particular status of established geographical indications.\n(16)\nThe measures necessary for the implementation of this Regulation should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission (9).\n(17)\nIn particular, the Commission should be empowered to: grant derogations from certain parts of this Regulation where the law of an importing country so requires; lay down a maximum level of sweetening for rounding off; grant a derogation from the rules governing the indication of a maturation period or age; adopt decisions on applications for registration, on cancellation and on removal of geographical indications, as well as on the alteration of the technical file; amend the list of technical definitions and requirements, the definitions of spirit drinks classified into categories, and the list of registered geographical indications; and to derogate from the procedure governing the registration of geographical indications and the alteration of the technical file. Since those measures are of general scope and are designed to amend non-essential elements of this Regulation, inter alia by deleting some of those elements or by supplementing this Regulation with new non-essential elements, they must be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny provided for in Article 5a of Decision 1999/468/EC.\n(18)\nThe transition from the rules provided for in Regulation (EEC) No 1576/89 to those in this Regulation could give rise to difficulties which are not dealt with in this Regulation. The measures necessary for this transition, as well as the measures required to solve practical problems specific to the spirit drinks sector, should be adopted in accordance with Decision 1999/468/EC.\n(19)\nTo facilitate the transition from the rules provided for in Regulation (EEC) No 1576/89, the production of spirit drinks under that Regulation should be permitted during the first year of application of this Regulation. The marketing of existing stocks should also be foreseen until they run out,\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nCHAPTER I\nSCOPE, DEFINITION AND CATEGORIES OF SPIRIT DRINKS\nArticle 1\nSubject matter and scope\n1.

Where a spirit drink meets the definition of more than one category of spirit drink in Annex II, it may be sold under one or more of the names listed for those categories in Annex II.\n4.   Without prejudice to paragraph 9 of this Article and to Article 10(1), the names referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article shall not be used to describe or present in any way whatsoever any drink other than the spirit drinks for which those names are listed in Annex II and registered in Annex III.\n5.   Sales denominations may be supplemented or replaced by a geographical indication registered in Annex III and in accordance with Chapter III, or supplemented in accordance with national provisions by another geographical indication, provided that this does not mislead the consumer.\n6.   The geographical indications registered in Annex III may only be supplemented either:\n(a)\nby terms already in use on 20 February 2008 for established geographical indications within the meaning of Article 20, or\n(b)\naccording to the relevant technical file provided for under Article 17(1).\n7.   An alcoholic beverage not meeting one of the definitions listed under categories 1 to 46 of Annex II shall not be described, presented or labelled by associating words or phrases such as ‘like’, ‘type’, ‘style’, ‘made’, ‘flavour’ or any other similar terms with any of the sales denominations provided for in this Regulation and/or geographical indications registered in Annex III.\n8.   No trade mark, brand name or fancy name may be substituted for the sales denomination of a spirit drink.\n9.

Without prejudice to Directive 2000/13/EC, the description, presentation or labelling of the spirit drinks resulting from the mixtures referred to in paragraph 2 of this Article may show one or more of the terms listed in Annex II only if that term does not form part of the sales denomination but is solely listed in the same visual field in the listing of all the alcoholic ingredients contained in the mixture, preceded by the term ‘mixed spirit drink’.\nThe term ‘mixed spirit drink’ shall be labelled in uniform characters of the same font and colour as those used for the sales denomination. The characters shall be no larger than half the size of the characters used for the sales denomination.\n5.   For the labelling and presentation of the mixtures referred to in paragraph 2 and to which the requirement to list alcoholic ingredients under paragraph 4 applies, the proportion of each alcoholic ingredient shall be expressed as a percentage in descending order of quantities used. That proportion shall be equal to the percentage by volume of pure alcohol it represents in the total pure alcohol content by volume of the mixture.\nArticle 12\nSpecific rules concerning the description, presentation and labelling of spirit drinks\n1.   Where the description, presentation or labelling of a spirit drink indicates the raw material used to produce the ethyl alcohol of agricultural origin, each agricultural alcohol used shall be mentioned in descending order of quantity used.\n2.

The terms in italics in Annex II and the geographical indications registered in Annex III shall not be translated on the label nor in the presentation of the spirit drink.\n3.   In the case of spirit drinks originating in third countries, use of an official language of the third country in which the spirit drink was produced shall be authorised if the particulars provided for in this Regulation are also given in an official language of the European Union in such a way that the final consumer can easily understand each item.\n4.   Without prejudice to paragraph 2, in the case of spirit drinks produced in the Community and intended for export, the particulars provided for in this Regulation may be repeated in a language other than an official language of the European Union.\nCHAPTER III\nGEOGRAPHICAL INDICATIONS\nArticle 15\nGeographical indications\n1.   For the purpose of this Regulation a geographical indication shall be an indication which identifies a spirit drink as originating in the territory of a country, or a region or locality in that territory, where a given quality, reputation or other characteristic of that spirit drink is essentially attributable to its geographical origin.\n2.   The geographical indications referred to in paragraph 1 are registered in Annex III.\n3.   The geographical indications registered in Annex III may not become generic.\nNames that have become generic may not be registered in Annex III.\nA name that has become generic means the name of a spirit drink which, although it relates to the place or region where this product was originally produced or placed on the market, has become the common name of a spirit drink in the Community.\n4.   Spirit drinks bearing a geographical indication registered in Annex III shall comply with all the specifications of the technical file provided for under Article 17(1).\nArticle 16\nProtection of geographical indications\nWithout prejudice to Article 10, the geographical indications registered in Annex III shall be protected against:\n(a)\nany direct or indirect commercial use in respect of products not covered by the registration in so far as those products are comparable to the spirit drink registered under that geographical indication or insofar as such use exploits the reputation of the registered geographical indication;\n(b)\nany misuse, imitation or evocation, even if the true origin of the product is indicated or the geographical indication is used in translation or accompanied by an expression such as ‘like’, ‘type’, ‘style’, ‘made’, ‘flavour’ or any other similar term;\n(c)\nany other false or misleading indication as to the provenance, origin, nature or essential qualities on the description, presentation or labelling of the product, liable to convey a false impression as to its origin;\n(d)\nany other practice liable to mislead the consumer as to the true origin of the product.\nArticle 17\nRegistration of geographical indications\n1.   An application for a geographical indication to be registered in Annex III shall be submitted to the Commission in one of the official languages of the European Union or accompanied by a translation into one of those languages. That application shall be duly substantiated and shall include a technical file setting out the specifications with which the spirit drink concerned must comply.\n2.   With regard to geographical indications within the Community, the application referred to in paragraph 1 shall be made by the Member State of origin of the spirit drink.\n3.   With regard to geographical indications within a third country, the application referred to in paragraph 1 shall be sent to the Commission, either directly or via the authorities of the third country concerned, and shall include proof that the name in question is protected in its country of origin.\n4.   The technical file referred to in paragraph 1 shall include at least the following main specifications:\n(a)\nthe name and category of the spirit drink including the geographical indication;\n(b)\na description of the spirit drink including the principal physical, chemical and/or organoleptic characteristics of the product as well as the specific characteristics of the spirit drink as compared to the relevant category;\n(c)\nthe definition of the geographical area concerned;\n(d)\na description of the method for obtaining the spirit drink and, if appropriate, the authentic and unvarying local methods;\n(e)\nthe details bearing out the link with the geographical environment or the geographical origin;\n(f)\nany requirements laid down by Community and/or national and/or regional provisions;\n(g)\nthe name and contact address of the applicant;\n(h)\nany supplement to the geographical indication and/or any specific labelling rule, according to the relevant technical file.\n5.   The Commission shall verify, within 12 months of the date of submission of the application referred to in paragraph 1, whether that application complies with this Regulation.\n6.   If the Commission concludes that the application referred to in paragraph 1 complies with this Regulation, the main specifications of the technical file referred to in paragraph 4 shall be published in the Official Journal of the European Union, C Series.\n7.   Within six months of the date of publication of the technical file, any natural or legal person that has a legitimate interest may object to the registration of the geographical indication in Annex III on the grounds that the conditions provided for in this Regulation are not fulfilled. The objection, which must be duly substantiated, shall be submitted to the Commission in one of the official languages of the European Union or accompanied by a translation into one of those languages.\n8.   The Commission shall take the decision on registration of the geographical indication in Annex III in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny referred to in Article 25(3), taking into account any objection raised in accordance with paragraph 7 of this Article. That decision shall be published in the Official Journal of the European Union, C Series.\nArticle 18\nCancellation of a geographical indication\nIf compliance with the specifications in the technical file is no longer ensured, the Commission shall take a decision cancelling the registration in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny referred to in Article 25(3). That decision shall be published in the Official Journal of the European Union, C Series.\nArticle 19\nHomonymous geographical indications\nA homonymous geographical indication meeting the requirements of this Regulation shall be registered with due regard for local and traditional usage and the actual risk of confusion, in particular:\n—\na homonymous name which misleads the consumer into believing that products come from another territory shall not be registered even if the name is accurate as far as its wording is concerned for the actual territory, region or place of origin of the spirit drink in question,\n—\nthe use of a registered homonymous geographical indication shall be subject to there being a clear distinction in practice between the homonym registered subsequently and the name already on the register, having regard to the need to treat the producers concerned in an equitable manner and not to mislead consumers.\nArticle 20\nEstablished geographical indications\n1.   For each geographical indication registered in Annex III on 20 February 2008, Member States shall submit a technical file as provided for under Article 17(1) to the Commission not later than 20 February 2015.\n2.   Member States shall ensure that this technical file is accessible to the public.\n3.   Where no technical file has been submitted to the Commission by 20 February 2015, the Commission shall remove the geographical indication from Annex III in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny referred to in Article 25(3).\nArticle 21\nAlteration of the technical file\nThe procedure provided for in Article 17 shall apply mutatis mutandis where the technical file referred to in Articles 17(1) and 20(1) is to be altered.\nArticle 22\nVerification of compliance with the specifications in the technical file\n1.   In respect of the geographical indications within the Community, verification of compliance with the specifications in the technical file, before placing the product on the market, shall be ensured by:\n—\none or more competent authorities referred to in Article 24(1), and/or\n—\none or more control bodies within the meaning of Article 2 of Regulation (EC) No 882/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on official controls performed to ensure the verification of compliance with feed and food law, animal health and animal welfare rules (10), operating as a product certification body.\nNotwithstanding national legislation, the costs of such verification of compliance with the specifications in the technical file shall be borne by the operators subject to those controls.\n2.   In respect of the geographical indications within a third country, verification of compliance with the specifications in the technical file, before placing the product on the market, shall be ensured by:\n—\none or more public authorities designated by the third country, and/or\n—\none or more product certification bodies.\n3.   The product certification bodies referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 shall comply with, and from 1 May 2010 be accredited in accordance with, European standard EN 45011 or ISO/IEC Guide 65 (General requirements for bodies operating product certification systems).\n4.   Where the authorities or bodies referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 have chosen to verify compliance with the specifications in the technical file, they shall offer adequate guarantees of objectivity and impartiality and have at their disposal the qualified staff and resources necessary to carry out their functions.\nArticle 23\nRelation between trade marks and geographical indications\n1.   The registration of a trade mark which contains or consists of a geographical indication registered in Annex III shall be refused or invalidated if its use would lead to any of the situations referred to in Article 16.\n2.   With due regard to Community law, a trade mark the use of which corresponds to one of the situations referred to in Article 16 which has been applied for, registered, or established by use, if that possibility is provided for by the legislation concerned, in good faith within the territory of the Community, before either the date of protection of the geographical indication in the country of origin or before 1 January 1996, may continue to be used notwithstanding the registration of a geographical indication, provided that no grounds for its invalidity or revocation exist as specified by First Council Directive 89/104/EEC of 21 December 1988 to approximate the laws of the Member States relating to trade marks (11) or Council Regulation (EC) No 40/94 of 20 December 1993 on the Community trade mark (12).\n3.   A geographical indication shall not be registered where, in the light of a trade mark's reputation and renown and the length of time it has been used in the Community, registration is liable to mislead the consumer as to the true identity of the product.\nCHAPTER IV\nGENERAL, TRANSITIONAL AND FINAL PROVISIONS\nArticle 24\nControl and protection of spirit drinks\n1.   Member States shall be responsible for the control of spirit drinks. They shall take the measures necessary to ensure compliance with the provisions of this Regulation and in particular they shall designate the competent authority or authorities responsible for controls in respect of the obligations established by this Regulation in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 882/2004.\n2.   Member States and the Commission shall communicate to each other the information necessary for the application of this Regulation.\n3.

consumers and develop the spirit drinks* sector, the European Union has created a legal framework that ensures uniform EU-wide rules on the marketing of spirit drinks.\nACT\n                  \nRegulation (EC) No 110/2008 of the European Parliament and the Council of 15 January 2008 on the definition, description, presentation, labelling and protection of geographical indications of spirit drinks and repealing Council Regulation (EEC) No 1576/89\nSUMMARY\nWHAT DOES THIS REGULATION DO?\n                     \nIt sets the rules regarding the definition, description, presentation and labelling of spirit drinks, and also the protection of geographical indications. It applies to all spirit drinks, whether produced in EU or non-EU countries.\nKEY POINTS\nAnnex II of this regulation highlights 46 different categories for spirit drinks with different qualities the spirit drink must have in order to be included in any given category. If the spirit drink contains qualities from several categories, then it may be sold under one or more of the category denominations.\nThe general rules concerning the presentation and the labelling of foodstuffs apply to spirit drinks. However, specific labelling and presentation rules are laid down in this regulation, such as labelling the raw materials used, drawing the parameters of the term ‘blend’, indicating the maturation period, banning lead-based capsules from being used as closing devices and ensuring that labelling is given in one or more of the EU's official languages.\nThe geographical indication identifies a spirit drink as originating within the territory of a country where a given quality, reputation or other characteristic is attributable to its geographical origin.\nIn order to register a geographical indication, both EU countries and non-EU countries must submit an application to the European Commission. The application must include a technical file containing information such as the description of the spirit drink, the definition of the geographical area, a description of the method for obtaining the spirit drink, any requirements laid down by European, national or regional provisions, and the name and contact address of the applicant.\nIf the spirit drink no longer possesses the characteristics described in the technical file, the European Commission may cancel the registration of a geographical indication.\nKEY TERMS\n* Spirit drinks: alcoholic drinks intended for human consumption. By definition, they possess particular organoleptic qualities and have a minimum alcoholic strength of 15 %. They are produced by distillation, by maceration or by the addition of flavourings, or by mixing a spirit drink with another drink, ethyl alcohol of agricultural origin or certain distillates.\nREFERENCES\nAct\nEntry into force\nDeadline for transposition in the Member States\nOfficial Journal\nRegulation (EC) No 110/2008\n20.2.2008\n-\nOJ L 39, 13.2.2008, pp. 16-54\nAmending act(s)\nEntry into force\nDeadline for transposition in the Member States\nOfficial Journal\nRegulation (EC) No 1334/2008\n20.1.2009\n-\nOJ L 354, 31.12.2008, pp. 34-50\nSuccessive amendments and corrections to Regulation (EC) No 110/2008 have been incorporated in the basic text.
