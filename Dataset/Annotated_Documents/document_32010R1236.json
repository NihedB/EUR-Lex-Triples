{"celex_id": "32010R1236", "reference": "31.12.2010\nEN\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\nL 348/17\nREGULATION (EU) No 1236/2010 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL\nof 15 December 2010\nlaying down a scheme of control and enforcement applicable in the area covered by the Convention on future multilateral cooperation in the North-East Atlantic fisheries and repealing Council Regulation (EC) No 2791/1999\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 43(2) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European Commission,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee (1),\nActing in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure (2),\nWhereas:\n(1)\nThe Convention on future multilateral cooperation in the North-East Atlantic fisheries (the Convention), was approved by the Council in Decision 81/608/EEC (3) and entered into force on 17 March 1982.\n(2)\nThe Convention provides for an appropriate framework for multilateral cooperation on the rational conservation and management of fishery resources in the Area defined by the Convention (the Convention Area).\n(3)\nThe North-East Atlantic Fisheries Commission (NEAFC), at its Annual Meeting on 15 November 2006, adopted a recommendation establishing a scheme of control and enforcement (the Scheme) applicable to fishing vessels operating in the waters of the Convention Area which lie beyond the waters under the fisheries jurisdiction of the Contracting Parties (the Regulatory Area). The Scheme, which came into force on 1 May 2007, was amended by several recommendations at the Annual Meetings in November 2007, 2008 and 2009.\n(4)\nUnder Articles 12 and 15 of the Convention, these recommendations came into force on 9 February 2008, 6 and 8 January 2009, and 6 February 2010 respectively.\n(5)\nThe Scheme provides for control and enforcement measures applicable to vessels flying the flag of Contracting Parties and operating in the Regulatory Area, and arrangements for inspection at sea which include inspection and surveillance procedures and infringement procedures which must be implemented by the Contracting Parties.\n(6)\nThe Scheme provides for a new Port State Control system which will effectively close European ports to landings and transhipments of frozen fish which have not been verified to be legal by the flag state of fishing vessels flying the flag of a Contracting Party other than the port state.\n(7)\nCertain control provisions adopted by NEAFC have been incorporated into Union law by way of the yearly TAC and quotas Regulation, and most recently by Council Regulation (EC) No 43/2009 of 16 January 2009 fixing for 2009 the fishing opportunities and associated conditions for certain fish stocks and groups of fish stocks, applicable in Community waters and, for Community vessels, in waters where catch limitations are required (4). For the sake of legal certainty, such provisions which are not of a temporary nature should be the subject of a new separate regulation.\n(8)\nThe Scheme also comprises provisions to promote compliance by vessels flying the flag of a non-Contracting Party with the control and enforcement measures in order to ensure full respect of conservation and management measures adopted by NEAFC. NEAFC recommended removing a number of vessels from the list of vessels that have been confirmed to have engaged in illegal, unreported and unregulated fisheries. The incorporation of those recommendations into Union law should be ensured.\n(9)\nArticle 5(2) of Council Regulation (EC) No 1224/2009 of 20 November 2009 establishing a Community control system for ensuring compliance with the rules of the common fisheries policy (5) provides that Member States shall control access to waters and resources and control activities outside EU waters carried out by vessels flying their flag. Provision should therefore be made for Member States whose vessels are authorised to fish in the Regulatory Area to assign inspectors to the Scheme to undertake monitoring and surveillance as well as adequate resources for inspection.\n(10)\nIn order to ensure the monitoring of fishing activities in the Convention Area, it is necessary for Member States to cooperate with one another and with the Commission and the body designated by it in applying the Scheme.\n(11)\nIt is the responsibility of Member States to ensure that their inspectors comply with the inspection procedures laid down by NEAFC.\n(12)\nThe Commission should be empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) in respect of detailed rules concerning lists of the fishery resources to be notified, procedures for prior notification of entry into port and for the cancellation thereof as well as authorisation to land or tranship. The Commission should also be empowered to adopt delegated acts in respect of the incorporation into Union law of future amendments of those measures of the Scheme which form the subject matter of certain expressly defined non-essential elements of this Regulation and which become binding upon the Union in accordance with the terms of the Convention. It is of particular importance that the Commission carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level.\n(13)\nThe measures necessary for the implementation of this Regulation should be adopted by the Commission by means of implementing acts in accordance with Article 291 TFEU. According to that Article, rules and general principles concerning mechanisms for the control by Member States of the Commission’s exercise of implementing powers are to be laid down in advance by a regulation adopted in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure. Pending the adoption of that new regulation, Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission (6) continues to apply, with the exception of the regulatory procedure with scrutiny, which is not applicable.\n(14)\nAs this Regulation will establish new rules concerning control and enforcement in the Convention Area, Council Regulation (EC) No 2791/1999 of 16 December 1999 laying down certain control measures applicable in the area covered by the Convention on future multilateral cooperation in the North-East Atlantic fisheries (7) should be repealed,\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nCHAPTER I\nGENERAL PROVISIONS\nArticle 1\nSubject matter\nThis Regulation lays down the general rules and conditions for the application by the Union of the Scheme adopted by NEAFC.\nArticle 2\nScope\nUnless otherwise stated, this Regulation shall apply to all EU vessels used or intended for use for fishing activities carried out in respect of fishery resources in the Regulatory Area.\nArticle 3\nDefinitions\nFor the purpose of this Regulation, the following definitions shall apply:\n1.\n‘Convention’ means the Convention on future multilateral cooperation in North-East Atlantic fisheries, as amended;\n2.\n‘Convention Area’ means the Convention Area as defined in Article 1(1) of the Convention;\n3.\n‘Regulatory Area’ means the waters of the Convention Area which lie beyond the waters under the fisheries jurisdiction of the Contracting Parties;\n4.\n‘Contracting Parties’ means the Contracting Parties to the Convention;\n5.\n‘NEAFC’ means the North-East Atlantic Fisheries Commission;\n6.\n‘fishing activities’ means fishing, including joint fishing operations, fish processing operations, the transhipment or landing of fish or fish products and any other commercial activity in preparation for or related to fishing;\n7.\n‘fishery resources’ means the resources referred to in Article 1(2) of the Convention;\n8.\n‘regulated resources’ means those fishery resources which are subject to recommendations under the Convention and are listed in the Annex;\n9.\n‘fishing vessel’ means any vessel used or intended for use for the purposes of the commercial exploitation of fishery resources, including fish processing vessels and vessels engaged in transhipment;\n10.\n‘non-Contracting Party vessel’ means any fishing vessel not flagged in a Contracting Party, including vessels for which there are reasonable grounds for suspecting them to be without nationality;\n11.\n‘joint fishing operation’ means any operations between two or more vessels where catch is taken from the fishing gear of one fishing vessel to another;\n12.\n‘transhipment operation’ means the unloading of all or any fishery products on board a fishing vessel onto another fishing vessel;\n13.\n‘port’ means any place used for landing or a place close to the shore designated by a Contracting Party for transhipping fishery resources.\nArticle 4\nContact points\n1.

The format and the specifications of these transmissions shall be determined in accordance with Article 50(2).\nArticle 12\nCommunication of information\n1.   Member States shall communicate the reports and the information referred to in Articles 9 and 11 without delay to the NEAFC Secretary. In the event of technical malfunction, however, such reports and information shall be transmitted to the NEAFC Secretary within 24 hours of receipt. Member States shall ensure that all reports and messages forwarded by them are numbered sequentially.\n2.   Member States shall ensure that the reports and information transmitted to the NEAFC Secretary are in accordance with the data exchange formats and protocols determined in accordance with Article 50(2).\nArticle 13\nTranshipments and joint fishing operations\n1.   EU fishing vessels shall engage in transhipment activities in the Regulatory Area only if they have received prior authorisation from the competent authorities in their flag Member State.\n2.   EU fishing vessels may only engage in transhipment operations or joint fishing operations with vessels flying the flag of a Contracting Party and vessels of a non-Contracting Party granted the status of a cooperating non-Contracting Party by NEAFC.\n3.   EU fishing vessels engaged in transhipment operations which on-load quantities on board shall not engage in other fishing activities, including joint fishing operations, during the same trip, with the exception of fish-processing operations and landings.\nArticle 14\nSeparate stowage\n1.   EU fishing vessels which carry on board frozen fishery resources caught in the Convention Area by more than one fishing vessel may stow the fish from each of those vessels in more than one part of the hold but shall keep it clearly separate from fish caught by other vessels, in particular by using plastic, plywood or netting.\n2.   All catches taken inside the Convention Area shall be stowed separately from all catches taken outside the area.\nArticle 15\nLabelling of frozen fish\nWhen frozen, all fish caught in the Convention Area shall be identified with a clearly legible label or stamp. The label or stamp shall be placed at the time of stowage on each box or block of frozen fish and shall indicate the species, the production date, the ICES sub-area and division where the catch was taken and the name of the vessel which caught the fish.\nCHAPTER III\nINSPECTIONS AT SEA\nArticle 16\nNEAFC inspectors\n1.   Member States whose fishing vessels are authorised to fish in the Regulatory Area shall assign inspectors to the Scheme to carry out surveillance and inspection (NEAFC inspectors).\n2.   Member States shall issue a special identity document to each NEAFC inspector. The form of this document shall be determined in accordance with Article 50(2).\n3.   Each NEAFC inspector shall carry and produce the special identity document when boarding a fishing vessel.\nArticle 17\nGeneral provisions for inspection and surveillance\n1.   The Commission or the body designated by it shall coordinate the surveillance and inspection activities for the Union and shall draw up each year, in concert with the Member States concerned, a joint deployment plan for Union participation in the Scheme in the following year. This deployment plan shall, inter alia, determine the number of inspections to be carried out.\nWhere at any time more than ten EU fishing vessels are engaged in fishing activities carried out in respect of regulated resources in the Regulatory Area, the Commission or the body designated by it shall ensure that an inspection vessel from a Member State is present during that time in the Regulatory Area or that an agreement has been concluded with another Contracting Party to ensure the presence of an inspection vessel.\n2.   Member States shall ensure that the inspections by their NEAFC inspectors are carried out in a non-discriminatory manner and in accordance with the Scheme. The number of inspections shall be based on fleet size, taking into account the time spent by fishing vessels in the Regulatory Area.\n3.   The Commission or the body designated by it shall seek to ensure, through an equitable distribution of inspections, equal treatment of all Contracting Parties with fishing vessels operating in the Regulatory Area.\n4.   Member States shall take steps to ensure that NEAFC inspectors from another Contracting Party are permitted to carry out inspections on board vessels flying their flag.\n5.   NEAFC inspectors shall avoid the use of force except in cases of legitimate self-defence. When carrying out inspections on board fishing vessels, NEAFC inspectors shall not carry fire-arms. This paragraph shall be without prejudice to national provisions concerning the prohibition of the use of force.\n6.   NEAFC inspectors shall avoid causing any inconvenience to the fishing vessel or interfering with its activities and the catch retained on board, except when and to the degree necessary to carry out their mandates.\nArticle 18\nMeans to carry out inspection\n1.   Member States shall make available to their NEAFC inspectors adequate means to enable them to carry out their surveillance and inspection tasks. To that end they shall assign inspection vessels and aircraft to the Scheme.\n2.   The Commission or the body designated by it shall send to the NEAFC Secretary before 1 January each year details of the plan together with the names of the NEAFC inspectors and special inspection vessels as well as the types of aircraft and their identification details (registration number, name, radio call-sign) which Member States are assigning to the Scheme during that year. Where appropriate, this information shall be taken from the list of inspectors referred to in Article 79(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1224/2009. Member States shall send changes to this list to the Commission or the body designated by it which in turn shall forward them to the NEAFC Secretary and the other Member States 1 month before the changes are due to come into effect.\n3.   Any vessel assigned to the Scheme and carrying NEAFC inspectors, as well as the boarding craft deployed by that vessel, shall display the NEAFC inspection special signal to indicate that NEAFC inspectors on board may carry out inspection duties in accordance with the Scheme. Aircraft assigned to the Scheme shall have their international radio call-sign clearly displayed. The form of the special signal shall be determined in accordance with Article 50(2).\n4.   For each Union inspection vessel or aircraft assigned to the Scheme, the Commission or the body designated by it shall keep a record of the date and hour of the start and termination of their duties under the Scheme as set out in the form determined in accordance with Article 50(2).\nArticle 19\nSurveillance procedure\n1.   Surveillance shall be based on sightings of fishing vessels by NEAFC inspectors from a vessel or aircraft assigned to the Scheme. NEAFC inspectors shall forward a copy of each sighting report for every vessel without delay, by electronic transmission in the form set out in accordance with Article 50(2), to the flag state of the vessel concerned, to the Commission or the body designated by it and to the NEAFC Secretary. A hard copy of each sighting report and any photographs shall be forwarded on request to the flag state of the vessel concerned.\n2.   NEAFC inspectors shall record their sightings in a surveillance report using a form established in accordance with Article 50(2).\nArticle 20\nInspection procedure\n1.   NEAFC inspectors shall not board any fishing vessel without prior notice being transmitted by radio to that vessel or without that vessel being given the appropriate signal using the International Code of Signals, including the identity of the inspection platform; however, it shall not be necessary for such notice to be acknowledged as received.\n2.   NEAFC inspectors shall have the authority to examine all relevant areas, decks and rooms of the fishing vessels, catch (whether processed or not), nets or other gear, equipment, and any relevant documents which they deem necessary to verify compliance with the conservation and management measures adopted by NEAFC and to question the master or a person designated by the master.\n3.   The fishing vessel to be boarded shall not be required to stop or manoeuvre when fishing, shooting or hauling. The NEAFC inspectors may order that the hauling of the fishing gear be interrupted or delayed until they have boarded the fishing vessel but may not do so in any event more than 30 minutes after the fishing vessel has received the signal referred to in paragraph 1.\n4.   Masters of inspection platforms shall ensure that they manoeuvre at a safe distance from the fishing vessels in accordance with good seamanship.\n5.   NEAFC inspectors may instruct a fishing vessel to delay its entry into or exit from the Regulatory Area for up to 6 hours from the time of transmission by the fishing vessel of the reports referred to in Article 9(1)(a) and (c).\n6.   The duration of an inspection shall not exceed 4 hours, or the time it takes to haul in the net and to inspect the net and the catch, whichever is longer. Where an infringement is detected the NEAFC inspectors may stay on board for the time necessary for the completion of the measures provided for in Article 29(1)(b).\n7.   In special circumstances relating to the size of a fishing vessel and the quantities of fish retained on board, the duration of the inspection may exceed the limits laid down in paragraph 6. In such a situation, NEAFC inspectors shall under no circumstances stay on board the fishing vessel longer than the time required to complete the inspection. The reasons for exceeding the limit laid down in paragraph 6 shall be recorded in the inspection report referred to in paragraph 9.\n8.   No more than two NEAFC inspectors assigned by a Member State shall board a fishing vessel of another Contracting Party. In carrying out their inspection, the NEAFC inspectors may request the master to provide any assistance which is required. NEAFC inspectors shall not interfere with the master’s ability to communicate with the authorities of the flag state during the boarding and inspection.\n9.   Each inspection shall be documented by the completion of an inspection report in the format established in accordance with Article 50(2). The master may add his comments to the inspection report which shall be signed by the NEAFC inspectors at the end of the inspection. A copy of the inspection report shall be given to the master of the fishing vessel. A copy of each inspection report shall be transmitted without delay to the flag state of the inspected vessel and to the Commission or the body designated by it. The Commission or the body designated by it shall forward the copy promptly to the NEAFC Secretary. The original or a certified copy of each inspection report shall be forwarded on request to the flag state of the inspected vessel.\nArticle 21\nObligations of the master of the vessel during the inspection procedure\nThe master of a fishing vessel shall:\n(a)\nfacilitate prompt and safe boarding and disembarkation pursuant to specifications adopted in accordance with Article 50(2);\n(b)\ncooperate with and assist in the inspection of the fishing vessel conducted pursuant to this Regulation, not obstruct, intimidate or interfere with the NEAFC inspectors in the performance of their duties and ensure their safety;\n(c)\nallow the NEAFC inspectors to communicate with the authorities of the flag state and the inspecting state;\n(d)\nprovide access to any areas, decks and rooms of the fishing vessel, catch (whether processed or not), nets or other gear, equipment, and to any relevant information or documents which the NEAFC inspectors deem necessary in accordance with Article 20(2);\n(e)\nprovide copies of documents as required by the NEAFC inspectors; and\n(f)\nprovide NEAFC inspectors with reasonable facilities, including, where appropriate, food and accommodation when they remain on board the vessel in accordance with Article 32(3).\nCHAPTER IV\nPORT STATE CONTROL OF FISHING VESSELS FLYING THE FLAG OF ANOTHER CONTRACTING PARTY\nArticle 22\nScope\nWithout prejudice to Regulation (EC) No 1224/2009 and to Council Regulation (EC) No 1005/2008 of 29 September 2008 establishing a Community system to prevent, deter and eliminate illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing (10), the provisions set out in this Chapter shall apply to landing or transhipping in ports of Member States of fishery resources frozen after being caught in the Convention Area by fishing vessels flying the flag of another Contracting Party.\nArticle 23\nDesignated ports\nMember States shall designate and notify the Commission of ports where the landing or transhipment of fishery resources frozen after being caught in the Convention Area by fishing vessels flying the flag of another Contracting Party are permitted. The Commission shall notify the NEAFC Secretary of these ports and of any changes to the list of ports designated at least 15 days before the change comes into force.\nLandings and transhipments of fish frozen after being caught in the Convention Area by fishing vessels flying the flag of another Contracting Party shall be allowed only in designated ports.\nArticle 24\nPrior notification of entry into port\n1.   In accordance with Article 6 of Regulation (EC) No 1005/2008, when the master of a fishing vessel carrying fish referred to in Article 22 of this Regulation intends to call into a port to land or tranship fish, the master of the vessel, or his representative, shall notify the competent authorities of the Member State of the port he wishes to use no later than three working days before the estimated time of arrival.\nHowever, a Member State may make provision for another notification period, taking into account, in particular, the distance between the fishing grounds and its ports. In such a case, the Member State shall inform the Commission, or the body designated by it, and the NEAFC Secretary thereof without delay.\n2.   Masters or their representatives may cancel a prior notification by notifying the competent authorities of the port they wish to use no later than 24 hours before the notified estimated time of arrival in that port. The notification shall be accompanied by a copy of the original notification form with the word ‘CANCELLED’ written across it.\nHowever, a Member State may make provision for another notification period for cancellation. In such a case, the Member State shall inform the Commission, or the body designated by it, and the NEAFC Secretary thereof without delay.\n3.   The competent authorities of the port Member State shall forward without delay a copy of the notifications referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 to the flag state of the fishing vessel and to the flag state or states of the donor vessels when the fishing vessel has engaged in transhipment operations. A copy of the notification referred to in paragraph 2 shall also be forwarded without delay to the NEAFC Secretary.\n4.   The format and the specifications of the notifications shall be determined in accordance with Article 50(2).\nAs far as necessary, further detailed rules on the notification and cancellation procedures under this Article, including periods, shall be adopted in accordance with the procedure laid down in Articles 46 to 49.\nArticle 25\nAuthorisation to land or tranship\n1.   The flag state of the fishing vessel intending to land or tranship or, where the fishing vessel has engaged in transhipment operations outside EU waters, the flag state or states of the donor vessels, shall, by returning a copy of the prior notification referred to in Article 24 to the competent authorities of the port Member State, confirm that:\n(a)\nthe fishing vessel which declared having caught the fish had sufficient quota for the species declared;\n(b)\nthe quantities of fish on board have been duly reported and taken into account for the calculation of any catch or effort limitations that may be applicable;\n(c)\nthe fishing vessel which declared having caught the fish had authorisation to fish in the areas declared;\n(d)\nthe presence of the fishing vessel in the area of catch declared has been verified according to VMS data.\n2.   Landing or transhipment operations may only start after authorisation has been given by the competent authorities of the port Member State. Such authorisation shall only be given if the confirmation from the flag state referred to in paragraph 1 has been received.\n3.   By way of derogation from paragraph 2, the competent authorities of the port Member State may authorise all or part of a landing in the absence of the confirmation referred to in paragraph 1, but in such cases they shall keep the fish concerned in storage under their control. The fish shall only be released to be sold, taken over or transported once the confirmation referred to in paragraph 1 has been received. If the confirmation has not been received within 14 days of the landing the competent authorities of the port Member State may confiscate and dispose of the fish in accordance with national rules.\n4.   The competent authorities of the port Member State shall without delay notify their decision on whether or not to authorise the landing or transhipment to the master and shall inform the NEAFC Secretary thereof.\n5.   Detailed rules on the authorisation to land or tranship under this Article shall be adopted in accordance with the procedure laid down in Articles 46 to 49.\nArticle 26\nPort inspections\n1.   Each Member State shall carry out inspections of at least 15 % of landings or transhipments in its ports during each reporting year.\n2.   Inspections shall involve the monitoring of the entire discharge or transhipment and include a cross-check between the quantities by species recorded in the prior notification of landing and the quantities by species landed or transhipped. When the landing or transhipment has been completed, the inspector shall verify and note the quantities by species of fish remaining on board.\n3.   National inspectors shall make all possible efforts to avoid delaying a vessel unduly and to ensure that the vessel suffers the minimum interference and inconvenience and that degradation of the quality of the fish is avoided.\n4.   The port Member State may invite inspectors of other Contracting Parties to accompany their own inspectors and observe the inspection of landings or transhipment operations of fishery resources caught by fishing vessels flying the flag of another Contracting Party.\nArticle 27\nInspection reports\n1.   Each inspection shall be documented by the completion of an inspection report using the form established in accordance with Article 50(2).\n2.   The master may add his comments to the inspection report, which shall be signed by the inspector and the master at the end of the inspection. A copy of the inspection report shall be given to the master of the fishing vessel.\n3.   A copy of each inspection report shall be transmitted without delay to the flag state of the inspected fishing vessel, to the flag state or states of the donor vessels where the vessel has engaged in transhipment operations, to the Commission or the body designated by it and to the NEAFC Secretary. The original or a certified copy of each inspection report shall be forwarded on request to the flag state of the inspected vessel.\nCHAPTER V\nINFRINGEMENTS\nArticle 28\nScope\nWithout prejudice to Regulation (EC) No 1224/2009 and to Regulation (EC) No 1005/2008 the provisions set out in this Chapter shall apply to EU fishing vessels and to fishing vessels flying the flag of another Contracting Party used or intended for use for fishing activities carried out in respect of fishery resources in the Regulatory Area.\nArticle 29\nInfringement procedures\n1.   Where inspectors find that there are clear grounds for believing that a fishing vessel has engaged in any activity contrary to the conservation and management measures adopted by NEAFC they shall:\n(a)\nrecord the infringement in the report referred to in Articles 19(2), 20(9) or 27;\n(b)\ntake all necessary measures to ensure security and continuity of the evidence. An identification mark may be affixed securely to any part of the fishing gear which appears to the inspector to be or to have been in contravention of applicable measures;\n(c)\nattempt immediately to communicate with an inspector or designated authority of the flag state of the inspected fishing vessel;\n(d)\ntransmit the inspection report promptly to the Commission or the body designated by it.\n2.   The Member State carrying out the inspection shall communicate in writing the details of the infringement to the designated authority of the flag state of the inspected vessel and to the Commission or the body designated by it and, whenever possible, shall do so during the first working day following the start of the inspection.\n3.   The Member State carrying out the inspection shall send without delay the original of the surveillance or inspection report with any supporting documents to the competent authorities of the flag state of the inspected fishing vessel as well as a copy to the Commission or the body designated by it, which shall forward a copy to the NEAFC Secretary.\nArticle 30\nFollow-up in the case of infringement\n1.   Where a Member State is notified by another Contracting Party or another Member State of an infringement committed by a fishing vessel flying its flag, it shall take prompt action in conformity with its national law to obtain and consider the evidence of the infringement and to conduct any further investigation necessary for the follow-up to the infringement and, whenever possible, to inspect the fishing vessel concerned.\n2.   Member States shall designate the competent authorities which are to receive evidence of infringement and shall inform the Commission or the body designated by it of the address of those authorities and of any change in this information. The Commission or the body designated by it shall subsequently forward the information to the NEAFC Secretary.\nArticle 31\nSerious infringements\nFor the purpose of this Regulation, the following infringements shall be considered to be serious:\n(a)\nfishing without a valid authorisation issued by the flag state;\n(b)\nfishing without quota or after its exhaustion;\n(c)\nuse of prohibited fishing gear;\n(d)\nserious misrecording of catches;\n(e)\nrepeated failure to comply with Articles 9 or 11;\n(f)\nlanding or transhipping in a port not designated in accordance with Article 23;\n(g)\nfailure to comply with Article 24;\n(h)\nlanding or transhipment without authorisation of the port state as referred to in Article 25;\n(i)\npreventing an inspector from carrying out his duties;\n(j)\ndirected fishing for a stock which is subject to a moratorium or for which fishing is prohibited;\n(k)\nfalsifying or concealing the markings, identity or registration of a fishing vessel;\n(l)\nconcealing, tampering with or disposing of evidence relating to an investigation;\n(m)\nmultiple violations which together constitute a serious disregard of conservation and management measures;\n(n)\nengaging in transhipment or joint fishing operations with vessels of a non-Contracting Party which has not been accorded the status of a cooperating non-Contracting Party by NEAFC;\n(o)\nsupplying any provisions, fuel or other services to vessels that have been placed on the list referred to in Article 44.\nArticle 32\nFollow-up in the case of serious infringements\n1.   If an inspector considers that there are clear grounds for believing that a fishing vessel has committed a serious infringement under Article 31, that inspector shall promptly notify that infringement to the Commission or the body designated by it, the competent authorities of the flag state of the inspected fishing vessel and the flag state or states of the donor vessels where the inspected vessel has engaged in transhipment operations, in accordance with Article 29(3), and shall also transmit a copy to the NEAFC Secretary.\n2.   In order to preserve the evidence, the inspector shall take all necessary measures to ensure the security and continuity thereof whilst minimising inconvenience to the vessel and interference with its operation.\n3.   The inspector shall be entitled to remain on board the fishing vessel for the period necessary to provide information on the infringement to the duly authorised inspector referred to in Article 33, or until receiving a reply from the flag state requesting him to leave the fishing vessel.\nArticle 33\nFollow-up in the case of serious infringements by an EU fishing vessel\n1.   Flag Member States shall respond to the notification referred to in Article 32(1) without delay and shall ensure that the fishing vessel concerned is inspected within 72 hours by an inspector duly authorised in relation to the infringement. The duly authorised inspector shall board the fishing vessel concerned and examine the evidence of the suspected infringement established by the inspector, and forward the results of the examination as quickly as possible to the competent authority in the flag Member State and to the Commission or the body designated by it.\n2.   Following notification of the results of the examination referred to in paragraph 1, flag Member States shall, if the evidence so warrants, require the fishing vessel to proceed immediately, and in any case within 24 hours, to a port designated by that flag Member State, for a thorough inspection under its authority.\n3.   The flag Member State may authorise the inspecting state to bring without delay the fishing vessel to a port designated by the flag Member State.\n4.   If the fishing vessel is not called to port, the flag Member State must provide due justification in a timely manner to the Commission or the body designated by it and to the inspecting state. The Commission or the body designated by it shall forward such justification to the NEAFC Secretary.\n5.   Where a fishing vessel is required to proceed to port for a thorough inspection pursuant to paragraphs 2 or 3, a NEAFC inspector from another Contracting Party may, subject to the consent of the flag Member State of the fishing vessel, board and remain on board the fishing vessel as it proceeds to port, and may be present during the inspection of the fishing vessel in port.\n6.   Flag Member States shall inform promptly the Commission or the body designated by it of the outcome of the thorough inspection and of the measures that they have adopted as a result of the infringement.\n7.   The detailed rules for the implementation of this Article shall be determined in accordance with Article 50(2).\nArticle 34\nReporting and follow-up of infringements\n1.   By 15 February each year, Member States shall report to the Commission or the body designated by it on the status of the proceedings concerning infringements of the conservation and management measures adopted by NEAFC which were committed during the previous calendar year. The infringements shall continue to be listed in each subsequent report until the proceedings are concluded in accordance with the relevant provisions of national law. The Commission or the body designated by it shall forward the reports to the NEAFC Secretary before 1 March of the same year.\n2.   The report referred to in paragraph 1 shall indicate the current status of the proceedings and in particular whether the case is pending, under appeal or still under investigation. The report shall describe in specific terms any sanctions imposed, stating in particular the level of fines, the value of forfeited fish and/or gear and any written warnings given and, if no action has been taken, it shall state the reasons thereof.\nArticle 35\nTreatment of inspection reports\nWithout prejudice to Article 77 of Regulation (EC) No 1224/2009, Member States shall collaborate with each other and with other Contracting Parties in order to facilitate judicial or other proceedings arising from a report submitted by an inspector under the Scheme, subject to the rules governing the admissibility of evidence in domestic judicial or other systems.\nArticle 36\nReports on surveillance and inspection activities\n1.   Each Member State shall report to the Commission or the body designated by it by 15 February each year for the previous calendar year:\n(a)\nthe number of inspections it has carried out under Articles 19, 20 and 26, specifying the number of inspections on the vessels of each Contracting Party and, where an infringement has been committed, the date and position of the inspection of the individual vessel concerned and the nature of the infringement;\n(b)\nthe number of hours flown and the number of days at sea on NEAFC patrols, the number of sightings of both Contracting Party vessels and non-Contracting Party vessels, and the list of individual vessels for which a surveillance report has been completed.\n2.   The Commission or the body designated by it shall compile a Union report on the basis of the reports of the Member States. It shall send the Union report to the NEAFC Secretary by 1 March each year.\nCHAPTER VI\nMEASURES TO PROMOTE COMPLIANCE BY NON-CONTRACTING PARTY FISHING VESSELS\nArticle 37\nScope\n1.   This Chapter shall apply to non-Contracting Parties’ fishing vessels used or intended for use for fishing activities carried out in respect of fishery resources in the Convention Area.\n2.   This Chapter shall be without prejudice to Regulation (EC) No 1224/2009 and to Regulation (EC) No 1005/2008.\nArticle 38\nSightings and identifications of non-Contracting Party vessels\n1.   Member States shall transmit without delay to the Commission or the body designated by it any information regarding non-Contracting Party vessels sighted or otherwise identified as engaging in fishing activities in the Convention Area. The Commission or the body designated by it shall inform promptly the NEAFC Secretary and all other Member States of each sighting report it receives.\n2.   The Member State which sighted the non-Contracting Party vessel shall attempt to inform that vessel without delay that it has been sighted or otherwise identified as engaging in fishing activities in the Convention Area and is consequently presumed, unless its flag state has been accorded the status of cooperating non-Contracting Party by NEAFC, to be undermining the NEAFC conservation and management measures.\n3.   In the case of a non-Contracting Party vessel sighted or otherwise identified as engaging in transhipment activities, the presumption of undermining the NEAFC conservation and management measures shall apply to any other non-Contracting Party vessel that has been identified as having engaged in such activities with that vessel.\nArticle 39\nInspections at sea\n1.   NEAFC inspectors shall request permission to board and inspect non-Contracting Party vessels sighted or otherwise identified by a Contracting Party as engaging in fishing activities in the Convention Area. If the master consents to the boarding and inspection of the vessel, the inspection shall be documented by the completion of an inspection report, as referred to Article 20(9).\n2.   NEAFC inspectors shall without delay transmit a copy of the inspection report to the Commission or the body designated by it, to the NEAFC Secretary and to the master of the non-Contracting Party vessel. Where the evidence in that report so warrants, a Member State may take such action as may be appropriate in accordance with international law. Member States are encouraged to examine whether their national measures are appropriate for the exercise of jurisdiction over such vessels.\n3.   If the master does not consent to the boarding and inspection of his vessel or does not fulfil any one of the obligations laid down in Article 21(a) to (d), the vessel shall be presumed to have engaged in illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing activities (IUU activities). The NEAFC Inspector shall inform without delay the Commission or the body designated by it thereof. In turn the Commission or the body designated by it shall promptly inform the NEAFC Secretary thereof.\nArticle 40\nEntry into port\n1.   The master of a non-Contracting Party fishing vessel may only call into a port designated in accordance with Article 23. The master intending to call into a port of a Member State shall notify the competent authorities of the port Member State in accordance with the provisions of Article 24. The port Member State concerned shall forward this information without delay to the flag state of the vessel and to the Commission or the body designated by it. In turn, the Commission or the body designated by it shall forward this information to the NEAFC Secretary.\n2.   The port Member State shall prohibit the entry into its ports of vessels that have not given the required prior notification of entry into port as referred to in Article 24.\nArticle 41\nInspections in port\n1.   Member States shall ensure that all non-Contracting Party vessels entering one of their ports are inspected. The vessel shall not be allowed to land or tranship any fish until this inspection has been completed. Each inspection shall be documented by the completion of an inspection report as provided for in Article 27. Where the master of the vessel has failed to fulfil any one of the obligations laid down in Article 21(a) to (d), the vessel shall be presumed to have engaged in IUU activities.\n2.   Information on the results of all inspections of non-Contracting Party vessels conducted in the ports of Member States, and concerning subsequent action, shall immediately be transmitted to the Commission or the body designated by it, which shall forward such information to the NEAFC Secretary.\nArticle 42\nLandings and transhipments\n1.   Landings and transhipments may only start after authorisation has been given by the competent authorities of the port state.\n2.   Landings and transhipments from a non-Contracting Party vessel which has been inspected pursuant to Article 41 shall be prohibited in the ports and waters of all Member States if such an inspection reveals that the vessel has species on board which are subject to recommendations established under the Convention, unless the master of the vessel provides satisfactory evidence to the competent authorities proving that the fish were caught outside the Regulatory Area or in compliance with all relevant recommendations established under the Convention.\n3.   The vessel shall not be authorised to engage in landings or transhipments if the flag state of the vessel, or the flag state or states of the donor vessels, where the vessel has engaged in transhipment operations, does not provide the confirmation referred to in Article 25.\n4.   Furthermore, landings and transhipments shall be prohibited where the master of the vessel has failed to fulfil any one of the obligations laid down in Article 21(a) to (d).\nArticle 43\nReports on non-Contracting Parties activities\n1.   Each Member State shall report to the Commission or the body designated by it by 15 February each year for the previous calendar year:\n(a)\nthe number of inspections of non-Contracting Party vessels that it conducted under this Scheme at sea or in its ports, the names of the vessels inspected and their respective flag states, the dates of the inspections and the names of any ports where the inspections were conducted, and the results of such inspections; and\n(b)\nwhere fish are landed or transhipped following an inspection pursuant to this Scheme, the evidence provided pursuant to Article 42.\n2.   In addition to surveillance reports and information on inspections, Member States may at any time submit to the Commission or the body designated by it any further information which might be relevant for the identification of non-Contracting Party vessels that might be carrying out IUU activities in the Convention Area.\n3.   On the basis of this information, the Commission or the body designated by it shall send a global report on non-Contracting Parties’ activities to the NEAFC Secretary by 1 March each year.\nArticle 44\nVessels engaged in IUU activities\n1.   Member States shall ensure that vessels appearing in the provisional list of vessels engaged in IUU activities established by NEAFC (‘A’ list) are:\n(a)\ninspected in accordance with the provisions of Article 41 when they enter their ports;\n(b)\nnot authorised to land or tranship in their ports or in the waters under their jurisdiction;\n(c)\nnot given assistance by fishing vessels, support vessels, refuel vessels, the mother-ship and cargo vessels flying their flag or permitted to participate in any transhipment or joint fishing operation with such vessels;\n(d)\nnot supplied with provisions, fuel or other services.\n2.   The provisions laid down in paragraph 1(b) and (d) shall not be applied to any vessel appearing on the ‘A’ list where a recommendation has been made to NEAFC that the vessel in question should be removed from the ‘A’ list.\nCHAPTER VII\nFINAL PROVISIONS\nArticle 45\nConfidentiality\n1.   In addition to the obligations laid down in Articles 112 and 113 of Regulation (EC) No 1224/2009, Member States shall ensure confidential treatment of electronic reports and messages transmitted to and received from the NEAFC Secretary pursuant to Articles 11, 12 and 19(1).\n2.   The detailed rules for the implementation of this Article shall be determined in accordance with Article 50(2).\nArticle 46\nDelegation of powers\n1.   The Commission may adopt, by means of delegated acts in accordance with Article 47 and subject to the conditions of Articles 48 and 49 the detailed rules for the application of Article 25, as well as the list of fishery resources referred to in Article 10(1) and detailed rules on the notification and cancellation procedures, including periods, as referred to in the second subparagraph of Article 24(4).\n2.

character of the basic legislative act, which now are listed under Article 51 of the Regulation (delegation of powers), can become at any time in the future a significant element of the existing NEAFC control scheme from a political point of view, in which case the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission recall that either of the legislators, the Council or the European Parliament, can immediately exercise either the right to object to a draft Commission delegated act or the right to revoke the delegated powers as provided under Article 48 and Article 49 of the Regulation respectively.’\n‘The Council and the Parliament agree that the inclusion of any provision of the NEAFC control scheme into this Regulation as a non-essential element, now listed under Article 51, does not imply per se that such provisions will automatically be considered by the legislators to be of a non-essential character in any future Regulations.’\n‘The European Parliament, the Council and the Commission declare that the provisions of this Regulation shall be without prejudice to any future position of the institutions as regards the implementation of Article 290 TFEU or individual legislative acts containing such provisions.’", "summary": "Future international cooperation in north-east Atlantic fisheries\nFuture international cooperation in north-east Atlantic fisheries\nSUMMARY OF:\nRegulation (EU) No 1236/2010 control and enforcement system for the north-east Atlantic fisheries area\nConvention on cooperation in north-east Atlantic fisheries\nWHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?\n              \nIt aims to promote international cooperation on the conservation, control and good management of the fisheries in the north-east Atlantic area.\nIt enacts the Convention on Multilateral Cooperation in North-East Atlantic Fisheries which sets out rules for cooperation on the conservation and management of fisheries.\nIn particular, the regulation implements the NEAFC Scheme of Control and Enforcement, which provides for\ncontrol and enforcement measures for vessels flying the flag of its contracting parties;\narrangements for inspections at sea;\nsurveillance; and\ninfringement procedures.\nKEY POINTS\n              \nThe scheme creates a new port state control system which will effectively close European ports to landings and transhipments* of frozen fish which have not been verified to be legal.\nEU countries must:\ndesignate a competent authority which acts as the contact point to receive surveillance and inspection reports, available 24 hours a day;\nsend the European Commission a list of all vessels flying their flag registered in the EU that are authorised to fish in the area covered by the regulation;\nundertake to retrieve on a regular basis lost fishing gear belonging to vessels flying their flag.\nVessel masters must:\nlog each entry and exit from the regulatory area*, the estimated cumulative catch, the amount of fish discarded, and the fishing depth;\nsend catch reports to their Fisheries Monitoring Centre*, which can then be accessed by the Commission.\nMasters of vessels which process and/or freeze their catch must record the species and type of product and stow fish products in the hold in a way that allows each species to be identified from a stowage plan kept on board. When frozen, all fish must be identified with a clearly legible label or stamp.\nWhen more than 10 EU fishing vessels are engaged in fishing activities* carried out in the regulatory area, an inspection vessel will be present.\nEach EU country must inspect at least 5% of landings or transhipments of fresh fish and at least 7.5% of frozen fish in its ports during each reporting year.\nWhen inspectors find that a fishing vessel has engaged in activity contrary to NEAFC conservation and management measures, they shall record and report the infringement.\nSerious infringements include:\nfishing without authorisation;\nfishing without quota;\nusing prohibited fishing gear;\nmisrecording catches;\nfalsifying the marking or identity of vessels;\npreventing an inspector from carrying out their duties.\nEU countries’ inspectors must also report any unauthorised vessels they record to the Commission.\nFROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?\n              \nIt has applied since 1 January 2011.\nBACKGROUND\n              \nThe north-east Atlantic is one of the most abundant fishing areas in the world. The Convention on Multilateral Cooperation in North East Atlantic Fisheries entered into force in November 1982. The contracting parties to the Convention are the EU, the Faroe Islands, Greenland, Iceland, Norway and the Russian Federation, and the area covered stretches from the southern tip of Greenland, east to the Barents Sea and south to Portugal.\nIn 2006, the North-East Atlantic Fisheries Commission (NEAFC) adopted a recommendation establishing a scheme of control and enforcement on fishing vessels operating in the area covered by the Convention.\nIt also included rules for vessels flying the flag of a non-contracting party to ensure full respect of conservation and management measures adopted by the NEAFC.\nThe NEAFC has recommended removing a number of vessels that have been engaged in illegal, unreported and unregulated fisheries.\nSimilar rules are in force in EU waters under the common fisheries policy.\nKEY TERMS\n              \nTranshipment: the transfer of a catch from one fishing boat to another which then incorporates it into a larger batch for shipment.\nRegulatory area: the waters covered by the convention which lie beyond the jurisdiction of the contracting parties. See map.\nFisheries Monitoring Centre: an operational centre based in an EU country which can receive, process and transmit fisheries data.\nFishing activities: fishing, fish processing operations, the transhipment or landing of fish or fish products, and any other commercial activity in preparation for or related to fishing, including packaging, transporting, refuelling or resupplying.\nMAIN DOCUMENTS\n            \nRegulation (EU) No 1236/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 December 2010 laying down a scheme of control and enforcement applicable in the area covered by the Convention on future multilateral cooperation in the North-East Atlantic fisheries and repealing Council Regulation (EC) No 2791/1999 (OJ L 348, 31.12.2010, pp. 17-33)\nSuccessive amendments to Regulation (EU) No 1236/2010 have been incorporated into the original document.
