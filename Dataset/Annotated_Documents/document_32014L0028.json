{"celex_id": "32014L0028", "reference": "29.3.2014\nEN\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\nL 96/1\nDIRECTIVE 2014/28/EU OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL\nof 26 February 2014\non the harmonisation of the laws of the Member States relating to the making available on the market and supervision of explosives for civil uses (recast)\n(Text with EEA relevance)\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 114 thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee (1),\nActing in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure (2),\nWhereas:\n(1)\nCouncil Directive 93/15/EEC of 5 April 1993 on the harmonization of the provisions relating to the placing on the market and supervision of explosives for civil uses (3) has been substantially amended (4). Since further amendments are to be made, that Directive should be recast in the interests of clarity.\n(2)\nIt is necessary to clarify in this Directive that certain articles were identified following the United Nations recommendations on the transport of dangerous goods as being pyrotechnic articles or ammunition, thus falling outside the scope of this Directive. Commission Directive 2004/57/EC of 23 April 2004 on the identification of pyrotechnic articles and certain ammunition for the purposes of Council Directive 93/15/EEC on the harmonisation of the provisions relating to the placing on the market and supervision of explosives for civil uses (5), which currently contains a list of such articles, should therefore be repealed.\n(3)\nRegulation (EC) No 765/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 9 July 2008 setting out the requirements for accreditation and market surveillance relating to the marketing of products (6) lays down rules on the accreditation of conformity assessment bodies, provides a framework for the market surveillance of products and for controls on products from third countries, and lays down the general principles of the CE marking.\n(4)\nDecision No 768/2008/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 9 July 2008 on a common framework for the marketing of products (7), lays down common principles and reference provisions intended to apply across sectoral legislation in order to provide a coherent basis for revision or recasts of that legislation. Directive 93/15/EEC should therefore be adapted to that Decision.\n(5)\nSafety during storage is covered by Council Directive 96/82/EC of 9 December 1996 on the control of major-accident hazards involving dangerous substances (8) which sets out safety requirements for establishments where explosives are present. Safety of explosives during transport is regulated by international conventions and agreements, including the United Nations recommendations on the transport of dangerous goods. Those aspects should therefore not fall under the scope of this Directive.\n(6)\nPyrotechnic articles require appropriate measures to ensure the protection of end-users and the safety of the public. Pyrotechnic articles are covered by Directive 2013/29/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 June 2013 on the harmonisation of the laws of the Member States relating to the making available on the market of pyrotechnic articles (9). This Directive should therefore not apply to pyrotechnic articles.\n(7)\nThe scope of this Directive should cover ammunition, but only as regards the rules governing controls on transfers and the associated arrangements. Since ammunition is transferred under conditions similar to those under which arms are transferred, transfers of ammunition should be governed by provisions similar to those applicable to arms, as set out in Council Directive 91/477/EEC of 18 June 1991 on control of the acquisition and possession of weapons (10).\n(8)\nThis Directive should apply to all forms of supply, including distance selling.\n(9)\nThe definition of the explosives covered by this Directive should be based on the definition of such products as set out in the United Nations recommendations on the transport of dangerous goods.\n(10)\nIn order to ensure the free movement of explosives it is necessary to harmonise the laws relating to making explosives available on the market.\n(11)\nEconomic operators should be responsible for the compliance of explosives with this Directive in relation to their respective roles in the supply chain, so as to ensure a high level of protection of public interests, such as health and safety of persons and public security and to guarantee fair competition on the Union market.\n(12)\nAll economic operators intervening in the supply and distribution chain should take appropriate measures to ensure that they only make available on the market explosives which are in conformity with this Directive. It is necessary to provide for a clear and proportionate distribution of obligations which correspond to the role of each economic operator in the supply and distribution chain.\n(13)\nIn order to facilitate communication between economic operators, market surveillance authorities and end-users, Member States should encourage economic operators to include a website address in addition to the postal address.\n(14)\nThe manufacturer, having detailed knowledge of the design and production process, is best placed to carry out the conformity assessment procedure. Conformity assessment should therefore remain solely the obligation of the manufacturer.\n(15)\nIt is necessary to ensure that explosives from third countries entering the Union market comply with this Directive, and in particular that appropriate conformity assessment procedures have been carried out by manufacturers with regard to those explosives. Provision should therefore be made for importers to make sure that the explosives they place on the market comply with the requirements of this Directive and that they do not place on the market explosives which do not comply with such requirements or present a risk. Provision should also be made for importers to make sure that conformity assessment procedures have been carried out and that marking of explosives and documentation drawn up by manufacturers are available for inspection by the competent national authorities.\n(16)\nThe distributor makes an explosive available on the market after it has been placed on the market by the manufacturer or the importer and should act with due care to ensure that its handling of the explosive does not adversely affect the compliance of the explosive.\n(17)\nAny economic operator that either places an explosive on the market under his own name or trade mark or modifies an explosive in such a way that compliance with this Directive may be affected should be considered to be the manufacturer and should assume the obligations of the manufacturer.\n(18)\nDistributors and importers, being close to the market place, should be involved in market surveillance tasks carried out by the competent national authorities, and should be prepared to participate actively, providing those authorities with all necessary information relating to the explosive concerned.\n(19)\nUnique identification of explosives is essential if accurate and complete records of explosives are to be kept at all stages of the supply chain. This should allow the identification and the traceability of an explosive from its production site and its placing on the market until its final user and its use with a view to preventing misuse and theft and to assisting law enforcement authorities in the tracing of the origin of lost or stolen explosives. An efficient traceability system also facilitates market surveillance authoritiesâ€™ task of tracing economic operators who made non-compliant explosives available on the market. When keeping the information required under this Directive for the identification of economic operators, economic operators should not be required to update such information in respect of other economic operators who have either supplied them with an explosive or to whom they have supplied an explosive.\n(20)\nThe provisions of this Directive relating to the making available on the market should be limited to the expression of the essential safety requirements for explosives in order to protect the health and safety of persons, property and the environment. In order to facilitate conformity assessment with those requirements it is necessary to provide for a presumption of conformity for explosives which are in conformity with harmonised standards that are adopted in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 1025/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 October 2012 on European Standardisation (11) for the purpose of expressing detailed technical specifications of those requirements.\n(21)\nRegulation (EU) No 1025/2012 provides for a procedure for objections to harmonised standards where those standards do not entirely satisfy the requirements of this Directive.\n(22)\nIn order to enable economic operators to demonstrate and the competent authorities to ensure that explosives made available on the market conform to the essential safety requirements it is necessary to provide for conformity assessment procedures. Decision No 768/2008/EC establishes modules for conformity assessment procedures which include procedures from the least to the most stringent, in proportion to the level of risk involved and the level of safety required. In order to ensure inter-sectoral coherence and to avoid ad-hoc variants conformity assessment procedures should be chosen from among those modules. Because of their specific characteristics and the hazards involved, explosives should always be submitted to third party conformity assessment.\n(23)\nManufacturers should draw up an EU declaration of conformity to provide information required under this Directive on the conformity of an explosive with this Directive and of other relevant Union harmonisation legislation.\n(24)\nTo ensure effective access to information for market surveillance purposes, the information required to identify all applicable Union acts should be available in a single EU declaration of conformity. In order to reduce the administrative burden on economic operators, that single EU declaration of conformity may be a dossier made up of relevant individual declarations of conformity.\n(25)\nThe CE marking, indicating the conformity of an explosive, is the visible consequence of a whole process comprising conformity assessment in a broad sense. General principles governing the CE marking are set out in Regulation (EC) No 765/2008. Rules governing the affixing of the CE marking should be laid down in this Directive.\n(26)\nThe conformity assessment procedures set out in this Directive require the intervention of conformity assessment bodies, which are notified by the Member States to the Commission.\n(27)\nExperience has shown that the criteria set out in Directive 93/15/EEC that conformity assessment bodies have to fulfil to be notified to the Commission are not sufficient to ensure a uniformly high level of performance of notified bodies throughout the Union. It is, however, essential that all notified bodies perform their functions to the same level and under conditions of fair competition. That requires the setting of obligatory requirements for conformity assessment bodies wishing to be notified in order to provide conformity assessment services.\n(28)\nIn order to ensure a consistent level of conformity assessment quality it is also necessary to set requirements for notifying authorities and other bodies involved in the assessment, notification and monitoring of notified bodies.\n(29)\nIf a conformity assessment body demonstrates conformity with the criteria laid down in harmonised standards, it should be presumed to comply with the corresponding requirements set out in this Directive.\n(30)\nThe system set out in this Directive should be complemented by the accreditation system provided for in Regulation (EC) No 765/2008. Since accreditation is an essential means of verifying the competence of conformity assessment bodies, it should also be used for the purposes of notification.\n(31)\nTransparent accreditation as provided for in Regulation (EC) No 765/2008, ensuring the necessary level of confidence in certificates of conformity, should be considered by the national public authorities throughout the Union as the preferred means of demonstrating the technical competence of conformity assessment bodies. However, national authorities may consider that they possess the appropriate means of carrying out that evaluation themselves. In such cases, in order to ensure the appropriate level of credibility of evaluations carried out by other national authorities, they should provide the Commission and the other Member States with the necessary documentary evidence demonstrating the compliance of the conformity assessment bodies evaluated with the relevant regulatory requirements.\n(32)\nConformity assessment bodies frequently subcontract parts of their activities linked to the assessment of conformity or have recourse to a subsidiary. In order to safeguard the level of protection required for the explosives to be placed on the Union market, it is essential that conformity assessment subcontractors and subsidiaries fulfil the same requirements as notified bodies in relation to the performance of conformity assessment tasks. Therefore, it is important that the assessment of the competence and the performance of conformity assessment bodies to be notified and the monitoring of notified bodies cover also activities carried out by subcontractors and subsidiaries.\n(33)\nIt is necessary to increase the efficiency and transparency of the notification procedure and, in particular, to adapt it to new technologies so as to enable online notification.\n(34)\nSince notified bodies may offer their services throughout the Union, it is appropriate to give the other Member States and the Commission the opportunity to raise objections concerning a notified body. It is therefore important to provide for a period during which any doubts or concerns as to the competence of conformity assessment bodies can be clarified before they start operating as notified bodies.\n(35)\nIn the interests of competitiveness, it is crucial that notified bodies apply the conformity assessment procedures without creating unnecessary burdens for economic operators. For the same reason, and to ensure equal treatment of economic operators, consistency in the technical application of the conformity assessment procedures needs to be ensured. That can best be achieved through appropriate coordination and cooperation between notified bodies.\n(36)\nIn order to ensure legal certainty, it is necessary to clarify that rules on Union market surveillance and control of products entering the Union market provided for in Regulation (EC) No 765/2008 apply to explosives. This Directive should not prevent Member States from choosing the competent authorities to carry out those tasks.\n(37)\nMember States should take all appropriate measures to ensure that explosives may be placed on the market only if, when properly stored and used for their intended purpose, or under conditions of use which can be reasonably foreseen, they do not endanger the health and safety of persons. Explosives should be considered as non-compliant with the essential safety requirements laid down in this Directive only under conditions of use which can be reasonably foreseen, that is when such use could result from lawful and readily predictable human behaviour.\n(38)\nThe existing system should be supplemented by a procedure under which interested parties are informed of measures intended to be taken with regard to explosives presenting a risk to the health or safety of persons, or to property or the environment. It should also allow market surveillance authorities, in cooperation with the relevant economic operators, to act at an earlier stage in respect of such explosives.\n(39)\nWhere the Member States and the Commission agree as to the justification of a measure taken by a Member State, no further involvement of the Commission should be required, except where non-compliance can be attributed to shortcomings of a harmonised standard.\n(40)\nIn the event of a serious threat to, or attack on, public security as a result of illicit possession or use of explosives or ammunition Member States should be allowed to derogate, under certain conditions, from this Directive with regard to transfer of explosives and ammunition in order to prevent such illicit possession or use.\n(41)\nIt is essential to establish administrative cooperation mechanisms between competent authorities of Member States. Therefore, the competent authorities should base their approach on Council Regulation (EC) No 515/97 of 13 March 1997 on mutual assistance between the administrative authorities of the Member States and cooperation between the latter and the Commission to ensure the correct application of the law on customs or agricultural matters (12).\n(42)\nThis Directive should not affect the power of Member States to take measures with a view to preventing illegal trade in explosives and ammunition.\n(43)\nIn order to achieve the objectives of this Directive, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union should be delegated to the Commission in respect of Union measures concerning adapting this Directive to United Nations recommendations on the transport of dangerous goods. It is of particular importance that the Commission carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level. The Commission, when preparing and drawing up delegated acts, should ensure a simultaneous, timely and appropriate transmission of relevant documents to the European Parliament and to the Council.\n(44)\nIn order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of this Directive, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission. Those powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 February 2011 laying down the rules and general principles concerning mechanisms for control by Member States of the Commissionâ€™s exercise of implementing powers (13).\n(45)\nThe advisory procedure should be used for the adoption of implementing acts requesting the notifying Member State to take the necessary corrective measures in respect of notified bodies that do not meet or no longer meet the requirements for their notification.\n(46)\nThe examination procedure should be used for the adoption of the implementing acts in order to set up the practical arrangements for the operation of the system for the unique identification and traceability of explosives, as well as for setting out the technical arrangements for the application of the provisions on the transfer of explosives, in particular the model document to be used.\n(47)\nThe examination procedure should also be used for the adoption of implementing acts with respect to compliant explosives which present a risk to the health or safety of persons or to other aspects of public interest protection.\n(48)\nThe Commission should adopt immediately applicable implementing acts where, in duly justified cases relating to compliant explosives which present a risk to the health or safety of persons, or to property or the environment, imperative grounds of urgency so require.\n(49)\nIn line with established practice, the committee set up by this Directive can play a useful role in examining matters concerning the application of this Directive raised either by its chair or by a representative of a Member State in accordance with its rules of procedure.\n(50)\nWhen matters relating to this Directive, other than its implementation or infringements, are being examined, i.e. in a Commission expert group, the European Parliament should in line with existing practice receive full information and documentation and, where appropriate, an invitation to attend such meetings.\n(51)\nThe Commission should, by means of implementing acts and, given their special nature, acting without the application of Regulation (EU) No 182/2011, determine whether measures taken by Member States in respect of non-compliant explosives are justified or not.\n(52)\nMember States should lay down rules on penalties applicable to infringements of the provisions of national law adopted pursuant to this Directive and ensure that those rules are enforced. The penalties provided for should be effective, proportionate and dissuasive.\n(53)\nIt is necessary to provide for reasonable transitional arrangements that allow the making available on the market without the need to comply with further product requirements of explosives that have already been placed on the market in accordance with Directive 93/15/EEC before the date of application of national measures transposing this Directive. Distributors should therefore be able to supply explosives that have been placed on the market, namely stock that is already in the distribution chain, before the date of application of national measures transposing this Directive.\n(54)\nSince the objective of this Directive, namely to ensure that explosives on the market fulfil the requirements providing for a high level of protection of health and safety and other public interests while guaranteeing the functioning of the internal market cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States but can rather, by reason of its scale and effects, be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Directive does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve that objective.\n(55)\nThe obligation to transpose this Directive into national law should be confined to those provisions which represent a substantive amendment as compared to the earlier Directives. The obligation to transpose the provisions which are unchanged arises under the earlier Directives.\n(56)\nThis Directive should be without prejudice to the obligations of the Member States relating to the time-limits for transposition into national law and the dates of application of the Directives set out in Annex V, Part B,\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:\nCHAPTER 1\nGENERAL PROVISIONS\nArticle 1\nScope\n1.

When placing their explosives on the market or when using them for their own purposes, manufacturers shall ensure that they have been designed and manufactured in accordance with the essential safety requirements set out in Annex II.\n2.   Manufacturers shall draw up the technical documentation referred to in Annex III and have the relevant conformity assessment procedure referred to in Article 20 carried out.\nWhere compliance of an explosive with the applicable requirements has been demonstrated by that procedure, manufacturers shall draw up an EU declaration of conformity and affix the CE marking.\n3.   Manufacturers shall keep the technical documentation and the EU declaration of conformity for 10 years after the explosive has been placed on the market.\n4.   Manufacturers shall ensure that procedures are in place for series production to remain in conformity with this Directive. Changes in design or characteristics of the explosive and changes in the harmonised standards or in other technical specifications by reference to which conformity of an explosive is declared shall be adequately taken into account.\n5.   Manufacturers shall ensure that explosives which they have placed on the market bear a unique identification in accordance with the system for the identification and traceability of explosives set out in Article 15. For explosives excluded from that system, manufacturers shall:\n(a)\nensure that explosives which they have placed on the market bear a type, batch or serial number or other element allowing their identification, or, where the small size, shape or design of the explosive does not allow it, that the required information is provided on its packaging or in a document accompanying the explosive;\n(b)\nindicate on the explosive their name, registered trade name or registered trade mark and the postal address at which they can be contacted or, where that is not possible, on its packaging or in a document accompanying the explosive. The address shall indicate a single point at which the manufacturer can be contacted. The contact details shall be in a language easily understood by end-users and market surveillance authorities.\n6.   Manufacturers shall ensure that explosives which they have placed on the market are accompanied by instructions and safety information in a language which can be easily understood by end-users, as determined by the Member State concerned. Such instructions and safety information, as well as any labelling, shall be clear, understandable and intelligible.\n7.   Manufacturers who consider or have reason to believe that an explosive which they have placed on the market is not in conformity with this Directive shall immediately take the corrective measures necessary to bring that explosive into conformity, to withdraw it or recall it, if appropriate. Furthermore, where the explosive presents a risk, manufacturers shall immediately inform the competent national authorities of the Member States in which they made the explosive available on the market to that effect, giving details, in particular, of the non-compliance and of any corrective measures taken.\n8.   Manufacturers shall, further to a reasoned request from a competent national authority, provide it with all the information and documentation in paper or electronic form necessary to demonstrate the conformity of the explosive with this Directive, in a language which can be easily understood by that authority. They shall cooperate with that authority, at its request, on any action taken to eliminate the risks posed by explosives which they have placed on the market.\nArticle 6\nAuthorised representatives\n1.   A manufacturer may, by a written mandate, appoint an authorised representative.\nThe obligations laid down in Article 5(1) and the obligation to draw up technical documentation referred to in Article 5(2) shall not form part of the authorised representativeâ€™s mandate.\n2.   An authorised representative shall perform the tasks specified in the mandate received from the manufacturer. The mandate shall allow the authorised representative to do at least the following:\n(a)\nkeep the EU declaration of conformity and the technical documentation at the disposal of national market surveillance authorities for 10 years after the explosive has been placed on the market;\n(b)\nfurther to a reasoned request from a competent national authority, provide that authority with all the information and documentation necessary to demonstrate the conformity of an explosive;\n(c)\ncooperate with the competent national authorities, at their request, on any action taken to eliminate the risks posed by explosives covered by the authorised representativeâ€™s mandate.\nArticle 7\nObligations of importers\n1.   Importers shall place only compliant explosives on the market.\n2.   Before placing an explosive on the market importers shall ensure that the appropriate conformity assessment procedure referred to in Article 20 has been carried out by the manufacturer. They shall ensure that the manufacturer has drawn up the technical documentation, that the explosive bears the CE marking and is accompanied by the required documents, and that the manufacturer has complied with the requirements set out in Article 5(5).\nWhere an importer considers or has reason to believe that an explosive is not in conformity with the essential safety requirements set out in Annex II, he shall not place the explosive on the market until it has been brought into conformity. Furthermore, where the explosive presents a risk, the importer shall inform the manufacturer and the market surveillance authorities to that effect.\n3.   Importers shall indicate, on the explosive, their name, registered trade name or registered trade mark and the postal address at which they can be contacted or, where that is not possible, on its packaging or in a document accompanying the explosive. The contact details shall be in a language easily understood by end-users and market surveillance authorities.\n4.   Importers shall ensure that the explosive is accompanied by instructions and safety information in a language which can be easily understood by end-users, as determined by the Member State concerned.\n5.   Importers shall ensure that, while an explosive is under their responsibility, its storage or transport conditions do not jeopardise its compliance with the essential safety requirements set out in Annex II.\n6.   Importers who consider or have reason to believe that an explosive which they have placed on the market is not in conformity with this Directive shall immediately take the corrective measures necessary to bring that explosive into conformity, to withdraw it or recall it, if appropriate. Furthermore, where the explosive presents a risk, importers shall immediately inform the competent national authorities of the Member States in which they made the explosive available on the market to that effect, giving details, in particular, of the non-compliance and of any corrective measures taken.\n7.   Importers shall, for 10 years after the explosive has been placed on the market, keep a copy of the EU declaration of conformity at the disposal of the market surveillance authorities and ensure that the technical documentation can be made available to those authorities, upon request.\n8.   Importers shall, further to a reasoned request from a competent national authority, provide it with all the information and documentation in paper or electronic form necessary to demonstrate the conformity of an explosive in a language which can be easily understood by that authority. They shall cooperate with that authority, at its request, on any action taken to eliminate the risks posed by explosives which they have placed on the market.\nArticle 8\nObligations of distributors\n1.   When making an explosive available on the market distributors shall act with due care in relation to the requirements of this Directive.\n2.   Before making an explosive available on the market distributors shall verify that the explosive bears the CE marking, that it is accompanied by the required documents and by instructions and safety information in a language which can be easily understood by end-users in the Member State in which the explosive is to be made available on the market, and that the manufacturer and the importer have complied with the requirements set out in Article 5(5) and Article 7(3) respectively.\nWhere a distributor considers or has reason to believe that an explosive is not in conformity with the essential safety requirements set out in Annex II, he shall not make the explosive available on the market until it has been brought into conformity. Furthermore, where the explosive presents a risk, the distributor shall inform the manufacturer or the importer to that effect as well as the market surveillance authorities.\n3.   Distributors shall ensure that, while an explosive is under their responsibility, its storage or transport conditions do not jeopardise its compliance with the essential safety requirements set out in Annex II.\n4.   Distributors who consider or have reason to believe that an explosive which they have made available on the market is not in conformity with this Directive shall make sure that the corrective measures necessary to bring that explosive into conformity, to withdraw it or recall it, if appropriate, are taken. Furthermore, where the explosive presents a risk, distributors shall immediately inform the competent national authorities of the Member States in which they made the explosive available on the market to that effect, giving details, in particular, of the non-compliance and of any corrective measures taken.\n5.   Distributors shall, further to a reasoned request from a competent national authority, provide it with all the information and documentation in paper or electronic form necessary to demonstrate the conformity of an explosive. They shall cooperate with that authority, at its request, on any action taken to eliminate the risks posed by explosives which they have made available on the market.\nArticle 9\nCases in which obligations of manufacturers apply to importers and distributors\nAn importer or distributor shall be considered a manufacturer for the purposes of this Directive and he shall be subject to the obligations of the manufacturer under Article 5, where he places an explosive on the market under his name or trade mark or modifies an explosive already placed on the market in such a way that compliance with this Directive may be affected.\nArticle 10\nIdentification of economic operators\nFor explosives not covered by the system set out in Article 15, economic operators shall, on request, identify the following to the market surveillance authorities:\n(a)\nany economic operator who has supplied them with an explosive;\n(b)\nany economic operator to whom they have supplied an explosive.\nEconomic operators shall be able to present the information referred to in the first paragraph for 10 years after they have been supplied with the explosive and for 10 years after they have supplied the explosive.\nCHAPTER 3\nSECURITY PROVISIONS\nArticle 11\nTransfers of explosives\n1.   Explosives may be transferred only in accordance with paragraphs 2 to 8.\n2.   Approval to transfer explosives shall be obtained by the consignee from the competent authority in the Member State of the consignee. The competent authority shall verify that the consignee is legally authorised to acquire explosives and that he is in possession of the necessary licences or authorisations. The economic operator responsible for the transfer shall notify the competent authorities of the transit Member State of any movement of explosives through the Member State concerned and shall obtain prior approval of the transit Member State concerned.\n3.   Where a Member State considers that there is a problem regarding the verification of the entitlement to acquire explosives referred to in paragraph 2, that Member State shall forward the available information on the subject to the Commission which shall inform the other Member States thereof.\n4.   Where the competent authority in the Member State of the consignee approves a transfer, it shall issue to the consignee a document which includes all the information referred to in paragraph 5. Such a document shall accompany the explosives until they arrive at their stated destination. It shall be produced at the request of the relevant competent authorities. A copy of that document shall be retained by the consignee who shall present it, upon request, for examination by the competent authority in the Member State of the consignee.\n5.   Where transfers of explosives must be specially supervised in order to comply with special security requirements in the territory or part of the territory of a Member State, prior to the transfer the following information shall be provided by the consignee to the competent authority in the Member State of the consignee:\n(a)\nthe names and addresses of the economic operators concerned;\n(b)\nthe number and quantity of the explosives being transferred;\n(c)\na full description of the explosives in question and of the means of identification, including the United Nations identification number;\n(d)\nwhere the explosives are to be placed on the market, information on compliance with conditions for placing on the market;\n(e)\nthe means of transfer and the itinerary;\n(f)\nthe expected dates of departure and arrival;\n(g)\nwhere necessary, the precise points of entry to and exit from Member States.\nThe information referred to in point (a) of the first subparagraph shall be sufficiently detailed in order to enable competent authorities to contact the economic operators and to obtain confirmation that the economic operators concerned are entitled to receive the consignment.\nThe competent authority in the Member State of the consignee shall examine the conditions under which the transfer may take place, with particular regard to the special security requirements. If the special security requirements are satisfied, approval for the transfer shall be granted. In the case of transit through the territory of other Member States, those Member States shall likewise examine and approve the particulars concerning the transfer.\n6.   Where the competent authority of a Member State considers that special security requirements referred to in paragraphs 4 and 5 are unnecessary, explosives may be transferred on their territory or part thereof without prior provision of information within the meaning of paragraph 5. The competent authority in the Member State of the consignee shall then grant an approval for a fixed period, which is liable to suspension or withdrawal at any time on the basis of a reasoned justification. The document referred to in paragraph 4, which shall accompany the explosives until they arrive at their destination, shall refer solely to that approval.\n7.   Without prejudice to the normal checks which the Member State of departure is to carry out in its territory, at the request of the competent authorities concerned, the consignees and the economic operators concerned shall forward to the authorities of the Member State of departure and to those of the Member State of transit all relevant information they possess concerning the transfer of explosives.\n8.   No economic operator may transfer explosives unless the consignee has obtained the necessary authorisations for the transfer in accordance with paragraphs 2, 4, 5 and 6.\nArticle 12\nTransfers of ammunition\n1.   Ammunition may be transferred from one Member State to another only in accordance with the procedure laid down in paragraphs 2 to 5. Those paragraphs shall also apply to transfers of ammunition under mail-order sales.\n2.   Where ammunition is to be transferred to another Member State the person concerned shall, before any dispatch, communicate to the Member State in which that ammunition is located:\n(a)\nthe names and addresses of the person selling or transferring the ammunition, of the person purchasing or acquiring the ammunition and, where appropriate, of the owner;\n(b)\nthe address to which the ammunition is to be consigned or transported;\n(c)\nthe quantity of ammunition to be consigned or transported;\n(d)\ndata making it possible to identify the ammunition and also an indication that the ammunition has undergone a check in accordance with the Convention of 1 July 1969 on the Reciprocal Recognition of Proofmarks on Small Arms;\n(e)\nthe means of transfer;\n(f)\nthe date of departure and the estimated date of arrival.\nThe information referred to in points (e) and (f) of the first subparagraph need not be supplied in the case of a transfer between dealers. The Member State shall examine the conditions under which the transfer is to be carried out, in particular with regard to security. Where the Member State authorises such a transfer it shall issue a licence incorporating all the particulars referred to in the first subparagraph. That licence shall accompany the ammunition until it reaches its destination. It shall be produced whenever so required by the competent authorities of the Member States.\n3.   Each Member State may grant dealers the right to effect transfers of ammunition from its territory to a dealer established in another Member State without the prior authorisation referred to in paragraph 2. To that end it shall issue an authorisation valid for three years which may at any time be suspended or cancelled by reasoned decision. A document referring to that authorisation shall accompany the ammunition until it reaches its destination. It shall be produced whenever so required by the competent authorities of the Member States.\nBefore effecting the transfer, the dealer shall communicate to the authorities of the Member State from which the transfer is to be effected all the particulars listed in the first subparagraph of paragraph 2.\n4.   Each Member State shall supply the other Member States with a list of the ammunition the transfer of which to its territory may be authorised without its prior consent.\nSuch lists of ammunition shall be communicated to dealers who have obtained approval for transferring ammunition without prior authorisation in accordance with the procedure laid down in paragraph 3.\n5.   Each Member State shall communicate all useful information at its disposal concerning definitive transfers of ammunition to the Member State, to the territory of which such a transfer has been effected.\nAll information that Member States receive in accordance with paragraphs 2 and 3 shall be communicated, not later than the time of the relevant transfers, to the Member States of destination and, where appropriate, not later than the time of transfer to the Member States of transit.\nArticle 13\nSecurity derogations\nBy way of derogation from Article 11(2), (4), (5) and (6) and from Article 12, a Member State, in the event of serious threats to, or attacks on, public security as a result of illicit possession or use of explosives or ammunition, may take all necessary measures concerning transfers of explosives or ammunition in order to prevent such illicit possession or use.\nThe measures referred to in the first paragraph shall respect the principle of proportionality. They shall constitute neither a means of arbitrary discrimination nor a veiled restriction in trade between Member States.\nEach Member State which adopts such measures shall notify the Commission of them forthwith. The Commission shall inform the other Member States thereof.\nArticle 14\nInformation exchange\n1.   Member States shall set up information exchange networks for the implementation of Articles 11 and 12. They shall notify the other Member States and the Commission of the national authorities responsible for forwarding or receiving information and for applying the procedures referred to in those Articles.\nMember States shall keep at the disposal of the other Member States and of the Commission updated information concerning economic operators possessing licences or authorisations referred to in Article 16.\n2.   For the purposes of implementing this Directive, Regulation (EC) No 515/97, in particular the requirements thereof relating to confidentiality, shall apply mutatis mutandis.\nArticle 15\nIdentification and traceability of explosives\n1.   Economic operators shall adhere to a uniform system for the unique identification and traceability of explosives, that takes into account their size, shape or design, except where it is not necessary to place a unique identification on the explosive due to its low level of hazard, based on its characteristics and factors such as its low detonative effects, its uses and the low security risk it presents due to the low potential effects of misuse.\nThe system shall not apply to explosives transported and delivered unpackaged or in pump trucks for their direct unloading into the blast-hole, or explosives manufactured at blasting sites, and that are loaded immediately after being produced (in situ production).\n2.   That system shall provide for the collection and storage of data, including where appropriate by electronic means, enabling the unique identification and traceability of the explosive as well as for the placement of a unique identification on the explosive and/or its packaging enabling access to that data. Those data shall relate to the unique identification of the explosive, including its location while in the possession of economic operators and the identity of those economic operators.\n3.   The data referred to in paragraph 2 shall be tested at regular intervals and protected against accidental or malicious damage or destruction. Those data shall be stored for 10 years after the transaction took place or, where the explosives have been used or disposed of, 10 years after their use or disposal, even if the economic operator has ceased trading. They shall be immediately available at the request of the competent authorities.\n4.   The Commission may adopt implementing acts:\n(a)\nlaying down the practical arrangements for the operation of the system of unique identification and traceability referred to in paragraph 1, taking into account the size, shape or design of the explosives, in particular the format and structure of the unique identification, as provided for in paragraph 2;\n(b)\nidentifying the cases referred to in paragraph 1 where it is not necessary, due to the low level of hazard of an explosive, for economic operators to adhere to the system for the unique identification and traceability within the meaning of that paragraph.\nThose implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 49(3).\nArticle 16\nLicence or authorisation\nEconomic operators shall be in possession of a licence or authorisation which entitles them to engage in the manufacture, storage, use, import, export, transfer or trade of explosives.\nThe first paragraph shall not apply to employees of an economic operator possessing a licence or authorisation.\nArticle 17\nLicensing of manufacturing activities\nWhen a Member State issues a licence or authorisation referred to in Article 16 for manufacturing of explosives, it shall check in particular that the economic operators responsible are capable of complying with the technical commitments they assume.\nArticle 18\nSeizures\nEach Member State shall adopt the necessary measures to enable the competent authorities to seize any explosive if there is sufficient evidence that that explosive will be illicitly acquired, used or dealt in.\nCHAPTER 4\nCONFORMITY OF THE EXPLOSIVE\nArticle 19\nPresumption of conformity of explosives\nExplosives, which are in conformity with harmonised standards or parts thereof the references of which have been published in the Official Journal of the European Union shall be presumed to be in conformity with the essential safety requirements set out in Annex II covered by those standards or parts thereof.\nArticle 20\nConformity assessment procedures\nFor the assessment of the conformity of explosives the manufacturer shall follow one of the following procedures referred to in Annex III:\n(a)\nEU-type examination (Module B) and, at the choice of the manufacturer, any of the following:\n(i)\nconformity to type based on internal production control plus supervised product checks at random intervals (Module C2);\n(ii)\nconformity to type based on quality assurance of the production process (Module D);\n(iii)\nconformity to type based on product quality assurance (Module E);\n(iv)\nconformity to type based on product verification (Module F);\n(b)\nconformity based on unit verification (Module G).\nArticle 21\nEU declaration of conformity\n1.   The EU declaration of conformity shall state that the fulfilment of the essential safety requirements set out in Annex II has been demonstrated.\n2.   The EU declaration of conformity shall have the model structure set out in Annex IV, shall contain the elements specified in the relevant modules set out in Annex III and shall be continuously updated. It shall be translated into the language or languages required by the Member State in which the explosive is placed or made available on the market.\n3.   Where an explosive is subject to more than one Union act requiring an EU declaration of conformity, a single EU declaration of conformity shall be drawn up in respect of all such Union acts. That declaration shall contain the identification of the Union acts concerned including their publication references.\n4.   By drawing up the EU declaration of conformity, the manufacturer shall assume responsibility for the compliance of the explosive with the requirements laid down in this Directive.\nArticle 22\nGeneral principles of the CE marking\nThe CE marking shall be subject to the general principles set out in Article 30 of Regulation (EC) No 765/2008.\nArticle 23\nRules and conditions for affixing the CE marking\n1.   The CE marking shall be affixed visibly, legibly and indelibly to the explosive. Where that is not possible or not warranted on account of the nature of the explosive, it shall be affixed to the packaging and to the accompanying documents.\n2.   The CE marking shall be affixed before the explosive is placed on the market.\n3.   The CE marking shall be followed by the identification number of the notified body, where that body is involved in the production control phase.\nThe identification number of the notified body shall be affixed by the body itself or, under its instructions, by the manufacturer or his authorised representative.\n4.   The CE marking and, where applicable, the identification number of the notified body may be followed by any other mark indicating a special risk or use.\n5.   In cases of explosives manufactured for own use, explosives transported and delivered unpackaged or in Mobile Explosives Manufacturing Units (MEMUs) for their direct unloading into the blast-hole, and explosives manufactured at the blasting sites which are loaded immediately after being produced (in situ production), the CE marking shall be affixed to the accompanying documents.\n6.   Member States shall build upon existing mechanisms to ensure correct application of the regime governing the CE marking and shall take appropriate action in the event of improper use of that marking.\nCHAPTER 5\nNOTIFICATION OF CONFORMITY ASSESSMENT BODIES\nArticle 24\nNotification\nMember States shall notify the Commission and the other Member States of bodies authorised to carry out third-party conformity assessment tasks under this Directive.\nArticle 25\nNotifying authorities\n1.

Notified bodies shall provide the other bodies notified under this Directive carrying out similar conformity assessment activities covering the same explosives with relevant information on issues relating to negative and, on request, positive conformity assessment results.\nArticle 39\nExchange of experience\nThe Commission shall provide for the organisation of exchange of experience between the Member Statesâ€™ national authorities responsible for notification policy.\nArticle 40\nCoordination of notified bodies\nThe Commission shall ensure that appropriate coordination and cooperation between bodies notified under this Directive are put in place and properly operated in the form of a sectoral group of notified bodies.\nMember States shall ensure that the bodies notified by them participate in the work of that group, directly or by means of designated representatives.\nCHAPTER 6\nUNION MARKET SURVEILLANCE, CONTROL OF EXPLOSIVES ENTERING THE UNION MARKET AND UNION SAFEGUARD PROCEDURE\nArticle 41\nUnion market surveillance and control of explosives entering the Union market\nArticles 16 to 29 of Regulation (EC) No 765/2008 shall apply to explosives.\nMember States shall take all appropriate measures to ensure that explosives may be placed on the market only if, when properly stored and used for their intended purpose, they do not endanger the health or safety of persons.\nArticle 42\nProcedure for dealing with explosives presenting a risk at national level\n1.   Where the market surveillance authorities of one Member State have sufficient reason to believe that an explosive presents a risk to the health or safety of persons, or to property or the environment, they shall carry out an evaluation in relation to the explosive concerned covering all relevant requirements laid down in this Directive. The relevant economic operators shall cooperate as necessary with the market surveillance authorities for that purpose.\nWhere, in the course of the evaluation referred to in the first subparagraph, the market surveillance authorities find that the explosive does not comply with the requirements laid down in this Directive, they shall without delay require the relevant economic operator to take all appropriate corrective actions to bring the explosive into compliance with those requirements, to withdraw the explosive from the market, or to recall it within a reasonable period, commensurate with the nature of the risk, as they may prescribe.\nThe market surveillance authorities shall inform the relevant notified body accordingly.\nArticle 21 of Regulation (EC) No 765/2008 shall apply to the measures referred to in the second subparagraph of this paragraph.\n2.   Where the market surveillance authorities consider that non-compliance is not restricted to their national territory, they shall inform the Commission and the other Member States of the results of the evaluation and of the actions which they have required the economic operator to take.\n3.   The economic operator shall ensure that all appropriate corrective action is taken in respect of all the explosives concerned that it has made available on the market throughout the Union.\n4.   Where the relevant economic operator does not take adequate corrective action within the period referred to in the second subparagraph of paragraph 1, the market surveillance authorities shall take all appropriate provisional measures to prohibit or restrict the explosiveâ€™s being made available on their national market, to withdraw the explosive from that market or to recall it.\nThe market surveillance authorities shall inform the Commission and the other Member States, without delay, of those measures.\n5.   The information referred to in the second subparagraph of paragraph 4 shall include all available details, in particular the data necessary for the identification of the non-compliant explosive, the origin of the explosive, the nature of the non-compliance alleged and the risk involved, the nature and duration of the national measures taken and the arguments put forward by the relevant economic operator. In particular, the market surveillance authorities shall indicate whether the non-compliance is due to either of the following:\n(a)\nfailure of the explosive to meet requirements relating to the health or safety of persons, or to the protection of property or the environment; or\n(b)\nshortcomings in the harmonised standards referred to in Article 19 conferring a presumption of conformity.\n6.   Member States other than the Member State initiating the procedure under this Article shall without delay inform the Commission and the other Member States of any measures adopted and of any additional information at their disposal relating to the non-compliance of the explosive concerned, and, in the event of disagreement with the adopted national measure, of their objections.\n7.   Where, within three months of receipt of the information referred to in the second subparagraph of paragraph 4, no objection has been raised by either a Member State or the Commission in respect of a provisional measure taken by a Member State, that measure shall be deemed justified.\n8.   Member States shall ensure that appropriate restrictive measures, such as withdrawal of the explosive from the market are taken in respect of the explosive concerned without delay.\nArticle 43\nUnion safeguard procedure\n1.   Where, on completion of the procedure set out in Article 42(3) and (4), objections are raised against a measure taken by a Member State, or where the Commission considers a national measure to be contrary to Union legislation, the Commission shall without delay enter into consultation with the Member States and the relevant economic operator or operators and shall evaluate the national measure. On the basis of the results of that evaluation, the Commission shall adopt an implementing act determining whether the national measure is justified or not.\nThe Commission shall address its decision to all Member States and shall immediately communicate it to them and the relevant economic operator or operators.\n2.   If the national measure is considered justified, all Member States shall take the necessary measures to ensure that the non-compliant explosive is withdrawn from their market, and shall inform the Commission accordingly. If the national measure is considered unjustified, the Member State concerned shall withdraw that measure.\n3.   Where the national measure is considered justified and the non-compliance of the explosive is attributed to shortcomings in the harmonised standards referred to in point (b) of Article 42(5) of this Directive, the Commission shall apply the procedure provided for in Article 11 of Regulation (EU) No 1025/2012.\nArticle 44\nCompliant explosives which present a risk\n1.   Where, having carried out an evaluation under Article 42(1), a Member State finds that although an explosive is in compliance with this Directive, it presents a risk to the health or safety of persons, or to property or the environment, it shall require the relevant economic operator to take all appropriate measures to ensure that the explosive concerned, when placed on the market, no longer presents that risk, to withdraw the explosive from the market or to recall it within a reasonable period, commensurate with the nature of the risk, as it may prescribe.\n2.   The economic operator shall ensure that corrective action is taken in respect of all the explosives concerned that he has made available on the market throughout the Union.\n3.   The Member State shall immediately inform the Commission and the other Member States. That information shall include all available details, in particular the data necessary for the identification of the explosive concerned, the origin and the supply chain of the explosive, the nature of the risk involved and the nature and duration of the national measures taken.\n4.   The Commission shall without delay enter into consultation with the Member States and the relevant economic operator or operators and shall evaluate the national measures taken. On the basis of the results of that evaluation, the Commission shall decide by means of implementing acts whether the national measure is justified or not, and where necessary, propose appropriate measures.\nThe implementing acts referred to in the first subparagraph of this paragraph shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 49(3).\nOn duly justified imperative grounds of urgency relating to the protection of health and safety of persons, or to the protection of property or the environment, the Commission shall adopt immediately applicable implementing acts in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 49(4).\n5.

These are: i) to establish a single EU market for trade in explosives for civil uses; ii) to harmonise their safety requirements at a high level of protection; iii) to set up an administrative system to supervise transfers of explosives and ammunition.\nACT\n                  \nDirective 2014/28/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 February 2014 on the harmonisation of the laws of the Member States relating to the making available on the market and supervision of explosives for civil uses (recast).\nSUMMARY\nWHAT DOES THIS DIRECTIVE DO?\n                     \nIt sets out rules for the placing on the market and supervision of explosives for civil uses in the EU. It does not apply to:\nexplosives intended for use by the armed forces or the police;\npyrotechnic articles; or\nammunition (subject to exceptions).\nKEY POINTS\n                     \nThe directive lays down manufacturersâ€™, importersâ€™ and distributorsâ€™ responsibilities with respect to the trade in commercial explosives.\nExplosives made available on the EU market must bear the CE conformity mark to show that they meet all essential safety requirements under EU law.\nTo obtain the CE mark, the manufacturer must carry out a conformity assessment, draw up detailed technical documentation for the products and make sure they are traceable.\nImporters must check whether manufacturers have carried out conformity assessments correctly and inform the national authority appointed to monitor safety if they believe the explosive represents a risk.\nAll necessary documentation must be recorded and kept for 10 years.\nDocumentation and safety information must be written in a language easily understood by end-users.\nManufacturers and importers must give their postal address on the explosive.\nDistributors must check that the explosive bears the CE mark and that it is accompanied by the required documents and by instructions written in a language easily understood by end-users in the country of destination. If they believe the explosives represent a risk, they must inform the national authority appointed to monitor safety accordingly.\nThe directive also:\nlays down requirements for the bodies carrying out conformity assessments, which must be independent and impartial;\nspecifies the steps to be taken by national market surveillance authorities to identify non-compliant products, prevent the import of dangerous products from non-EU countries and take all appropriate corrective action.\nWHEN DOES THE DIRECTIVE APPLY?\n                     \nThe directive will apply from 20 April 2016. It replaces Directive 93/15/EEC as of 20.4.2016.\nREFERENCES\nAct\nEntry into force\nDeadline for transposition in the Member States\nOfficial Journal\nDirective 2014/28/EU\n18.4.2014\n19.4.2016\nOJ L 96, 29.3.2014, pp. 1-44\nlast update 12.02.2015", "tags": ["approximation of laws", "market supervision", "safety standard", "technical standard", "market approval", "EC conformity marking", "explosive"], "subjects": ["Internal market - Principles", "Protocol on Ireland/Northern Ireland"], "split": "train", "reference_annotations": {"32014L0028_p3": {"text": "directive 93/15/eec as amended by the Regulations listed in Annex V, Part A, and directive 2004/57/ec are repealed with effect from 20 April 2016, without prejudice to the obligations of the Member States relating to the time-limits for the transposition into national law and the dates of application of the Directives set out in Annex V, Part B.", "triples": [" directive 2004/57/ec,  amended,  directive 93/15/eec"]}}, "summary_annotations": {}}
