{"celex_id": "32011H0442", "reference": "21.7.2011\nEN\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\nL 190/87\nCOMMISSION RECOMMENDATION\nof 18 July 2011\non access to a basic payment account\n(Text with EEA relevance)\n(2011/442/EU)\nTHE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 292 thereof,\nWhereas:\n(1)\nEnsuring that consumers have access to payment services in the European Union (hereinafter referred to as ‘the Union’) is essential to enable them to fully benefit from the Single Market and for the Single Market to function properly. At present, the availability of essential payment services is neither ensured by payment service providers nor guaranteed by all Member States in the Union.\n(2)\nExisting restrictive eligibility criteria imposed by payment service providers to open payment accounts, beyond what is required by law, may prevent full access to the right of freedom of movement of persons within the Union. Moreover, lack of access to payment accounts prevents consumers from accessing the mainstream financial services market and thereby weakens financial and social inclusion, often to the detriment of the most vulnerable part of the population. It also makes it more difficult for consumers to access essential goods and services. It is therefore necessary to establish principles on access to basic payment accounts which is a key element for promoting social inclusion and cohesion, in order to allow consumers to benefit as a minimum from a common set of essential payment services.\n(3)\nIt is important to ensure that principles on access to basic payment accounts are applied consistently throughout the Union. However, in order to be more effective, those principles would need to be implemented taking into account the variety of banking habits within the Union.\n(4)\nThis Recommendation sets out general principles applicable to the provision of basic payment accounts within the Union.\n(5)\nThis Recommendation should apply in conjunction with Directive 2007/64/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 November 2007 on payment services in the internal market (1). Accordingly, rules on the transparency of conditions and on information regarding payment services should apply to basic payment accounts.\n(6)\nThe provisions of this Recommendation should not prevent Member States or payment services providers from taking measures justified on legitimate grounds of public security and public order in conformity with Union law.\n(7)\nIn any Member State, consumers who are legally resident in the Union and who do not hold a payment account in that Member State should be in a position to open and use a basic payment account in that Member State. In order to ensure the widest possible access to basic payment accounts, Member States should ensure that consumers have access to such an account in spite of their financial circumstances, such as unemployment or personal bankruptcy. However, the right to access a basic payment account in any Member State should be granted in conformity with the requirements set out in Directive 2005/60/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 October 2005 on the prevention of the use of the financial system for the purpose of money laundering and terrorist financing (2), in particular with regard to customer due diligence procedures.\n(8)\nFurthermore this Recommendation should be without prejudice to the payment service provider’s obligation to terminate the basic payment account contract in exceptional circumstances under relevant Union or national legislation, such as legislation on money laundering and terrorist financing or on the prevention and investigation of crimes.\n(9)\nTo ensure the availability of basic payment accounts in light of their specific national circumstances, Member States should be able to designate, based on the principles of transparency, non-discrimination and proportionality, one, several or all payment service providers. The measures to be adopted by Member States in this respect should not create distortions of competition between payment service providers and should be based on the principles of transparency, non-discrimination and proportionality. In this context, Member States should make public the rights enjoyed by and the obligations placed on the providers that are responsible for providing basic payment accounts.\n(10)\nIn order to ensure transparency and fairness of treatment and in order to allow the consumer to question the payment service provider’s decision, the payment service provider should inform the consumer of the grounds and justification for his refusal of access to a basic payment account.\n(11)\nAccess to a core range of essential payment services should be guaranteed in any Member State. Services inseparably linked to basic payment accounts should include the facility to deposit and withdraw cash into and from the account. They should enable the consumer to make essential payment transactions such as receiving income or benefits, paying bills or taxes and purchasing goods and services, including via direct debit, credit transfer and the use of a payment card. In order to ensure the fullest financial inclusion possible, such services should allow the purchase of goods and services online where technically possible. They should also give the opportunity to the consumer to initiate payment orders via the payment service provider’s online banking facilities where technically possible. However a basic payment account should not allow the execution of payment orders where such payment orders would result in a negative balance on the account. Access to credit should not be considered as an automatic component of or a right attached to a basic payment account.\n(12)\nWhere the payment service provider charges the consumer for the opening, operating and closing of the account and for using the services that are inseparably associated to it as defined in this Recommendation, the total amount charged should be reasonable for the consumer and should be such that the consumer, in the light of specific national circumstances, is not prevented from opening the basic payment account and using its associated services. All additional charges to the consumer in the event of non-compliance with any of the terms laid down in the contract should also be reasonable.\n(13)\nIn order to ensure consistency and efficiency in the implementation of the principle of a reasonable charge, Member States should establish what constitutes a reasonable charge on the basis of the indicative criteria laid down in this Recommendation, which may be considered together.\n(14)\nMeasures to enhance consumers’ awareness of the availability of basic payment accounts are also necessary in order to promote financial inclusion. General, clear and comprehensible information should therefore be provided to consumers by Member States as well as by payment service providers on the main features and conditions of the use of such accounts as well as on the practical steps that the consumer should follow in exercising the right to open a basic payment account. The consumer should also be informed that the purchase of additional services is not compulsory to access a basic payment account.\n(15)\nCompliance with the provisions laid down in this Recommendation requires the processing of consumers’ personal data. Such processing is governed by Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data (3), notably its Articles 6, 7, 10, 11, 12 and 17 so as to ensure the fair and lawful processing and the respect of the fundamental right to protection of personal data, in particular with regard to the general requirements of necessity and proportionality, the data subject’s right of access to his own data, the rectification and erasure or blocking of inaccurate data, and its Article 28 regarding the monitoring of compliance with Directive 95/46/EC by independent public data protection authorities.\n(16)\nConsumers should have access to effective out-of-court complaint and redress procedures for the settlement of disputes arising from the principles set out in this Recommendation. Existing bodies and schemes, for instance those existing for the settlement of disputes concerning rights and obligations arising under Directive 2007/64/EC, may be used.\n(17)\nThe implementation of the principles laid down in this Recommendation should be reinforced through supervisory review at the national level. Competent authorities should be empowered to fulfil their monitoring duties efficiently.\n(18)\nMember States should have reliable annual statistics at least on the number of basic payment accounts opened, the number of refusals and terminations of basic payment accounts and the charges associated to basic payment accounts. To this end, Member States are invited to use any relevant sources of information. They should communicate this information to the Commission on an annual basis and for the first time by 1 July 2012 at the latest.\n(19)\nMember States should be invited to take the necessary measures to ensure the application of this Recommendation at the latest 6 months after its publication. Based on the reporting provided by Member States, the Commission will monitor and assess the measures taken by 1 July 2012. On the basis of this monitoring, the Commission will propose any necessary action, including legislative measures if needed, in order to ensure that the objectives of this Recommendation are fully met,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS RECOMMENDATION:\nSECTION I\nDefinitions\n1.\nFor the purposes of this Recommendation, the following definitions apply:\n(a)\n‘Consumer’ means any natural person who is acting for purposes other than his trade, business, craft or profession;\n(b)\n‘Payment service provider’ means the payment service provider(s) as defined in Article 4(9) of Directive 2007/64/EC, which is in charge of offering basic payment accounts pursuant to paragraph 3;\n(c)\n‘Payment account’ means an account held in the name of one consumer which is used for the execution of payment transactions;\n(d)\n‘Payment transaction’ means a payment transaction as defined in Article 4(5) of Directive 2007/64/EC;\n(e)\n‘Funds’ means funds as defined in Article 4(15) of Directive 2007/64/EC;\n(f)\n‘Contract’ means a framework contract as defined in Article 4(12) of Directive 2007/64/EC.\nSECTION II\nRight of access\n2.\nMember States should ensure that any consumer legally resident in the Union has the right to open and use a basic payment account with a payment service provider operating in their territory provided that the consumer does not already hold a payment account allowing him to make use of the payment services listed in paragraph 6 in their territory.
