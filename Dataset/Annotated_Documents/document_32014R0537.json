{"celex_id": "32014R0537", "reference": "27.5.2014\nEN\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\nL 158/77\nREGULATION (EU) No 537/2014 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL\nof 16 April 2014\non specific requirements regarding statutory audit of public-interest entities and repealing Commission Decision 2005/909/EC\n(Text with EEA relevance)\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 114 thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee (1),\nActing in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure (2),\nWhereas:\n(1)\nStatutory auditors and audit firms are entrusted by law to conduct statutory audits of public-interest entities with a view to enhancing the degree of confidence of the public in the annual and consolidated financial statements of such entities. The public-interest function of statutory audit means that a broad community of people and institutions rely on the quality of a statutory auditor's or an audit firm's work. Good audit quality contributes to the orderly functioning of markets by enhancing the integrity and efficiency of financial statements. Thus, statutory auditors fulfil a particularly important societal role.\n(2)\nUnion legislation requires that the financial statements, comprising annual financial statements or consolidated financial statements, of credit institutions, insurance undertakings, issuers of securities admitted to trading on a regulated market, payment institutions, undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities (UCITS), electronic money institutions and alternative investment funds be audited by one or more persons entitled to carry out such audits in accordance with Union law, namely: Article 1(1) of Council Directive 86/635/EEC (3), Article 1(1) of Council Directive 91/674/EEC (4), Article 4(4) of Directive 2004/109/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (5), Article 15(2) of Directive 2007/64/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (6), Article 73 of Directive 2009/65/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (7), Article 3(1) of Directive 2009/110/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (8), and Article 22(3) of Directive 2011/61/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council (9). Moreover, point (1) of Article 4(1) of Directive 2004/39/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (10) also requires that the annual financial statements of investment firms be audited when Directive 2013/34/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council (11) is not applicable.\n(3)\nThe conditions for the approval of the persons responsible for carrying out the statutory audit as well as the minimum requirements for carrying out such statutory audit are laid down in Directive 2006/43/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (12).\n(4)\nOn 13 October 2010 the Commission published a Green Paper entitled ‘Audit Policy: Lessons from the Crisis’, which launched a wide public consultation, in the general context of financial market regulatory reform, on the role and scope of audit and how the audit function could be enhanced in order to contribute to increased financial stability. That public consultation showed that the rules of Directive 2006/43/EC regarding the carrying out of the statutory audit of annual and consolidated financial statements of public-interest entities could be improved. The European Parliament issued an own-initiative report on the Green Paper on 13 September 2011. The European Economic and Social Committee also adopted a report on that Green Paper on 16 June 2011.\n(5)\nIt is important to lay down detailed rules with a view to ensuring that the statutory audits of public-interest entities are of adequate quality and are carried out by statutory auditors and audit firms subject to stringent requirements. A common regulatory approach should enhance the integrity, independence, objectivity, responsibility, transparency and reliability of statutory auditors and audit firms carrying out statutory audits of public-interest entities, contributing to the quality of statutory audits in the Union, thus to the smooth functioning of the internal market, while achieving a high level of consumer and investor protection. The development of a separate act for public-interest entities should also ensure consistent harmonisation and uniform application of the rules and thus contribute to a more effective functioning of the internal market. These strict requirements should be applicable to statutory auditors and audit firms only insofar as they carry out statutory audits of public-interest entities.\n(6)\nThe statutory audit of cooperatives and savings banks is characterised in some Member States by a system that does not allow them to choose their statutory auditor or audit firm freely. The audit association to which the cooperative or savings bank belongs as a member is obliged by law to carry out the statutory audit. Such audit associations act on a non-profit-making basis without pursuing commercial interests, as results from their legal nature. In addition, the organisational units of these associations are not associated with a common economic interest, which could jeopardise their independence. Accordingly, Member States should have the possibility to exempt cooperatives within the meaning of point (14) of Article 2 of Directive 2006/43/EC, savings banks or similar entities as referred to in Article 45 of Directive 86/635/EEC or their subsidiaries or legal successors from this Regulation provided that the principles of independence laid down in Directive 2006/43/EC are complied with.\n(7)\nThe level of fees received from one audited entity and the structure of fees can threaten the independence of a statutory auditor or an audit firm. Thus, it is important to ensure that audit fees are not based on any form of contingency and that, when the audit fees from a single client including its subsidiaries are significant, a specific procedure involving the audit committee is established to secure the quality of the audit. If the statutory auditor or the audit firm becomes excessively dependent on a single client, the audit committee should decide on the basis of proper grounds whether the statutory auditor or the audit firm may continue to carry out the statutory audit. When taking such decision, the audit committee should take into consideration, inter alia, the threats to independence and the consequences of such decision.\n(8)\nThe provision of certain services other than statutory audit (non-audit services) to audited entities by statutory auditors, audit firms or members of their networks may compromise their independence. Therefore, it is appropriate to prohibit the provision of certain non-audit services such as specific tax, consultancy and advisory services to the audited entity, to its parent undertaking and to its controlled undertakings within the Union. The services that involve playing any part in the management or decision-making of the audited entity might include working capital management, providing financial information, business process optimisation, cash management, transfer pricing, creating supply chain efficiency and the like. Services linked to the financing, capital structure and allocation, and investment strategy of the audited entity should be prohibited except the provision of services such as due diligence services, issuing comfort letters in connection with prospectuses issued by the audited entity and other assurance services.\n(9)\nIt should be possible for Member States to decide to allow the statutory auditors and the audit firms to provide certain tax and valuation services when such services are immaterial or have no direct effect, separately or in the aggregate, on the audited financial statements. Where such services involve aggressive tax planning, they should not be considered as immaterial. Accordingly, a statutory auditor or an audit firm should not provide such services to the audited entity. A statutory auditor or an audit firm should be able to provide non-audit services which are not prohibited under this Regulation, if the provision of those services has been approved in advance by the audit committee and if the statutory auditor or the audit firm has satisfied itself that provision of those services does not pose a threat to the independence of the statutory auditor or the audit firm that cannot be reduced to an acceptable level by the application of safeguards.\n(10)\nWith a view to avoiding conflicts of interest it is important that the statutory auditor or the audit firm, before accepting or continuing an engagement for a statutory audit of a public-interest entity, assess whether the independence requirements are met, and in particular whether any threats to independence arise as a result of the relationship with that entity. The statutory auditor or the audit firm should confirm its independence annually to the audit committee of the audited entity and should discuss with that committee any threat to its independence as well as the safeguards applied to mitigate those threats.\n(11)\nDirective 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (13) should govern the processing of personal data carried out in the Member States in the context of this Regulation and such processing of personal data should be subject to the supervision of the Member States' competent authorities, in particular the public independent authorities designated by the Member States. Any exchange or transmission of information by competent authorities should comply with the rules on the transfer of personal data as laid down in Directive 95/46/EC.\n(12)\nA sound engagement quality control review of the work carried out in each statutory audit engagement should be conducive to high audit quality. Therefore, the statutory auditor or the audit firm should not issue his, her or its audit report until such an engagement quality control review has been completed.\n(13)\nThe results of the statutory audit of a public-interest entity should be presented to the stakeholders in the audit report. In order to increase the confidence of stakeholders in the financial statements of the audited entity, it is particularly important that the audit report be well-founded and solidly substantiated. In addition to the information required to be provided under Article 28 of Directive 2006/43/EC, the audit report should in particular include sufficient information on the independence of the statutory auditor or the audit firm and on whether the statutory audit was considered capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud.\n(14)\nThe value of statutory audit for the audited entity would be particularly enhanced if the communication between the statutory auditor or the audit firm, on the one hand, and the audit committee, on the other hand, were reinforced. Further to the regular dialogue during the carrying out of the statutory audit, it is important that the statutory auditor or the audit firm submit to the audit committee an additional and more detailed report on the results of the statutory audit. This additional report should be submitted to the audit committee no later than the audit report. Upon request, the statutory auditor or the audit firm should discuss key matters which have been mentioned in the additional report with the audit committee. In addition, it should be possible to make such additional detailed report available to competent authorities responsible for the oversight of statutory auditors and audit firms upon their request, and to third parties where national law so provides.\n(15)\nStatutory auditors or audit firms already provide competent authorities supervising public-interest entities with information on facts or decisions which could constitute a breach of the rules governing the activities of the audited entity or an impairment of the continuous functioning of the audited entity. However, supervisory tasks would be facilitated if supervisors of credit institutions and insurance undertakings and their statutory auditors and audit firms were required to establish an effective dialogue with each other.\n(16)\nRegulation (EU) No 1092/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council (14) established the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB). The role of the ESRB is to monitor the build-up of systemic risk in the Union. Given the information that statutory auditors and audit firms of systemically important financial institutions have access to, their experience could help the ESRB in its work. Therefore an annual forum for dialogue between statutory auditors and audit firms, on the one hand, and ESRB, on the other, on a sectoral, anonymised basis should be facilitated by this Regulation.\n(17)\nIn order to increase the confidence in, and the liability of, the statutory auditors and the audit firms carrying out the statutory audit of public-interest entities, it is important that the transparency reporting by statutory auditors and audit firms be increased. Therefore, statutory auditors and audit firms should be required to disclose financial information, showing in particular their total turnover divided into audit fees paid by public-interest entities, audit fees paid by other entities and fees for other services. They should also disclose financial information at the level of the network to which they belong. Statutory auditors and audit firms should provide additional supplementary information on audit fees to competent authorities with a view to facilitating their supervisory tasks.\n(18)\nIt is important that the role of the audit committee in the selection of a new statutory auditor or audit firm be reinforced, in the interest of a more informed decision of the general meeting of shareholders or members of the audited entity. Hence, when making a proposal to the general meeting, the administrative or supervisory body should explain whether it follows the preference of the audit committee and, if not, why. The recommendation of the audit committee should include at least two possible choices for the audit engagement and a duly justified preference for one of them, so that a real choice can be made. In order to provide a fair and proper justification in its recommendation, the audit committee should use the results of a mandatory selection procedure organised by the audited entity, under the responsibility of the audit committee. In such selection procedure, the audited entity should not restrict statutory auditors or audit firms with a low market share from presenting proposals for the audit engagement. Tender documents should contain transparent and non-discriminatory selection criteria to be used for the evaluation of proposals. Considering, however, that this selection procedure could entail disproportionate costs for undertakings with reduced market capitalisation or small and medium-sized public-interest entities having regard to their size, it is appropriate to relieve such undertakings and entities from the obligation of organising a procedure for the selection of a new statutory auditor or audit firm.\n(19)\nThe right of the general meeting of shareholders or members of the audited entity to choose the statutory auditor or the audit firm would be of no value if the audited entity were to enter into a contract with a third party providing for a restriction of such choice. Therefore, any clause of a contract entered into by the audited entity with a third party regarding the appointment or restricting the choice to particular statutory auditors or audit firms should be considered null and void.\n(20)\nThe appointment of more than one statutory auditor or audit firm by public-interest entities would reinforce the professional scepticism and help to increase audit quality. Also, this measure, combined with the presence of smaller audit firms in the audit market would facilitate the development of the capacity of such firms, thus broadening the choice of statutory auditors and audit firms for public-interest entities. Therefore, the latter should be encouraged and incentivised to appoint more than one statutory auditor or audit firm to carry out the statutory audit.\n(21)\nIn order to address the familiarity threat and therefore reinforce the independence of statutory auditors and audit firms, it is important to establish a maximum duration of the audit engagement of a statutory auditor or an audit firm in a particular audited entity. In addition, as a means of strengthening the independence of the statutory auditor or the audit firm, reinforcing professional scepticism, and increasing audit quality, this Regulation provides for the following alternatives for an extension of the maximum duration: regular and open mandatory retendering or the appointment of more than one statutory auditor or audit firm by public-interest entities. Also, the involvement of smaller audit firms in these measures would facilitate the development of the capacity of such firms, thus broadening the choice of statutory auditors and audit firms for public-interest entities. An appropriate gradual rotation mechanism should also be established with regard to the key audit partners carrying out the statutory audit on behalf of the audit firm. It is also important to provide for an appropriate period within which such statutory auditor or audit firm may not carry out the statutory audit of the same entity. In order to ensure a smooth transition, the former statutory auditor should transfer a handover file with relevant information to the incoming statutory auditor.\n(22)\nIn order to ensure a high level of investor and consumer confidence in the internal market by avoiding conflicts of interests, statutory auditors and audit firms should be subject to appropriate oversight by competent authorities which are independent from the audit profession and which have adequate capacity, expertise and resources. Member States should be able to delegate or allow their competent authorities to delegate any of the tasks of those competent authorities to other authorities or bodies except those related to the quality assurance system, investigations and disciplinary systems. However, Member States should be able to choose to delegate tasks related to disciplinary systems to other authorities and bodies provided that the majority of the persons involved in the governance of the authority or body concerned are independent from the audit profession. The national competent authorities should have the necessary powers to undertake their supervisory tasks, including the capacity to access data, obtain information and carry out inspections. They should specialise in the supervision of financial markets, in the compliance with financial reporting obligations or in statutory audit oversight. However, it should be possible for the supervision of the compliance with the obligations imposed on public-interest entities to be carried out by the competent authorities responsible for the supervision of those entities. The funding of the competent authorities should be free from any undue influence by statutory auditors or audit firms.\n(23)\nThe quality of supervision should improve if there is effective cooperation between authorities charged with different tasks at national level. Therefore, the authorities competent to supervise compliance with the obligations regarding statutory audit of public-interest entities should cooperate with the authorities responsible for the tasks provided for in Directive 2006/43/EC, with those supervising public-interest entities and with the financial intelligence units referred to in Directive 2005/60/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (15).\n(24)\nExternal quality assurance for the statutory audit is fundamental for high quality audit. It adds credibility to published financial information and provides better protection for shareholders, investors, creditors and other interested parties. Statutory auditors and audit firms should therefore be subject to a system of quality assurance under the responsibility of the competent authorities, thus ensuring objectivity and independence from the audit profession. Quality assurance reviews should be organised in such a manner that each statutory auditor or each audit firm carrying out audits of public-interest entities is subject to a quality assurance review on the basis of an analysis of the risks. In the case of statutory auditors and audit firms carrying out statutory audits of public-interest entities other than those defined in points (17) and (18) of Article 2 of Directive 2006/43/EC, that review should take place at least every three years and, in other cases, at least every six years. The Commission Recommendation of 6 May 2008 on external quality assurance for statutory auditors and audit firms auditing public-interest entities (16) provides information on how inspections should be undertaken. Quality assurance reviews should be appropriate and proportionate in view of the scale and complexity of the business of the reviewed statutory auditor or audit firm.\n(25)\nThe market for the provision of statutory audit services to public-interest entities evolves over time. It is therefore necessary that competent authorities monitor the developments in the market, particularly as regards the risks that arise from high market concentration, including within specific sectors, and the performance of audit committees.\n(26)\nThe transparency of the activities of competent authorities should help to increase the confidence of investors and consumers in the internal market. Therefore, competent authorities should be required to report regularly on their activities and to publish information in aggregated form on findings and conclusions of inspections, or in individual form where Member States so provide.\n(27)\nCooperation between the competent authorities of the Member States can make an important contribution to ensuring consistently high quality of statutory audit in the Union. Therefore, the competent authorities of the Member States should cooperate with each other, where necessary, for the purpose of carrying out their supervisory duties regarding statutory audits. They should respect the principle of home-country regulation and oversight by the Member State in which the statutory auditor or the audit firm is approved and in which the audited entity has its registered office. The cooperation between competent authorities should be organised within the framework of a Committee of European Auditing Oversight Bodies (CEAOB), which should be composed of high-level representatives of the competent authorities. In order to enhance consistent application of this Regulation, the CEAOB should be able to adopt non-binding guidelines or opinions. In addition, it should facilitate the exchange of information, provide advice to the Commission and contribute to technical assessments and technical examinations.\nFor the purpose of carrying out the technical assessment of public oversight systems of third countries and to the international cooperation between Member States and third countries in this area, the CEAOB should establish a sub-group chaired by the member appointed by the European Supervisory Authority (European Securities and Markets Authority — ESMA) (17) and should request the assistance from ESMA, the European Supervisory Authority (European Banking Authority — EBA) (18) or the European Supervisory Authority (European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority — EIOPA) (19) insofar as its request is related to the international cooperation between Member States and third countries in the field of statutory audit of public-interest entities supervised by these European Supervisory Authorities. The Secretariat of the CEAOB should be provided by the Commission and, based on the work programme agreed by the CEAOB, should include related expenses in its estimates for the next year.\n(28)\nThe scope of cooperation between the competent authorities of Member States should include cooperation with regard to quality assurance reviews and assistance with investigations related to the carrying-out of statutory audits of public-interest entities, including in cases where the conduct under investigation does not constitute an infringement of any legislative or regulatory provision in force in the Member States concerned. The detailed arrangements for cooperation between the competent authorities of the Member States should include the possibility of creating colleges of competent authorities and the delegation of tasks among themselves. The concept of a network in which statutory auditors and audit firms operate should be taken into account in such cooperation. Competent authorities should respect appropriate confidentiality and professional secrecy rules.\n(29)\nThe interrelation of capital markets gives rise to the need to empower competent authorities to cooperate with supervisory authorities and bodies of third countries regarding the exchange of information or quality assurance reviews. However, where the cooperation with third country authorities is related to audit working papers or other documents held by statutory auditors or audit firms, the procedures laid down by Directive 2006/43/EC should apply.\n(30)\nSustainable audit capacity and a competitive market for statutory audit services in which there is a sufficient choice of statutory auditors and audit firms capable of carrying out statutory audits of public-interest entities are required in order to ensure a smooth functioning of capital markets. The competent authorities and the European Competition Network (ECN) should report on the changes brought in the audit market structure introduced by this Regulation.\n(31)\nThe alignment of the procedures for the adoption of delegated acts by the Commission to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union and, in particular, to Article 290 and 291 thereof, should be effected on a case-by-case basis. In order to take into account the developments in auditing and in the audit profession, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union should be delegated to the Commission. In particular, delegated acts are necessary for the purpose of adopting international auditing standards in the area of audit practice, independence of and internal controls of statutory auditors and audit firms. The international auditing standards adopted should not amend any requirements of this Regulation or supplement any of those requirements, except for those precisely defined. It is of particular importance that the Commission carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including consultations at expert level.\nThe Commission, when preparing and drawing up delegated acts, should ensure a simultaneous, timely and appropriate transmission of relevant documents to the European Parliament and to the Council.\n(32)\nIn order to ensure legal certainty and the smooth transition to the regime introduced by this Regulation, it is important to introduce a transitional period regarding the entry into force of the obligation to rotate statutory auditors and audit firms and the obligation to organise a selection procedure for the choice of statutory auditors and audit firms.\n(33)\nReferences to provisions of Directive 2006/43/EC should be understood as references to the national provisions transposing those provisions of Directive 2006/43/EC. The new European audit framework as established by this Regulation and Directive 2014/56/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council (20) replaces existing requirements laid down in Directive 2006/43/EC and should be interpreted without referring to any preceding instruments such as Commission recommendations adopted under the previous framework.\n(34)\nSince the objectives of this Regulation, namely clarifying and better defining the role of statutory audit regarding public-interest entities, improving the information that the statutory auditor or the audit firm provides to the audited entity, investors and other stakeholders, improving the communication channels between auditors and supervisors of public-interest entities, preventing any conflict of interest arising from the provision of non-audit services to public-interest entities, mitigating the risk of any potential conflict of interest due to the existing system whereby the auditee selects and pays the auditor or the familiarity threat, facilitating the switching of, and the choice of a statutory auditor or an audit firm to public-interest entities, broadening the choice of statutory auditors and audit firms for public-interest entities and improving the effectiveness, independence and consistency of the regulation and oversight of statutory auditors and audit firms providing statutory audits to public-interest entities including as regards cooperation at Union level, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States but can rather, by reason of their scale, be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives.\n(35)\nThis Regulation respects the fundamental rights and observes the principles recognised in particular by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, notably the right to respect for private and family life, the right to the protection of personal data, and the freedom to conduct a business, and has to be applied in accordance with those rights and principles.\n(36)\nThe European Data Protection Supervisor was consulted in accordance with Article 28(2) of Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council and delivered an opinion on 23 April 2012 (21).\n(37)\nA new legal framework of statutory audit of annual and consolidated financial statements should be established by this Regulation and Directive 2014/56/EU, therefore Commission Decision 2005/909/EC (22) should be repealed,\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nTITLE I\nSUBJECT MATTER, SCOPE AND DEFINITIONS\nArticle 1\nSubject matter\nThis Regulation lays down requirements for the carrying out of the statutory audit of annual and consolidated financial statements of public-interest entities, rules on the organisation and selection of statutory auditors and audit firms by public-interest entities to promote their independence and the avoidance of conflicts of interest and rules on the supervision of compliance by statutory auditors and audit firms with those requirements.\nArticle 2\nScope\n1.   This Regulation shall apply to the following:\n(a)\nstatutory auditors and audit firms carrying out statutory audits of public-interest entities;\n(b)\npublic-interest entities.\n2.   This Regulation shall apply without prejudice to Directive 2006/43/EC.\n3.   Where a cooperative within the meaning of point (14) of Article 2 of Directive 2006/43/EC, a savings bank or a similar entity as referred to in Article 45 of Directive 86/635/EEC, or a subsidiary or a legal successor of a cooperative, a savings bank or a similar entity as referred to in Article 45 of Directive 86/635/EEC is required or permitted under national provisions to be a member of a non-profit-making auditing entity, the Member State may decide that this Regulation or certain provisions of it shall not apply to the statutory audit of such entity, provided that the principles of independence laid down in Directive 2006/43/EC are complied with by the statutory auditor when carrying out the statutory audit of one of its members and by persons who may be in a position to influence the statutory audit.\n4.   Where a cooperative within the meaning of point (14) of Article 2 of Directive 2006/43/EC, a savings bank or a similar entity as referred to in Article 45 of Directive 86/635/EEC, or a subsidiary or a legal successor of a cooperative, a savings bank or a similar entity as referred to in Article 45 of Directive 86/635/EEC is required or permitted under national provisions to be a member of a non-profit-making auditing entity, an objective, reasonable and informed party would not conclude that the membership-based relationship compromises the statutory auditor's independence, provided that when such an auditing entity is conducting a statutory audit of one of its members, the principles of independence are applied to the statutory auditors carrying out the audit and those persons who may be in a position to influence the statutory audit.\n5.   The Member State shall inform the Commission and the Committee of European Auditing Oversight Bodies (hereinafter referred to as ‘the CEAOB’), referred to in Article 30, of such exceptional situations of non-application of this Regulation or certain provisions of this Regulation. It shall communicate to the Commission and the CEAOB the list of provisions of this Regulation that do not apply to the statutory audit of the entities referred to in paragraph 3 of this Article and the reasons that justified such non-application.\nArticle 3\nDefinitions\nFor the purposes of this Regulation, the definitions laid down in Article 2 of Directive 2006/43/EC shall apply, except as regards the term ‘competent authority’ as provided for in Article 20 of this Regulation.\nTITLE II\nCONDITIONS FOR CARRYING OUT STATUTORY AUDIT OF PUBLIC INTEREST ENTITIES\nArticle 4\nAudit fees\n1.   Fees for the provision of statutory audits to public-interest entities shall not be contingent fees.\nWithout prejudice to Article 25 of Directive 2006/43/EC, for the purposes of the first subparagraph, contingent fees means fees for audit engagements calculated on a predetermined basis relating to the outcome or result of a transaction or the result of the work performed. Fees shall not be regarded as being contingent if a court or a competent authority has established them.\n2.   When the statutory auditor or the audit firm provides to the audited entity, its parent undertaking or its controlled undertakings, for a period of three or more consecutive financial years, non-audit services other than those referred to in Article 5(1) of this Regulation, the total fees for such services shall be limited to no more than 70 % of the average of the fees paid in the last three consecutive financial years for the statutory audit(s) of the audited entity and, where applicable, of its parent undertaking, of its controlled undertakings and of the consolidated financial statements of that group of undertakings.\nFor the purposes of the limits specified in the first subparagraph, non-audit services, other than those referred to in Article 5(1), required by Union or national legislation shall be excluded.\nMember States may provide that a competent authority may, upon a request by the statutory auditor or the audit firm, on an exceptional basis, allow that statutory auditor or audit firm to be exempt from the requirements in the first subparagraph in respect of an audited entity for a period not exceeding two financial years.\n3.   When the total fees received from a public-interest entity in each of the last three consecutive financial years are more than 15 % of the total fees received by the statutory auditor or the audit firm or, where applicable, by the group auditor carrying out the statutory audit, in each of those financial years, such a statutory auditor or audit firm or, as the case may be, group auditor, shall disclose that fact to the audit committee and discuss with the audit committee the threats to their independence and the safeguards applied to mitigate those threats. The audit committee shall consider whether the audit engagement should be subject to an engagement quality control review by another statutory auditor or audit firm prior to the issuance of the audit report.\nWhere the fees received from such a public-interest entity continue to exceed 15 % of the total fees received by such a statutory auditor or audit firm or, as the case may be, by a group auditor carrying out the statutory audit, the audit committee shall decide on the basis of objective grounds whether the statutory auditor or the audit firm or the group auditor, of such an entity or group of entities may continue to carry out the statutory audit for an additional period which shall not, in any case, exceed two years.\n4.   Member States may apply more stringent requirements than set out in this Article.\nArticle 5\nProhibition of the provision of non-audit services\n1.   A statutory auditor or an audit firm carrying out the statutory audit of a public-interest entity, or any member of the network to which the statutory auditor or the audit firm belongs, shall not directly or indirectly provide to the audited entity, to its parent undertaking or to its controlled undertakings within the Union any prohibited non-audit services in:\n(a)\nthe period between the beginning of the period audited and the issuing of the audit report; and\n(b)\nthe financial year immediately preceding the period referred to in point (a) in relation to the services listed in point (g) of the second subparagraph.\nFor the purposes of this Article, prohibited non-audit services shall mean:\n(a)\ntax services relating to:\n(i)\npreparation of tax forms;\n(ii)\npayroll tax;\n(iii)\ncustoms duties;\n(iv)\nidentification of public subsidies and tax incentives unless support from the statutory auditor or the audit firm in respect of such services is required by law;\n(v)\nsupport regarding tax inspections by tax authorities unless support from the statutory auditor or the audit firm in respect of such inspections is required by law;\n(vi)\ncalculation of direct and indirect tax and deferred tax;\n(vii)\nprovision of tax advice;\n(b)\nservices that involve playing any part in the management or decision-making of the audited entity;\n(c)\nbookkeeping and preparing accounting records and financial statements;\n(d)\npayroll services;\n(e)\ndesigning and implementing internal control or risk management procedures related to the preparation and/or control of financial information or designing and implementing financial information technology systems;\n(f)\nvaluation services, including valuations performed in connection with actuarial services or litigation support services;\n(g)\nlegal services, with respect to:\n(i)\nthe provision of general counsel;\n(ii)\nnegotiating on behalf of the audited entity; and\n(iii)\nacting in an advocacy role in the resolution of litigation;\n(h)\nservices related to the audited entity's internal audit function;\n(i)\nservices linked to the financing, capital structure and allocation, and investment strategy of the audited entity, except providing assurance services in relation to the financial statements, such as the issuing of comfort letters in connection with prospectuses issued by the audited entity;\n(j)\npromoting, dealing in, or underwriting shares in the audited entity;\n(k)\nhuman resources services, with respect to:\n(i)\nmanagement in a position to exert significant influence over the preparation of the accounting records or financial statements which are the subject of the statutory audit, where such services involve:\n—\nsearching for or seeking out candidates for such position; or\n—\nundertaking reference checks of candidates for such positions;\n(ii)\nstructuring the organisation design; and\n(iii)\ncost control.\n2.   Member States may prohibit services other than those listed in paragraph 1 where they consider that those services represent a threat to independence. Member States shall communicate to the Commission any additions to the list in paragraph 1.\n3.   By way of derogation from the second subparagraph of paragraph 1, Member States may allow the provision of the services referred to in points (a) (i), (a) (iv) to (a) (vii) and (f), provided that the following requirements are complied with:\n(a)\nthey have no direct or have immaterial effect, separately or in the aggregate on the audited financial statements;\n(b)\nthe estimation of the effect on the audited financial statements is comprehensively documented and explained in the additional report to the audit committee referred to in Article 11; and\n(c)\nthe principles of independence laid down in Directive 2006/43/EC are complied with by the statutory auditor or the audit firm.\n4.   A statutory auditor or an audit firm carrying out statutory audits of public-interest entities and, where the statutory auditor or the audit firm belongs to a network, any member of such network, may provide to the audited entity, to its parent undertaking or to its controlled undertakings non-audit services other than the prohibited non-audit services referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 subject to the approval of the audit committee after it has properly assessed threats to independence and the safeguards applied in accordance with Article 22b of Directive 2006/43/EC. The audit committee shall, where applicable, issue guidelines with regard to the services referred to in paragraph 3.\nMember States may establish stricter rules setting out the conditions under which a statutory auditor, an audit firm or a member of a network to which the statutory auditor or audit firm belongs may provide to the audited entity, to its parent undertaking or to its controlled undertakings non-audit services other than the prohibited non-audit services referred to in paragraph 1.\n5.   When a member of a network to which the statutory auditor or the audit firm carrying out a statutory audit of a public-interest entity belongs provides any of the non-audit services, referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Article, to an undertaking incorporated in a third country which is controlled by the audited public-interest entity, the statutory auditor or the audit firm concerned shall assess whether his, her or its independence would be compromised by such provision of services by the member of the network.\nIf his, her or its independence is affected, the statutory auditor or the audit firm shall apply safeguards where applicable in order to mitigate the threats caused by such provision of services in a third country. The statutory auditor or the audit firm may continue to carry out the statutory audit of the public-interest entity only if he, she or it can justify, in accordance with Article 6 of this Regulation and Article 22b of Directive 2006/43/EC, that such provision of services does not affect his, her or its professional judgement and the audit report.\nFor the purposes of this paragraph:\n(a)\nbeing involved in the decision-taking of the audited entity and the provision of the services referred to in points (b), (c) and (e) of the second subparagraph of paragraph 1 shall be deemed to affect such independence in all cases and to be incapable of mitigation by any safeguards.\n(b)\nprovision of the services referred to in the second subparagraph of paragraph 1 other than points (b), (c) and (e) thereof shall be deemed to affect such independence and therefore to require safeguards to mitigate the threats caused thereby.\nArticle 6\nPreparation for the statutory audit and assessment of threats to independence\n1.   Before accepting or continuing an engagement for a statutory audit of a public- interest entity, a statutory auditor or an audit firm shall assess and document, in addition to the provisions of Article 22b of Directive 2006/43/EC, the following:\n(a)\nwhether he, she or it complies with the requirements of Articles 4 and 5 of this Regulation;\n(b)\nwhether the conditions of Article 17 of this Regulation are complied with;\n(c)\nwithout prejudice to Directive 2005/60/EC, the integrity of the members of the supervisory, administrative and management bodies of the public-interest entity.\n2.   A statutory auditor or an audit firm shall:\n(a)\nconfirm annually in writing to the audit committee that the statutory auditor, the audit firm and partners, senior managers and managers, conducting the statutory audit are independent from the audited entity;\n(b)\ndiscuss with the audit committee the threats to their independence and the safeguards applied to mitigate those threats, as documented by them pursuant to paragraph 1.\nArticle 7\nIrregularities\nWithout prejudice to Article 12 of this Regulation and Directive 2005/60/EC, when a statutory auditor or an audit firm carrying out the statutory audit of a public-interest entity suspects or has reasonable grounds to suspect that irregularities, including fraud with regard to the financial statements of the audited entity, may occur or have occurred, he, she or it shall inform the audited entity and invite it to investigate the matter and take appropriate measures to deal with such irregularities and to prevent any recurrence of such irregularities in the future.\nWhere the audited entity does not investigate the matter, the statutory auditor or the audit firm shall inform the authorities as designated by the Member States responsible for investigating such irregularities.\nThe disclosure in good faith to those authorities, by the statutory auditor or the audit firm, of any irregularities referred to in the first subparagraph shall not constitute a breach of any contractual or legal restriction on disclosure of information.\nArticle 8\nEngagement quality control review\n1.   Before the reports referred to in Articles 10 and 11 are issued, an engagement quality control review (in this Article hereinafter referred to as: review) shall be performed to assess whether the statutory auditor or the key audit partner could reasonably have come to the opinion and conclusions expressed in the draft of these reports.\n2.   The review shall be performed by an engagement quality control reviewer (in this Article hereinafter referred to as: reviewer). The reviewer shall be a statutory auditor who is not involved in the performance of the statutory audit to which the review relates.\n3.   By way of derogation from paragraph 2, where the statutory audit is carried out by an audit firm and all the statutory auditors were involved in the carrying-out of the statutory audit, or where the statutory audit is carried out by a statutory auditor and the statutory auditor is not a partner or employee of an audit firm, he, she or it shall arrange for another statutory auditor to perform a review. The disclosure of documents or information to the independent reviewer for the purposes of this Article shall not constitute a breach of professional secrecy. Documents or information disclosed to the reviewer for the purposes of this Article shall be subject to professional secrecy.\n4.   When performing the review, the reviewer shall record at least the following:\n(a)\nthe oral and written information provided by the statutory auditor or the key audit partner to support the significant judgements as well as the main findings of the audit procedures carried out and the conclusions drawn from those findings, whether or not at the request of the reviewer;\n(b)\nthe opinions of the statutory auditor or the key audit partner, as expressed in the draft of the reports referred to in Articles 10 and 11;\n5.   The review shall at least assess the following elements:\n(a)\nthe independence of the statutory auditor or the audit firm from the audited entity;\n(b)\nthe significant risks which are relevant to the statutory audit and which the statutory auditor or the key audit partner has identified during the performance of the statutory audit and the measures that he or she has taken to adequately manage those risks;\n(c)\nthe reasoning of the statutory auditor or the key audit partner, in particular with regard to the level of materiality and the significant risks referred to in point (b);\n(d)\nany request for advice to external experts and the implementation of such advice;\n(e)\nthe nature and scope of the corrected and uncorrected misstatements in the financial statements that were identified during the carrying out of the audit;\n(f)\nthe subjects discussed with the audit committee and the management and/or supervisory bodies of the audited entity;\n(g)\nthe subjects discussed with competent authorities and, where applicable, with other third parties;\n(h)\nwhether the documents and information selected from the file by the reviewer support the opinion of the statutory auditor or the key audit partner as expressed in the draft of the reports referred to in Articles 10 and 11.\n6.   The reviewer shall discuss the results of the review with the statutory auditor or the key audit partner. The audit firm shall establish procedures for determining the manner in which any disagreement between the key audit partner and the reviewer are to be resolved.\n7.   The statutory auditor or the audit firm and the reviewer shall keep a record of the results of the review, together with the considerations underlying those results.\nArticle 9\nInternational auditing standards\nThe Commission shall be empowered to adopt by means of delegated acts in accordance with Article 39 the international auditing standards referred to in Article 26 of Directive 2006/43/EC in the area of audit practice, and the independence and internal quality controls of statutory auditors and audit firms for the purposes of their application within the Union, provided they meet the requirements of points (a), (b) and (c) of Article 26(3) of Directive 2006/43/EC and do not amend any of the requirements of this Regulation or supplement any of its requirements apart from those set out in Articles 7, 8 and 18 of this Regulation.\nArticle 10\nAudit report\n1.   The statutory auditor(s) or the audit firm(s) shall present the results of the statutory audit of the public-interest entity in an audit report.\n2.

Except as required by point (e) of paragraph 2 the audit report shall not contain any cross-references to the additional report to the audit committee referred to in Article 11. The audit report shall be in clear and unambiguous language.\n4.   The statutory auditor or the audit firm shall not use the name of any competent authority in a way that would indicate or suggest endorsement or approval by that authority of the audit report.\nArticle 11\nAdditional report to the audit committee\n1.   Statutory auditors or audit firms carrying out statutory audits of public-interest entities shall submit an additional report to the audit committee of the audited entity not later than the date of submission of the audit report referred to in Article 10. Member States may additionally require that this additional report be submitted to the administrative or supervisory body of the audited entity.\nIf the audited entity does not have an audit committee, the additional report shall be submitted to the body performing equivalent functions within the audited entity. Member States may allow the audit committee to disclose that additional report to such third parties as are provided for in their national law.\n2.

The disclosure in good faith to the competent authorities or to ESRB and the CEAOB, by the statutory auditor or the audit firm or network, where applicable, of any information referred to in paragraph 1 or of any information emerging during the dialogue provided for in paragraph 2 shall not constitute a breach of any contractual or legal restriction on disclosure of information.\nArticle 13\nTransparency report\n1.

In that event, paragraphs 2 to 5 of this Article shall not apply.\n2.   The audit committee shall submit a recommendation to the administrative or supervisory body of the audited entity for the appointment of statutory auditors or audit firms.\nUnless it concerns the renewal of an audit engagement in accordance with Article 17(1) and 17(2), the recommendation shall be justified and contain at least two choices for the audit engagement and the audit committee shall express a duly justified preference for one of them.\nIn its recommendation, the audit committee shall state that its recommendation is free from influence by a third party and that no clause of the kind referred to in paragraph 6 has been imposed upon it.\n3.   Unless it concerns the renewal of an audit engagement in accordance with Article 17(1) and 17(2), the recommendation of the audit committee referred to in paragraph 2 of this Article shall be prepared following a selection procedure organised by the audited entity respecting the following criteria:\n(a)\nthe audited entity shall be free to invite any statutory auditors or audit firms to submit proposals for the provision of the statutory audit service on the condition that Article 17(3) is respected and that the organisation of the tender process does not in any way preclude the participation in the selection procedure of firms which received less than 15 % of the total audit fees from public-interest entities in the Member State concerned in the previous calendar year;\n(b)\nthe audited entity shall prepare tender documents for the attention of the invited statutory auditors or audit firms. Those tender documents shall allow them to understand the business of the audited entity and the type of statutory audit that is to be carried out.

The audited entity shall prepare a report on the conclusions of the selection procedure, which shall be validated by the audit committee.

The competent authority shall use the information provided by statutory auditors and audit firms pursuant to Article 14 to make the relevant calculations.\n4.   Public-interest entities which meet the criteria set out in points (f) and (t) of Article 2(1) of Directive 2003/71/EC shall not be required to apply the selection procedure referred to in paragraph 3.\n5.   The proposal to the general meeting of shareholders or members of the audited entity for the appointment of statutory auditors or audit firms shall include the recommendation and preference referred to in paragraph 2 made by the audit committee or the body performing equivalent functions.\nIf the proposal departs from the preference of the audit committee, the proposal shall justify the reasons for not following the recommendation of the audit committee. However, the statutory auditor or audit firm recommended by the administrative or supervisory body must have participated in the selection procedure described in paragraph 3. This subparagraph shall not apply where the audit committee's functions are performed by the administrative or supervisory body.\n6.   Any clause of a contract entered into between a public-interest entity and a third party restricting the choice by the general meeting of shareholders or members of that entity, as referred to in Article 37 of Directive 2006/43/EC to certain categories or lists of statutory auditors or audit firms, as regards the appointment of a particular statutory auditor or audit firm to carry out the statutory audit of that entity shall be null and void.\nThe public-interest entity shall inform the competent authorities referred to in Article 20 directly and without delay of any attempt by a third party to impose such a contractual clause or to otherwise improperly influence the decision of the general meeting of shareholders or members on the selection of a statutory auditor or an audit firm.\n7.   Member States may decide that a minimum number of statutory auditors or audit firms are to be appointed by public-interest entities in certain circumstances and establish the conditions governing the relations between the statutory auditors or audit firms appointed.\nIf a Member State establishes any such requirement, it shall inform the Commission and the relevant European Supervisory Authority thereof.\n8.   Where the audited entity has a nomination committee in which shareholders or members have a considerable influence and which has the task of making recommendations on the selecting of auditors, Member States may allow that nomination committee to perform the functions of the audit committee that are laid down in this Article and require it to submit the recommendation referred to in paragraph 2 to the general meeting of shareholders or members.\nArticle 17\nDuration of the audit engagement\n1.   A public-interest entity shall appoint a statutory auditor or an audit firm for an initial engagement of at least one year. The engagement may be renewed.\nNeither the initial engagement of a particular statutory auditor or audit firm, nor this in combination with any renewed engagements therewith shall exceed a maximum duration of 10 years.\n2.   By way of derogation from paragraph 1, Member States may\n(a)\nrequire that the initial engagement referred to in paragraph 1 be for a period of more than one year;\n(b)\nset a maximum duration of less than 10 years for the engagements referred to in the second subparagraph of paragraph 1.\n3.   After the expiry of the maximum durations of engagements referred to in the second subparagraph of paragraph 1, or in point (b) of paragraph 2, or after the expiry of the durations of engagements extended in accordance with paragraphs 4 or 6, neither the statutory auditor or the audit firm nor, where applicable, any members of their networks within the Union shall undertake the statutory audit of the same public-interest entity within the following four-year period.\n4.   By way of derogation from paragraph 1 and point (b) of paragraph (2), Member States may provide that the maximum durations referred to in the second subparagraph of paragraph 1 and in point (b) of paragraph 2 may be extended to the maximum duration of:\n(a)\n20 years, where a public tendering process for the statutory audit is conducted in accordance with paragraphs 2 to 5 of Article 16 and takes effect upon the expiry of the maximum durations referred to in the second subparagraph of paragraph 1 and in point (b) of paragraph 2; or\n(b)\ntwenty four years, where, after the expiry of the maximum durations referred to in the second subparagraph of paragraph 1 and in point (b) of paragraph 2, more than one statutory auditor or audit firm is simultaneously engaged, provided that the statutory audit results in the presentation of the joint audit report as referred to in Article 28 of Directive 2006/43/EC.\n5.   The maximum durations referred to in the second subparagraph of paragraph 1 and in point (b) of paragraph 2 shall be extended only if, upon a recommendation of the audit committee, the administrative or supervisory body, proposes to the general meeting of shareholders or members, in accordance with national law, that the engagement be renewed and that proposal is approved.\n6.

public-interest entities\nRules for statutory audit of public-interest entities\nSUMMARY OF:\nRegulation (EU) No 537/2014 on specific requirements regarding statutory audit of public-interest entities\nWHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?\nIt aims to improve transparency in the audit market to strengthen public confidence in the annual and consolidated financial statements of public-interest entities (PIEs)*.\nIt does so by laying down rules on: audits of public-interest entities;organisation and selection of statutory auditors and audit firms to guarantee their independence and avoid conflicts of interest;supervision of statutory auditors and audit firms.\nKEY POINTS\n              \nThe regulation sets out:\nConditions for carrying out statutory audit of public interest entities, notably:\nFee structures:\npayments for permitted non-audit services, if supplied for 3 or more consecutive years, should be limited to a maximum of 70% of the average of the statutory audit fees paid in the previous 3 years;\nstatutory auditors or firms must declare to the audit committee* if they receive from a single PIE more than 15% of their total income 3 years running to determine whether this is a threat to their independence and if safeguards are in place.\nBan on non-audit services:\nauditors carrying out a statutory audit of a PIE may not provide a wide range of non-audit activities, such as tax and legal advice or preparation of accounts, to the company, or parent or subsidiaries, while conducting the audit or during the previous financial year;\nEU governments may relax some of the restrictions or ban other services depending on their impact on an auditor’s independence;\nauditors carrying out a statutory audit may provide non-audit services which are not specifically banned subject to the approval of the audit committee.\nPreparation for statutory audits: auditors, before accepting or continuing an engagement for a statutory audit of a PIE: must ensure the independence requirements are met;confirm annually in writing to the audit committee that the firm, partners and senior managers are independent from the PIE;discuss with the audit committee any threats to their independence and the safeguards applied.\nIrregularities:\nAuditors must: inform the company if they suspect financial irregularities or fraud have taken place and ask it to take the necessary action. If it fails to do so, they inform the appropriate authorities;report promptly to the appropriate authorities if, during an audit, they uncover illegal behaviour, a threat or doubt about the PIE’s viability or decide to refuse to issue an audit opinion or to deliver an adverse or qualified one.\nAudit reports:\nstatutory auditors produce an audit report and an additional report to the audit committee. Each is subject to a quality control review before publication;\nthe audit report, drafted in clear and unambiguous language, describes, among other things, the most significant risks identified and the auditor’s response to them and key observations;\nthe additional report provides more detailed information, such as scope and timing of the audit and methodology used, for the audit committee.\nAdditional requirements for statutory auditors:\npublication of an annual transparency report, available on its website for at least 5 years, containing detailed information about the company and its activities;\nsubmission annually to the relevant authority of income from PIEs broken down by revenue from statutory audit and various non-audit services;\nretention for at least 5 years of documents and information specified in the regulation.\nAppointment of statutory auditors or audit firms by public-interest entities\na general meeting of shareholders or members of the PIE appoint the auditor on the basis of a recommendation from the audit committee. This contains at least 2 choices and explains why one is preferred;\na PIE is free to invite any auditor or firm to submit proposals and the tender should not exclude small firms which received less than 15% of their total audit fees from PIEs the previous calendar year;\na PIE appoints an auditor initially for 1 year and a maximum of 10 years. This can be raised to 20 years for a public tendering process and 24 years where a company is audited by at least 2 audit firms;\na gap of 4 years must occur before an auditor can audit the same company again;\nauditors provide a hand-over file containing all relevant information and the most recent audit to their successor.\nSurveillance of statutory auditors and audit firms\nEU governments appoint an authority to supervise auditors and firms carrying out statutory audits of PIEs. The authorities: are independent of statutory auditors and audit firms;respect professional secrecy;may not interfere with the content of audit reports;have the necessary supervisory and investigative powers, including accessing data and inspecting firms, either on their own, working with other authorities or help of the judiciary;establish and implement an effective system of audit quality assurance;follow clear rules on the appointment of inspectors and their activities;monitor the market for the provision of statutory audit services to PIEs, especially the performance of audit committees, market concentration in specific sectors or any failings by firms;publish a report by 17/6/2016, and every 3 years thereafter, on market developments (based on these reports, the European Commission will publish a joint report on these developments at the EU level);publish annual activity reports, work programmes and assessments of the quality assurance system;cooperate with their counterparts in other EU countries, particularly on quality assurance reviews, investigations and on-site inspections;may exchange information with colleagues in non-EU countries subject to certain conditions.\nThe regulation establishes the Committee of European Auditing Oversight Bodies (CEAOB). This: contains one senior representative from each national authority and one from the European Securities and Markets Authority;provides advice to the European Commission and national authorities, contributes technical expertise, plays a coordinating role and encourages exchange of information, expertise and best practice;may establish permanent or ad hoc sub-groups on specific issues.\nTransitional measures\nFrom 17 June 2020, a PIE may not renew a contract with a statutory auditor or audit firm if the latter has been providing it with audit services for 20 or more consecutive years when the regulation came into force;\nFrom 17 June 2023, the same restriction applies if the services have been provided for between 11 and 20 consecutive years.\nThe regulation repeals Commission Decision 2005/909/EC.\nFROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?\n              \nIt has applied since 17 June 2016.\nBACKGROUND\nThe regulation complements Directive 2006/43/EC which applies to all statutory audits (see summary) with regard to public-interest entities.\nIn 2017, the Commission published a report on monitoring developments in the EU market for providing statutory audit services to public-interest entities\nIn addition to increasing transparency in the audit market, the regulation encourages a wider choice of audit providers in an area highly concentrated in a few big accounting firms.\nFor more information, see: Regulation on statutory audit of public-interest entities (Audit regulation) (European Commission).\nKEY TERMS\n              \nPublic-interest entity: companies with a significant public interest because of the nature of their business, size or number of employees or corporate status, including banks, insurance firms and listed companies.\nAudit committee: each PIE has an audit committee of non-executive members or members of its supervisory body.\nMAIN DOCUMENT\n            \nRegulation (EU) No 537/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 April 2014 on specific requirements regarding statutory audit of public-interest entities and repealing Commission Decision 2005/909/EC (OJ L 158, 27.5.2014, pp. 77-112)\nSuccessive amendments to Regulation (EU) No 537/2014 have been incorporated into the original text.
