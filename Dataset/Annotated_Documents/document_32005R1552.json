In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve that objective.\n(14)\nThe measures necessary for the implementation of this Regulation should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission (7). These measures should take into account the capacities available in the Member States for data collection and processing.\n(15)\nThe Statistical Programme Committee has been consulted in accordance with Article 3 of Council Decision 89/382/EEC, Euratom of 19 June 1989 establishing a Committee on the Statistical Programmes of the European Communities (8),\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nArticle 1\nSubject matter\nThis Regulation establishes a common framework for the production of Community statistics on vocational training in enterprises.\nArticle 2\nDefinitions\nFor the purpose of this Regulation, the following definitions shall apply:\n1.\n‘enterprise’ means the enterprise as defined in Council Regulation (EEC) No 696/93 of 15 March 1993 on the statistical units for the observation and analysis of the production system in the Community (9);\n2.\n‘NACE Rev. 1.1’ means the common statistical classification of economic activities within the European Community, as established by Council Regulation (EEC) No 3037/90 of 9 October 1990 on the statistical classification of economic activities in the European Community (10).\nArticle 3\nData to be collected\n1.
