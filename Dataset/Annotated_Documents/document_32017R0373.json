{"celex_id": "32017R0373", "reference": "8.3.2017\nEN\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\nL 62/1\nCOMMISSION IMPLEMENTING REGULATION (EU) 2017/373\nof 1 March 2017\nlaying down common requirements for providers of air traffic management/air navigation services and other air traffic management network functions and their oversight, repealing Regulation (EC) No 482/2008, Implementing Regulations (EU) No 1034/2011, (EU) No 1035/2011 and (EU) 2016/1377 and amending Regulation (EU) No 677/2011\n(Text with EEA relevance)\nTHE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,\nHaving regard to Regulation (EC) No 216/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 February 2008 on common rules in the field of civil aviation and establishing a European Aviation Safety Agency, and repealing Council Directive 91/670/EEC, Regulation (EC) No 1592/2002 and Directive 2004/36/EC (1), and in particular Article 8b(6) thereof,\nHaving regard to Regulation (EC) No 550/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 10 March 2004 on the provision of air navigation services in the single European sky (the service provision Regulation) (2), and in particular Articles 4 and 6 thereof,\nHaving regard to Regulation (EC) No 551/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 10 March 2004 on the organisation and use of the airspace in the single European sky (the airspace Regulation) (3), and in particular Article 6(7) thereof,\nWhereas:\n(1)\nCommission Implementing Regulations (EU) No 1034/2011 (4) and (EU) No 1035/2011 (5) lay down requirements on safety oversight in air traffic management and air navigation services and common requirements for the provision of air navigation services, respectively. Those latter requirements are to be complied with by the service providers concerned in order for them to be issued the certificates referred to in Article 7(1) of Regulation (EC) No 550/2004 and Article 8b(2) of Regulation (EC) No 216/2008. Those Regulations also lay down requirements concerning the competent authorities, which are responsible for issuing those certificates and exercising oversight and enforcement tasks, in accordance with Article 4 of Regulation (EC) No 549/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council (6), Articles 2 and 7(7) of Regulation (EC) No 550/2004 and Articles 10 and 22a of Regulation (EC) No 216/2008.\n(2)\nThe requirements set out in Implementing Regulations (EU) No 1034/2011 and (EU) No 1035/2011 serve in particular to implement, at an initial stage, the essential requirements concerning the provision of air traffic management and air navigation services (‘ATM/ANS’) set out in Regulation (EC) No 216/2008, in particular to ensure compliance with Articles 8b and 22a of Regulation (EC) No 216/2008 and Annex Vb thereto and to allow the commencement of standardisation inspections in accordance with Article 24 of Regulation (EC) No 216/2008.\n(3)\nThose requirements set out in Implementing Regulations (EU) No 1034/2011 and (EU) No 1035/2011 should now be complemented and updated, in light of technical progress. It should also be clarified that, for service providers to be issued and retain a certificate, or to make a declaration, in accordance with this Regulation, they must comply, and continue to comply, with those requirements as well as with the essential requirements referred to in Article 8b(1) of Regulation (EC) No 216/2008. In addition, consistency should be ensured between those requirements and the requirements set out in Commission Regulations (EU) No 965/2012 (7), (EU) No 1178/2011 (8), (EU) No 139/2014 (9) and (EU) 2015/340 (10), thus moving towards a ‘total system approach’, which entails a logical and technologically consistent approach across the various domains. Therefore, the requirements set out in Implementing Regulations (EU) No 1034/2011 and (EU) No 1035/2011 should now be laid down in a single instrument and Implementing Regulations (EU) No 1034/2011 and (EU) No 1035/2011 should be repealed.\n(4)\nCommon rules for the certification and oversight of the service providers concerned are essential to increase the Member States' confidence in each other's systems. Therefore, and in order to ensure the highest level of safety and security, uniform requirements for the provision of services and their oversight should be strengthened. That should ensure the safe, high-quality provision of services for the purpose of air navigation and the mutual recognition of certificates throughout the Union, thereby increasing freedom of movement and improving the availability of those services.\n(5)\nIn order to ensure a harmonised approach to certification and oversight, the measures to be implemented for security of systems, constituents in use and data should be coordinated across Member States, functional airspace blocks and the network formed by the services, functions and products offered by service providers, the Network Manager, aerodromes and other persons providing the necessary infrastructure for flight operations.\n(6)\nSafety management ensures the identification, assessment and minimisation of safety risks as well as security vulnerabilities which have an impact on safety. Therefore, it is necessary to further elaborate the requirements related to the safety assessment of changes to the functional system by a certified organisation. Those requirements should be adapted taking into account the integration of requirements relating to change management into the common regulatory structure for civil aviation safety, as well as the experience gained by stakeholders and competent authorities in the field of safety oversight.\n(7)\nIt is appropriate to introduce safety culture as an aspect of the management systems of the service providers in a manner that promotes understanding and improvement of those systems, while acknowledging the need to strengthen management systems further, especially by integrating reliable occurrence reporting.\n(8)\nIt should be specified which authorities are responsible for the tasks related to certification, oversight and enforcement in respect of the service providers that are subject to this Regulation, in line with the criterion set out in Article 7(2) of Regulation (EC) No 550/2004 and the tasks of the European Aviation Safety Agency (‘the Agency’) pursuant to Article 22a of Regulation (EC) No 216/2008, and without prejudice to the requirements of Article 2 of Regulation (EC) No 550/2004. The Agency should be the competent authority for providers of data services and for the Network Manager, in light of the nature and scale of the services provided. In order to fulfil the objectives of Regulation (EC) No 216/2008, in particular the objective set out in point (d) of Article 2(2) thereof, and the objective set out in Article 1(3) of Regulation (EC) No 549/2004, it is also appropriate to align the requirements for the competent authorities with the progress in International Civil Aviation Organisation (‘ICAO’) safety management concepts, in particular the introduction of the authority management system, as well as in the implementation of the state safety programme and in ensuring coordination between those authorities.\n(9)\nIt should be clarified that, when exercising their certification, oversight and enforcement tasks under this Regulation, the competent authorities should be independent from any service provider, through ensuring adequate separation of those authorities from those providers at least at the functional level, and that any possible conflict of interest should be avoided. The aim is to guarantee the objectivity and impartiality of those authorities and to ensure that the exercise of their tasks under this Regulation is of high quality.\n(10)\nThe Agency should establish a database with relevant information relating to the competent authorities, so as to facilitate standardisation inspections of, and coordination with, the competent authorities, as well as to support the Commission in carrying out its tasks.\n(11)\nWith a view to ensuring that the requirements for service providers set out in this Regulation are complied with at all times and the competent authorities can effectively exercise their tasks under this Regulation, in accordance with Article 4(3) and (4) of Regulation (EC) No 549/2004, those authorities should be granted certain specific investigatory powers, in addition to the possibility to carry out investigations and surveys referred to in Article 2(2) of Regulation (EC) No 550/2004 and Article 10(2) and (3) of Regulation (EC) No 216/2008. It is appropriate to clarify that those powers should be exercised in accordance with the applicable rules of national law, while having due regard to a number of specific elements, which are meant to ensure a fair balance between all rights and interests at issue in a particular case.\n(12)\nThe air traffic safety electronics personnel employed by a service provider or the Network Manager should be subject to a harmonised training and competence assessment scheme. The service provider or Network Manager should also ensure that the personnel of contracted organisations are appropriately qualified. Therefore, detailed provisions on training and competence assessment of such personnel should be included in this Regulation.\n(13)\nIn order to ensure a high level of civil aviation safety in the Union, the measures set out in this Regulation should reflect the state of the art in aviation safety, including best practice and scientific and technical progress in the field of meteorological services. Therefore, this Regulation should be based on the applicable ICAO standards and recommended practices, specifically Annex 3 to the Convention on International Aviation, signed in Chicago on 7 December 1944 (‘Chicago Convention’) on ‘Meteorological Service for International Air Navigation’, while drawing on the experience of Union and worldwide meteorological service provision and ensuring proportionality according to the size, type and complexity of the meteorological services provider.\n(14)\nCommon requirements should be established for the certification and oversight of data services providers to ensure that the providers of aeronautical data for use on aircraft process the data in an appropriate manner, which meets the airspace end-users' requirements and allows for safe performance-based navigation operations.\n(15)\nThe aeronautical industry and the competent authorities of the Member States should be allowed sufficient time to adapt to the new regulatory framework established by this Regulation and to replace certificates issued before the date of application of this Regulation.\n(16)\nHowever, in order to ensure consistency with Regulation (EU) No 965/2012, the relevant provisions of this Regulation should apply to data services providers already from an earlier date. Moreover, those providers should be allowed, on a voluntary basis, to apply for, and be granted, the relevant certificates already immediately upon the entry into force of this Regulation, so as to allow them, as entities that are not subject to Implementing Regulation (EU) No 1035/2011 but that are subject to the practice of issuing voluntary letters of acceptance by the Agency, to benefit from an early application of this Regulation in this regard and the mutual recognition of those certificates. Such early application of this Regulation with respect to data services providers would also relieve aircraft operators from their oversight responsibilities when contracting the services of those providers, once the provider is certified for aeronautical databases. Where such a provider makes use of that possibility, it should be bound by the applicable requirements of this Regulation for the purposes of obtaining a certificate and subsequently continue to be bound by those requirements. In view of this possibility for data service providers, the relevant provisions of this Regulation concerning the competent authority in respect of those providers, which is in this case only the Agency, should also apply already from the date of entry into force of this Regulation.\n(17)\nThe provisions contained in Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 923/2012 (11) should be complemented with aspects related to the provision of air traffic services, to ensure consistency of service provision with pilot and air traffic service personnel actions and requirements under that Regulation.\n(18)\nThe safety acceptability of any change proposed by a service provider should be assessed based on the analysis of the risks posed by the introduction of a change to its functional system, differentiated under either quantitative or qualitative objective assessment criteria, or a combination of both, to be determined at a local level.\n(19)\nFor reasons of consistency and ease of application, the provisions of Commission Regulation (EC) No 482/2008 (12) should be integrated in this Regulation and Commission Regulation (EC) No 482/2008 should therefore be repealed.\n(20)\nThe requirements of Articles 12 and 21 of Commission Regulation (EU) No 677/2011 (13) and Annex VI thereto should be integrated in this Regulation in order to ensure a harmonised approach to all service providers. Therefore, those provisions should be deleted.\n(21)\nCommission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2016/1377 (14), which has not yet become applicable, contains numerous errors. In order to eliminate those errors, while at the same time ensuring the required legal clarity, it is appropriate to repeal Implementing Regulation (EU) 2016/1377 in its entirety and to replace it with the rules set out in this Regulation.\n(22)\nThe measures provided for in this Regulation are based on the opinion of the Agency in accordance with Articles 17(2)(b) and 19(1) of Regulation (EC) No 216/2008.\n(23)\nThe measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee established by Article 5(3) of Regulation (EC) No 549/2004,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nArticle 1\nSubject matter\nThis Regulation lays down common requirements for:\n(1)\nthe provision of air traffic management and air navigation services (‘ATM/ANS’) and other air traffic management network functions (‘ATM network functions’) for general air traffic, in particular for the legal or natural persons providing those services and functions;\n(2)\nthe competent authorities, and the qualified entities acting on their behalf, which exercise certification, oversight and enforcement tasks in respect of the providers of the services and functions referred to in point (1).\nArticle 2\nDefinitions\nFor the purposes of this Regulation, the definitions in Annex I and the following definitions shall apply:\n(1)\nthe definitions in Article 2 of Regulation (EC) No 549/2004 and Article 3 of Regulation (EC) No 216/2008, except for the definition of ‘certificate’ in Article 2(15) of Regulation (EC) No 549/2004;\n(2)\n‘service provider’ means any legal or natural person providing functions or services of ATM/ANS as defined in point (q) of Article 3 of Regulation (EC) No 216/2008 or other ATM network functions, either individually or bundled for general air traffic;\n(3)\n‘Network Manager’ means the body established in accordance with Article 6 of Regulation (EC) No 551/2004 to perform the duties provided for in that Article and in Articles 3 and 4 of Regulation (EU) No 677/2011;\n(4)\n‘pan-European service’ means an activity which is designed and established for users within most or all Member States and which may also extend beyond the airspace of the territory to which the Treaty applies;\n(5)\n‘data services provider (DAT provider)’ means an organisation, which is:\n(a)\ntype 1 DAT provider that processes aeronautical data for use on aircraft and provides an aeronautical database meeting the DQRs, under controlled conditions, for which no corresponding airborne application/equipment compatibility has been determined;\n(b)\ntype 2 DAT provider that processes aeronautical data and provides an aeronautical database for use on certified aircraft application/equipment meeting the DQRs for which compatibility with that application/equipment has been determined.\nArticle 3\nProvision of ATM/ANS and ATM network functions\n1.   Member States shall ensure that the appropriate ATM/ANS and ATM network functions are provided in accordance with this Regulation in a manner that facilitates general air traffic, while taking into account safety considerations and traffic requirements.\n2.   When Member States adopt additional provisions to complement this Regulation on any matters left to the Member States under this Regulation, those provisions shall follow the standards and recommended practices set by the Chicago Convention. Where use is made of the provisions of Article 38 of the Chicago Convention, in addition to notifying the International Civil Aviation Organisation, the Member States shall notify the European Aviation Safety Agency (‘Agency’), with due justification, at the latest two months after the additional provisions have been adopted.\n3.   Member States shall publish, in accordance with the Chicago Convention, those additional provisions through their aeronautical information publications.\n4.   Where a Member State decides to organise the provision of certain specific air traffic services in a competitive environment, that Member State shall take all appropriate measures to ensure that the providers of those services shall neither engage in conduct that would have as its object or effect the prevention, restriction or distortion of competition, nor shall they engage in conduct that amounts to an abuse of a dominant position, in accordance with applicable Union and national law.\nArticle 4\nCompetent authority for certification, oversight and enforcement\n1.   The competent authority responsible for the issuing of certificates to service providers, for the acknowledgment of receipts of declarations made by providers of flight information services referred to in Article 7 where relevant, and for the oversight and enforcement in respect of service providers shall be the national supervisory authority referred to in Article 4 of Regulation (EC) No 549/2004 of the Member State where the legal or natural person applying for the certificate or making the declaration has its principal place of operation or, if any, its registered office, unless the Agency is the competent authority pursuant to Article 22a of Regulation (EC) No 216/2008.\nFor the purposes of this Regulation, data services providers and the Network Manager shall be considered to be pan-European service providers in respect of which, in accordance with point (c) of Article 22a of Regulation (EC) No 216/2008, the Agency is the competent authority.\n2.   The competent authorities referred to in paragraph 1 shall comply with the requirements laid down in Annex II.\n3.   Where one of the service providers concerned is an organisation in respect of which the Agency is the competent authority, the competent authorities of the Member States concerned shall coordinate with the Agency in order to ensure that the requirements set out in points (1), (2) and (3) of point ATM/ANS.AR.A.005(b) of Annex II are complied with where, alternatively:\n(a)\nservice providers provide services in respect of functional airspace blocks that extend across the airspace falling under the responsibility of more than one Member State, as referred to in Article 2(3) of Regulation (EC) No 550/2004;\n(b)\nservice providers provide cross-border air navigation services as referred to in Article 2(5) of Regulation (EC) No 550/2004.\n4.   Where a Member State has nominated or established more than one competent authority in accordance with Article 4 of Regulation (EC) No 549/2004 or as referred to in Article 2(3) to (6) of Regulation (EC) No 550/2004 to exercise the certification, oversight and enforcement tasks under this Regulation, it shall ensure that the areas of competence of each of those authorities are clearly defined, in particular in terms of responsibilities and geographic and airspace limitation. In such a case, those authorities shall establish coordination between them, based on written arrangements, so as to ensure effective oversight and enforcement in respect of all service providers to which they issued certificates or, where relevant, which made declarations to them.\n5.   When exercising their certification, oversight and enforcement tasks under this Regulation, the competent authorities shall be independent of any service provider. That independence shall be ensured by adequate separation, at least at the functional level, between the competent authorities and the service providers. In this context, Member States shall ensure that the competent authorities exercise their powers impartially and transparently.\n6.   Member States and, where the Agency is the competent authority, the Commission shall ensure that their competent authorities do not allow their personnel to be involved in the exercise of the certification, oversight and enforcement tasks of that authority under this Regulation where there are indications that such involvement could result, directly or indirectly, in a conflict of interest, in particular relating to family or financial interests.\n7.   The Agency shall maintain a database of contact details of the competent authorities referred to in paragraph 1. For this purpose, Member States shall notify the Agency of the names and addresses of their competent authorities, and of any subsequent changes thereto.\n8.   Member States and, where the Agency is the competent authority, the Commission shall determine the necessary resources and capabilities required by the competent authorities for the exercise of their tasks, in accordance with Article 4(4) of Regulation (EC) No 549/2004 and Article 22a of Regulation (EC) No 216/2008, taking into account all relevant factors, including an assessment carried out by the respective competent authorities to determine the resources needed for the exercise of their tasks under this Regulation.\nArticle 5\nPowers of the competent authority referred to in Article 4\n1.   The competent authorities shall, where required for the exercise of their certification, oversight and enforcement tasks under this Regulation, be empowered to:\n(a)\nrequire the service providers subject to their oversight to provide all necessary information;\n(b)\nrequire any representative, manager or other member of the personnel of those service providers to provide oral explanations on any fact, document, object, procedure or other subject matter relevant to the oversight of the service provider;\n(c)\nenter any premises and land, including operating sites, and means of transport of those service providers;\n(d)\nexamine, copy or make extracts from any document, record or data held by or accessible to those service providers, irrespective of the medium on which the information in question is stored;\n(e)\ncarry out audits, assessments, investigations and inspections of those service providers.\n2.   The competent authorities shall, where required for the exercise of their certification, oversight and enforcement tasks under this Regulation, also be empowered to exercise the powers set out in paragraph 1 in relation to the contracted organisations subject to the service providers' oversight, as referred to in point ATM/ANS.OR.B.015 of Annex III.\n3.   The powers provided for in paragraphs 1 and 2 shall be exercised in compliance with the national law of the Member State where the activities in question take place, with due regard for the need to ensure the effective exercise of those powers and for the rights and legitimate interests of the service provider and any third persons concerned, and in compliance with the principle of proportionality. Where, in accordance with the applicable national law, prior authorisation from the judicial authority of the Member State concerned is needed to enter premises, land and means of transport as referred to in point (c) of paragraph 1, the related powers shall be exercised only after having obtained such prior authorisation.\nWhen exercising the powers provided for in paragraphs 1 and 2, the competent authority shall ensure that the members of its staff and, where relevant, any other expert participating in the activities in question are duly authorised.\n4.   The competent authorities shall take or initiate any appropriate enforcement measure necessary to ensure that the service providers to which they issued a certificate or, where relevant, which made a declaration to them, comply and continue to comply with the requirements of this Regulation.\nArticle 6\nService providers\nService providers shall be granted a certificate and be entitled to exercise the privileges granted within the scope of that certificate, where, in addition to the requirements referred to in Article 8b(1) of Regulation (EC) No 216/2008, they comply and continue to comply with the following requirements:\n(a)\nfor all service providers, the requirements laid down in Annex III (Part-ATM/ANS.OR), Subparts A and B, and in Annex XIII (Part-PERS);\n(b)\nfor service providers other than providers of air traffic services, in addition to the requirements of point (a), the requirements laid down in Annex III (Part-ATM/ANS.OR), Subpart C;\n(c)\nfor providers of air navigation services, providers of air traffic flow management and the Network Manager, in addition to the requirements of point (a), the requirements laid down in Annex III (Part-ATM/ANS.OR), Subpart D;\n(d)\nfor providers of air traffic services, in addition to the requirements of points (a) and (c), the requirements laid down in Annex IV (Part-ATS);\n(e)\nfor providers of meteorological services, in addition to the requirements of points (a), (b) and (c), the requirements laid down in Annex V (Part-MET);\n(f)\nfor providers of aeronautical information services, in addition to the requirements of points (a), (b) and (c), the requirements laid down in Annex VI (Part-AIS);\n(g)\nfor data services providers, in addition to the requirements of points (a) and (b), the requirements laid down in Annex VII (Part-DAT);\n(h)\nfor providers of communication, navigation or surveillance services, in addition to the requirements of points (a), (b) and (c), the requirements laid down in Annex VIII (Part-CNS);\n(i)\nfor providers of air traffic flow management, in addition to the requirements of points (a), (b) and (c), the requirements laid down in Annex IX (Part-ATFM);\n(j)\nfor providers of airspace management, in addition to the requirements of points (a) and (b), the requirements laid down in Annex X (Part-ASM);\n(k)\nfor providers of procedure design, in addition to the requirements of points (a) and (b), the requirements laid down in Annex XI (Part-ASD), when those requirements will be adopted by the Commission;\n(l)\nfor the Network Manager, in addition to the requirements of points (a), (b) and (c), the requirements laid down in Annex XII (Part-NM).\nArticle 7\nDeclaration by providers of flight information services\nWhere Member States allow providers of flight information services to declare their capability and means of discharging the responsibilities associated with the services provided in accordance with Article 8b(3) of Regulation (EC) No 216/2008, those providers shall fulfil, in addition to the requirements referred to in Article 8b(1) of Regulation (EC) No 216/2008, the requirements laid down in point ATM/ANS.OR.A.015 in Annex III to this Regulation.\nArticle 8\nExisting certificates\n1.
