{"celex_id": "32008R0215", "reference": "19.3.2008\nEN\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\nL 78/1\nCOUNCIL REGULATION (EC) No 215/2008\nof 18 February 2008\non the Financial Regulation applicable to the 10th European Development Fund\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,\nHaving regard to the Partnership Agreement between the members of the African, Caribbean and Pacific Group of States of the one part, and the European Community and its Member States, of the other part, signed in Cotonou on 23 June 2000 (1) and revised in Luxembourg on 25 June 2005 (2) (the ACP-EC Agreement),\nHaving regard to Council Decision 2001/822/EC of 27 November 2001 on the association of the overseas countries and territories with the European Community (the Overseas Association Decision) (3), and in particular the fourth paragraph of Article 23 thereof,\nHaving regard to Decision No 1/2006 of the ACP-EC Council of Ministers of 2 June 2006 specifying the multiannual financial framework for the period 2008 to 2013 and modifying the revised ACP-EC Agreement (4),\nHaving regard to the Internal Agreement between the Representatives of the Governments of the Member States, meeting within the Council, on the financing of Community aid under the multiannual financial framework for the period 2008 to 2013 in accordance with the ACP-EC Agreement and on the allocation of financial assistance for the Overseas Countries and Territories to which Part Four of the EC Treaty applies (5) (the Internal Agreement) and in particular Article 10(2) thereof,\nHaving regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 617/2007 of 14 May 2007 on the implementation of the 10th European Development Fund under the ACP-EC Partnership Agreement (6),\nHaving regard to the proposal from the Commission,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the Court of Auditors (7),\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European Investment Bank,\nWhereas:\n(1)\nIt is necessary to determine the detailed rules for the payment of contributions by the Member States to the 10th European Development Fund (the EDF), set up by the Internal Agreement, and for the allocation of financial assistance for the Overseas Countries and Territories to which Part Four of the EC Treaty applies (OCTs).\n(2)\nRules should be laid down for the treatment of the balances remaining from the previous EDFs, in particular as regards the detailed arrangements for their transfer to the 10th EDF and the rules applicable for their implementation, or the consequences of their decommitment in relation with Member States contributions.\n(3)\nIt is necessary to lay down the conditions in accordance with which the Court of Auditors must exercise its powers in respect of the EDF.\n(4)\nIt is necessary to lay down the conditions in accordance with which the European Investment Bank (EIB) manages EDF resources.\n(5)\nThe provisions concerning scrutiny by the Court of Auditors of the EDF resources managed by the EIB should comply with the Tripartite Agreement concluded between the Court of Auditors, the EIB and the Commission provided for in Article 248(4) of the Treaty.\n(6)\nIt is appropriate to ensure the proper, prompt and efficient execution of programmes and projects financed under the ACP-EC Agreement and to establish management procedures which are transparent and easy to apply, and which facilitate the decentralisation of tasks and responsibilities.\n(7)\nThe parties to the ACP-EC Agreement have reaffirmed their commitment to the social and ethic clauses as defined by the relevant International Labour Organisation (ILO) Conventions,\n(8)\nIt is necessary to establish the detailed rules in accordance with which the authorising officer by delegation establishes the necessary arrangements to ensure the proper execution of operations, in close cooperation with the National Authorising Officer.\n(9)\nAs far as possible, Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002 of 25 June 2002 on the Financial Regulation applicable to the general budget of the European Communities (8) should, as the cornerstone of the reform of the Commission's internal management, be taken into account in this Regulation, for reasons of efficiency and simplification. If appropriate Commission Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 2342/2002 of 23 December 2002 laying down detailed rules for the implementation of Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002 on the Financial Regulation applicable to the general budget of the European Communities (9) should be applied mutatis mutandis in certain cases.\n(10)\nAll changes in comparison with the Financial Regulation of 27 March 2003 applicable to the Ninth European Development Fund (10) should contribute to achieving the objectives of the Commission's reforms, should improve or ensure sound financial management, and should enhance the protection of the financial interests of the Community against fraud and other illegal activities, and thus enhance legality and regularity of financial operations.\n(11)\nSome changes in comparison with the Financial Regulation for the Ninth EDF are necessary in the light of practical experience in order to facilitate EDF implementation and the realisation of the underlying policy objectives and to adjust some procedural and documentary requirements. Transparency, in particular, has to be reinforced by providing for information on beneficiaries of Community funds.\n(12)\nThe principle of sound financial management should imply effective and efficient internal control for the implementation of EDF resources.\n(13)\nAs regards EDF resources, it should be made possible for Member States to make voluntary financial contributions to help achieve the objectives of the ACP-EC Partnership Agreement outside co-financing arrangements, as provided for in Regulation (EC) No 617/2007.\n(14)\nThe principle of specification should apply to the EDF.\n(15)\nAs regards the methods of implementation of the EDF resources, the provisions on centralised, decentralised and joint management as laid down in the Financial Regulation for the Ninth EDF should be restructured for the purpose of clarity and some requirements should be made clearer. In particular, the requirements for joint management, the conditions for the delegation of tasks and the criteria for using national public-sector bodies should be simplified in order to facilitate their use and to respond to growing operational needs.\n(16)\nThe prohibition on delegating implementation tasks to private bodies should be adjusted in respect to centralised management because the terms of that prohibition have turned out to be unnecessarily strict. It should be possible for the Commission to engage the services of a travel agency or a conference organiser to take charge of reimbursing the costs of participants at conferences, provided that care is taken to ensure that no discretionary powers are exercised by the private company.\n(17)\nAs regards the accounting officer, his responsibility for certifying the accounts on the basis of the financial information supplied to him by the authorising officers has to be made clearer. To this end, the accounting officer should be empowered to check the information received by the authorising officer by delegation and to enter reservations, if necessary.\n(18)\nThe conditions and limitations regarding financial liability of all financial actors and any other person involved in EDF implementation should be clarified.\n(19)\nThe rules on recovery of amounts receivable should be clarified and strengthened in order to better safeguard the financial interests of the Communities. In particular, the conditions in which interest on late payments is due to the EDF should be specified.\n(20)\nProvision should be made for periods of limitation on the validity of claims. The Community, unlike many of its Member States, is not subject to a period of limitation under which financial claims are extinguished after a certain period of time. Nor is the Community restricted by a period of limitation in the pursuit of its claims against third persons. The introduction of such periods of limitation should correspond to the principle of sound financial management.\n(21)\nIn line with the general Financial Regulation and Directive 2004/18/EC of the European Parliament and the Council of 31 March 2004 on the coordination of procedures for the award of public works contracts, public supply contracts and public service contracts (11), the rules on exclusion from a procurement procedure need to be clarified. A clear distinction should be made between mandatory exclusion and exclusion on the basis of an administrative penalty. In addition, for reasons of legal certainty and proportionality, a maximum period of exclusion should be laid down. An exception to the rules on exclusion may be provided for as regards the purchase of supplies on particularly advantageous terms from either a supplier which is definitively winding up its business activities, or the receivers or liquidators of a bankruptcy, an arrangement with creditors, or a similar procedure under national law.\n(22)\nIt is appropriate to allow the use of the central database concerning candidates or tenderers in situations of exclusion set up under Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002 in the context of the EDF.\n(23)\nAs regards grants, some clarifications need to be made in Article 103, in particular as regards their scope. To improve the management of grants and to simplify procedures, it should be possible to award grants either by decisions of the institution or by written agreements with beneficiaries, and to authorise the use of lump sum and flat-rate payments alongside the more traditional method of reimbursing costs actually incurred. Finally, requirements for checks and guarantees should be more proportionate to the financial risks involved.\n(24)\nThe rule that grants should be awarded on the basis of calls for proposals has proved its worth. Experience has shown, however, that in certain situations the nature of the action leaves no choice in the selection of beneficiaries. It should therefore be expressly recognised that such exceptional cases arise.\n(25)\nWhere grants are given for running costs, the rule that the necessary agreement may not be signed more than four months after the start of the beneficiary's financial year has proven unnecessarily rigid. That deadline should therefore be fixed at six months.\n(26)\nAs grants should continue to be awarded on the basis of selection and award criteria, there is no need to have those criteria evaluated in all cases by a committee. Other more flexible means should be allowed for the evaluation of the selection criteria.\n(27)\nFor the sake of clarity, the rule concerning the procurement requirements to be applied by beneficiaries of grants should be simplified. Moreover, it should be expressly provided for the case in which the implementation of an action necessitates financial support to third parties,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nCONTENTS\nPART ONE —\nMAIN PROVISIONS\nTITLE I —\nSUBJECT MATTER AND SCOPE\nTITLE II —\nFINANCIAL PRINCIPLES\nCHAPTER 1:\nPRINCIPLE OF FINANCIAL ACCURACY\nCHAPTER 2:\nPRINCIPLE OF THE UNIT OF ACCOUNT\nCHAPTER 3:\nPRINCIPLE OF SPECIFICATION\nCHAPTER 4:\nPRINCIPLE OF SOUND FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT\nCHAPTER 5:\nPRINCIPLE OF TRANSPARENCY\nTITLE III —\nRESOURCES AND MEMBER STATES CONTRIBUTIONS\nCHAPTER 1:\nCOMPOSITION OF EDF RESOURCES\nTITLE IV —\nIMPLEMENTATION OF EDF RESOURCES\nCHAPTER 1:\nGENERAL PROVISIONS\nCHAPTER 2:\nMETHODS OF IMPLEMENTATION\nSection 1:\nGeneral provisions\nSection 2:\nDecentralised management\nSection 3:\nCentralised management\nSection 4:\nJoint management with international organisations\nCHAPTER 3:\nFINANCIAL ACTORS\nSection 1:\nPrinciple of segregation of duties\nSection 2:\nAuthorising officer\nSection 3:\nAccounting officer\nSection 4:\nPaying agent\nSection 5:\nPaying manager\nCHAPTER 4:\nLIABILITY OF FINANCIAL ACTORS\nSection 1:\nGeneral rules\nSection 2:\nRules applicable to authorising officers\nSection 3:\nRules applicable to accounting officers and paying managers\nCHAPTER 5:\nREVENUE OPERATIONS\nSection 1:\nMaking available of EDF resources\nSection 2:\nEstimates of amounts receivable\nSection 3:\nEstablishment of amounts receivable\nSection 4:\nAuthorisation of recovery\nSection 5:\nRecovery\nCHAPTER 6:\nEXPENDITURE OPERATIONS\nSection 1:\nGeneral provisions\nSection 2:\nCommitment of expenditure\nSection 3:\nCommitment of expenditure under centralised or joint management\nSection 4:\nCommitment of expenditure under decentralised management\nSection 5:\nValidation of expenditure\nSection 6:\nAuthorisation of expenditure\nSection 7:\nPayment of expenditure\nSection 8:\nTime limits for expenditure operations\nCHAPTER 7:\nIT SYSTEMS\nCHAPTER 8:\nINTERNAL AUDITOR\nTITLE V —\nPROCUREMENT\nCHAPTER 1:\nGENERAL PROVISIONS\nSection 1:\nScope and award principles\nSection 2:\nPublication\nCHAPTER 2:\nPROCUREMENT PROCEDURES\nTITLE VI —\nDIRECT LABOUR AND INDIRECT DECENTRALISED OPERATIONS\nTITLE VII —\nGRANTS\nCHAPTER 1:\nSCOPE AND FORMS OF GRANTS\nCHAPTER 2:\nPRINCIPLES\nCHAPTER 3:\nAWARD PROCEDURE\nCHAPTER 4:\nPAYMENT AND CONTROL\nCHAPTER 5:\nIMPLEMENTATION\nTITLE VIII —\nPRESENTATION OF THE ACCOUNTS AND ACCOUNTING\nCHAPTER 1:\nPRESENTATION OF THE ACCOUNTS\nCHAPTER 2:\nINFORMATION ON IMPLEMENTATION OF EDF RESOURCES\nCHAPTER 3:\nACCOUNTING\nTITLE IX —\nEXTERNAL AUDIT AND DISCHARGE\nCHAPTER 1:\nGENERAL PROVISIONS\nCHAPTER 2:\nEXTERNAL AUDIT\nCHAPTER 3:\nDISCHARGE\nPART TWO —\nSPECIFIC PROVISIONS CONCERNING EDF RESOURCES MANAGED BY THE EIB\nPART THREE —\nTRANSITIONAL AND FINAL PROVISIONS\nTITLE I —\nTRANSITIONAL PROVISIONS\nCHAPTER 1:\nTRANSFER OF BALANCE REMAINING FROM PREVIOUS EDFs\nCHAPTER 2:\nBALANCES REMAINING FROM PREVIOUS EDFs\nCHAPTER 3:\nRULES APPLICABLE FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF PREVIOUS EDFs\nCHAPTER 4:\nTRANSITIONAL PERIOD\nTITLE II —\nFINAL PROVISIONS\nPART ONE\nMAIN PROVISIONS\nTITLE I\nSUBJECT MATTER AND SCOPE\nArticle 1\nThis Regulation lays down the rules for the establishment and financial implementation of the resources of the 10th European Development Fund (EDF), and the presentation and auditing of the accounts.\nArticle 2\n1.   The Commission shall assume the responsibilities of the Community defined in Article 57 of the ACP-EC Agreement and in the Overseas Association Decision.\nTo that end, it shall undertake the financial implementation of operations carried out with EDF resources allocated in the form of non-repayable aid, excluding interest rate subsidies, and make payments in accordance with this Regulation.\n2.   For the purposes of the application of this Regulation, the Commission shall act on its own responsibility and within the limits of the resources allocated.\nArticle 3\nThe European Investment Bank (EIB), acting on behalf of the Community, shall manage the Investment Facility, as well as interest rate subsidies, and shall conduct operations there under, in accordance with the rules set out in Part Two. In that context, the EIB shall act on behalf of and at the risk of the Community.\nThe EIB shall undertake the financial implementation of operations carried out by means of loans from its own resources, where applicable combined with interest rate subsidies drawn from the EDF's grant resources.\nArticle 4\nThe provisions of this Part and Part Three shall apply exclusively to the financial implementation of the EDF resources managed by the Commission. Those provisions may not be interpreted as giving rise to any obligations on the Commission's part in respect of the financial implementation of EDF resources managed by the EIB.\nArticle 5\n1.   Unless otherwise specified, references in this Regulation to the ACP States shall be deemed to refer also to the bodies or representatives defined in Articles 13 and 14 of Annex IV to the ACP-AC Agreement, which they may duly mandate to exercise their responsibilities under that Agreement.\n2.   The financial year shall begin on 1 January and end on 31 December.\nTITLE II\nFINANCIAL PRINCIPLES\nArticle 6\nEDF resources shall be established and implemented in compliance with the following principles as set out in this Regulation:\n(a)\nfinancial accuracy;\n(b)\nunit of account;\n(c)\nspecification;\n(d)\nsound financial management;\n(e)\ntransparency.\nCHAPTER 1\nPrinciple of financial accuracy\nArticle 7\n1.   No revenue shall be collected and no expenditure effected unless booked to an allocation of the EDF.\n2.   No expenditure may be committed or authorised in excess of the allocations.\n3.   Interest yielded by the funds which are the property of the EDF shall be entered as EDF revenue.\nArticle 8\n1.   Interest generated by pre-financing payments shall be assigned to the programme or the action concerned and deducted from the payment of the balance of the amounts due to the beneficiary.\n2.   Interest shall not be due to the Communities in the following cases:\n(a)\npre-financing which does not represent a significant amount;\n(b)\npre-financing paid under a procurement contract within the meaning of Article 91;\n(c)\nadvances paid to members of the institutions and to staff in accordance with the Staff Regulations of officials of the European Communities and the Conditions of employment of other servants of the European Communities (the Staff Regulations);\n(d)\npre-financing paid in the framework of joint management as referred to in Article 20(1)(c).\n3.   Articles 3, 4 and 4a of Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 2342/2002 shall apply mutatis mutandis to the implementation of paragraphs 1 and 2.\nCHAPTER 2\nPrinciple of the unit of account\nArticle 9\n1.   EDF resources shall be drawn up and implemented in euro and the accounts shall be presented in euro.\nHowever, for the treasury management purposes referred to in Article 39, the accounting officer may carry out operations in euro or in other currencies.\n2.   Articles 7 and 8 of Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 2342/2002 shall apply mutatis mutandis to the implementation of paragraph 1.\nCHAPTER 3\nPrinciple of specification\nArticle 10\nEDF resources shall be earmarked for specific purposes according to the main instruments of cooperation, as described in the Financial Protocol of the ACP-EC Agreement and in the Overseas Association Decision.\nIn respect of the ACP States, those instruments are laid down by the Financial Protocol set out in Annex Ib to the ACP-EC Agreement. Earmarking of resources shall also be based on the provisions of the Internal Agreement and shall take account of the resources reserved for support expenditure linked to programming and implementation under Article 6 thereof.\nIn respect of the OCTs, those instruments are laid down in Annex IIA bis to the Overseas Association Decision. Earmarking of those resources shall also take account of the non-allocated reserve provided for in Article 3(4) of that Annex and of the resources reserved for studies or technical assistance measures under Article 1(1)(c) thereof.\nCHAPTER 4\nPrinciple of sound financial management\nArticle 11\n1.   EDF resources shall be used in accordance with the principles of sound financial management, namely in accordance with the principles of economy, efficiency and effectiveness.\n2.   The principle of economy requires that the resources used for the pursuit of activities shall be made available in due time, in appropriate quantity and quality and at the best price.\nThe principle of efficiency is concerned with the best relationship between resources employed and results achieved.\nThe principle of effectiveness is concerned with attaining the specific objectives set and achieving the intended results.\n3.   Specific, measurable, achievable, relevant and timed objectives shall be set. The achievement of those objectives shall be monitored by performance indicators.\nArticle 12\nIn order to improve decision-making, in particular to justify and specify the determination of the contributions to be paid by Member States referred to in Article 57, the following evaluations are required:\n(a)\nthe use of EDF resources shall be preceded by an ex ante evaluation of the operation to be undertaken;\n(b)\nthe operation shall be submitted to an ex post evaluation with a view to ensuring that the intended results justify the means deployed.\nArticle 13\n1.   The principle of sound financial management required that EDF resources shall be implemented in compliance with effective and efficient internal control as appropriate in each management mode.\n2.   For the purposes of the implementation of EDF resources, internal control is defined as a process applicable at all levels of the management and designed to provide reasonable assurance on the achievement of the following objectives:\n(a)\neffectiveness, efficiency and economy of operations;\n(b)\nreliability of reporting;\n(c)\nsafeguarding of assets and information;\n(d)\nprevention and detection of fraud and irregularities;\n(e)\nadequate management of the risks relating to the legality and regularity of the underlying transactions, taking into account the multiannual character of programmes as well as the nature of the payments concerned.\nCHAPTER 5\nPrinciple of transparency\nArticle 14\n1.   EDF resources shall be established and implemented and the accounts presented in compliance with the principle of transparency.\n2.   The annual estimates of commitments and payments under Article 7 of the Internal Agreement, together with the EDF accounts referred to in Article 118 of this Regulation, shall be published in the Official Journal of the European Union.\n3.   The Commission shall make available, in an appropriate manner, information on the beneficiaries of funds deriving from the EDF held by it when EDF resources are implemented on a centralised basis and directly by its departments, and information on the beneficiaries of funds as provided by the entities to which financial implementation tasks are delegated under other modes of management.\nThis information shall be made available with due observance of the requirements of confidentiality, in particular the protection of personal data as laid down in Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data (12) and Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 December 2001 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data (13) by the Community institutions and bodies and on the free movement of such data, and of the requirements of security, taking into account the specificities of each management mode referred to in Article 20.\nTITLE III\nRESOURCES AND MEMBER STATES CONTRIBUTIONS\nCHAPTER 1\nComposition of EDF resources\nArticle 15\nThe EDF resources shall consist of the amounts laid down in Article 1 of the Internal Agreement.\nArticle 16\n1.   The Commission may manage financial contributions from Member States and other donor countries on their behalf, including in both cases their public and parastatal agencies, or from international organisations to certain projects or programmes financed by the EDF, in accordance with Article 9(1) and (2) of Regulation (EC) No 617/2007.\n2.   The Commission may also manage voluntary financial contributions from Member States in accordance with Article 9(4) and (5) of Regulation (EC) No 617/2007 and any specific arrangements laid down in relevant bilateral contribution agreements.\n3.   The additional resources as defined in paragraphs 1 and 2 shall be managed according to the same rules as the EDF resources.\nTITLE IV\nIMPLEMENTATION OF EDF RESOURCES\nCHAPTER 1\nGeneral provisions\nArticle 17\nThe Commission may, within its own departments, delegate its powers to implement EDF resources, in accordance with the conditions laid down by this Regulation and by its internal rules and within the limits set by the Commission in the instrument of delegation. Those so empowered may act only within the limits of the powers expressly conferred upon them.\nArticle 18\n1.   All financial actors and any other person involved in the implementation, management, audit or control of EDF resources shall be prohibited from taking any action which may bring their own interests into conflict with those of the Community. Should a conflict of interests arise, the person in question shall refrain from such an action and refer the matter to the competent authority.\n2.   There is a conflict of interests where the impartial and objective exercise of the functions of a financial actor or other person, as referred to in paragraph 1, is compromised for reasons involving family, emotional life, political or national affinity, economic interest or any other shared interest with the beneficiary.\n3.   Article 34 of Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 2342/2002 shall apply mutatis mutandis to the implementation of paragraphs 1 and 2.\nArticle 19\nFor the purposes of this Title, the term ‘staff’ refers to persons covered by the Staff Regulations.\nCHAPTER 2\nMethods of implementation\nSection 1\nGeneral provisions\nArticle 20\n1.   The Commission shall implement EDF resources in accordance with the provisions set out in Articles 21 to 29 in any of the following ways:\n(a)\nby decentralised management;\n(b)\nby centralised management;\n(c)\nby joint management with international organisations.\n2.   Chapter 2 ‘methods of implementation’ of Part I, Title IV of Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 2342/2002 shall apply mutatis mutandis to the implementation the present Chapter.\nSection 2\nDecentralised management\nArticle 21\nAs a general rule, the Commission shall undertake the financial implementation of EDF resources by one of the following:\n(a)\nby means of decentralised management with the ACP States in accordance with the conditions set out in the ACP-EC Agreement and applying the breakdown of responsibilities provided for in Article 57 of that Agreement and Articles 34, 35 and 36 of Annex IV thereto;\n(b)\nby means of decentralised management with the OCTs in accordance with the conditions set out in the Overseas Association Decision and in the measures implementing that Decision.\nArticle 22\n1.   In the context of decentralised management, the Commission shall undertake the financial implementation of EDF resources in accordance with the detailed rules laid down in paragraphs 2, 3 and 4. As provided for in the case of centralised management, the Commission may delegate residual tasks to bodies referred to in Article 25(2) to (5).\n2.   The beneficiary ACP States or OCTs shall:\n(a)\nconduct regular checks to ensure that the actions to be financed by EDF resources have been implemented correctly;\n(b)\ntake appropriate measures to prevent irregularities and fraud and, if necessary, bring legal proceedings to recover funds wrongly paid.\n3.   In order to ensure that funds are used in accordance with the applicable rules and within the limits of powers thereby conferred upon it, the Commission shall apply clearance-of-accounts procedures or financial correction mechanisms which enable it to discharge its obligations under the ACP-EC Agreement, in particular under Article 34(1) of Annex IV thereto, and under the Overseas Association Decision, in particular under Articles 20 and 32 thereof.\n4.   Partner countries and territories to which implementation tasks are delegated shall ensure, in conformity with Article 14(3), adequate annual ex post publication of beneficiaries of funds deriving from the EDF.\nArticle 23\nThe implementation by ACP States and OCTs of operations financed from EDF resources shall be subject to Commission scrutiny.\nThat scrutiny may be exercised by prior approval, by ex post checks or by a combined procedure, in accordance with the provisions of the ACP-EC Agreement, the Overseas Association Decision and the measures implementing that Decision.\nArticle 24\nDepending on the degree of decentralisation provided for in the ACP-EC Agreement, the Overseas Association Decision and the measures implementing that Decision, the Commission shall strive to encourage the beneficiary ACP States and the OCTs to adhere, when exercising the powers entrusted to them under the ACP-EC Agreement and under the Overseas Association Decision, to the principle of sound financial management set out in Article 11, in particular the progressive application of the following criteria:\n(a)\ntransparent procurement and grant-awarded procedures, which are non-discriminatory and exclude any conflict of interests;\n(b)\nan effective and efficient internal control system for the management of operations, which includes effective segregation of the duties of authorising officer and accounting officer or of the equivalent functions;\n(c)\nan accounting system that enables the correct use of EDF resources to be verified and the use of funds to be reflected in the EDF accounts;\n(d)\nan independent external audit exercised by a national institution for independent external auditing;\n(e)\nin the case of the direct-labour operations referred to in Article 101(1), adequate provisions for the management and scrutiny of local imprest accounts and for the definition of the responsibilities of the local imprest manager and the local accounting officer.\nFor the purposes of applying the first subparagraph, the Commission shall, in agreement with the beneficiary ACP States and OCTs, incorporate appropriate provisions in the financing agreements referred to in Article 70(3).\nSection 3\nCentralised management\nArticle 25\n1.   Where the Commission implements EDF resources on a centralised basis, implementation tasks shall be performed either directly by its departments or indirectly, in accordance with paragraphs 2 to 4 of this Article and with Articles 26 to 29.\nIndirect implementation, in accordance with paragraphs 2 to 4 of this Article and with Article 27 to 29 also applies in the case of delegation of residual tasks to bodies referred to in paragraph 3 of this Article in the case of decentralised management.\n2.   The Commission may not delegate to third parties the executive powers it enjoys under the ACP-EC Agreement or the Overseas Association Decision where those powers involve a large measure of discretion implying political choices. The implementing tasks delegated shall be clearly defined and fully supervised as to the use made of them.\nThe delegation of financial implementation tasks shall comply with the principle of sound financial management and shall ensure compliance with the visibility of Community action. No implementation tasks delegated in this way may give rise to conflicts of interests.\n3.   Within the limits laid down in paragraph 2, the Commission may delegate tasks of public authority, and in particular financial implementation tasks, to the following:\n(a)\nthe executive agencies established in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) No 58/2003 (14);\n(b)\nnational public-sector bodies or bodies governed by private law with a public-service mission and providing adequate financial guarantees for the implementation of the tasks assigned to them.\nThe Commission may draw on the EDF resources in order to pay financial compensation to these bodies for the administrative costs incurred.\nThe Commission shall inform annually the Council of the cases, agencies and bodies concerned. It shall provide commensurate motivation of the use of national agencies.\n4.   Implementation of the corresponding EDF resources by an agency referred to in paragraph 3(a) shall be carried out by the director of that agency.\n5.   Where the agencies and bodies referred to in paragraph 3 perform implementation tasks, they shall conduct regular checks to ensure that the actions to be financed from EDF resources have been implemented correctly.\nSuch agencies and bodies shall take appropriate measures to prevent irregularities and fraud and if necessary bring legal proceedings to recover funds wrongly paid or incorrectly used.\nArticle 26\nWhere the Commission implements EDF resources by indirect centralised management, it shall first obtain evidence of the existence and proper operation within the entities to which it entrusts implementation of the following:\n(a)\ntransparent procurement and grant-awarded procedures which are non-discriminatory and exclude any conflict of interest and which are in accordance with Titles V and VII;\n(b)\nan effective and efficient internal control system for the management of operations, which includes effective segregation of the duties of authorising officer and accounting officer or of the equivalent functions;\n(c)\nan accounting system that enables the correct use of EDF resources to be verified and the use of funds to be reflected in the EDF accounts;\n(d)\nan independent external audit;\n(e)\npublic access to information at the level provided for in Community Regulations;\n(f)\nadequate annual ex post publication of beneficiaries of funds deriving from the EDF in conformity with Article 14(3).\nThe Commission may accept that the audit, accounting, procurement and grant-awarded systems of the agencies and bodies referred to in Article 25(3) are equivalent to its own, with due account for internationally accepted standards.\nArticle 27\n1.   The Commission shall ensure supervision, evaluation and control of the implementation of the tasks entrusted. It shall take the equivalence of control systems into account when it carries out controls using its own control systems.\n2.   The European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) shall enjoy the same powers with regard to bodies to which tasks are delegated as it does with regard to Commission departments. The bodies in question shall adopt the necessary measures to help OLAF carry out internal investigations. Any act undertaken by such bodies for the implementation of EDF resources, and in particular any decision or any contract concluded by them, must specifically provide for the same controls as those provided for in Article 70(4).\nArticle 28\nThe Commission may not entrust measures of implementation of funds deriving from EDF resources, such as payment and recovery, to external private-sector entities or bodies except to those referred to in point (b) of the first subparagraph of Article 25(3) or in specific cases where the payments involved are to be made to beneficiaries determined by the Commission, are subject to conditions and amounts fixed by the Commission and do not involve the exercise of discretion by the entity or body making the payments.\nThe tasks which may be entrusted by contract to external private-sector entities or bodies other than those referred to in point (b) of the first subparagraph of Article 25(3) are technical expertise tasks and administrative, preparatory or ancillary tasks involving neither the exercise of public authority nor the use of discretionary powers of judgment.\nSection 4\nJoint management with international organisations\nArticle 29\n1.   Where the Commission implements EDF resources by joint management, certain implementation tasks shall be delegated to international organisations in the following cases:\n(a)\nwherever the Commission and the international organisation are bound by a long-term framework agreement laying down the administrative and financial arrangements for their cooperation;\n(b)\nwherever the Commission and the international organisation elaborate a joint project or programme;\n(c)\nwhere the funds of several donors are pooled and are not earmarked for specific items or categories of expenditure, that is to say, in the case of multi-donor actions.\nThese organisations shall, in their accounting, audit, internal control and procurement procedures, apply standards which offer guarantees equivalent to internationally accepted standards.\n2.   The implementation by international organisations of operations financed from EDF resources shall be subject to scrutiny by the Commission. Such scrutiny shall be exercised by prior approval, by ex post checks or by a combined procedure.\n3.   Individual agreements concluded with international organisations for the award of financing shall contain detailed provisions for the implementation of the tasks entrusted to such international organisations.\n4.   International organisations to which implementation tasks are delegated shall ensure, in conformity with Article 14(3), adequate annual ex post publication of beneficiaries of funds deriving from the EDF.\nCHAPTER 3\nFinancial actors\nArticle 30\nThe Commission shall provide each financial actor with the resources required to perform his duties and a charter describing in detail his tasks, rights and obligations.\nSection 1\nPrinciple of segregation of duties\nArticle 31\nThe duties of authorising officer and accounting officer shall be segregated and mutually incompatible.\nSection 2\nAuthorising officer\nArticle 32\n1.   In the context of the financial implementation of the operations referred to in Article 2, the Commission shall perform the duties of authorising officer.\n2.   The Commission shall determine the staff of an appropriate level to whom it delegates the duties of authorising officer, the scope of the powers delegated and the possibility for the persons to whom these powers are delegated to sub-delegate them.\n3.

However, he may depart from them where justified by the specific nature of the EDF's activities.\n2.   Entries in the accounts shall be made on the basis of the chart of accounts using a nomenclature which makes a clear distinction between the general accounts and the financial accounts.

Movements on the accounts and the balances shall be entered in the accounting ledgers.\n2.   All accounting entries, including adjustments to the accounts, shall be based on supporting documents, to which they shall refer.\n3.   The accounting system shall be such as to leave a trail for all accounting entries.\nArticle 132\nThe accounting officer shall, after the close of the financial year and up to the date of presentation of the accounts, make any adjustments which, without involving disbursement or collection in respect of that year, are necessary for a true and fair presentation of the accounts which complies with the rules.\nArticle 133\n1.   The financial accounts shall provide a detailed record of the financial implementation of EDF resources.\nThey shall show all:\n(a)\nallocations;\n(b)\ncommitments;\n(c)\npayments, and established debts and collection operations for the financial year, in full and without any adjustment against each other.\n2.   When commitments, payments and debts are expressed in national currencies, the accounting system shall make it possible, where necessary, for them to be recorded in national currencies as well as in euro.\n3.   The commitments defined in Article 70 shall be recorded in euro for the value of the financing decisions taken by the Commission.\nThe commitments defined in Article 78(2) shall be recorded in euro at the equivalent of the value of the contracts, grant agreements and programme estimates. That value shall include where appropriate:\n(a)\nprovision for the payment of reimbursable expenses on presentation of supporting documents;\n(b)\nprovision for the revision of prices and contingencies as defined in EDF-funded contracts;\n(c)\nfinancial provision for exchange rate fluctuations.\n4.   All accounting records referring to the fulfilment of a commitment shall be kept for a period of five years from the date of the decision giving discharge in respect of the financial implementation of EDF resources, referred to in Article 142, concerning the financial year during which the commitment was closed for accounting purposes.\nTITLE IX\nEXTERNAL AUDIT AND DISCHARGE\nCHAPTER 1\nGeneral provisions\nArticle 134\nThe operations financed from EDF resources managed by the EIB in accordance with Article 3 shall be subject to the audit and discharge procedures laid down in the Statutes of the EIB for all of its operations.

It shall have the power to make enquiries of any official responsible for a revenue or expenditure operation and to use any of the auditing procedures appropriate to the aforementioned departments or bodies.\nIn order to obtain all the necessary information for the performance of its task, the Court of Auditors may be present, at its request, during the audit operations carried out within the framework of financial implementation by, or on behalf of, the Commission.\nAt the request of the Court of Auditors, the Commission shall authorise financial institutions holding EDF deposits to enable the Court of Auditors to ensure that the external data tally with the accounts.\nIn the performance of its task, the Court of Auditors shall notify the Commission and the authorities to which this Regulation applies of the names of the members of its staff who are empowered to audit them.\nArticle 137\nThe Court of Auditors shall ensure that all securities and cash on deposit or in hand are checked against vouchers signed by the depositories or against official memoranda of cash and securities held. It may carry out such checks itself.\nArticle 138\n1.   The Commission, the bodies administering revenue or expenditure on the EDF behalf and the final beneficiaries of payments from EDF resources shall afford the Court of Auditors all the facilities and give it all the information which the Court of Auditors considers necessary for the performance of its task.

The task of establishing that the revenue has been received and the expenditure incurred in a lawful and proper manner and that the financial management has been sound shall extend to the utilisation, by bodies outside the Commission, of EDF resources received by way of grants.\n5.   Financing from EDF resources paid to beneficiaries outside the Commission shall be subject to the agreement in writing by the beneficiaries or, failing agreement on their part, by the contractors or subcontractors, to an audit by the Court of Auditors of the use made of the financing granted.\n6.   Use of integrated computer systems may not have the effect of reducing the access of the Court of Auditors to the supporting documents.\n7.

It shall also examine the annual report made by the Court of Auditors together with the Commission's replies, any relevant special reports by the Court of Auditors in respect of the financial year in question and the Court of Auditors' statement of assurance as to the reliability of the accounts and the legality and regularity of the underlying transactions.\n3.   The Commission shall submit to the European Parliament, at the latter's request, any information required for the control of implementation of the EDF resources managed by the Commission in accordance with Article 2 for the year in question.\nAccess to confidential information and the arrangements for handling it shall comply with fundamental rights, the protection of business secrecy, the provisions governing judicial and disciplinary proceedings and the interests of the Community.\nArticle 144\n1.

The 1957 Treaty of Rome made provision for its creation with a view to granting technical and financial assistance, initially to African countries with which some Member States had historical links.\nEven though a heading has been reserved for the Fund in the European Union (EU) budget since 1993 following a request by the European Parliament, the EDF does not yet come under the EU general budget. It is funded by the Member States, is subject to its own financial rules and is managed by a specific committee. The aid granted to ACP States and OCTs will continue to be funded by the EDF, at least for the period 2014-2020.\nEach EDF is concluded for a period of several years. Since the conclusion of the first partnership convention in 1964, the EDF cycles have generally followed the partnership agreement/convention cycles.\n1st EDF: 1959-1964\n2nd EDF: 1964-1970 (Yaoundé I Convention)\n3rd EDF: 1970-1975 (Yaoundé II Convention)\n4th EDF: 1975-1980 (Lomé I Convention)\n5th EDF: 1980-1985 (Lomé II Convention)\n6th EDF: 1985-1990 (Lomé III Convention)\n7th EDF: 1990-1995 (Lomé IV Convention)\n8th EDF: 1995-2000 (Lomé IV Convention and the revised Lomé IV)\n9th EDF: 2000-2007 (Cotonou Agreement)\n10th EDF: 2008-2013 (Revised Cotonou Agreement)\n11th EDF: 2014-2020 (Revised Cotonou Agreement).\nThe Stabex and Sysmin instruments designed to help the agricultural and mining sectors were abolished by the new partnership agreement signed in Cotonou in June 2000. This agreement also streamlined the EDF and introduced a system of rolling programming, making for greater flexibility and giving the ACP States greater responsibility.\nThe 9th EDF was allocated €13.5 billion for the period 2000-2007. In addition, the unspent balances from previous EDFs total €9.9 billion.\nACP-EC Council of Ministers Decision No 6/2005 of 22 November 2005 commits €482 million of the conditional 1 billion to the ninth European Development Fund. This amount is allocated as follows: €352 million to support long-term development, €48 million for regional cooperation and integration and €82 million for the investment facility. Furthermore, a second instalment of €250 million for the ACP-EU Water Facility was established by ACP-EC Council of Ministers Decision No 7/2005.\nThe development aid provided by the EDF forms part of a broader European framework. Within the European Union, the funds of the Community's general budget may be used for certain types of aid. Moreover, in addition to managing part of the EDF's resources (loans and risk capital), the European Investment Bank (EIB) will contribute a total of €1.7 billion from own resources for the period covered by the ninth EDF.\nThe 10th EDF covered the period from 2008 to 2013 and provided an overall budget of €22,682 million. Of this amount, €21,966 million were allocated to the ACP countries, €286 million to the OCT and €430 million to the Commission as support expenditure for programming and implementation of the EDF. The amount for the ACP countries is divided accordingly: €17, 766 million to the national and regional indicative programmes, €2,700 million to intra-ACP and intra-regional cooperation and €1,500 million to Investment Facilities. An increased share of the budget is devoted to regional programmes, thereby emphasising the importance of regional economic integration as the basic framework for national and local development. An innovation in the 10th EDF was the creation of ‘incentive amounts’ for each country.\nThe Member States have their own bilateral agreements and implement their own initiatives with developing countries that are not financed by the EDF or any other Community funds.\nThe 11th EDF will run between 2014 and 2020: it amounts to €30.5 billion and an additional €2.6 billion will be made available by the European Investment Bank in the form of loans from its own resources.\nIn June 2013, EU countries reached an internal agreement setting up 11th EDF, including the revised sharing out of contributions between them; this internal agreement still needs to be ratified. Council Decision 2013/759/EU lays down transitional EDF management measures until the entry into force of the 11th EDF.\nREFERENCES\nAct\nEntry into force\nDeadline for transposition in the Member States\nOfficial Journal\nRegulation (EC) No 215/2008\n20.3.2008\n-\nOJ L 78 of 19.3.2008, p. 1-34\nDecision 2013/759/EU\n1.1.2014\n-\nOJ L335, 14.12.2013, p. 48-49\nlast update 29.04.2014", "tags": ["financial regulation", "EDF"], "subjects": ["Financial provisions", "European Development Fund (EDF)"], "split": "train", "reference_annotations": {}, "summary_annotations": {}}
