The consequences of the illicit manufacture, transfer and circulation of small arms and light weapons (SALW) and their excessive accumulation and uncontrolled spread are central to four of these five challenges.\n(2)\nOn 15-16 December 2005, the Council adopted the EU Strategy to combat the illicit accumulation and trafficking of SALW and their ammunition (EU SALW Strategy). The EU SALW Strategy promotes the development of a policy for actively combating illicit network trafficking in SALW (illicit brokers and carriers) using the Union’s air, sea and land space, by devising alert and cooperation mechanisms.\n(3)\nThe Action Plan of the EU SALW Strategy also underlines the need to improve the impact of missions of crisis management by including in their mandate measures aiming at the establishment of border controls (or control of the air, land and sea space of the conflict zone) and disarmament.\n(4)\nThe EU Council Working Party on Global Disarmament and Arms Controls (CODUN) and the EU Joint Situation Centre (SitCen) have, since 2007, developed an EU initiative to hinder illicit trafficking of SALW by air transport, by enhancing the exchange, among Member States, of relevant information on suspected air-carriers. In establishing such a system of exchange of information, CODUN and SitCen have been collaborating with the Stockholm International Peace and Research Institute (SIPRI) and its Countering Illicit Trafficking – Mechanism Assessment Project (CIT – MAP). Within the framework of this initiative, CODUN recently agreed to consider ways to render this EU initiative more operational and effective, by ensuring the timely updating and processing of relevant information.\n(5)\nThe risk posed to international security by the illicit trade of SALW via air was also recognised by other international and regional organisations. The OSCE Forum on Security and cooperation held a special session in 2007 devoted to this topic and the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly adopted in 2008 a resolution calling for the completion, adoption and implementation of an OSCE Best Practice Guide on the illicit air transportation of SALW. Similarly, Participating States in the Wassenaar Arrangement adopted in 2007 ‘Best practices to prevent destabilising transfers of SALW through air transport’. In addition, numerous UN Security Council Sanctions Committee Group of Expert reports on West Africa and the Great Lakes region have repeatedly documented the key role played by air cargo companies involved in illicit SALW trafficking.\n(6)\nThe action foreseen in this Decision does not pursue any objectives related to the improvement of air transport safety,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\nArticle 1\n1.   With a view to the implementation of the EU Strategy to combat the illicit accumulation and trafficking of SALW and their ammunition (EU SALW Strategy), the Union shall pursue the following objectives:\n(a)\nimproving tools and techniques, at the disposal of relevant crisis management missions, international and third countries’ national authorities and Member States, to effectively screen and target suspect air cargo aircrafts likely to be involved in illicit trade of SALW via air within, from or to third States;\n(b)\nincreasing awareness and technical expertise on the part of relevant international and national personnel, of ‘best practices’ in the areas of monitoring, detection and risk management analysis against air cargo carriers suspected of SALW trafficking via air within, from or to third States.\n2.   In order to achieve the objectives referred to in paragraph 1, the Union shall undertake the following measures:\n(a)\nthe development and field testing of a pilot air trafficking risk management dedicated software for relevant crisis management missions, and international and national authorities, including a regularly updated database on, inter alia, air companies, aircraft, registration numbers and transportation routings;\n(b)\nthe development and field testing of a secure pilot risk management and information dissemination system;\n(c)\nthe development and publication of a manual and accompanying training material, as well as the provision of technical assistance to facilitate the use and adaptation of the pilot software and of the secure risk management and information system, including through the organisation of regional seminars to train relevant crisis management missions, and international and national authorities.\nA detailed description of the project is set out in the Annex.\nArticle 2\n1.

WATHELET\nANNEX\n1.   General Framework\nThis Decision builds on the CODUN initiative to address the threats posed by the trafficking of SALW and other destabilising commodities via air. Within the context of the CODUN initiative, this Decision follows on from projects undertaken by the Council in collaboration with SitCen, the Club of Budapest and SIPRI. This Decision provides for software, pilot implementation systems, training and outreach programmes, for relevant crisis management missions, as well as international and national authorities, in order to better monitor, update and disseminate information on suspect air cargo actors operating in Africa and from other regions. In the implementation of this Decision, good coordination with other relevant projects financed in the framework of Community programmes and other Council Decisions, should be ensured in order to increase the impact of the Union’s action in preventing the illicit trade of SALW.\n2.   Objectives\nThe projects described below will address three areas identified by CODUN and other stakeholders involved in the EU initiative to combat SALW trafficking via air:\n(a)\nthe need to develop a secure system for providing updates on companies and aircrafts which routinely reregister assets and relocate businesses in their efforts to avoid detection;\n(b)\nthe provision of risk-management software and training to allow relevant crisis management missions, and international and national authorities to more effectively monitor and screen an increasing number of air cargo actors suspected of involvement in SALW trafficking or the movement of other destabilising commodity flows via air;\n(c)\nthe need to provide training and technical support to, and raise awareness in multilateral organisations, missions, regional bodies and states in Africa and other regions in order to strengthen their ability to monitor and detect actors involved in SALW trafficking or the movement of other destabilising commodities via air.\n3.   Project description\n3.1.   Project 1: Creating a software package and implementing a pilot project to monitor, update and disseminate information on air cargo actors suspected of illicit SALW trafficking\n3.1.1.   Project objective\nThe project aims at improving tools and techniques at the disposal of relevant crisis management missions, international and third countries’ national authorities, and Member States, to effectively screen and target suspect air cargo aircrafts likely to be involved in the illicit trade of SALW via air, within, from or to third States.\n3.1.2.   Project description\nIn the framework of this project, the following activities will be undertaken:\n(a)\nthe development of an air trafficking risk management software package for multilateral organisations, missions and selected third countries;\n(b)\nthe development of a secure pilot risk management and information dissemination package system;\n(c)\nthe field testing of the software package in consultation with the HR and relevant Council bodies;\n(d)\nthe field testing of the information dissemination package system in consultation with the HR and relevant Council bodies;\n(e)\nthe development of a manual and accompanying training material to facilitate the use and adoption of the systems described in points (a) and (b) by relevant crisis management missions, international and third countries’ national authorities, and Member States;\n(f)\nthe presentation of the final software and associated manual and training material in a concluding workshop where relevant stakeholders will be invited to participate (up to 80 people).\nThe project will be implemented over an appropriate time period which takes into consideration the need to consult and coordinate with the various stakeholders, under the control of the HR. The project will be implemented in six phases.\nPreparatory Phase\nSIPRI, in consultation with relevant Council bodies and under the control of the HR, will develop a software package, risk management tools, as well as an information and disaggregated data dissemination package system, using relevant information technology (IT) options.\nData Input Phase\nUsing open source information only, the project will input data from the relevant sources to build comprehensive databases, capable of providing sufficient information to support accurate risk management, detection and profiling tools.\nAssessment Phase\nSIPRI, in consultation with relevant Council bodies and under the control of the HR, will undertake an assessment of various sites, regions, organisations and missions where the pilot package using open-source data may be field tested under optimum conditions.\nField Testing phase\nSIPRI, in consultation with relevant Council bodies and under the control of the HR, will undertake a field testing phase in conjunction with partners identified in the assessment phase.\nEvaluation and adapting phase\nFollowing field testing, SIPRI will evaluate and adapt the software to take into account the experience and lessons learned from the field testing phase. This will result in a final product to be made available with the agreement of the various stakeholders.\nPresentation phase\nThe final version of the software and of the training material will be presented in a dedicated event to relevant stakeholders (up to 80 people) who were involved in its development and were identified as final users of the software.\n3.1.3.   Project results\nThe project will:\n(a)\nstrengthen the ability of relevant crisis management missions, international and third countries’ national authorities, and Member States, to monitor the activities of air cargo actors suspected of SALW trafficking via air;\n(b)\nprovide the tools and pilot systems necessary to increase the number of interdictions of suspected illicit SALW shipments, shipped via air by multilateral organisations, missions and states in Africa and other regions;\n(c)\nincrease the ability of Member States to securely share information on air cargo actors through disaggregated data techniques and other profiling mechanisms.\n3.1.4.   Project beneficiaries\nThe beneficiaries of the project will be relevant personnel from crisis management missions and national and international authorities. The selection of specific beneficiaries to test the pilot software package will take into account variables such as the presence of European or multilateral crisis management missions in the field, the need to maximise resources, the availability of assistance at local level, political will and the capacity of local and national authorities to counter the illicit trade of SALW via air. SIPRI will propose a shortlist of beneficiaries which will then be endorsed by the HR in consultation with the competent Council bodies.\n3.2.
