{"celex_id": "32004R0785", "reference": "30.4.2004\nEN\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\nL 138/1\nREGULATION (EC) No 785/2004 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL\nof 21 April 2004\non insurance requirements for air carriers and aircraft operators\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 80(2) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the Commission (1),\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee (2),\nAfter consulting the Committee of the Regions,\nActing in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty (3),\nWhereas:\n(1)\nIn the framework of the common transport policy, and in order to foster consumer protection, it is important to ensure a proper minimum level of insurance to cover liability of air carriers in respect of passengers, baggage, cargo and third parties.\n(2)\nIn the Community aviation market, the distinction between national and international air transport has been eliminated and it is, therefore, appropriate to establish minimum insurance requirements for Community air carriers.\n(3)\nCommon action is necessary to ensure that these requirements also apply to air carriers from third countries in order to ensure a level playing field with Community air carriers.\n(4)\nIn its Communication of 10 October 2001 regarding the repercussions of the terrorist attacks in the United States on the air transport industry, the Commission stated its intention to examine the amounts and conditions of insurance required for the grant of operating licences by Member States in order to ensure a harmonised approach. Moreover, in its Communication of 2 July 2002 regarding insurance in the air transport sector following the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001 in the United States, the Commission stated that it would continue to monitor the developments on the aviation insurance market with regard to the revision of the amounts and conditions of insurance required for the grant of operating licences by Member States.\n(5)\nBy Council Decision 2001/539/EC (4) the Community concluded the Convention for the Unification of Certain Rules Relating to International Carriage by Air, agreed at Montreal on 28 May 1999 (Montreal Convention), which lays down new rules on liability in respect of the international carriage by air of persons, baggage and cargo. These rules are expected to replace those of the Warsaw Convention of 1929 and its subsequent amendments.\n(6)\nArticle 50 of the Montreal Convention requires parties to ensure that air carriers are adequately insured to cover liability under that Convention. Warsaw Convention of 1929 and its subsequent amendments will continue to exist alongside the Montreal Convention for an indefinite period. Both Conventions provide for the possibility of unlimited liability.\n(7)\nArticle 7 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2407/92 of 23 July 1992 on licensing of air carriers (5), requires air carriers to be insured to cover liability in case of accidents, in particular in respect of passengers, baggage, cargo, mail and third parties, albeit without specifying minimum amounts and conditions of insurance.\n(8)\nIt is appropriate to take into account the fact that the European Civil Aviation Conference adopted on 13 December 2000 Resolution ECAC/25-1 on minimum levels of insurance cover for passenger and third party liability, which was modified on 27 November 2002.\n(9)\nIt is necessary to define minimum insurance requirements to cover passengers, baggage, cargo and third parties for air carriers and aircraft operators flying within, into, out of, or over the territory of a Member State, including its territorial waters.\n(10)\nInsurance obligations should remain with air carriers with a valid operating licence, and, in the case of Community air carriers, with a valid operating licence granted in accordance with Regulation (EEC) No 2407/92. The absence or expiry of such licence does not relieve the undertaking from such obligation.\n(11)\nWhile the Montreal Convention specifically regulates liability in respect of passengers, baggage and cargo, the liability for mail is, according to Article 2 of that Convention, to be subject to ‘the rules applicable to the relationship between the carriers and the postal administrations’. In the Community, insurance for such liability is sufficiently regulated by Article 7 of Regulation (EEC) No 2407/92.\n(12)\nMandatory insurance should not be required for State aircraft and for certain other types of aircraft.\n(13)\nMinimum insurance cover should be provided in situations where an air carrier or aircraft operator is liable in respect of passengers, baggage, cargo and third parties in accordance with rules of international Conventions, Community or national law, without interfering with such rules.\n(14)\nThe insurance should cover aviation-specific liability in respect of passengers, baggage, cargo and third parties. Regarding passengers, baggage and cargo, insurance should include cover for death and personal injury caused by accidents and for loss or destruction of or damage to baggage and cargo. Regarding third parties, insurance should include cover for death, personal injury and damage to property caused by accidents.\n(15)\nThis Regulation should not be interpreted as requiring double insurance. As far as the contracting carrier and the actual carrier within the meaning of Article 39 of the Montreal Convention can be held liable for the same damage, Member States may establish specific measures to avoid double insurance.\n(16)\nWhile the market practice of offering insurance on an aggregate basis may be conducive to insurability, in particular for risks of war and terrorism, by allowing insurers better control over their liabilities, this practice does not release an air carrier or aircraft operator from the obligation to respect minimum insurance requirements when the aggregate fixed by its insurance contract is reached.\n(17)\nIt is necessary to require air carriers to provide evidence that they respect at all times the minimum insurance requirements to cover liability, as provided for in this Regulation. With regard to Community air carriers and with regard to aircraft operators using aircraft registered in the Community, depositing evidence of insurance in one Member State should be sufficient for all Member States, such insurance being effected by an undertaking authorised to do so under the applicable law.\n(18)\nWith respect to overflights of the territory of a Member State by non-Community air carriers or aircraft registered outside the Community which do not involve a landing on or take-off from any Member State, any overflown Member State may, in accordance with international law, request evidence of compliance with the insurance requirements of this Regulation, for example by carrying out random checks.\n(19)\nThe minimum insurance requirements should be reviewed after a period of time.\n(20)\nProcedures for monitoring the application of the minimum insurance requirements should be transparent and non-discriminatory and should not impede the free movement of goods, persons, services and capital.\n(21)\nThe measures necessary for the implementation of this Regulation should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission (6).\n(22)\nWhere further rules are required to establish adequate insurance covering aviation-specific liability on points which are not covered by this Regulation, the Member States should have the possibility to introduce such rules.\n(23)\nArrangements for greater cooperation over the use of Gibraltar airport were agreed in London on 2 December 1987 by the Kingdom of Spain and the United Kingdom in a joint declaration by the Ministers of Foreign Affairs of the two countries. Such arrangements have yet to enter into operation.\n(24)\nSince the objective of this Regulation, namely the introduction of minimum insurance requirements which can contribute to the objectives of the internal aviation market by reducing distortions of competition, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve that objective,\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nArticle 1\nObjective\n1.   The objective of this Regulation is to establish minimum insurance requirements for air carriers and aircraft operators in respect of passengers, baggage, cargo and third parties.\n2.

The application of this Regulation to the airport of Gibraltar is understood to be without prejudice to the respective legal positions of the Kingdom of Spain and the United Kingdom with regard to the dispute over sovereignty over the territory in which the airport is situated.\n4.   Application of this Regulation to Gibraltar airport shall be suspended until the arrangements included in the Joint Declaration made by the Foreign Ministers of the Kingdom of Spain and the United Kingdom on 2 December 1987 enter into operation. The Governments of Spain and the United Kingdom will inform the Council of such date of entry into operation.\nArticle 3\nDefinitions\nFor the purposes of this Regulation:\n(a)\n   \n‘air carrier’\n means an air transport undertaking with a valid operating licence;\n(b)\n   \n‘Community air carrier’\n means an air carrier with a valid operating licence granted by a Member State in accordance with Regulation (EEC) No 2407/92;\n(c)\n   \n‘aircraft operator’\n means the person or entity, not being an air carrier, who has continual effective disposal of the use or operation of the aircraft; the natural or legal person in whose name the aircraft is registered shall be presumed to be the operator, unless that person can prove that another person is the operator;\n(d)\n   ‘flight’ means:\n—\nwith regard to passengers and unchecked baggage, the period of transport of the passengers by aircraft including their boarding and disembarkation,\n—\nwith regard to cargo and checked baggage, the period of transport of baggage and cargo from the moment the baggage or cargo is handed to the air carrier until the moment of delivery to the entitled recipient,\n—\nwith regard to third parties, the use of an aircraft from the moment when power is applied to its engines for the purpose of taxiing or actual take-off until the moment when it is on the surface and its engines have come to a complete stop; additionally, it shall mean the moving of an aircraft by towing and push-back vehicles or by powers which are typical for the drive and the lift of aircraft, particularly air streams;\n(e)\n   \n‘SDR’\n means a Special Drawing Right as defined by the International Monetary Fund;\n(f)\n   \n‘MTOM’\n means the Maximum Take Off Mass, which corresponds to a certified amount specific to all aircraft types, as stated in the certificate of airworthiness of the aircraft;\n(g)\n   \n‘passenger’\n means any person who is on a flight with the consent of the air carrier or the aircraft operator, excluding on-duty members of both the flight crew and the cabin crew;\n(h)\n   \n‘third party’\n means any legal or natural person, excluding passengers and on-duty members of both the flight crew and the cabin crew;\n(i)\n   \n‘commercial operation’\n means an operation for remuneration and/or hire.\nArticle 4\nPrinciples of insurance\n1.
