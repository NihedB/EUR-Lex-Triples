The United States, the European Union, and its Member States shall take all necessary and appropriate measures within their authority to carry out the provisions and achieve the purpose of this Agreement.\nArticle 2\nScope of application\nThis Agreement applies to the obtaining and use of financial payment messaging and related data with a view to the prevention, investigation, detection, or prosecution of:\n(a)\nacts of a person or entity that involve violence, or are otherwise dangerous to human life or create a risk of damage to property or infrastructure, and which, given their nature and context, are reasonably believed to be committed with the aim of:\n(i)\nintimidating or coercing a population;\n(ii)\nintimidating, compelling, or coercing a government or international organisation to act or abstain from acting; or\n(iii)\nseriously destabilising or destroying the fundamental political, constitutional, economic, or social structures of a country or an international organisation;\n(b)\na person or entity assisting, sponsoring, or providing financial, material, or technological support for, or financial or other services to or in support of, acts described in subparagraph (a);\n(c)\na person or entity providing or collecting funds, by any means, directly or indirectly, with the intention that they should be used or in the knowledge that they are to be used, in full or in part, in order to carry out any of the acts described in subparagraphs (a) or (b); or\n(d)\na person or entity aiding, abetting, or attempting acts described in subparagraphs (a), (b), or (c).\nArticle 3\nEnsuring provision of data by Designated Providers\nThe Parties, jointly and individually, shall ensure, in accordance with this Agreement and in particular Article 4, that entities jointly designated by the Parties under this Agreement as providers of international financial payment messaging services (Designated Providers) provide to the U.S. Treasury Department requested financial payment messaging and related data which are necessary for the purpose of the prevention, investigation, detection, or prosecution of terrorism or terrorist financing (Provided Data). The Designated Providers shall be identified in the Annex to this Agreement and may be updated, as necessary, by exchange of diplomatic notes. Any amendments to the Annex shall be duly published in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nArticle 4\nU.S. Requests to obtain data from Designated Providers\n1.   For the purposes of this Agreement, the U.S. Treasury Department shall serve production orders (Requests), under authority of U.S. law, upon a Designated Provider present in the territory of the United States in order to obtain data necessary for the purpose of the prevention, investigation, detection, or prosecution of terrorism or terrorist financing that are stored in the territory of the European Union.\n2.

The Designated Provider shall thereupon provide the data (i.e., on a ‘push basis’) directly to the U.S. Treasury Department. The Designated Provider shall keep a detailed log of all data transmitted to the U.S. Treasury Department for the purposes of this Agreement.\n7.   Once the data have been provided pursuant to these procedures, the Designated Provider shall be deemed to have complied with this Agreement and with all other applicable legal requirements in the European Union related to the transfer of such data from the European Union to the United States.\n8.   Designated Providers shall have all administrative and judicial redress available under U.S. law to recipients of U.S. Treasury Department Requests.\n9.

In the latter case the competent authorities of the concerned Member State shall be informed of the matter at the earliest opportunity;\n(e)\nin sharing such information, the U.S. Treasury Department shall request that the information shall be deleted by the recipient authority as soon as it is no longer necessary for the purpose for which it was shared; and\n(f)\neach onward transfer shall be duly logged.\nArticle 8\nAdequacy\nSubject to ongoing compliance with the commitments on privacy and protection of personal data set out in this Agreement, the U.S. Treasury Department is deemed to ensure an adequate level of data protection for the processing of financial payment messaging and related data transferred from the European Union to the United States for the purposes of this Agreement.\nArticle 9\nSpontaneous provision of information\n1.   The U.S. Treasury Department shall ensure the availability, as soon as practicable and in the most expedient manner, to law enforcement, public security, or counter terrorism authorities of concerned Member States, and, as appropriate, to Europol and Eurojust, within the remit of their respective mandates, of information obtained through the TFTP that may contribute to the investigation, prevention, detection, or prosecution by the European Union of terrorism or its financing. Any follow-on information that may contribute to the investigation, prevention, detection, or prosecution by the United States of terrorism or its financing shall be conveyed back to the United States on a reciprocal basis and in a reciprocal manner.\n2.   In order to facilitate the efficient exchange of information, Europol may designate a liaison officer to the U.S. Treasury Department.

The U.S. Treasury Department shall promptly conduct a search in accordance with Article 5 and provide relevant information in response to such requests.\nArticle 11\nCooperation with future equivalent EU system\n1.   During the course of this Agreement, the European Commission will carry out a study into the possible introduction of an equivalent EU system allowing for a more targeted transfer of data.\n2.   If, following this study, the European Union decides to establish an EU system, the United States shall cooperate and provide assistance and advice to contribute to the effective establishment of such a system.\n3.   Since the establishment of an EU system could substantially change the context of this Agreement, if the European Union decides to establish such a system, the Parties should consult to determine whether this Agreement would need to be adjusted accordingly. In that regard, U.S. and EU authorities shall cooperate to ensure the complementariness and efficiencies of the U.S. and EU systems in a manner that further enhances the security of citizens of the United States, the European Union, and elsewhere.

At the same time, it sends a copy of these documents to Europol, which checks that the request complies with the requirements of the agreement and notifies the designated provider accordingly. Once the compliance of the request is confirmed, it will have binding legal effect and the designated provider is required to transfer the requested data to the US Treasury Department.\nThe US Treasury Department must ensure that certain safeguards, particularly in relation to the protection of personal data, are applied when the data provided are processed. The data may only be processed for the purpose of preventing, investigating, detecting or prosecuting terrorism or terrorist financing. It must be secured from unauthorised access, disclosure and loss, as well as from any unauthorised form of processing. A search of the data provided may only be carried out where there is pre-existing information or evidence indicating that the subject of the search might be connected to terrorism or its financing. All searches and the reasons for them must be recorded.\nThe US Treasury Department must delete non-extracted data: no longer necessary for the fight against terrorism, based on (at least) an annual evaluation;transmitted without having been requested;by 20 July 2012 at the latest, if it was received before 20 July 2007;no later than 5 years after receipt, if it was received after 20 July 2007.\nExtracted data may be retained for only as long as is necessary to fulfil the purpose for which it was requested. The agreement also defines safeguards to limit the onward transfers of extracted data.\nThe US Treasury Department must make information from the TFTP that may contribute to the EU’s actions against terrorism available to the relevant authorities of the EU countries concerned and, as appropriate, to Europol and Eurojust. Similarly, if any additional information is thought to be necessary to the US’s fight against terrorism, it must be conveyed back. To facilitate these exchanges of information, a Europol liaison officer may be delegated to the US Treasury Department.\nA relevant EU national authority, Europol or Eurojust may ask US Treasury Department to search data acquired through the TFTP and to transfer relevant information if there is reason to believe that a person or entity is connected to terrorism or its financing as defined by Directive (EU) 2017/541 on combating terrorism and Directive (EU) 2015/849 on the prevention of the use of the financial system for money laundering.\nDuring the term of the agreement, the European Commission is to examine the options available for establishing an EU system equivalent to that of the US TFTP. Once a European system is established, there will be the need to review and possibly modify this agreement and ensure the systems are complementary.\nIndependent overseers monitor compliance with the limitations and safeguards of the agreement. They have the authority to review, query and block searches of data provided, as well as to request additional justifications on the connection to terrorism. One of these overseers is appointed by the Commission.\nVia the national data protection authority, a person has the right to request confirmation that his or her personal data have been processed in compliance with data protection rights under Directive (EU) 2016/680 on protecting personal data when being used by police and criminal justice authorities. Disclosure of this information may be refused or restricted if necessary for the fight against terrorism or the protection of public or national security. In such cases, a written explanation will be given to the person, together with information on the possibility to seek administrative and judicial redress in the US. A person also has the right to request the rectification, erasure or blocking of inaccurate or wrongly processed personal data. To maintain the accuracy of information received or transmitted under this agreement, the data may be supplemented, deleted or corrected by each party. The US Treasury Department provides information on the TFTP on a public website, including on the right of redress.\nFROM WHEN DO THE AGREEMENT AND DECISION APPLY?\n              \nThe decision has applied since 13 July 2010. The agreement entered into force on 1 August 2010 for a period of 5 years. After that, it is automatically extended for subsequent periods of one year, unless one of the parties notifies of its intention not to extend it.\nBACKGROUND\n              \nFor more information, see:\nTerrorist Finance Tracking Programme  (European Commission).\nKEY TERMS\n              \nDesignated providers: providers of international financial payment messaging services.\nMAIN DOCUMENTS\n            \nAgreement between the European Union and the United States of America on the processing and transfer of Financial Messaging Data from the European Union to the United States for the purposes of the Terrorist Finance Tracking Program (OJ L 195, 27.7.2010, pp. 5-14)\nCouncil Decision 2010/412/EU of 13 July 2010 on the conclusion of the Agreement between the European Union and the United States of America on the processing and transfer of Financial Messaging Data from the European Union to the United States for the purposes of the Terrorist Finance Tracking Program (OJ L 195, 27.7.2010, pp. 3-4)\nSuccessive amendments to Decision 2010/412/EU have been incorporated in the original document.
