Any Party introducing or modifying any import licensing procedure shall make all relevant information available online on an official website. That information shall be made available, whenever practicable, at least 21 days prior to the date of the application of the new or modified licensing procedure and in any event no later than the date of application. That information shall contain the data required under Article 5 of the Import Licensing Agreement.\n6.   At the request of the other Party, a Party shall promptly provide any relevant information regarding any import licensing procedures that it intends to adopt or that it maintains, including the information referred to in Articles 1 to 3 of the Import Licensing Agreement.\n7.   For greater certainty, nothing in this Article requires a Party to grant an import licence, or prevents a Party from implementing its obligations or commitments under United Nations Security Council Resolutions or under multilateral non-proliferation regimes and import control arrangements.\nArticle 29\nExport licensing procedures\n1.   Each Party shall publish any new export licensing procedure, or any modification to an existing export licensing procedure, in such a manner as to enable governments, traders and other interested parties to become acquainted with them. Such publication shall take place, whenever practicable, 45 days before the procedure or modification takes effect, and in any case no later than the date such procedure or modification takes effect and, where appropriate, publication shall take place on any relevant government websites.\n2.   The publication of export licensing procedures shall include the following information:\n(a)\nthe texts of the Party's export licensing procedures, or of any modifications the Party makes to those procedures;\n(b)\nthe goods subject to each licensing procedure;\n(c)\nfor each procedure, a description of the process for applying for a licence and any criteria an applicant must meet to be eligible to apply for a licence, such as possessing an activity licence, establishing or maintaining an investment, or operating through a particular form of establishment in a Party's territory;\n(d)\na contact point or points from which interested persons can obtain further information on the conditions for obtaining an export licence;\n(e)\nthe administrative body or bodies to which an application or other relevant documentation are to be submitted;\n(f)\na description of any measure or measures being implemented through the export licensing procedure;\n(g)\nthe period during which each export licensing procedure will be in effect, unless the procedure remains in effect until withdrawn or revised in a new publication;\n(h)\nif the Party intends to use a licensing procedure to administer an export quota, the overall quantity and, if applicable, the value of the quota and the opening and closing dates of the quota; and\n(i)\nany exemptions or exceptions that replace the requirement to obtain an export licence, how to request or use those exemptions or exceptions, and the criteria for granting them.\n3.   Within 45 days after the date of entry into force of this Agreement, each Party shall notify the other Party of its existing export licensing procedures. Each Party shall notify to the other Party any new export licensing procedures and any modifications to existing export licensing procedures within 60 days of publication. The notification shall include a reference to the sources where the information required pursuant to paragraph 2 is published and shall include, where appropriate, the address of the relevant government websites.\n4.   For greater certainty, nothing in this Article requires a Party to grant an export licence, or prevents a Party from implementing its commitments under United Nations Security Council Resolutions as well as under multilateral non-proliferation regimes and export control arrangements including the Wassenaar Arrangement on Export Controls for Conventional Arms and Dual-Use Goods and Technologies, the Australia Group, the Nuclear Suppliers Group, and the Missile Technology Control Regime, or from adopting, maintaining or implementing independent sanctions regimes.\nArticle 30\nCustoms valuation\nEach Party shall determine the customs value of goods of the other Party imported into its territory in accordance with Article VII of GATT 1994 and the Customs Valuation Agreement. To that end, Article VII of GATT 1994 including its Notes and Supplementary Provisions, and Articles 1 to 17 of the Customs Valuation Agreement including its Interpretative Notes, are incorporated into and made part of this Agreement, mutatis mutandis.\nArticle 31\nPreference utilisation\n1.   For the purpose of monitoring the functioning of this Agreement and calculating preference utilisation rates, the Parties shall annually exchange import statistics for a 10 year-long period starting one year after the entry into force of this Agreement. Unless the Trade Partnership Committee decides otherwise, this period shall be automatically extended for five years, and thereafter the Trade Partnership Committee may decide to extend it further.\n2.   The exchange of import statistics shall cover data pertaining to the most recent year available, including value and, where applicable, volume, at the tariff line level for imports of goods of the other Party benefitting from preferential duty treatment under this Agreement and for those that receive non-preferential treatment.\nArticle 32\nTrade remedies\n1.   The Parties affirm their rights and obligations under Article VI of GATT 1994, the Anti-Dumping Agreement, the SCM Agreement, Article XIX of GATT 1994, the Safeguards Agreement, and Article 5 of the Agreement on Agriculture.\n2.   Chapter 2 of this Title does not apply to anti-dumping, countervailing and safeguard investigations and measures.\n3.   Each Party shall apply anti-dumping and countervailing measures in accordance with the requirements of the Anti-Dumping Agreement and the SCM Agreement, and pursuant to a fair and transparent process.\n4.   Provided it does not unnecessarily delay the conduct of the investigation, each interested party in an anti-dumping or countervailing investigation (1) shall be granted a full opportunity to defend its interests.\n5.   Each Party's investigating authority may, in accordance with the Party's law, consider whether the amount of the anti-dumping duty to be imposed shall be the full margin of dumping or a lesser amount.\n6.   Each Party's investigating authority shall, in accordance with the Party's law, consider information provided as to whether imposing an anti-dumping or a countervailing duty would not be in the public interest.\n7.   A Party shall not apply or maintain, with respect to the same good, at the same time:\n(a)\na measure pursuant to Article 5 of the Agreement on Agriculture; and\n(b)\na measure pursuant to Article XIX of GATT 1994 and the Safeguards Agreement.\n8.   Title I of Part Six does not apply to paragraphs 1 to 6 of this Article.\nArticle 33\nUse of existing WTO tariff rate quotas\n1.   Products originating in one Party shall not be eligible to be imported into the other Party under existing WTO Tariff Rate Quotas (\"TRQs\") as defined in paragraph 2. This shall include those TRQs as being apportioned between the Parties pursuant to Article XXVIII GATT negotiations initiated by the European Union in WTO document G/SECRET/42/Add.2 and by the United Kingdom in WTO document G/SECRET/44 and as set out in each Party's respective internal legislation. For the purposes of this Article, the originating status of the products shall be determined on the basis of non-preferential rules of origin applicable in the importing Party.\n2.   For the purposes of paragraph 1, \"existing WTO TRQs\" means those tariff rate quotas which are WTO concessions of the European Union included in the draft EU28 schedule of concessions and commitments under GATT 1994 submitted to the WTO in document G/MA/TAR/RS/506 as amended by documents G/MA/TAR/RS/506/Add.1 and G/MA/TAR/RS/506/Add.2.\nArticle 34\nMeasures in case of breaches or circumventions of customs legislation\n1.   The Parties shall cooperate in preventing, detecting and combating breaches or circumventions of customs legislation, in accordance with their obligations under Chapter 2 of this Title and the Protocol on mutual administrative assistance in customs matters. Each Party shall take appropriate and comparable measures to protect its own and the other Party's financial interests regarding the levying of duties on goods entering the customs territories of the United Kingdom or the Union.\n2.   Subject to the possibility of exemption for compliant traders under paragraph 7, a Party may temporarily suspend the relevant preferential treatment of the product or products concerned in accordance with the procedure laid down in paragraphs 3 and 4 if:\n(a)\nthat Party has made a finding, based on objective, compelling and verifiable information, that systematic and large-scale breaches or circumventions of customs legislation have been committed, and;\n(b)\nthe other Party repeatedly and unjustifiably refuses or otherwise fails to comply with the obligations referred to in paragraph 1.\n3.   The Party which has made a finding as referred to in paragraph 2 shall notify the Trade Partnership Committee and shall enter into consultations with the other Party within the Trade Partnership Committee with a view to reaching a mutually acceptable solution.\n4.   If the Parties fail to agree on a mutually acceptable solution within three months after the date of notification, the Party which has made the finding may decide to suspend temporarily the relevant preferential treatment of the product or products concerned. In this case, the Party which made the finding shall notify the temporary suspension, including the period during which it intends the temporary suspension to apply, to the Trade Partnership Committee without delay.\n5.   The temporary suspension shall apply only for the period necessary to counteract the breaches or circumventions and to protect the financial interests of the Party concerned, and in any case not for longer than six months. The Party concerned shall keep the situation under review and, where it decides that the temporary suspension is no longer necessary, it shall bring it to an end before the end of the period notified to the Trade Partnership Committee. Where the conditions that gave rise to the suspension persist at the expiry of the period notified to the Trade Partnership Committee, the Party concerned may decide to renew the suspension. Any suspension shall be subject to periodic consultations within the Trade Partnership Committee.\n6.   Each Party shall publish, in accordance with its internal procedures, notices to importers about any decision concerning temporary suspensions referred to in paragraphs 4 and 5.\n7.   Notwithstanding paragraph 4, if an importer is able to satisfy the importing customs authority that such products are fully compliant with the importing Party's customs legislation, the requirements of this Agreement, and any other appropriate conditions related to the temporary suspension established by the importing Party in accordance with its laws and regulations, the importing Party shall allow the importer to apply for preferential treatment and recover any duties paid in excess of the applicable preferential tariff rates when the products were imported.\nArticle 35\nManagement of administrative errors\nIn case of systematic errors by the competent authorities or issues concerning the proper management of the preferential system at export, concerning notably the application of the provisions of Chapter 2 of this Title or the application of the Protocol on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Customs Matters, and if these errors or issues lead to consequences in terms of import duties, the Party facing such consequences may request the Trade Partnership Committee to examine the possibility of adopting decisions, as appropriate, to resolve the situation.\nArticle 36\nCultural property\n1.   The Parties shall cooperate in facilitating the return of cultural property illicitly removed from the territory of a Party, having regard to the principles enshrined in the UNESCO Convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit Import, Export and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property signed in Paris on 17 November 1970.\n2.   For the purposes of this Article, the following definitions apply:\n(a)\n\"cultural property\" means property classified or defined as being among the national treasures possessing artistic, historic or archaeological value under the respective rules and procedures of each Party; and\n(b)\n\"illicitly removed from the territory of a Party\" means:\n(i)\nremoved from the territory of a Party on or after 1 January 1993 in breach of that Party's rules on the protection of national treasures or in breach of its rules on the export of cultural property; or\n(ii)\nnot returned at the end of a period of lawful temporary removal or any breach of another condition governing such temporary removal, on or after 1 January 1993.\n3.   The competent authorities of the Parties shall cooperate with each other in particular by:\n(a)\nnotifying the other Party where cultural property is found in their territory and there are reasonable grounds for believing that the cultural property has been illicitly removed from the territory of the other Party;\n(b)\naddressing requests of the other Party for the return of cultural property which has been illicitly removed from the territory of that Party;\n(c)\npreventing any actions to evade the return of such cultural property, by means of any necessary interim measures; and\n(d)\ntaking any necessary measures for the physical preservation of cultural property which has been illicitly removed from the territory of the other Party.\n4.   Each Party shall identify a contact point responsible for communicating with the contact point of the other Party with respect to any matters arising under this Article, including with respect to the notifications and requests referred to in points (a) and (b) of paragraph 3.\n5.   The envisaged cooperation between the Parties shall involve the customs authorities of the Parties responsible for managing export procedures for cultural property as appropriate and necessary.\n6.   Title I of Part Six does not apply to this Article.\nCHAPTER 2\nRULES OF ORIGIN\nSECTION 1\nRULES OF ORIGIN\nArticle 37\nObjective\nThe objective of this Chapter is to lay down the provisions determining the origin of goods for the purpose of application of preferential tariff treatment under this Agreement, and setting out related origin procedures.\nArticle 38\nDefinitions\nFor the purposes of this Chapter, the following definitions apply:\n(a)\n\"classification\" means the classification of a product or material under a particular chapter, heading, or sub-heading of the Harmonised System;\n(b)\n\"consignment\" means products which are either sent simultaneously from one exporter to one consignee or covered by a single transport document covering their shipment from the exporter to the consignee or, in the absence of such a document, by a single invoice;\n(c)\n\"exporter\" means a person, located in a Party, who, in accordance with the requirements laid down in the laws and regulations of that Party, exports or produces the originating product and makes out a statement on origin;\n(d)\n\"importer\" means a person who imports the originating product and claims preferential tariff treatment for it;\n(e)\n\"material\" means any substance used in the production of a product, including any components, ingredients, raw materials, or parts;\n(f)\n\"non-originating material\" means a material which does not qualify as originating under this Chapter, including a material whose originating status cannot be determined;\n(g)\n\"product\" means the product resulting from the production, even if it is intended for use as a material in the production of another product;\n(h)\n\"production\" means any kind of working or processing including assembly.\nArticle 39\nGeneral requirements\n1.

The acquisition of originating status shall be fulfilled without interruption in the United Kingdom or the Union.\nArticle 40\nCumulation of origin\n1.   A product originating in a Party shall be considered as originating in the other Party if that product is used as a material in the production of another product in that other Party.\n2.

Paragraph 1 of this Article does not apply to products wholly obtained in a Party within the meaning of Article 41. If Annex 3 requires that the materials used in the production of a product are wholly obtained, paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Article apply.\nArticle 43\nInsufficient production\n1.   Notwithstanding point (c) of Article 39(1), a product shall not be considered as originating in a Party if the production of the product in a Party consists only of one or more of the following operations conducted on non-originating materials:\n(a)\npreserving operations such as drying, freezing, keeping in brine and other similar operations where their sole purpose is to ensure that the products remain in good condition during transport and storage; (2)\n(b)\nbreaking-up or assembly of packages;\n(c)\nwashing, cleaning; removal of dust, oxide, oil, paint or other coverings;\n(d)\nironing or pressing of textiles and textile articles;\n(e)\nsimple painting and polishing operations;\n(f)\nhusking and partial or total milling of rice; polishing and glazing of cereals and rice; bleaching of rice;\n(g)\noperations to colour or flavour sugar or form sugar lumps; partial or total milling of sugar in solid form;\n(h)\npeeling, stoning and shelling, of fruits, nuts and vegetables;\n(i)\nsharpening, simple grinding or simple cutting;\n(j)\nsifting, screening, sorting, classifying, grading, matching including the making-up of sets of articles;\n(k)\nsimple placing in bottles, cans, flasks, bags, cases, boxes, fixing on cards or boards and all other simple packaging operations;\n(l)\naffixing or printing marks, labels, logos and other like distinguishing signs on products or their packaging;\n(m)\nsimple mixing of products, whether or not of different kinds; mixing of sugar with any material;\n(n)\nsimple addition of water or dilution with water or another substance that does not materially alter the characteristics of the product, or dehydration or denaturation of products;\n(o)\nsimple assembly of parts of articles to constitute a complete article or disassembly of products into parts;\n(p)\nslaughter of animals.\n2.

Accessories, spare parts, tools and instructional or other information materials shall be regarded as one product with the piece of equipment, machine, apparatus or vehicle in question if they:\n(a)\nare classified and delivered with, but not invoiced separately from, the product; and\n(b)\nare of the types, quantities and value which are customary for that product.\n2.   Accessories, spare parts, tools and instructional or other information materials referred to paragraph 1 shall be disregarded in determining the origin of the product except for the purposes of calculating the value of non-originating materials if a product is subject to a maximum value of non-originating materials as set out in Annex 3.\nArticle 48\nSets\nSets, as defined in General Rule 3 for the Interpretation of the Harmonised System, shall be considered as originating in a Party if all of their components are originating. If a set is composed of originating and non-originating components, the set as a whole shall be considered as originating in a Party if the value of the non-originating components does not exceed 15 % of the ex-works price of the set.\nArticle 49\nNeutral elements\nIn order to determine whether a product is originating in a Party, it shall not be necessary to determine the origin of the following elements, which might be used in its production:\n(a)\nfuel, energy, catalysts and solvents;\n(b)\nplant, equipment, spare parts and materials used in the maintenance of equipment and buildings;\n(c)\nmachines, tools, dies and moulds;\n(d)\nlubricants, greases, compounding materials and other materials used in production or used to operate equipment and buildings;\n(e)\ngloves, glasses, footwear, clothing, safety equipment and supplies;\n(f)\nequipment, devices and supplies used for testing or inspecting the product; and\n(g)\nother materials used in the production which are not incorporated into the product nor intended to be incorporated into the final composition of the product.\nArticle 50\nAccounting segregation\n1.

For the purpose of paragraph 1, \"fungible materials\" or \"fungible products\" means materials or products that are of the same kind and commercial quality, with the same technical and physical characteristics, and that cannot be distinguished from one another for origin purposes.\n3.   Notwithstanding paragraph 1, originating and non-originating fungible materials may be used in the production of a product without being physically segregated during storage if an accounting segregation method is used.\n4.   Notwithstanding paragraph 1, originating and non-originating fungible products classified under Chapters 10, 15, 27, 28, 29, headings 32.01 to 32.07, or headings 39.01 to 39.14 of the Harmonised System may be stored in a Party before exportation to the other Party without being physically segregated, provided that an accounting segregation method is used.\n5.   The accounting segregation method referred to in paragraphs 3 and 4 shall be applied in conformity with a stock management method under accounting principles which are generally accepted in the Party.\n6.   The accounting segregation method shall be any method that ensures that at any time no more materials or products receive originating status than would be the case if the materials or products had been physically segregated.\n7.   A Party may require, under conditions set out in its laws or regulations, that the use of an accounting segregation method is subject to prior authorisation by the customs authorities of that Party. The customs authorities of the Party shall monitor the use of such authorisations and may withdraw an authorisation if the holder makes improper use of the accounting segregation method or fails to fulfil any of the other conditions laid down in this Chapter.\nArticle 51\nReturned products\nIf a product originating in a Party exported from that Party to a third country returns to that Party, it shall be considered as a non-originating product unless it can be demonstrated to the satisfaction of the customs authority of that Party that the returning product:\n(a)\nis the same as that exported; and\n(b)\nhas not undergone any operation other than what was necessary to preserve it in good condition while in that third country or while being exported.\nArticle 52\nNon-alteration\n1.   An originating product declared for home use in the importing Party shall not, after exportation and prior to being declared for home use, have been altered, transformed in any way or subjected to operations other than to preserve it in good condition or than adding or affixing marks, labels, seals or any other documentation to ensure compliance with specific domestic requirements of the importing Party.\n2.   The storage or exhibition of a product may take place in a third country, provided that the product remains under customs supervision in that third country.\n3.   The splitting of consignments may take place in a third country if it is carried out by the exporter or under the responsibility of the exporter, provided that the consignments remain under customs supervision in that third country.\n4.   In the case of doubt as to whether the requirements provided for in paragraphs 1 to 3 are complied with, the customs authority of the importing Party may request the importer to provide evidence of compliance with those requirements, which may be given by any means, including contractual transport documents such as bills of lading or factual or concrete evidence based on the marking or numbering of packages or any evidence related to the product itself.\nArticle 53\nReview of drawback of, or exemption from, customs duties\nNot earlier than two years from the entry into force of this Agreement, at the request of either Party, the Trade Specialised Committee on Customs Cooperation and Rules of Origin shall review the Parties' respective duty drawback and inward-processing schemes. For that purpose, at the request of a Party, no later than 60 days from that request, the other Party shall provide the requesting Party with available information and detailed statistics covering the period from the entry into force of this Agreement, or the previous five years if that period is shorter, on the operation of its duty-drawback and inward-processing scheme. In the light of this review, the Trade Specialised Committee on Customs Cooperation and Rules of Origin may make recommendations to the Partnership Council for the amendment of the provisions of this Chapter and its Annexes, with a view to introducing limitations or restrictions with respect to drawback of or exemption from customs duties.\nSECTION 2\nORIGIN PROCEDURES\nArticle 54\nClaim for preferential tariff treatment\n1.   The importing Party, on importation, shall grant preferential tariff treatment to a product originating in the other Party within the meaning of this Chapter on the basis of a claim by the importer for preferential tariff treatment. The importer shall be responsible for the correctness of the claim for preferential tariff treatment and for compliance with the requirements provided for in this Chapter.\n2.   A claim for preferential tariff treatment shall be based on:\n(a)\na statement on origin that the product is originating made out by the exporter; or\n(b)\nthe importer's knowledge that the product is originating.\n3.   The importer making the claim for preferential tariff treatment based on a statement on origin as referred to in point (a) of paragraph 2 shall keep the statement on origin and, when required by the customs authority of the importing Party, shall provide a copy thereof to that customs authority.\nArticle 55\nTime of the claim for preferential tariff treatment\n1.   A claim for preferential tariff treatment and the basis for that claim as referred to in Article 54(2) shall be included in the customs import declaration in accordance with the laws and regulations of the importing Party.\n2.   By way of derogation from paragraph 1 of this Article, if the importer did not make a claim for preferential tariff treatment at the time of importation, the importing Party shall grant preferential tariff treatment and repay or remit any excess customs duty paid provided that:\n(a)\nthe claim for preferential tariff treatment is made no later than three years after the date of importation, or such longer time period as specified in the laws and regulations of the importing Party;\n(b)\nthe importer provides the basis for the claim as referred to in Article 54(2); and\n(c)\nthe product would have been considered originating and would have satisfied all other applicable requirements within the meaning of Section 1 of this Chapter if it had been claimed by the importer at the time of importation.\nThe other obligations applicable to the importer under Article 54 remain unchanged.\nArticle 56\nStatement on origin\n1.   A statement on origin shall be made out by an exporter of a product on the basis of information demonstrating that the product is originating, including, information on the originating status of materials used in the production of the product. The exporter shall be responsible for the correctness of the statement on origin and the information provided.\n2.   A statement on origin shall be made out using one of the language versions set out in Annex 7 in an invoice or on any other document that describes the originating product in sufficient detail to enable the identification of that product. The exporter shall be responsible for providing sufficient detail to allow the identification of the originating product. The importing Party shall not require the importer to submit a translation of the statement on origin.\n3.   A statement on origin shall be valid for 12 months from the date it was made out or for such longer period as provided by the Party of import up to a maximum of 24 months.\n4.   A statement on origin may apply to:\n(a)\na single shipment of one or more products imported into a Party; or\n(b)\nmultiple shipments of identical products imported into a Party within the period specified in the statement on origin, which shall not exceed 12 months.\n5.   If, at the request of the importer, unassembled or disassembled products within the meaning of General Rule 2(a) for the Interpretation of the Harmonised System that fall within Sections XV to XXI of the Harmonised System are imported by instalments, a single statement on origin for such products may be used in accordance with the requirements laid down by the customs authority of the importing Party.\nArticle 57\nDiscrepancies\nThe customs authority of the importing Party shall not reject a claim for preferential tariff treatment due to minor errors or discrepancies in the statement on origin, or for the sole reason that an invoice was issued in a third country.\nArticle 58\nImporter's knowledge\n1.   For the purposes of a claim for preferential tariff treatment that is made under point (b) of Article 54(2), the importer's knowledge that a product is originating in the exporting Party shall be based on information demonstrating that the product is originating and satisfies the requirements provided for in this Chapter.\n2.   Before claiming the preferential treatment, in the event that an importer is unable to obtain the information referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article as a result of the exporter deeming that information to be confidential information or for any other reason, the exporter may provide a statement on origin so that the importer may claim the preferential tariff treatment on the basis of point (a) of Article 54(2).\nArticle 59\nRecord-keeping requirements\n1.   For a minimum of three years after the date of importation of the product, an importer making a claim for preferential tariff treatment for a product imported into the importing Party shall keep:\n(a)\nif the claim was based on a statement on origin, the statement on origin made out by the exporter; or\n(b)\nif the claim was based on the importer's knowledge, all records demonstrating that the product satisfies the requirements for obtaining originating status.\n2.   An exporter who has made out a statement on origin shall, for a minimum of four years after that statement on origin was made out, keep a copy of the statement on origin and all other records demonstrating that the product satisfies the requirements to obtain originating status.\n3.   The records to be kept in accordance with this Article may be held in electronic format.\nArticle 60\nSmall consignments\n1.   By way of derogation from Articles 54 to 58, provided that the product has been declared as meeting the requirements of this Chapter and the customs authority of the importing Party has no doubts as to the veracity of that declaration, the importing Party shall grant preferential tariff treatment to:\n(a)\na product sent in a small package from private persons to private persons;\n(b)\na product forming part of a traveller's personal luggage; and\n(c)\nfor the United Kingdom, in addition to points (a) and (b) of this Article, other low value consignments.\n2.   The following products are excluded from the application of paragraph 1 of this Article:\n(a)\nproducts, the importation of which forms part of a series of importations that may reasonably be considered to have been made separately for the purpose of avoiding the requirements of Article 54;\n(b)\nfor the Union:\n(i)\na product imported by way of trade; the imports which are occasional and consist solely of products for the personal use of the recipients or travellers or their families are not be considered as imports by way of trade if it is evident from the nature and quantity of the products that no commercial purpose is intended; and\n(ii)\nproducts, the total value of which exceeds EUR 500 in the case of products sent in small packages, or EUR 1 200 in the case of products forming part of a traveller's personal luggage. The amounts to be used in a given national currency shall be the equivalent in that currency of the amounts expressed in euro as at the first working day of October. The exchange rate amounts shall be those published for that day by the European Central Bank, unless a different amount is communicated to the European Commission by 15 October, and shall apply from 1 January the following year. The European Commission shall notify the United Kingdom of the relevant amounts. The Union may establish other limits which it will communicate to the United Kingdom; and\n(c)\nfor the United Kingdom, products whose total value exceeds the limits set under the domestic law of the United Kingdom. The United Kingdom will communicate these limits to the Union.\n3.   The importer shall be responsible for the correctness of the declaration and for the compliance with the requirements provided for in this Chapter. The record-keeping requirements set out in Article 59 shall not apply to the importer under this Article.\nArticle 61\nVerification\n1.   The customs authority of the importing Party may conduct a verification as to whether a product is originating or whether the other requirements of this Chapter are satisfied, on the basis of risk assessment methods, which may include random selection. Such verifications may be conducted by means of a request for information from the importer who made the claim referred to in Article 54, at the time the import declaration is submitted, before the release of the products, or after the release of the products.\n2.   The information requested pursuant to paragraph 1 shall cover no more than the following elements:\n(a)\nif the claim was based on a statement on origin, that statement on origin; and\n(b)\ninformation pertaining to the fulfilment of origin criteria, which is:\n(i)\nwhere the origin criterion is \"wholly obtained\", the applicable category (such as harvesting, mining, fishing) and the place of production;\n(ii)\nwhere the origin criterion is based on change in tariff classification, a list of all the non-originating materials, including their tariff classification (in 2, 4 or 6-digit format, depending on the origin criterion);\n(iii)\nwhere the origin criterion is based on a value method, the value of the final product as well as the value of all the non-originating materials used in the production of that product;\n(iv)\nwhere the origin criterion is based on weight, the weight of the final product as well as the weight of the relevant non-originating materials used in the final product;\n(v)\nwhere the origin criterion is based on a specific production process, a description of that specific process.\n3.   When providing the requested information, the importer may add any other information that it considers relevant for the purpose of verification.\n4.   If the claim for preferential tariff treatment is based on a statement on origin, the importer shall provide that statement on origin but may reply to the customs authority of the importing Party that the importer is not in a position to provide the information referred to in point (b) of paragraph 2.\n5.   If the claim for preferential tariff treatment is based on the importer's knowledge, after having first requested information in accordance with paragraph 1, the customs authority of the importing Party conducting the verification may request the importer to provide additional information if that customs authority considers that additional information is necessary in order to verify the originating status of the product or whether the other requirements of this Chapter are met. The customs authority of the importing Party may request the importer for specific documentation and information, if appropriate.\n6.   If the customs authority of the importing Party decides to suspend the granting of preferential tariff treatment to the product concerned while awaiting the results of the verification, the release of the products shall be offered to the importer subject to appropriate precautionary measures including guarantees. Any suspension of preferential tariff treatment shall be terminated as soon as possible after the customs authority of the importing Party has ascertained the originating status of the products concerned, or the fulfilment of the other requirements of this Chapter.\nArticle 62\nAdministrative cooperation\n1.   In order to ensure the proper application of this Chapter, the Parties shall cooperate, through the customs authority of each Party, in verifying whether a product is originating and is in compliance with the other requirements provided for in this Chapter.\n2.   If the claim for preferential tariff treatment was based on a statement on origin, as appropriate after having first requested information in accordance with Article 61(1) and based on the reply from the importer, the customs authority of the importing Party conducting the verification may also request information from the customs authority of the exporting Party within a period of two years after the importation of the products, or from the moment the claim is made pursuant to point (a) of Article 55(2) if the customs authority of the importing Party conducting the verification considers that additional information is necessary in order to verify the originating status of the product or to verify that the other requirements provided for in this Chapter have been met. The request for information shall include the following elements:\n(a)\nthe statement on origin;\n(b)\nthe identity of the customs authority issuing the request;\n(c)\nthe name of the exporter;\n(d)\nthe subject and scope of the verification; and\n(e)\nany relevant documentation.\nIn addition, the customs authority of the importing Party may request the customs authority of the exporting Party to provide specific documentation and information, where appropriate.\n3.   The customs authority of the exporting Party may, in accordance with its laws and regulations, request documentation or examination by calling for any evidence, or by visiting the premises of the exporter, to review records and observe the facilities used in the production of the product.\n4.   Without prejudice to paragraph 5, the customs authority of the exporting Party receiving the request referred to in paragraph 2 shall provide the customs authority of the importing Party with the following information:\n(a)\nthe requested documentation, where available;\n(b)\nan opinion on the originating status of the product;\n(c)\nthe description of the product that is subject to examination and the tariff classification relevant to the application of this Chapter;\n(d)\na description and explanation of the production process that is sufficient to support the originating status of the product;\n(e)\ninformation on the manner in which the examination of the product was conducted; and\n(f)\nsupporting documentation, where appropriate.\n5.   The customs authority of the exporting Party shall not provide the information referred to in points (a), (d) and (f) of paragraph 4 to the customs authority of the importing Party if that information is deemed confidential by the exporter.\n6.   Each Party shall notify the other Party of the contact details of the customs authorities and shall notify the other Party of any change to those contact details within 30 days after the date of the change.\nArticle 63\nDenial of preferential tariff treatment\n1.   Without prejudice to paragraph 3, the customs authority of the importing Party may deny preferential tariff treatment, if:\n(a)\nwithin three months after the date of a request for information pursuant to Article 61(1):\n(i)\nno reply has been provided by the importer;\n(ii)\nwhere the claim for preferential tariff treatment was based on a statement on origin, no statement on origin has been provided; or\n(iii)\nwhere the claim for preferential tariff treatment was based on the importer's knowledge, the information provided by the importer is inadequate to confirm that the product is originating;\n(b)\nwithin three months after the date of a request for additional information pursuant to Article 61(5):\n(i)\nno reply has been provided by the importer; or\n(ii)\nthe information provided by the importer is inadequate to confirm that the product is originating;\n(c)\nwithin 10 months (3) after the date of a request for information pursuant to Article 62(2):\n(i)\nno reply has been provided by the customs authority of the exporting Party; or\n(ii)\nthe information provided by the customs authority of the exporting Party is inadequate to confirm that the product is originating.\n2.   The customs authority of the importing Party may deny preferential tariff treatment to a product for which an importer claims preferential tariff treatment where the importer fails to comply with requirements under this Chapter other than those relating to the originating status of the products.\n3.   If the customs authority of the importing Party has sufficient justification to deny preferential tariff treatment under paragraph 1 of this Article, in cases where the customs authority of the exporting Party has provided an opinion pursuant to point (b) of Article 62(4) confirming the originating status of the products, the customs authority of the importing Party shall notify the customs authority of the exporting Party of its intention to deny the preferential tariff treatment within two months after the date of receipt of that opinion.\nIf such notification is made, consultations shall be held at the request of either Party, within three months after the date of the notification. The period for consultation may be extended on a case-by-case basis by mutual agreement between the customs authorities of the Parties. The consultation may take place in accordance with the procedure set by the Trade Specialised Committee on Customs Cooperation and Rules of Origin.\nUpon the expiry of the period for consultation, if the customs authority of the importing Party cannot confirm that the product is originating, it may deny the preferential tariff treatment if it has a sufficient justification for doing so and after having granted the importer the right to be heard. However, when the customs authority of the exporting Party confirms the originating status of the products and provides justification for such conclusion, the customs authority of the importing Party shall not deny preferential tariff treatment to a product on the sole ground that Article 62(5) has been applied.\n4.   In all cases, the settlement of differences between the importer and the customs authority of the Party of import shall be under the law of the Party of import.\nArticle 64\nConfidentiality\n1.   Each Party shall maintain, in accordance with its laws and regulations, the confidentiality of any information provided to it by the other Party, pursuant to this Chapter, and shall protect that information from disclosure.\n2.   Where, notwithstanding Article 62(5), confidential business information has been obtained from the exporter by the customs authority of the exporting Party or importing Party through the application of Articles 61 and 62, that information shall not be disclosed.\n3.   Each Party shall ensure that confidential information collected pursuant to this Chapter shall not be used for purposes other than the administration and enforcement of decisions and determinations relating to origin and to customs matters, except with the permission of the person or Party who provided the confidential information.\n4.   Notwithstanding paragraph 3, a Party may allow information collected pursuant to this Chapter to be used in any administrative, judicial, or quasi-judicial proceedings instituted for failure to comply with customs-related laws implementing this Chapter. A Party shall notify the person or Party who provided the information in advance of such use.\nArticle 65\nAdministrative measures and sanctions\nEach Party shall ensure the effective enforcement of this Chapter. Each Party shall ensure that the competent authorities are able to impose administrative measures, and, where appropriate, sanctions, in accordance with its laws and regulations, on any person who draws up a document, or causes a document to be drawn up, which contains incorrect information that was provided for the purpose of obtaining a preferential tariff treatment for a product, who does not comply with the requirements set out in Article 59, or who does not provide the evidence, or refuses to submit to a visit, as referred to in Article 62(3).\nSECTION 3\nOTHER PROVISIONS\nArticle 66\nCeuta and Melilla\n1.   For purposes of this Chapter, in the case of the Union, the term \"Party\" does not include Ceuta and Melilla.\n2.   Products originating in the United Kingdom, when imported into Ceuta and Melilla, shall in all respects be subject to the same customs treatment under this Agreement as that which is applied to products originating in the customs territory of the Union under Protocol 2 of the Act of Accession of the Kingdom of Spain and the Portuguese Republic to the European Union. The United Kingdom shall grant to imports of products covered by this Agreement and originating in Ceuta and Melilla the same customs treatment as that which is granted to products imported from and originating in the Union.\n3.   The rules of origin and origin procedures referred to in this Chapter apply mutatis mutandis to products exported from the United Kingdom to Ceuta and Melilla and to products exported from Ceuta and Melilla to the United Kingdom.\n4.   Ceuta and Melilla shall be considered as a single territory.\n5.   Article 40 applies to import and exports of products between the Union, the United Kingdom and Ceuta and Melilla.\n6.   The exporters shall enter \"the United Kingdom\" or \"Ceuta and Melilla\" in field 3 of the text of the statement on origin, depending on the origin of the product.\n7.   The customs authority of the Kingdom of Spain shall be responsible for the application and implementation of this Chapter in Ceuta and Melilla.\nArticle 67\nTransitional provisions for products in transit or storage\nThe provisions of this Agreement may be applied to products which comply with the provisions of this Chapter and which on the date of entry into force of this Agreement are either in transit from the exporting Party to the importing Party or under customs control in the importing Party without payment of import duties and taxes, subject to the making of a claim for preferential tariff treatment referred to in Article 54 to the customs authority of the importing Party, within 12 months of that date.\nArticle 68\nAmendment to this Chapter and its Annexes\nThe Partnership Council may amend this Chapter and its Annexes.\nCHAPTER 3\nSANITARY AND PHYTOSANITARY MEASURES\nArticle 69\nObjectives\nThe objectives of this Chapter are to:\n(a)\nprotect human, animal and plant life or health in the territories of the Parties while facilitating trade between the Parties;\n(b)\nfurther the implementation of the SPS Agreement;\n(c)\nensure that the Parties' sanitary and phytosanitary (\"SPS\") measures do not create unnecessary barriers to trade;\n(d)\npromote greater transparency and understanding on the application of each Party's SPS measures;\n(e)\nenhance cooperation between the Parties in the fight against antimicrobial resistance, promotion of sustainable food systems, protection of animal welfare, and on electronic certification;\n(f)\nenhance cooperation in the relevant international organisations to develop international standards, guidelines and recommendations on animal health, food safety and plant health; and\n(g)\npromote implementation by each Party of international standards, guidelines and recommendations.\nArticle 70\nScope\n1.   This Chapter applies to all SPS measures of a Party that may, directly or indirectly, affect trade between the Parties.\n2.   This Chapter also lays down separate provisions regarding cooperation on animal welfare, antimicrobial resistance and sustainable food systems.\nArticle 71\nDefinitions\n1.   For the purposes of this Chapter, the following definitions apply:\n(a)\nthe definitions contained in Annex A of the SPS Agreement;\n(b)\nthe definitions adopted under the auspices of the Codex Alimentarius Commission (the \"Codex\");\n(c)\nthe definitions adopted under the auspices of the World Organisation for Animal Health (the \"OIE\"); and\n(d)\nthe definitions adopted under the auspices of the International Plant Protection Convention (the \"IPPC\").\n2.   For the purposes of this Chapter, the following definitions apply:\n(a)\n\"import conditions\" means any SPS measures that are required to be fulfilled for the import of products; and\n(b)\n\"protected zone\" for a specified regulated plant pest means an officially defined geographical area in which that pest is not established in spite of favourable conditions and its presence in other parts of the territory of the Party, and into which that pest is not allowed to be introduced.\n3.   The Trade Specialised Committee on Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures may adopt other definitions for the purposes of this Chapter, taking into consideration the glossaries and definitions of the relevant international organisations, such as the Codex, OIE and IPPC.\n4.   The definitions under the SPS Agreement prevail to the extent that there is an inconsistency between the definitions adopted by the Trade Specialised Committee on Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures or adopted under the auspices of the Codex, the OIE, the IPPC and the definitions under the SPS Agreement. In the event of an inconsistency between definitions adopted by the Trade Specialised Committee on Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures and the definitions set out in the Codex, OIE or IPPC, the definitions set out in the Codex, OIE or IPPC shall prevail.\nArticle 72\nRights and obligations\nThe Parties reaffirm their rights and obligations under the SPS Agreement. This includes the right to adopt measures in accordance with Article 5(7) of the SPS Agreement.\nArticle 73\nGeneral principles\n1.   The Parties shall apply SPS measures for achieving their appropriate level of protection that are based on risk assessments in accordance with relevant provisions, including Article 5 of the SPS Agreement.\n2.   The Parties shall not use SPS measures to create unjustified barriers to trade.\n3.   Regarding trade-related SPS procedures and approvals established under this Chapter, each Party shall ensure that those procedures and related SPS measures:\n(a)\nare initiated and completed without undue delay;\n(b)\ndo not include unnecessary, scientifically and technically unjustified or unduly burdensome information requests that might delay access to each other's markets;\n(c)\nare not applied in a manner which would constitute arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination against the other Party's entire territory or parts of the other Party's territory where identical or similar SPS conditions exist; and\n(d)\nare proportionate to the risks identified and not more trade restrictive than necessary to achieve the importing Party's appropriate level of protection.\n4.   The Parties shall not use the procedures referred to in paragraph 3, or any requests for additional information, to delay access to their markets without scientific and technical justification.\n5.   Each Party shall ensure that any administrative procedure it requires concerning the import conditions on food safety, animal health or plant health is not more burdensome or trade restrictive than necessary to give the importing Party adequate confidence that these conditions are met. Each Party shall ensure that the negative effects on trade of any administrative procedures are kept to a minimum and that the clearance processes remain simple and expeditious while meeting the importing Party's conditions.\n6.   The importing Party shall not put in place any additional administrative system or procedure that unnecessarily hampers trade.\nArticle 74\nOfficial certification\n1.   Where the importing Party requires official certificates, the model certificates shall be:\n(a)\nset in line with the principles as laid down in the international standards of the Codex, the IPPC and the OIE; and\n(b)\napplicable to imports from all parts of the territory of the exporting Party.\n2.   The Trade Specialised Committee on Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures may agree on specific cases where the model certificates referred to in paragraph 1 would be established only for a part or parts of the territory of the exporting Party. The Parties shall promote the implementation of electronic certification and other technologies to facilitate trade.\nArticle 75\nImport conditions and procedures\n1.   Without prejudice to the rights and obligations each Party has under the SPS Agreement and this Chapter, the import conditions of the importing Party shall apply to the entire territory of the exporting Party in a consistent manner.\n2.   The exporting Party shall ensure that products exported to the other Party, such as animals and animal products, plants and plant products, or other related objects, meet the SPS requirements of the importing Party.\n3.   The importing Party may require that imports of particular products are subject to authorisation. Such authorisation shall be granted where a request is made by the relevant competent authority of the exporting Party which objectively demonstrates, to the satisfaction of the importing Party, that the authorisation requirements of the importing Party are fulfilled. The relevant competent authority of the exporting Party may make a request for authorisation in respect of the entire territory of the exporting Party. The importing Party shall grant such requests on that basis, where they fulfil the authorisation requirements of the importing Party as set out in this paragraph.\n4.   The importing Party shall not introduce authorisation requirements which are additional to those which apply at the end of the transition period, unless the application of such requirements to further products is justified to mitigate a significant risk to human, animal or plant health.\n5.   The importing Party shall establish and communicate to the other Party import conditions for all products. The importing Party shall ensure that its import conditions are applied in a proportionate and non-discriminatory manner.\n6.   Without prejudice to provisional measures under Article 5(7) of the SPS Agreement, for products, or other related objects, where a phytosanitary concern exists, the import conditions shall be restricted to measures to protect against regulated pests of the importing Party and shall be applicable to the entire territory of the exporting Party.\n7.   Notwithstanding paragraphs 1 and 3, in the case of import authorisation requests for a specific product, where the exporting Party has requested to be examined only for a part, or certain parts, of its territory (in the case of the Union, individual Member States), the importing Party shall promptly proceed to the examination of that request. Where the importing Party receives requests in respect of the specific product from more than one part of the exporting Party, or, where further requests are received in respect of a product which has already been authorised, the importing Party shall expedite completion of the authorisation procedure, taking into account the identical or similar SPS regime applicable in the different parts of the exporting Party.\n8.   Each Party shall ensure that all SPS control, inspection and approval procedures are initiated and completed without undue delay. Information requirements shall be limited to what is necessary for the approval process to take into account information already available in the importing Party, such as on the legislative framework and audit reports of the exporting Party.\n9.   Except in duly justified circumstances related to its level of protection, each Party shall provide a transition period between the publication of any changes to its approval procedures and their application to allow the other Party to become familiar with and adapt to such changes. Each Party shall not unduly prolong the approval process for applications submitted prior to publication of the changes.\n10.   In relation to the processes set out in paragraphs 3 to 8, the following actions shall be taken:\n(a)\nas soon as the importing Party has positively concluded its assessment, it shall promptly take all necessary legislative and administrative measures to allow trade to take place without undue delay;\n(b)\nthe exporting Party shall:\n(i)\nprovide all relevant information required by the importing Party; and\n(ii)\ngive reasonable access to the importing Party for audit and other relevant procedures.\n(c)\nthe importing party shall establish a list of regulated pests for products, or other related objects, where a phytosanitary concern exists. That list shall contain:\n(i)\nthe pests not known to occur within any part of its own territory;\n(ii)\nthe pests known to occur within its own territory and under official control;\n(iii)\nthe pests known to occur within parts of its own territory and for which pest free areas or protected zones are established; and\n(iv)\nnon-quarantine pests known to occur within its own territory and under official control for specified planting material.\n11.   The importing Party shall accept consignments without requiring that the importing Party verifies compliance of those consignments before their departure from the territory of the exporting Party.\n12.   A Party may collect fees for the costs incurred to conduct specific SPS frontier checks, which should not exceed the recovery of the costs.\n13.   The importing Party shall have the right to carry out import checks on products imported from the exporting Party for the purposes of ensuring compliance with its SPS import requirements.\n14.   The import checks carried out on products imported from the exporting Party shall be based on the SPS risk associated with such importations. Import checks shall be carried out only to the extent necessary to protect human, animal or plant life and health, without undue delay and with a minimum effect on trade between the Parties.\n15.   Information on the proportion of products from the exporting Party checked at import shall be made available by the importing Party upon request of the exporting Party.\n16.   If import checks reveal non-compliance with the relevant import conditions the action taken by the importing Party must be based on an assessment of the risk involved and not be more trade restrictive than required to achieve the Party's appropriate level of SPS protection.\nArticle 76\nLists of approved establishments\n1.   Whenever justified, the importing Party may maintain a list of approved establishments meeting its import requirements as a condition to allow imports of animal products from these establishments.\n2.   Unless justified to mitigate a significant risk to human or animal health, lists of approved establishments shall only be required for the products for which they were required at the end of the transition period.\n3.   The exporting Party shall inform the importing Party of its list of establishments meeting the importing Party's conditions which shall be based on guarantees provided by the exporting Party.\n4.   Upon a request from the exporting Party, the importing Party shall approve establishments which are situated in the territory of the exporting Party, based on guarantees provided by the exporting Party, without prior inspection of individual establishments.\n5.   Unless the importing Party requests additional information and subject to guarantees being provided by the exporting party, the importing Party shall take the necessary legislative or administrative measures, in accordance with its applicable legal procedures, to allow imports from those establishments without undue delay.\n6.   The list of the approved establishments shall be made publicly available by the importing Party.\n7.   Where the importing Party decides to reject the request of the exporting Party to accept adding an establishment to the list of approved establishments, it shall inform the exporting Party without delay and shall submit a reply, including information about the non-conformities which led to the rejection of the establishment's approval.\nArticle 77\nTransparency and exchange of information\n1.   Each Party shall pursue transparency as regards SPS measures applicable to trade and shall for those purposes undertake the following actions:\n(a)\npromptly communicate to the other Party any changes to its SPS measures and approval procedures, including changes that may affect its capacity to fulfil the SPS import requirements of the other Party for certain products;\n(b)\nenhance mutual understanding of its SPS measures and their application;\n(c)\nexchange information with the other Party on matters related to the development and application of SPS measures, including the progress on new available scientific evidence, that affect, or may affect, trade between the Parties with a view to minimising negative trade effects;\n(d)\nupon request of the other Party, communicate the conditions that apply for the import of specific products within 20 working days;\n(e)\nupon request of the other Party, communicate the state of play of the procedure for the authorisation of specific products within 20 working days;\n(f)\ncommunicate to the other Party any significant change to the structure or organisation of a Party's competent authority;\n(g)\non request, communicate the results of a Party's official control and a report that concerns the results of the control carried out;\n(h)\non request, communicate the results of an import check provided for in case of a rejected or a non-compliant consignment; and\n(i)\non request, communicate, without undue delay, a risk assessment or scientific opinion produced by a Party that is relevant to this Chapter.\n2.   Where a Party has made available the information in paragraph 1 via notification to the WTO's Central Registry of Notifications or to the relevant international standard-setting body, in accordance with its relevant rules, the requirements in paragraph 1, as they apply to that information, are fulfilled.\nArticle 78\nAdaptation to regional conditions\n1.   The Parties shall recognise the concept of zoning including disease or pest-free areas, protected zones and areas of low disease or pest prevalence and shall apply it to the trade between the Parties, in accordance with the SPS Agreement, including the guidelines to further the practical implementation of Article 6 of the SPS Agreement (WTO/SPS Committee Decision G/SPS/48) and the relevant recommendations, standards and guidelines of the OIE and IPPC. The Trade Specialised Committee on Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures may define further details for these procedures, taking into account any relevant SPS Agreement, OIE and IPPC standards, guidelines or recommendations.\n2.   The Parties may also agree to cooperate on the concept of compartmentalisation as referred to in Chapters 4.4 and 4.5 of the OIE Terrestrial Animal Health Code and Chapters 4.1 and 4.2 of the OIE Aquatic Animal Health Code.\n3.   When establishing or maintaining the zones referred to in paragraph 1, the Parties shall consider factors such as geographical location, ecosystems, epidemiological surveillance and the effectiveness of SPS controls.\n4.   With regard to animals and animal products, when establishing or maintaining import conditions upon the request of the exporting Party, the importing Party shall recognise the disease-free areas established by the exporting Party as a basis for consideration towards the determination of allowing or maintaining the import, without prejudice to paragraphs 8 and 9.\n5.   The exporting Party shall identify the parts of its territory referred to in paragraph 4 and, if requested, provide a full explanation and supporting data based on the OIE standards, or in other ways established by the Trade Specialised Committee on Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures, based on the knowledge acquired through experience of the exporting Party's relevant authorities.\n6.   With regard to plants, plant products, and other related objects, when establishing or maintaining phytosanitary import conditions on request of the exporting Party, the importing Party shall recognise the pest-free areas, pest-free places of production, pest-free production sites, areas of low pest prevalence and protected zones established by the exporting Party as a basis for consideration towards the determination to allow or maintain the import, without prejudice to paragraphs 8 and 9.\n7.   The exporting Party shall identify its pest-free areas, pest-free places of production, pest-free production sites and areas of low pest prevalence or protected zones. If requested by the importing Party, the exporting Party shall provide a full explanation and supporting data based on the International Standards for Phytosanitary Measures developed under the IPPC, or in other ways established by the Trade Specialised Committee on Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures, based on the knowledge acquired through experience of the exporting Party's relevant phytosanitary authorities.\n8.   The Parties shall recognise disease-free areas and protected zones which are in place at the end of the transition period.\n9.   Paragraph 8 shall also apply to subsequent adaptations to the disease-free areas and protected zones (in the case of the United Kingdom pest-free areas), except in cases of significant changes in the disease or pest situations.\n10.   The Parties may carry out audits and verifications pursuant to Article 79 to implement paragraphs 4 to 9 of this Article.\n11.   The Parties shall establish close cooperation with the objective of maintaining confidence in the procedures in relation to the establishment of disease- or pest-free areas, pest-free places of production, pest-free production sites and areas of low pest or disease prevalence and protected zones, with the aim to minimise trade disruption.\n12.   The importing Party shall base its own determination of the animal or plant health status of the exporting Party or parts thereof on the information provided by the exporting Party in accordance with the SPS Agreement, OIE and IPPC standards, and take into consideration any determination made by the exporting Party.\n13.   Where the importing Party does not accept the determination made by the exporting Party as referred to in paragraph 12 of this Article, the importing Party shall objectively justify and explain to the exporting Party the reasons for that rejection and, upon request, hold consultations, in accordance with Article 80(2).\n14.   Each Party shall ensure that the obligations set out in paragraphs 4 to 9, 12 and 13 are carried out without undue delay. The importing Party will expedite the recognition of the disease or pest status when the status has been recovered after an outbreak.\n15.   Where a Party considers that a specific region has a special status with respect to a specific disease and which fulfils the criteria laid down in the OIE Terrestrial Animal Health Code Chapter 1.2 or the OIE Aquatic Animal Health Code Chapter 1.2, it may request recognition of this status. The importing Party may request additional guarantees in respect of imports of live animals and animal products appropriate to the agreed status.\nArticle 79\nAudits and verifications\n1.   The importing Party may carry out audits and verifications of the following:\n(a)\nall or part of the other Party's authorities' inspection and certification system;\n(b)\nthe results of the controls carried out under the exporting Party's inspection and certification system.\n2.   The Parties shall carry out those audits and verifications in accordance with the provisions of the SPS Agreement, taking into account the relevant international standards, guidelines and recommendations of the Codex, OIE or IPPC.\n3.   For the purposes of carrying out such audits and verifications, the importing Party may conduct audits and verifications by means of requests of information from the exporting Party or audit and verification visits to the exporting Party, which may include:\n(a)\nan assessment of all or part of the responsible authorities' total control programme, including, where appropriate, reviews of regulatory audit and inspection activities;\n(b)\non-the-spot checks; and\n(c)\nthe collection of information and data to assess the causes of recurring or emerging problems in relation to exports of products.\n4.   The importing Party shall share with the exporting Party the results and conclusions of the audits and verifications carried out pursuant to paragraph 1. The importing Party may make these results publicly available.\n5.   Prior to the commencement of an audit or verification, the Parties shall discuss the objectives and scope of the audit or verification, the criteria or requirements against which the exporting Party will be assessed, and the itinerary and procedures for conducting the audit or verification which shall be laid down in an audit or verification plan. Unless otherwise agreed by the Parties, the importing Party shall provide the exporting Party with an audit or verification plan at least 30 days prior to the commencement of the audit or verification.\n6.

If a Party has a significant concern with respect to food safety, plant health, or animal health, or an SPS measure that the other Party has proposed or implemented, that Party may request technical consultations with the other Party. The requested Party should respond to the request without undue delay. Each Party shall endeavour to provide the information necessary to avoid a disruption to trade and, as the case may be, to reach a mutually acceptable solution.\n3.   Consultations referred to in paragraph 2 may be held via telephone conference, videoconference, or any other means of communication mutually agreed on by the Parties.\nArticle 81\nEmergency measures\n1.   If the importing Party considers that there is a serious risk to human, animal or plant life and health, it may take without prior notification the necessary measures for the protection of human, animal or plant life and health. For consignments that are in transit between the Parties, the importing Party shall consider the most suitable and proportionate solution to avoid unnecessary disruptions to trade.\n2.   The Party taking the measures shall notify the other Party of an emergency SPS measure as soon as possible after its decision to implement the measure and no later than 24 hours after the decision has been taken. If a Party requests technical consultations to address the emergency SPS measure, the technical consultations must be held within 10 days of the notification of the emergency SPS measure. The Parties shall consider any information provided through the technical consultations. These consultations shall be carried out in order to avoid unnecessary disruptions to trade. The Parties may consider options for the facilitation of the implementation or the replacement of the measures.\n3.   The importing Party shall consider, in a timely manner, information that was provided by the exporting Party when it makes its decision with respect to consignments that, at the time of adoption of the emergency SPS measure, are being transported between the Parties, in order to avoid unnecessary disruptions to trade.\n4.   The importing Party shall ensure that any emergency measure taken on the grounds referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article is not maintained without scientific evidence or, in cases where scientific evidence is insufficient, is adopted in accordance with Article 5(7) of the SPS Agreement.\nArticle 82\nMultilateral international fora\nThe Parties agree to cooperate in multilateral international fora on the development of international standards, guidelines and recommendations in the areas under the scope of this Chapter.\nArticle 83\nImplementation and competent authorities\n1.

This Chapter applies to the preparation, adoption and application of all standards, technical regulations and conformity assessment procedures, which may affect trade in goods between the Parties.\n2.   This Chapter does not apply to:\n(a)\npurchasing specifications prepared by governmental bodies for production or consumption requirements of such bodies; or\n(b)\nSPS measures that fall within the scope of Chapter 3 of this Title.\n3.   The Annexes to this Chapter apply in addition to this Chapter in respect of products within the scope of those Annexes. Any provision in an Annex to this Chapter that an international standard or body or organisation is to be considered or recognised as relevant shall not prevent a standard developed by any other body or organisation from being considered to be a relevant international standard pursuant to Article 91(4) and (5).\nArticle 90\nRelationship with the TBT Agreement\n1.   Articles 2 to 9 of and Annexes 1 and 3 to the TBT Agreement are incorporated into and made part of this Agreement mutatis mutandis.\n2.   Terms referred to in this Chapter and in the Annexes to this Chapter shall have the same meaning as they have in the TBT Agreement.\nArticle 91\nTechnical regulations\n1.   Each Party shall carry out impact assessments of planned technical regulations in accordance with its respective rules and procedures. The rules and procedures referred to in this paragraph and in paragraph 8 may provide for exceptions.\n2.   Each Party shall assess the available regulatory and non-regulatory alternatives to the proposed technical regulation that may fulfil the Party's legitimate objectives, in accordance with Article 2.2 of the TBT Agreement.\n3.   Each Party shall use relevant international standards as a basis for its technical regulations except when it can demonstrate that such international standards would be an ineffective or inappropriate means for the fulfilment of the legitimate objectives pursued.\n4.   International standards developed by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC), the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) and the Codex Alimentarius Commission (Codex) shall be the relevant international standards within the meaning of Article 2, Article 5 and Annex 3 of the TBT Agreement.\n5.   A standard developed by other international organisations may also be considered a relevant international standard within the meaning of Article 2, Article 5 and Annex 3 of the TBT Agreement, provided that:\n(a)\nit has been developed by a standardising body which seeks to establish consensus either:\n(i)\namong national delegations of the participating WTO Members representing all the national standardising bodies in their territory that have adopted, or expect to adopt, standards on the subject matter to which the international standardisation activity relates, or,\n(ii)\namong governmental bodies of participating WTO Members; and\n(b)\nit has been developed in accordance with the Decision of the WTO Committee on Technical Barriers to Trade on Principles for the Development of International Standards, Guides and Recommendations with relation to Articles 2, 5, and Annex 3 of the TBT Agreement. (4)\n6.   Where a Party does not use international standards as a basis for a technical regulation, on request of the other Party, it shall identify any substantial deviation from the relevant international standard, explain the reasons why such standards were judged inappropriate or ineffective for the objective pursued, and provide the scientific or technical evidence on which that assessment was based.\n7.   Each Party shall review its technical regulations to increase the convergence of those technical regulations with relevant international standards, taking into account, inter alia, any new developments in the relevant international standards or any changes in the circumstances that have given rise to divergence from any relevant international standards.\n8.   In accordance with its respective rules and procedures and without prejudice to Title X of this Heading, when developing a major technical regulation which may have a significant effect on trade, each Party shall ensure that procedures exist that allow persons to express their opinion in a public consultation, except where urgent problems of safety, health, environment or national security arise or threaten to arise. Each Party shall allow persons of the other Party to participate in such consultations on terms that are no less favourable than those accorded to its own nationals, and shall make the results of those consultations public.\nArticle 92\nStandards\n1.   Each Party shall encourage the standardising bodies established within its territory, as well as the regional standardising bodies of which a Party or the standardising bodies established in its territory are members:\n(a)\nto participate, within the limits of their resources, in the preparation of international standards by relevant international standardising bodies;\n(b)\nto use relevant international standards as a basis for the standards they develop, except where such international standards would be ineffective or inappropriate, for example because of an insufficient level of protection, fundamental climatic or geographical factors or fundamental technological problems;\n(c)\nto avoid duplications of, or overlaps with, the work of international standardising bodies;\n(d)\nto review national and regional standards that are not based on relevant international standards at regular intervals, with a view to increasing the convergence of those standards with relevant international standards;\n(e)\nto cooperate with the relevant standardising bodies of the other Party in international standardisation activities, including through cooperation in the international standardising bodies or at regional level;\n(f)\nto foster bilateral cooperation with the standardising bodies of the other Party; and\n(g)\nto exchange information between standardising bodies.\n2.   The Parties shall exchange information on:\n(a)\ntheir respective use of standards in support of technical regulations; and\n(b)\ntheir respective standardisation processes, and the extent to which they use international, regional or sub-regional standards as a basis for their national standards.\n3.   Where standards are rendered mandatory in a draft technical regulation or conformity assessment procedure, through incorporation or reference, the transparency obligations set out in Article 94 and in Article 2 or 5 of the TBT Agreement shall apply.\nArticle 93\nConformity assessment\n1.   Article 91 concerning the preparation, adoption and application of technical regulations shall also apply to conformity assessment procedures, mutatis mutandis.\n2.   Where a Party requires conformity assessment as a positive assurance that a product conforms with a technical regulation, it shall:\n(a)\nselect conformity assessment procedures that are proportionate to the risks involved, as determined on the basis of a risk-assessment;\n(b)\nconsider as proof of compliance with technical regulations the use of a supplier's declaration of conformity, i.e. a declaration of conformity issued by the manufacturer on the sole responsibility of the manufacturer without a mandatory third-party assessment, as assurance of conformity among the options for showing compliance with technical regulations;\n(c)\nwhere requested by the other Party, provide information on the criteria used to select the conformity assessment procedures for specific products.\n3.   Where a Party requires third party conformity assessment as a positive assurance that a product conforms with a technical regulation and it has not reserved this task to a government authority as specified in paragraph 4, it shall:\n(a)\nuse accreditation, as appropriate, as a means to demonstrate technical competence to qualify conformity assessment bodies. Without prejudice to its right to establish requirements for conformity assessment bodies, each Party recognises the valuable role that accreditation operated with authority derived from government and on a non-commercial basis can play in the qualification of conformity assessment bodies;\n(b)\nuse relevant international standards for accreditation and conformity assessment;\n(c)\nencourage accreditation bodies and conformity assessment bodies located within its territory to join any relevant functioning international agreements or arrangements for harmonisation or facilitation of acceptance of conformity assessment results;\n(d)\nif two or more conformity assessment bodies are authorised by a Party to carry out conformity assessment procedures required for placing a product on the market, ensure that economic operators have a choice amongst the conformity assessment bodies designated by the authorities of a Party for a particular product or set of products;\n(e)\nensure that conformity assessment bodies are independent of manufacturers, importers and economic operators in general and that there are no conflicts of interest between accreditation bodies and conformity assessment bodies;\n(f)\nallow conformity assessment bodies to use subcontractors to perform testing or inspections in relation to the conformity assessment, including subcontractors located in the territory of the other Party, and may require subcontractors to meet the same requirements the conformity assessment body must meet to perform such testing or inspections itself; and\n(g)\npublish on a single website a list of the bodies that it has designated to perform such conformity assessment and the relevant information on the scope of designation of each such body.\n4.   Nothing in this Article shall preclude a Party from requiring that conformity assessment in relation to specific products is performed by its specified government authorities. If a Party requires that conformity assessment is performed by its specified government authorities, that Party shall:\n(a)\nlimit the conformity assessment fees to the approximate cost of the services rendered and, at the request of an applicant for conformity assessment, explain how any fees it imposes for that conformity assessment are limited to the approximate cost of services rendered; and\n(b)\nmake publicly available the conformity assessment fees.\n5.   Notwithstanding paragraphs 2 to 4, each Party shall accept a supplier's declaration of conformity as proof of compliance with its technical regulations in those product areas where it does so on the date of entry into force of this Agreement.\n6.   Each Party shall publish and maintain a list of the product areas referred to in paragraph 5 for information purposes, together with the references to the applicable technical regulations.\n7.   Notwithstanding paragraph 5, either Party may introduce requirements for the mandatory third party testing or certification of the product areas referred to in that paragraph, provided that such requirements are justified on grounds of legitimate objectives and are proportionate to the purpose of giving the importing Party adequate confidence that products conform with the applicable technical regulations or standards, taking account of the risks that non-conformity would create.\n8.   A Party proposing to introduce the conformity assessment procedures referred to in paragraph 7 shall notify the other Party at an early stage and shall take the comments of the other Party into account in devising any such conformity assessment procedures.\nArticle 94\nTransparency\n1.   Except where urgent problems of safety, health, environmental protection or national security arise or threaten to arise, each Party shall allow the other Party to provide written comments on notified proposed technical regulations and conformity assessment procedures within a period of at least 60 days from the date of the transmission of the notification of such regulations or procedures to the WTO Central Registry of Notifications. A Party shall give positive consideration to a reasonable request to extend that comment period.\n2.   Each Party shall provide the electronic version of the full notified text together with the notification. In the event that the notified text is not in one of the official WTO languages, the notifying Party shall provide a detailed and comprehensive description of the content of the measure in the WTO notification format.\n3.   If a Party receives written comments on its proposed technical regulation or conformity assessment procedure from the other Party, it shall:\n(a)\nif requested by the other Party, discuss the written comments with the participation of its competent regulatory authority, at a time when they can be taken into account; and\n(b)\nreply in writing to the comments no later than the date of publication of the technical regulation or conformity assessment procedure.\n4.   Each Party shall endeavour to publish on a website its responses to the comments it receives following the notification referred to in paragraph 1 no later than on the date of publication of the adopted technical regulation or conformity assessment procedure.\n5.   Each Party shall, where requested by the other Party, provide information regarding the objectives of, legal basis for and rationale for, any technical regulation or conformity assessment procedure that the Party has adopted or is proposing to adopt.\n6.   Each Party shall ensure that the technical regulations and conformity assessment procedures it has adopted are published on a website that is accessible free of charge.\n7.   Each Party shall provide information on the adoption and the entry into force of technical regulations or conformity assessment procedures and the adopted final texts through an addendum to the original notification to the WTO.\n8.   Each Party shall allow a reasonable interval between the publication of technical regulations and their entry into force, in order to allow time for the economic operators of the other Party to adapt. \"Reasonable interval\" means a period of at least six months, unless this would be ineffective in fulfilling the legitimate objectives pursued.\n9.   A Party shall give positive consideration to a reasonable request from the other Party received prior to the end of the comment period set out in paragraph 1 to extend the period of time between the adoption of the technical regulation and its entry into force, except where the delay would be ineffective in fulfilling the legitimate objectives pursued.\n10.   Each Party shall ensure that the enquiry point established in accordance with Article 10 of the TBT Agreement provides information and answers in one of the official WTO languages to reasonable enquiries from the other Party or from interested persons of the other Party regarding adopted technical regulations and conformity assessment procedures.\nArticle 95\nMarking and labelling\n1.   The technical regulations of a Party may include or exclusively address mandatory marking or labelling requirements. In such cases, the principles of Article 2.2 of the TBT Agreement apply to these technical regulations.\n2.   Where a Party requires mandatory marking or labelling of products, all of the following conditions shall apply:\n(a)\nit shall only require information which is relevant for consumers or users of the product or information that indicates that the product conforms to the mandatory technical requirements;\n(b)\nit shall not require any prior approval, registration or certification of the labels or markings of products, nor any fee disbursement, as a precondition for placing on its market products that otherwise comply with its mandatory technical requirements unless it is necessary in view of legitimate objectives;\n(c)\nwhere the Party requires the use of a unique identification number by economic operators, it shall issue such a number to the economic operators of the other Party without undue delay and on a non-discriminatory basis;\n(d)\nunless the information listed in point (i), (ii) or (iii) would be misleading, contradictory or confusing in relation to the information that the importing Party requires with respect to the goods, the importing Party shall permit:\n(i)\ninformation in other languages in addition to the language required in the importing Party of the goods;\n(ii)\ninternationally-accepted nomenclatures, pictograms, symbols or graphics; and\n(iii)\nadditional information to that required in the importing Party of the goods;\n(e)\nit shall accept that labelling, including supplementary labelling or corrections to labelling, take place in customs warehouses or other designated areas in the country of import as an alternative to labelling in the country of origin, unless such labelling is required to be carried out by approved persons for reasons of public health or safety; and\n(f)\nunless it considers that legitimate objectives may be undermined, it shall endeavour to accept the use of non-permanent or detachable labels, or marking or labelling in the accompanying documentation, rather than requiring labels or marking to be physically attached to the product.\nArticle 96\nCooperation on market surveillance and non-food product safety and compliance\n1.   The Parties recognise the importance of cooperation on market surveillance, compliance and the safety of non-food products for the facilitation of trade and for the protection of consumers and other users, and the importance of building mutual trust based on shared information.\n2.   To guarantee the independent and impartial functioning of market surveillance, the Parties shall ensure:\n(a)\nthe separation of market surveillance functions from conformity assessment functions; and\n(b)\nthe absence of any interests that would affect the impartiality of market surveillance authorities in the performance of their control or supervision of economic operators.\n3.   The Parties shall cooperate and exchange information in the area of non-food product safety and compliance, which may include in particular the following:\n(a)\nmarket surveillance and enforcement activities and measures;\n(b)\nrisk assessment methods and product testing;\n(c)\ncoordinated product recalls or other similar actions;\n(d)\nscientific, technical and regulatory matters in order to improve non-food product safety and compliance;\n(e)\nemerging issues of significant health and safety relevance;\n(f)\nstandardisation-related activities;\n(g)\nexchanges of officials.\n4.   The Partnership Council shall use its best endeavours to establish in Annex 16, as soon as possible and preferably within six months of entry into force of this Agreement, an arrangement for the regular exchange of information between the Rapid Alert System for non-food products (RAPEX), or its successor, and the database relating to market surveillance and product safety established under the General Product Safety Regulations 2005, or its successor, in relation to the safety of non-food products and related preventive, restrictive and corrective measures.\nThe arrangement shall set out the modalities under which:\n(a)\nthe Union is to provide the United Kingdom with selected information from its RAPEX alert system, or its successor, as referred to in Directive 2001/95/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 3 December 2001 on general product safety, or its successor;\n(b)\nthe United Kingdom is to provide the Union with selected information from its database relating to market surveillance and product safety established under the General Product Safety Regulations 2005, or its successor; and\n(c)\nthe Parties are to inform each other of any follow-up actions and measures taken in response to the information exchanged.\n5.   The Partnership Council may establish in Annex 17 an arrangement on the regular exchange of information, including the exchange of information by electronic means, regarding measures taken on non-compliant non-food products, other than those covered by paragraph 4.\n6.   Each Party shall use the information obtained pursuant to paragraphs 3, 4 and 5 for the sole purpose of protecting consumers, health, safety or the environment.\n7.   Each Party shall treat the information obtained pursuant to paragraphs 3, 4 and 5 as confidential.\n8.

For the purposes of this Article, \"market surveillance\" means activities conducted and measures taken by market surveillance and enforcement authorities, including activities conducted and measures taken in cooperation with economic operators, on the basis of procedures of a Party to enable that Party to monitor or address safety of products and their compliance with the requirements set out in its laws and regulations.\n10.   Each Party shall ensure that any measure taken by its market surveillance or enforcement authorities to withdraw or recall from its market or to prohibit or restrict the making available on its market of a product imported from the territory of the other Party, for reasons related to non-compliance with the applicable legislation, is proportionate, states the exact grounds on which the measure is based and is communicated without delay to the relevant economic operator.\nArticle 97\nTechnical discussions\n1.   If a Party considers that a draft or proposed technical regulation or conformity assessment procedure of the other Party might have a significant effect on trade between the Parties, it may request technical discussions on the matter. The request shall be made in writing to the other Party and shall identify:\n(a)\nthe measure at issue;\n(b)\nthe provisions of this Chapter or of an Annex to this Chapter to which the concerns relate; and\n(c)\nthe reasons for the request, including a description of the requesting Party's concerns regarding the measure.\n2.

The Parties shall endeavour, where appropriate, to review the non-conforming measures and reservations set out in Annexes 19, 20, 21 and 22 and the activities for short term business visitors set out in Annex 21, with a view to agreeing to possible improvements in their mutual interest.\n3.   This Article shall not apply with respect to financial services.\nCHAPTER 2\nINVESTMENT LIBERALISATION\nArticle 127\nScope\nThis Chapter applies to measures of a Party affecting the establishment of an enterprise to perform economic activities and the operation of such an enterprise by:\n(a)\ninvestors of the other Party;\n(b)\ncovered enterprises; and\n(c)\nfor the purposes of Article 132, any enterprise in the territory of the Party which adopts or maintains the measure.\nArticle 128\nMarket access\nA Party shall not adopt or maintain, with regard to establishment of an enterprise by an investor of the other Party or by a covered enterprise, or operation of a covered enterprise, either on the basis of its entire territory or on the basis of a territorial sub-division, measures that:\n(a)\nimpose limitations on:\n(i)\nthe number of enterprises that may carry out a specific economic activity, whether in the form of numerical quotas, monopolies, exclusive rights or the requirement of an economic needs test;\n(ii)\nthe total value of transactions or assets in the form of numerical quotas or the requirement of an economic needs test;\n(iii)\nthe total number of operations or on the total quantity of output expressed in terms of designated numerical units in the form of quotas or the requirement of an economic needs test; (10) (11)\n(iv)\nthe participation of foreign capital in terms of maximum percentage limit on foreign shareholding or the total value of individual or aggregate foreign investment; or\n(v)\nthe total number of natural persons that may be employed in a particular sector or that an enterprise may employ and who are necessary for, and directly related to, the performance of an economic activity, in the form of numerical quotas or the requirement of an economic needs test; or\n(b)\nrestrict or require specific types of legal entity or joint venture through which an investor of the other Party may perform an economic activity.\nArticle 129\nNational treatment\n1.   Each Party shall accord to investors of the other Party and to covered enterprises treatment no less favourable than that it accords, in like situations, to its own investors and to their enterprises, with respect to their establishment and operation in its territory.\n2.   The treatment accorded by a Party under paragraph 1 means:\n(a)\nwith respect to a regional or local level of government of the United Kingdom, treatment no less favourable than the most favourable treatment accorded, in like situations, by that level of government to investors of the United Kingdom and to their enterprises in its territory; and\n(b)\nwith respect to a government of, or in, a Member State, treatment no less favourable than the most favourable treatment accorded, in like situations, by that government to investors of that Member State and to their enterprises in its territory.\nArticle 130\nMost-favoured-nation-treatment\n1.   Each Party shall accord to investors of the other Party and to covered enterprises treatment no less favourable than that it accords, in like situations, to investors of a third country and to their enterprises, with respect to establishment in its territory.\n2.   Each Party shall accord to investors of the other Party and to covered enterprises treatment no less favourable than that it accords, in like situations, to investors of a third country and to their enterprises, with respect to operation in its territory.\n3.   Paragraphs 1 and 2 shall not be construed as obliging a Party to extend to investors of the other Party or to covered enterprises the benefit of any treatment resulting from:\n(a)\nan international agreement for the avoidance of double taxation or other international agreement or arrangement relating wholly or mainly to taxation; or\n(b)\nmeasures providing for recognition, including the recognition of the standards or criteria for the authorisation, licencing, or certification of a natural person or enterprise to carry out an economic activity, or the recognition of prudential measures as referred to in paragraph 3 of the GATS Annex on Financial Services.\n4.   For greater certainty, the \"treatment\" referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 does not include investor-to-state dispute settlement procedures provided for in other international agreements.\n5.   For greater certainty, the existence of substantive provisions in other international agreements concluded by a Party with a third country, or the mere formal transposition of those provisions into domestic law to the extent that it is necessary in order to incorporate them into the domestic legal order, do not in themselves constitute the \"treatment\" referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2. Measures of a Party pursuant to those provisions may constitute such treatment and thus give rise to a breach of this Article.\nArticle 131\nSenior management and boards of directors\nA Party shall not require a covered enterprise to appoint individuals of any particular nationality as executives, managers or members of boards of directors.\nArticle 132\nPerformance requirements\n1.   A Party shall not impose or enforce any requirement, or enforce any commitment or undertaking, in connection with the establishment or operation of any enterprise in its territory:\n(a)\nto export a given level or percentage of goods or services;\n(b)\nto achieve a given level or percentage of domestic content;\n(c)\nto purchase, use or accord a preference to goods produced or services provided in its territory or to purchase goods or services from natural or legal persons or any other entities in its territory;\n(d)\nto relate in any way the volume or value of imports to the volume or value of exports or to the amount of foreign exchange inflows associated with such enterprise;\n(e)\nto restrict sales of goods or services in its territory that such enterprise produces or supplies, by relating those sales in any way to the volume or value of its exports or foreign exchange inflows;\n(f)\nto transfer technology, a production process or other proprietary knowledge to a natural or legal person or any other entity in its territory (12);\n(g)\nto supply exclusively from the territory of that Party a good produced or a service supplied by the enterprise to a specific regional or world market;\n(h)\nto locate the headquarters for a specific region of the world which is broader than the territory of the Party or the world market in its territory;\n(i)\nto employ a given number or percentage of natural persons of that Party;\n(j)\nto achieve a given level or value of research and development in its territory;\n(k)\nto restrict the exportation or sale for export; or\n(l)\nwith regard to any licence contract in existence at the time the requirement is imposed or enforced, or any commitment or undertaking is enforced, or with regard to any future licence contract freely entered into between the enterprise and a natural or legal person or any other entity in its territory, if the requirement is imposed or enforced or the commitment or undertaking is enforced, in a manner that constitutes direct interference with that licence contract by an exercise of non-judicial governmental authority of a Party, to adopt:\n(i)\na rate or amount of royalty below a certain level; or\n(ii)\na given duration of the term of a licence contract.\nThis point does not apply where the licence contract is concluded between the enterprise and the Party. For the purposes of this point, a \"licence contract\" means any contract concerning the licensing of technology, a production process, or other proprietary knowledge.\n2.   A Party shall not condition the receipt or continued receipt of an advantage, in connection with the establishment or operation of an enterprise in its territory, on compliance with any of the following requirements:\n(a)\nachieving a given level or percentage of domestic content;\n(b)\npurchasing, using or according a preference to goods produced or services supplied in its territory, or to purchase goods or services from natural or legal persons or any other entity in its territory;\n(c)\nrelating in any way the volume or value of imports to the volume or value of exports or to the amount of foreign exchange inflows associated with that enterprise;\n(d)\nrestricting the sales of goods or services in its territory that that enterprise produces or supplies by relating those sales in any way to the volume or value of its exports or foreign exchange inflows; or\n(e)\nrestricting the exportation or sale for export.\n3.   Paragraph 2 shall not be construed as preventing a Party from conditioning the receipt or continued receipt of an advantage, in connection with the establishment or operation of any enterprise in its territory, on compliance with a requirement to locate production, supply a service, train or employ workers, construct or expand particular facilities, or carry out research and development, in its territory.\n4.   Points (f) and (l) of paragraph 1 of this Article do not apply where:\n(a)\nthe requirement is imposed or enforced, or the commitment or undertaking is enforced, by a court or administrative tribunal, or by a competition authority pursuant to a Party's competition law to prevent or remedy a restriction or a distortion of competition; or\n(b)\na Party authorises the use of an intellectual property right in accordance with Article 31 or Article 31bis of the TRIPS Agreement, or adopts or maintains measures requiring the disclosure of data or proprietary information that fall within the scope of, and are consistent with, paragraph 3 of Article 39 of the TRIPS Agreement.\n5.   Points (a) to (c) of paragraph 1 and points (a) and (b) of paragraph 2 do not apply to qualification requirements for goods or services with respect to participation in export promotion and foreign aid programmes.\n6.   For greater certainty, this Article does not preclude the enforcement by the competent authorities of a Party of any commitment or undertaking given between persons other than a Party which was not directly or indirectly imposed or required by that Party.\n7.   For greater certainty, points (a) and (b) of paragraph 2 do not apply to requirements imposed by an importing Party in relation to the content of goods necessary to qualify for preferential tariffs or preferential quotas.\n8.   Point (l) of paragraph 1 does not apply if the requirement is imposed or enforced, or the commitment or undertaking is enforced, by a tribunal as equitable remuneration under the Party's copyright laws.\n9.   A Party shall neither impose nor enforce any measure inconsistent with its obligations under the Agreement on Trade-Related Investment Measures (TRIMs), even where such measure has been listed by that Party in Annex 19 or 20.\n10.   For greater certainty, this Article shall not be construed as requiring a Party to permit a particular service to be supplied on a cross-border basis where that Party adopts or maintains restrictions or prohibitions on such provision of services which are consistent with the reservations, conditions or qualifications specified with respect to a sector, subsector or activity listed in Annex 19 or 20.\n11.   A condition for the receipt or continued receipt of an advantage referred to in paragraph 2 does not constitute a requirement or a commitment or undertaking for the purposes of paragraph 1.\nArticle 133\nNon-conforming measures and exceptions\n1.   Articles 128, 129, 130, 131 and 132 do not apply to:\n(a)\nany existing non-conforming measure of a Party at the level of:\n(i)\nfor the Union:\n(A)\nthe Union, as set out in the Schedule of the Union in Annex 19;\n(B)\nThe central government of a Member State, as set out in the Schedule of the Union in Annex 19;\n(C)\na regional government of a Member State, as set out in the Schedule of the Union in Annex 19; or\n(D)\na local government, other than that referred to in point (C); and\n(ii)\nfor the United Kingdom:\n(A)\nthe central government, as set out in the Schedule of the United Kingdom in Annex 19;\n(B)\na regional government, as set out in the Schedule of the United Kingdom in Annex 19;\nor\n(C)\na local government;\n(b)\nthe continuation or prompt renewal of any non-conforming measure referred to in point (a) of this paragraph; or\n(c)\na modification to any non-conforming measure referred to in points (a) and (b) of this paragraph, to the extent that it does not decrease the conformity of the measure, as it existed immediately before the modification, with Article 128, 129, 130, 131 or 132.\n2.   Articles 128, 129, 130, 131 and 132 do not apply to a measure of a Party which is consistent with the reservations, conditions or qualifications specified with respect to a sector, subsector or activity listed in Annex 20.\n3.   Articles 129 and 130 of this Agreement do not apply to any measure that constitutes an exception to, or a derogation from, Article 3 or 4 of the TRIPS Agreement, as specifically provided for in Articles 3 to 5 of that Agreement.\n4.   For greater certainty, Articles 129 and 130 shall not be construed as preventing a Party from prescribing information requirements, including for statistical purposes, in connection with the establishment or operation of investors of the other Party or of covered enterprises, provided that it does not constitute a means to circumvent that Party's obligations under those Articles.\nCHAPTER 3\nCROSS-BORDER TRADE IN SERVICES\nArticle 134\nScope\nThis Chapter applies to measures of a Party affecting the cross-border trade in services by service suppliers of the other Party.\nArticle 135\nMarket access\nA Party shall not adopt or maintain, either on the basis of its entire territory or on the basis of a territorial sub-division, measures that:\n(a)\nimpose limitations on:\n(i)\nthe number of service suppliers that may supply a specific service, whether in the form of numerical quotas, monopolies, exclusive service suppliers or the requirement of an economic needs test;\n(ii)\nthe total value of service transactions or assets in the form of numerical quotas or the requirement of an economic needs test; or\n(iii)\nthe total number of service operations or on the total quantity of service output expressed in the terms of designated numerical units in the form of quotas or the requirement of an economic needs test (13); or\n(b)\nrestrict or require specific types of legal entity or joint venture through which a service supplier may supply a service.\nArticle 136\nLocal presence\nA Party shall not require a service supplier of the other Party to establish or maintain an enterprise or to be resident in its territory as a condition for the cross-border supply of a service.\nArticle 137\nNational treatment\n1.   Each Party shall accord to services and service suppliers of the other Party treatment no less favourable than that it accords, in like situations, to its own services and service suppliers.\n2.   A Party may meet the requirement of paragraph 1 by according to services and service suppliers of the other Party either formally identical treatment or formally different treatment to that it accords to its own services and service suppliers.\n3.   Formally identical or formally different treatment shall be considered to be less favourable if it modifies the conditions of competition in favour of services or service suppliers of the Party compared to services or service suppliers of the other Party.\n4.   Nothing in this Article shall be construed as requiring either Party to compensate for inherent competitive disadvantages which result from the foreign character of the relevant services or service suppliers.\nArticle 138\nMost-favoured-nation treatment\n1.   Each Party shall accord to services and service suppliers of the other Party treatment no less favourable than that it accords, in like situations, to services and service suppliers of a third country.\n2.   Paragraph 1 shall not be construed as obliging a Party to extend to services and service suppliers of the other Party the benefit of any treatment resulting from:\n(a)\nan international agreement for the avoidance of double taxation or other international agreement or arrangement relating wholly or mainly to taxation; or\n(b)\nmeasures providing for recognition, including of the standards or criteria for the authorisation, licencing, or certification of a natural person or enterprise to carry out an economic activity, or of prudential measures as referred to in paragraph 3 of the GATS Annex on Financial Services.\n3.   For greater certainty, the existence of substantive provisions in other international agreements concluded by a Party with a third country, or mere formal transposition of those provisions into domestic law to the extent that it is necessary in order to incorporate them into the domestic legal order, do not in themselves constitute the \"treatment\" referred to in paragraph 1. Measures of a Party pursuant to those provisions may constitute such treatment and thus give rise to a breach of this Article.\nArticle 139\nNon-conforming measures\n1.   Articles 135, 136, 137 and 138 do not apply to:\n(a)\nany existing non-conforming measure of a Party at the level of:\n(i)\nfor the Union:\n(A)\nthe Union, as set out in the Schedule of the Union in Annex 19;\n(B)\nthe central government of a Member State, as set out in the Schedule of the Union in Annex 19;\n(C)\na regional government of a Member State, as set out in the Schedule of the Union in Annex 19; or\n(D)\na local government, other than that referred to in point (C); and\n(ii)\nfor the United Kingdom:\n(A)\nthe central government, as set out in the Schedule of the United Kingdom in Annex 19;\n(B)\na regional government, as set out in the Schedule of the United Kingdom in Annex 19; or\n(C)\na local government;\n(b)\nthe continuation or prompt renewal of any non-conforming measure referred to in point (a) of this paragraph; or\n(c)\na modification to any non-conforming measure referred to in points (a) and (b) of this paragraph to the extent that it does not decrease the conformity of the measure, as it existed immediately before the modification, with Articles 135, 136, 137 and 138.\n2.   Articles 135, 136, 137 and 138 do not apply to any measure of a Party which is consistent with the reservations, conditions or qualifications specified with respect to a sector, subsector or activity listed in Annex 20.\nCHAPTER 4\nENTRY AND TEMPORARY STAY OF NATURAL PERSONS FOR BUSINESS PURPOSES\nArticle 140\nScope and definitions\n1.   This Chapter applies to measures of a Party affecting the performance of economic activities through the entry and temporary stay in its territory of natural persons of the other Party, who are business visitors for establishment purposes, contractual service suppliers, independent professionals, intra-corporate transferees and short-term business visitors.\n2.

The Partnership Council may, following such review, develop and adopt an arrangement on the conditions for the recognition of professional qualifications by decision as an annex to this Agreement, which shall be considered to form an integral part of this Title. (24)\n4.   An arrangement referred to in paragraph 3 shall provide for the conditions for recognition of professional qualifications acquired in the Union and professional qualifications acquired in the United Kingdom relating to an activity covered by this Title and Title III of this Heading.\n5.

Each Party shall provide adequate legal protection against the circumvention of any effective technological measures, which the person concerned carries out in the knowledge, or with reasonable grounds to know, that he or she is pursuing that objective. Each Party may provide for a specific regime for legal protection of technological measures used to protect computer programs.\n2.   Each Party shall provide adequate legal protection against the manufacture, import, distribution, sale, rental, advertisement for sale or rental, or possession for commercial purposes of devices, products or components or the provision of services which:\n(a)\nare promoted, advertised or marketed for the purpose of circumvention of;\n(b)\nhave only a limited commercially significant purpose or use other than to circumvent; or\n(c)\nare primarily designed, produced, adapted or performed for the purpose of enabling or facilitating the circumvention of, any effective technological measures.\n3.

Each Party shall provide that the registration of a trade mark confers on the proprietor exclusive rights therein. The proprietor shall be entitled to prevent all third parties not having the proprietor's consent from using in the course of trade:\n(a)\nany sign which is identical with the registered trade mark in relation to goods or services which are identical with those for which the trade mark is registered;\n(b)\nany sign where, because of its identity with, or similarity to, the registered trade mark and the identity or similarity of the goods or services covered by this trade mark and the sign, there exists a likelihood of confusion on the part of the public, including the likelihood of association between the sign and the registered trade mark.\n2.   The proprietor of a registered trade mark shall be entitled to prevent all third parties from bringing goods, in the course of trade, into the Party where the trade mark is registered without being released for free circulation there, where such goods, including packaging, come from other countries or the other Party and bear without authorisation a trade mark which is identical to the trade mark registered in respect of such goods, or which cannot be distinguished in its essential aspects from that trade mark.\n3.   The entitlement of the proprietor of a trade mark pursuant to paragraph 2 shall lapse if during the proceedings to determine whether the registered trade mark has been infringed, evidence is provided by the declarant or the holder of the goods that the proprietor of the registered trade mark is not entitled to prohibit the placing of the goods on the market in the country of final destination.\nArticle 239\nRegistration procedure\n1.   Each Party shall provide for a system for the registration of trade marks in which each final negative decision taken by the relevant trade mark administration, including partial refusals of registration, shall be communicated in writing to the relevant party, duly reasoned and subject to appeal.\n2.

Each Party shall provide for limited exceptions to the rights conferred by a trade mark such as the fair use of descriptive terms including geographical indications, and may provide other limited exceptions, provided such exceptions take account of the legitimate interests of the proprietor of the trade mark and of third parties.\n2.   The trade mark shall not entitle the proprietor to prohibit a third party from using, in the course of trade:\n(a)\nthe name or address of the third party, where the third party is a natural person;\n(b)\nsigns or indications concerning the kind, quality, quantity, intended purpose, value, geographical origin, the time of production of goods or of rendering of the service, or other characteristics of goods or services; or\n(c)\nthe trade mark for the purpose of identifying or referring to goods or services as those of the proprietor of that trade mark, in particular where the use of that trade mark is necessary to indicate the intended purpose of a product or service, in particular as accessories or spare parts,\nprovided the third party uses them in accordance with honest practices in industrial or commercial matters.\n3.   The trade mark shall not entitle the proprietor to prohibit a third party from using, in the course of trade, an earlier right which only applies in a particular locality if that right is recognised by the laws of the Party in question and is used within the limits of the territory in which it is recognised.\nArticle 242\nGrounds for revocation\n1.   Each Party shall provide that a trade mark shall be liable to revocation if, within a continuous period of five years it has not been put to genuine use in the relevant territory of a Party by the proprietor or with the proprietor's consent in relation to the goods or services for which it is registered, and there are no proper reasons for non-use.\n2.   Each Party shall also provide that a trade mark shall be liable to revocation if within the period of five years following the date of completion of the registration procedure it has not been put to genuine use in the relevant territory by the proprietor or with the proprietor's consent, in relation to the goods or services for which it is registered, and there are no proper reasons for non-use.\n3.   However, no person may claim that the proprietor's rights in a trade mark should be revoked where, during the interval between expiry of the five-year period and filing of the application for revocation, genuine use of the trade mark has been started or resumed. The commencement or resumption of use within a period of three months preceding the filing of the application for revocation which began at the earliest on expiry of the continuous period of five years of non-use, shall, however, be disregarded where preparations for the commencement or resumption occur only after the proprietor becomes aware that the application for revocation may be filed.\n4.   A trade mark shall also be liable to revocation if, after the date on which it was registered:\n(a)\nas a consequence of acts or inactivity of the proprietor, it has become the common name in the trade for a good or service in respect of which it is registered;\n(b)\nas a consequence of the use made of the trade mark by the proprietor of the trade mark or with the proprietor's consent in respect of the goods or services for which it is registered, it is liable to mislead the public, particularly as to the nature, quality or geographical origin of those goods or services.\nArticle 243\nThe right to prohibit preparatory acts in relation to the use of packaging or other means\nWhere the risk exists that the packaging, labels, tags, security or authenticity features or devices, or any other means to which the trade mark is affixed could be used in relation to goods or services and that use would constitute an infringement of the rights of the proprietor of the trade mark, the proprietor of that trade mark shall have the right to prohibit the following acts if carried out in the course of trade:\n(a)\naffixing a sign identical with, or similar to, the trade mark on packaging, labels, tags, security or authenticity features or devices, or any other means to which the mark may be affixed; or\n(b)\noffering or placing on the market, or stocking for those purposes, or importing or exporting, packaging, labels, tags, security or authenticity features or devices, or any other means to which the mark is affixed.\nArticle 244\nBad faith applications\nA trade mark shall be liable to be declared invalid where the application for registration of the trade mark was made in bad faith by the applicant. Each Party may provide that such a trade mark shall not be registered.\nSECTION 3\nDESIGN\nArticle 245\nProtection of registered designs\n1.   Each Party shall provide for the protection of independently created designs that are new and original. This protection shall be provided by registration and shall confer exclusive rights upon their holders in accordance with this Section.\nFor the purposes of this Article, a Party may consider that a design having individual character is original.\n2.   The holder of a registered design shall have the right to prevent third parties not having the holder's consent at least from making, offering for sale, selling, importing, exporting, stocking the product bearing and embodying the protected design or using articles bearing or embodying the protected design where such acts are undertaken for commercial purposes.\n3.   A design applied to or incorporated in a product which constitutes a component part of a complex product shall only be considered to be new and original:\n(a)\nif the component part, once it has been incorporated into the complex product, remains visible during normal use of the latter; and\n(b)\nto the extent that those visible features of the component part fulfil in themselves the requirements as to novelty and originality.\n4.   For the purposes of point (a) of paragraph 3, \"normal use\" means use by the end user, excluding maintenance, servicing or repair work.\nArticle 246\nDuration of protection\nThe duration of protection available for registered designs, including renewals of registered designs, shall amount to a total term of 25 years from the date on which the application was filed (36).\nArticle 247\nProtection of unregistered designs\n1.   Each Party shall confer on holders of an unregistered design the right to prevent the use of the unregistered design by any third party not having the holder's consent only if the contested use results from copying the unregistered design in their respective territory (37). Such use shall at least cover the offering for sale, putting on the market, importing or exporting the product.\n2.   The duration of protection available for the unregistered design shall amount to at least three years as from the date on which the design was first made available to the public in the territory of the respective Party.\nArticle 248\nExceptions and exclusions\n1.   Each Party may provide limited exceptions to the protection of designs, including unregistered designs, provided that such exceptions do not unreasonably conflict with the normal exploitation of designs, and do not unreasonably prejudice the legitimate interests of the holder of the design, taking account of the legitimate interests of third parties.\n2.   Protection shall not extend to designs solely dictated by technical or functional considerations. A design shall not subsist in features of appearance of a product which must necessarily be reproduced in their exact form and dimensions in order to permit the product in which the design is incorporated or to which it is applied to be mechanically connected to or placed in, around or against another product so that either product may perform its function.\n3.   By way of derogation from paragraph 2 of this Article, a design shall, in accordance with the conditions set out in Article 245(1), subsist in a design, which has the purpose of allowing the multiple assembly or connection of mutually interchangeable products within a modular system.\nArticle 249\nRelationship to copyright\nEach Party shall ensure that designs, including unregistered designs, shall also be eligible for protection under the copyright law of that Party as from the date on which the design was created or fixed in any form. The extent to which, and the conditions under which, such a protection is conferred, including the level of originality required, shall be determined by each Party.\nSECTION 4\nPATENTS\nArticle 250\nPatents and public health\n1.

For the purposes of point (b)(iii) of paragraph 1:\n(a)\na tax measure shall not be considered as specific unless:\n(i)\ncertain economic actors obtain a reduction in the tax liability that they otherwise would have borne under the normal taxation regime; and\n(ii)\nthose economic actors are treated more advantageously than others in a comparable position within the normal taxation regime; for the purposes of this point, a normal taxation regime is defined by its internal objective, by its features (such as the tax base, the taxable person, the taxable event or the tax rate) and by an authority which is autonomous institutionally, procedurally, economically and financially and has the competence to design the features of the taxation regime;\n(b)\nnotwithstanding point (a), a subsidy shall not be regarded as specific if it is justified by principles inherent to the design of the general system; in the case of tax measures, examples of such inherent principles are the need to fight fraud or tax evasion, administrative manageability, the avoidance of double taxation, the principle of tax neutrality, the progressive nature of income tax and its redistributive purpose, or the need to respect taxpayers' ability to pay;\n(c)\nnotwithstanding point (a), special purpose levies shall not be regarded as specific if their design is required by non-economic public policy objectives, such as the need to limit the negative impacts of certain activities or products on the environment or human health, insofar as the public policy objectives are not discriminatory (53).\nArticle 364\nScope and exceptions\n1.   Articles 366, 367 and 374 do not apply to subsidies granted to compensate the damage caused by natural disasters or other exceptional non-economic occurrences.\n2.   Nothing in this Chapter prevents the Parties from granting subsidies of a social character that are targeted at final consumers.\n3.   Subsidies that are granted on a temporary basis to respond to a national or global economic emergency shall be targeted, proportionate and effective in order to remedy that emergency. Articles 367 and 374 do not apply to such subsidies.\n4.   This Chapter does not apply to subsidies where the total amount granted to a single economic actor is below 325 000 Special Drawing Rights over any period of three fiscal years. The Partnership Council may amend this threshold.\n5.   This Chapter does not apply to subsidies that are subject to the provisions of Part IV or Annex 2 of the Agreement on Agriculture and subsidies related to trade in fish and fish products.\n6.   This Chapter does not apply to subsidies related to the audio-visual sector.\n7.   Article 371 does not apply to subsidies financed by resources of a Party at supranational level.\n8.   For the purposes of subsidies to air carriers, any reference to \"effect on trade or investment between the Parties\" in this Chapter shall be read as \"effect on competition between air carriers of the Parties in the provision of air transport services\", including those air transport services not covered under Title I of Heading Two.\nArticle 365\nServices of public economic interest\n1.   Subsidies granted to economic actors assigned with particular tasks in the public interest, including public service obligations, are subject to Article 366 insofar as the application of the principles set out in that Article does not obstruct the performance in law or fact of the particular task assigned to the economic actor concerned. The task shall be assigned in advance in a transparent manner.\n2.   The Parties shall ensure that the amount of compensation granted to an economic actor that is assigned with a task in the public interest is limited to what is necessary to cover all or part of the costs incurred in the discharge of that task, taking into account the relevant receipts and a reasonable profit for discharging that task. The Parties shall ensure that the compensation granted is not used to cross-subsidise activities falling outside the scope of the assigned task. Compensation below 15 million Special Drawing Rights per task shall not be subject to the obligations under Article 369. The Partnership Council may amend this threshold.\n3.   This Chapter does not apply where the total compensation to an economic actor providing tasks in the public interest is below 750 000 Special Drawing Rights over any period of three fiscal years. The Partnership Council may amend this threshold.\nArticle 366\nPrinciples\n1.   With a view to ensuring that subsidies are not granted where they have or could have a material effect on trade or investment between the Parties, each Party shall have in place and maintain an effective system of subsidy control that ensures that the granting of a subsidy respects the following principles:\n(a)\nsubsidies pursue a specific public policy objective to remedy an identified market failure or to address an equity rationale such as social difficulties or distributional concerns (\"the objective\");\n(b)\nsubsidies are proportionate and limited to what is necessary to achieve the objective;\n(c)\nsubsidies are designed to bring about a change of economic behaviour of the beneficiary that is conducive to achieving the objective and that would not be achieved in the absence of subsidies being provided;\n(d)\nsubsidies should not normally compensate for the costs the beneficiary would have funded in the absence of any subsidy;\n(e)\nsubsidies are an appropriate policy instrument to achieve a public policy objective and that objective cannot be achieved through other less distortive means;\n(f)\nsubsidies' positive contributions to achieving the objective outweigh any negative effects, in particular the negative effects on trade or investment between the Parties.\n2.   Without prejudice to paragraph 1 of this Article, each Party shall apply the conditions set out in Article 367, where relevant, if the subsidies concerned have or could have a material effect on trade or investment between the Parties.\n3.   It is for each Party to determine how its obligations under paragraphs 1 and 2 are implemented in the design of its subsidy control system in its own domestic law, provided that each Party shall ensure that the obligations under paragraphs 1 and 2 are implemented in its law in such a manner that the legality of an individual subsidy will be determined by the principles.\nArticle 367\nProhibited subsidies and subsidies subject to conditions\n1.   The categories of the subsidies referred to in Article 366(2) and the conditions to be applied to them are as follows. The Partnership Council may update these provisions as necessary to ensure the operation of this Article over time.\nSubsidies in the form of unlimited guarantees\n2.   Subsidies in the form of a guarantee of debts or liabilities of an economic actor without any limitation as to the amount of those debts and liabilities or the duration of that guarantee shall be prohibited.\nRescue and restructuring\n3.   Subsidies for restructuring an ailing or insolvent economic actor without the economic actor having prepared a credible restructuring plan shall be prohibited. The restructuring plan shall be based on realistic assumptions with a view to ensuring the return to long-term viability of the ailing or insolvent economic actor within a reasonable time period. During the preparation of the restructuring plan, the economic actor may receive temporary liquidity support in the form of loans or loan guarantees. Except for small and medium-sized enterprises, an economic actor or its owners, creditors or new investors shall contribute significant funds or assets to the cost of restructuring. For the purposes of this paragraph, an ailing or insolvent economic actor is one that would almost certainly go out of business in the short to medium term without the subsidy.\n4.   Other than in exceptional circumstances, subsidies for the rescue and restructuring of insolvent or ailing economic actors should only be allowed if they contribute to an objective of public interest by avoiding social hardship or preventing a severe market failure, in particular with regard to job losses or disruption of an important service that is difficult to replicate. Except in the case of unforeseeable circumstances not caused by the beneficiary, they should not be granted more than once in any five year period.\n5.   Paragraphs 3 and 4 do not apply to subsidies to ailing or insolvent banks, credit institutions and insurance companies.\nBanks, credit institutions and insurance companies\n6.   Without prejudice to Article 184, subsidies to restructure banks, credit institutions and insurance companies may only be granted on the basis of a credible restructuring plan that restores long-term viability. If a return to long-term viability cannot be credibly demonstrated, any subsidy to banks, credit institutions and insurance companies shall be limited to what is needed to ensure their orderly liquidation and exit from the market while minimising the amount of the subsidy and its negative effect on trade or investment between the Parties.\n7.   It shall be ensured that the granting authority is properly remunerated for the restructuring subsidy and that the beneficiary, its shareholders, its creditors or the business group to which the beneficiary belongs, contribute significantly to the restructuring or liquidation costs from their own resources. Subsidies to support liquidity provisions shall be temporary, shall not be used to absorb losses and shall not become capital support. Proper remuneration shall be paid to the granting authority for the subsidies granted to support liquidity provisions.\nExport subsidies\n8.   Subsidies that are contingent in law or in fact (54), whether solely or as one of several other conditions, upon export performance relating to goods or services, shall be prohibited, except in relation to:\n(a)\nshort-term credit insurance for non-marketable risks; or\n(b)\nexport credits and export credit guarantee or insurance programmes that are permissible in accordance with the SCM Agreement, read with any adjustments necessary for context.\n9.   For the purposes of point (a) of paragraph 8, \"marketable risk\" means commercial and political risks with a maximum risk period of less than two years on public and non-public buyers in marketable risk countries (55). A country may be understood to be temporarily removed from the group of marketable risk countries if there is a lack of sufficient private market capacity because of:\n(a)\na significant contraction of private credit insurance capacity;\n(b)\na significant deterioration of sovereign sector rating; or\n(c)\na significant deterioration of corporate sector performance.\n10.   Such temporary removal of a marketable risk country shall take effect, as far as a Party is concerned, in accordance with a decision of that Party on the basis of the criteria in paragraph 9, and only if that Party adopts such a decision. The publication of that decision shall be deemed to constitute notice to the other Party of such temporary removal as far as the former Party is concerned.\n11.   If a subsidised insurer provides export credit insurance, any insurance for marketable risks shall be provided on a commercial basis. In such a case, the insurer shall not directly or indirectly benefit from subsidies for the provision of insurance for marketable risks.\nSubsidies contingent upon the use of domestic content\n12.   Without prejudice to Articles 132 and 133, subsidies contingent, whether solely or as one of several other conditions, upon the use of domestic over imported goods or services shall be prohibited.\nLarge cross-border or international cooperation projects\n13.   Subsidies may be granted in the context of large cross-border or international cooperation projects, such as those for transport, energy, the environment, research and development, and first deployment projects to incentivise the emergence and deployment of new technologies (excluding manufacturing). The benefits of such cross-border or international cooperation projects must not be limited to the economic actors or to the sector or the States participating, but must have wider benefit and relevance through spillover effects that do not exclusively accrue to the State that grants the subsidy, the relevant sector and beneficiary.\nEnergy and environment\n14.   The Parties recognise the importance of a secure, affordable and sustainable energy system and environmental sustainability, notably in relation to the fight against climate change which represents an existential threat to humanity. Therefore, without prejudice to Article 366, subsidies in relation to energy and environment shall be aimed at, and incentivise the beneficiary in, delivering a secure, affordable and sustainable energy system and a well-functioning and competitive energy market or increasing the level of environmental protection compared to the level that would be achieved in absence of the subsidy. Such subsidies shall not relieve the beneficiary from liabilities arising from its responsibilities as a polluter under the law of the relevant Party.\nSubsidies to air carriers for the operation of routes\n15.   Subsidies shall not be granted to an air carrier (56) for the operation of routes except:\n(a)\nwhere there is a public service obligation, in accordance with Article 365;\n(b)\nin special cases where this funding provides benefits for society at large; or\n(c)\nas start-up subsidies for opening new routes to regional airports provided that such subsidies increase the mobility of citizens and stimulate regional development.\nArticle 368\nUse of subsidies\nEach Party shall ensure that economic actors use subsidies only for the specific purpose for which they are granted.\nArticle 369\nTransparency\n1.   With respect to any subsidy granted or maintained within its territory, each Party shall within six months from the granting of the subsidy make publicly available, on an official website or a public database, the following information:\n(a)\nthe legal basis and policy objective or purpose of the subsidy;\n(b)\nthe name of the recipient of the subsidy when available;\n(c)\nthe date of the grant of the subsidy, the duration of the subsidy and any other time limits attached to the subsidy; and\n(d)\nthe amount of the subsidy or the amount budgeted for the subsidy.\n2.   For subsidies in the form of tax measures, information shall be made public within one year from the date the tax declaration is due. The transparency obligations for subsidies in the form of tax measures concern the same information as listed in paragraph 1, except for the information required under point (d) of that paragraph, which may be provided as a range.\n3.   In addition to the obligation set out in paragraph 1, the Parties shall make subsidy information available in accordance with paragraph 4 or 5.\n4.   For the Union, compliance with paragraph 3 of this Article means that with respect to any subsidy granted or maintained within its territory, within six months from the grant of the subsidy, information is made publicly available, on an official website or a public database, that allows interested parties to assess compliance with the principles set out in Article 366.\n5.   For the United Kingdom, compliance with paragraph 3 means that the United Kingdom shall ensure that:\n(a)\nif an interested party communicates to the granting authority that it may apply for a review by a court or tribunal of:\n(i)\nthe grant of a subsidy by a granting authority; or\n(ii)\nany relevant decision by the granting authority or the independent body or authority;\n(b)\nthen, within 28 days of the request being made in writing, the granting authority, independent body or authority shall provide that interested party with the information that allows the interested party to assess the application of the principles set out in Article 366, subject to any proportionate restrictions which pursue a legitimate objective, such as commercial sensitivity, confidentiality or legal privilege.\nThe information referred to in point (b) of the first subparagraph shall be provided to the interested party for the purposes of enabling it to make an informed decision as to whether to make a claim or to understand and properly identify the issues in dispute in the proposed claim.\n6.   For the purposes of this Article and Articles 372 and 373, \"interested party\" means any natural or legal person, economic actor or association of economic actors whose interest might be affected by the granting of a subsidy, in particular the beneficiary, economic actors competing with the beneficiary or relevant trade associations.\n7.   The obligations in this Article are without prejudice to the obligations of the Parties under their respective laws concerning the freedom of information or access to documents.\nArticle 370\nConsultations on subsidy control\n1.   If a Party considers that a subsidy has been granted by the other Party or that there is clear evidence that the other Party intends to grant a subsidy and that the granting of the subsidy has or could have a negative effect on trade or investment between the Parties, it may request to the other Party to provide an explanation of how the principles set out in Article 366 have been respected with regard to that subsidy.\n2.   A Party may also request the information listed in Article 369(1) to the extent that the information has not already been made publicly available on an official website or a public database as referred to in Article 369(1), or to the extent that the information has not been made available in an easily and readily accessible manner.\n3.   The other Party shall provide the requested information in writing no later than 60 days of the receipt of the request. If any requested information cannot be provided, that Party shall explain the absence of such information in its written response.\n4.   If after receiving the information requested, the requesting Party still considers that the subsidy granted or intended to be granted by the other Party has or could have a negative effect on trade or investment between the Parties, the requesting Party may request consultations within the Trade Specialised Committee on Level Playing Field for Open and Fair Competition and Sustainable Development. The request shall be in writing and shall include an explanation of the requesting Party's reasons for requesting the consultation.\n5.   The Trade Specialised Committee on Level Playing Field for Open and Fair Competition and Sustainable Development shall make every attempt to arrive at a mutually satisfactory resolution of the matter. It shall hold its first meeting within 30 days of the request for consultation.\n6.   The timeframes for the consultations referred to in paragraphs 3 and 5 may be extended by agreement between the Parties.\nArticle 371\nIndependent authority or body and cooperation\n1.   Each Party shall establish or maintain an operationally independent authority or body with an appropriate role in its subsidy control regime. That independent authority or body shall have the necessary guarantees of independence in exercising its operational functions and shall act impartially.\n2.   The Parties shall encourage their respective independent authorities or bodies to cooperate with each other on issues of common interest within their respective functions, including the application of Articles 363 to 369 as applicable, within the limits established by their respective legal frameworks. The Parties, or their respective independent authorities or bodies, may agree upon a separate framework regarding cooperation between those independent authorities.\nArticle 372\nCourts and tribunals\n1.   Each Party shall ensure, in accordance with its general and constitutional laws and procedures, that its courts or tribunals are competent to:\n(a)\nreview subsidy decisions taken by a granting authority or, where relevant, the independent authority or body for compliance with that Party's law implementing Article 366;\n(b)\nreview any other relevant decisions of the independent authority or body and any relevant failure to act;\n(c)\nimpose remedies that are effective in relation to point (a) or (b), including the suspension, prohibition or requirement of action by the granting authority, the award of damages, and the recovery of a subsidy from its beneficiary, if and to the extent that those remedies are available under the respective laws on the date of entry into force of this Agreement;\n(d)\nhear claims from interested parties in respect of subsidies that are subject to this Chapter where an interested party has standing to bring a claim in respect of a subsidy under that Party's law.\n2.   Each Party shall have the right to intervene with the permission, where required, of the court or tribunal concerned, in accordance with the general laws and procedures of the other Party in cases referred to in paragraph 1.\n3.   Without prejudice to the obligations to maintain or, where necessary, to create the competencies, remedies and rights of intervention referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Article, and Article 373, nothing in this Article requires either Party to create rights of action, remedies, procedures, or widen the scope or grounds of review of decisions of their respective public authorities, beyond those existing under its law on the date of entry into force of this Agreement.\n4.   Nothing in this Article requires either Party to widen the scope or grounds of review by its courts and tribunals of Acts of the United Kingdom Parliament, of acts of the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union, or of acts of the Council of the European Union beyond those existing under its law on the date of entry into force of this Agreement. (57)\nArticle 373\nRecovery\n1.   Each Party shall have in place an effective mechanism of recovery in respect of subsidies in accordance with the following provisions, without prejudice to other remedies that exist in that Party's law. (58)\n2.   Each Party shall ensure that, provided that the interested party as defined in Article 369 has challenged a decision to grant a subsidy before a court or a tribunal within the specified time period, as defined in paragraph 3 of this Article, recovery may be ordered if a court or tribunal of a Party makes a finding of a material error of law, in that:\n(a)\na measure constituting a subsidy was not treated by the grantor as a subsidy;\n(b)\nthe grantor of a subsidy has failed to apply the principles set out in Article 366, as implemented in that Party's law, or applied them in a manner which falls below the standard of review applicable in that Party's law; or\n(c)\nthe grantor of a subsidy has, by deciding to grant that subsidy, acted outside the scope of its powers or misused those powers in relation to the principles set out in Article 366, as implemented in that Party's law.\n3.   For the purposes of this Article, the specified time period shall be determined as follows:\n(a)\nfor the Union, it shall commence on the date on which information specified in Article 369(1), (2) and (4) was made available on the official website or public database and be no shorter than one month.\n(b)\nfor the United Kingdom:\n(i)\nit shall commence on the date on which information specified in Article 369(1) and (2) was made available on the official website or public database;\n(ii)\nit shall terminate one month later, unless, prior to that date, the interested party has requested information under the process specified in Article 369(5);\n(iii)\nonce the interested party has received the information identified in point (b) of Article 369(5) sufficient for the purposes identified in Article 369(5), there shall be a further one month period at the end of which the specified time period shall terminate;\n(iv)\nthe date of receipt of the information in point (iii) will be the date on which the granting authority certifies that it has provided the information identified in point (b) of Article 369(5) sufficient for those purposes, irrespective of further or clarificatory correspondence after that date;\n(v)\nthe time periods identified in points (i), (ii) and (iii) may be increased by legislation.\n4.   For the purposes of point (b) of paragraph 3 in relation to schemes, the specified time period commences when the information under point (b) of this paragraph is published, not when subsequent payments are made, where:\n(a)\na subsidy is ostensibly granted in accordance with the terms of a scheme;\n(b)\nthe maker of the scheme has made publicly available the information required to be published by Article 369(1) and (2) in respect of the scheme; and\n(c)\nthe information provided about the scheme under point (b) of this paragraph contains information about the subsidy that would enable an interested party to determine whether it may be affected by the scheme, which at a minimum shall cover the purpose of the subsidy, the categories of beneficiary, the terms and conditions of eligibility for the subsidy and the basis for the calculation of the subsidy (including any relevant conditions relating to subsidy ratios or amounts).\n5.   For the purposes of this Article, recovery of a subsidy is not required where a subsidy is granted on the basis of an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom, of an act of the European Parliament and of the Council of the European Union or of an act of the Council of the European Union.\n6.   Nothing in this Article prevents a Party from choosing to provide additional situations where recovery is a remedy, beyond those specified in this Article, in accordance with its law.\n7.   The Parties recognise that recovery is an important remedial tool in any system of subsidy control. At the request of either Party, the Parties shall within the Partnership Council consider additional or alternative mechanisms for recovery, as well as corresponding amendments to this Article. Within the Partnership Council, either Party may propose amendments to allow for different arrangements for their respective mechanisms for recovery. A Party shall consider a proposal made by the other Party in good faith and agree to it, provided that that Party considers that it contains arrangements which represent at least as effective a means of securing recovery as the existing mechanisms of the other Party. The Partnership Council may then make corresponding amendments to this Article. (59)\nArticle 374\nRemedial measures\n1.   A Party may deliver to the other Party a written request for information and consultations regarding a subsidy that it considers causes, or there is a serious risk that it will cause, a significant negative effect on trade or investment between the Parties. The requesting Party should provide in that request all relevant information to enable the Parties to find a mutually acceptable solution, including a description of the subsidy and the concerns of the requesting Party regarding its effect on trade or investment.\n2.   No later than 30 days from the date of delivery of the request, the requested Party shall deliver a written response providing the requested information to the requesting Party, and the Parties shall enter into consultations, which shall be deemed concluded 60 days from the date of delivery of that request, unless the Parties agree otherwise. Such consultations, and in particular all information designated as confidential and positions taken by the Parties during consultations, shall be confidential and shall be without prejudice to the rights of either Party in any further proceedings.\n3.   No earlier than 60 days from the date of delivery of the request referred to in paragraph 1, the requesting Party may unilaterally take appropriate remedial measures if there is evidence that a subsidy of the requested Party causes, or there is a serious risk that it will cause, a significant negative effect on trade or investment between the Parties.\n4.   No earlier than 45 days from the date of delivery of the request referred to in paragraph 1, the requesting Party shall notify the requested Party of the remedial measures that it intends to take in accordance with paragraph 3. The requesting Party shall provide all relevant information in relation to the measures that it intends to take to enable the Parties to find a mutually acceptable solution. The requesting Party may not take those remedial measures earlier than 15 days from the date of delivery of the notification of those measures to the requested Party.\n5.   A Party's assessment of the existence of a serious risk of a significant negative effect shall be based on facts and not merely on allegation, conjecture or remote possibility. The change in circumstances that would create a situation in which the subsidy would cause such a significant negative effect must be clearly predictable.\n6.   A Party's assessment of the existence of a subsidy or of a significant negative effect on trade or investment between the Parties caused by the subsidy shall be based on reliable evidence and not merely on conjecture or remote possibility, and shall relate to identifiable goods, service suppliers or other economic actors, including, if relevant, in the case of subsidy schemes.\n7.   The Partnership Council may maintain an illustrative list of what would amount to a significant negative effect on trade or investment between the Parties within the meaning of this Article. This shall be without prejudice to the right of the Parties to take remedial measures.\n8.   The remedial measures taken pursuant to paragraph 3 shall be restricted to what is strictly necessary and proportionate in order to remedy the significant negative effect caused or to address the serious risk of such an effect. Priority shall be given to measures that will least disturb the functioning of this Agreement.\n9.   Within five days from the date on which the remedial measures referred to in paragraph 3 enter into effect and without having prior recourse to consultations in accordance with Article 738, the notified Party may request, in accordance with Article 739(2), the establishment of an arbitration tribunal by means of a written request delivered to the requesting Party in order for the arbitration tribunal to decide whether:\n(a)\na remedial measure taken by the requesting Party is inconsistent with paragraph 3 or 8;\n(b)\nthe requesting Party did not participate in the consultations after the requested Party delivered the requested information and agreed to the holding of such consultations; or\n(c)\nthere was a failure to take or notify a remedial measure in accordance with the time periods referred to in paragraph 3 or 4 respectively.\nThat request shall not have a suspensive effect on the remedial measures. Furthermore, the arbitration tribunal shall not assess the application by the Parties of Articles 366 and 367.\n10.   The arbitration tribunal established following the request referred to in paragraph 9 of this Article shall conduct its proceedings in accordance with Article 760 and deliver its final ruling within 30 days from its establishment.\n11.   In the case of a finding against the respondent Party, the respondent Party shall, at the latest 30 days from the date of delivery of the ruling of the arbitration tribunal, deliver a notification to the complaining Party of any measure that it has taken to comply with that ruling.\n12.   Following a finding against the respondent Party in the procedure referred to paragraph 10 of this Article, the complaining Party may request the arbitration tribunal, within 30 days from its ruling, to determine a level of suspension of obligations under this Agreement or a supplementing agreement not exceeding the level equivalent to the nullification or impairment caused by the application of the remedial measures, if it finds that the inconsistency of the remedial measures with paragraph 3 or 8 of this Article is significant. The request shall propose a level of suspension of obligations in accordance with the principles set out in Article 761. The complaining Party may suspend obligations under this Agreement or a supplementing agreement in accordance with the level of suspension of obligations determined by the arbitration tribunal. Such suspension shall not be applied sooner than 15 days following such ruling.\n13.   A Party shall not invoke the WTO Agreement or any other international agreement to preclude the other Party from taking measures pursuant to this Article, including where those measures consist in the suspension of obligations under this Agreement or under a supplementing agreement.\n14.   For the purposes of assessing whether imposing or maintaining remedial measures on imports of the same product is restricted to what is strictly necessary or proportionate for the purposes of this Article, a Party:\n(a)\nshall take into account countervailing measures applied or maintained pursuant to Article 32(3); and\n(b)\nmay take into account anti-dumping measures applied or maintained pursuant to Article 32(3).\n15.   A Party shall not apply simultaneously a remedial measure under this Article and a rebalancing measure under Article 411 to remedy the impact on trade or investment caused directly by the same subsidy.\n16.   If the Party against which remedial measures were taken does not submit a request pursuant to paragraph 9 of this Article within the time period laid down in that paragraph, that Party may initiate the arbitration procedure referred to in Article 739 to challenge a remedial measure on the grounds set out in paragraph 9 of this Article without having prior recourse to consultations in accordance with Article 738. An arbitration tribunal shall treat the issue as a case of urgency for the purpose of Article 744.\n17.   For the purposes of the proceedings under paragraphs 9 and 16, in assessing whether a remedial measure is strictly necessary or proportionate, the arbitration tribunal shall pay due regard to the principles set out in paragraphs 5 and 6, as well as to paragraphs 13, 14 and 15.\nArticle 375\nDispute settlement\n1.   Subject to paragraphs 2 and 3 of this Article, Title I of Part Six applies to disputes between the Parties concerning the interpretation and application of this Chapter, except for Articles 371 and 372.\n2.

A Party may request consultations with the other Party regarding any matter arising under Article 355(3) and Chapters 6, 7, and 8 by delivering a written request to the other Party. The complaining Party shall specify in its written request the reasons and basis for the request, including identification of the measures at issue, specifying the provisions that it considers applicable. Consultations must commence promptly after a Party delivers a request for consultations and in any event not later than 30 days after the date of delivery of the request, unless the Parties agree to a longer period.\n2.   The Parties shall enter into consultations with the aim of reaching a mutually satisfactory resolution of the matter. During consultations, each Party shall provide the other Party with sufficient information in its possession to allow a full examination of the matters raised. Each Party shall endeavour to ensure the participation of personnel of their competent authorities who have expertise in the matter subject to the consultations.\n3.   In matters relating to Article 355(3) or to the multilateral agreements or instruments referred to in Chapters 6, 7 or 8 the Parties shall take into account available information from the ILO or relevant bodies or organisations established under multilateral environmental agreements. Where relevant, the Parties shall jointly seek advice from such organisations or their bodies, or any other expert or body they deem appropriate.\n4.   Each Party may seek, when appropriate, the views of the domestic advisory groups referred to in Article 13 or other expert advice.\n5.   Any resolution reached by the Parties shall be made available to the public.\nArticle 409\nPanel of experts\n1.   For any matter that is not satisfactorily addressed through consultations under Article 408, a Party may, after 90 days from the receipt of a request for consultations under that Article, request that a panel of experts be convened to examine that matter, by delivering a written request to the other Party. The request shall identify the measure at issue, specify and explain how that measure does not conform with the provisions of the relevant Chapter or Chapters in a manner sufficient to present the complaint clearly.\n2.   The panel of experts shall be composed of three panellists.\n3.   The Trade Specialised Committee on Level Playing Field for Open and Fair Competition and Sustainable Development shall, at its first meeting after the entry into force of this Agreement, establish a list of at least 15 individuals who are willing and able to serve as panellists. Each Party shall name at least five individuals to the list to serve as panellists. The Parties shall also name at least five individuals who are not nationals of either Party and who are willing and able to serve as chairperson of a panel of experts. The Trade Specialised Committee on Level Playing Field for Open and Fair Competition and Sustainable Development shall ensure that the list is kept up to date and that the number of experts is maintained at a minimum of 15 individuals.\n4.   The experts proposed as panellists must have specialised knowledge or expertise in labour or environmental law, other issues addressed in the relevant Chapter or Chapters, or in the resolution of disputes arising under international agreements. They must serve in their individual capacities and not take instructions from any organisation or government with regard to matters related to the dispute. They must not be affiliated with or take instructions from either Party. They shall not be persons who are members, officials or other servants of the Union institutions, of the Government of a Member State, or of the Government of the United Kingdom.\n5.   Unless the Parties agree otherwise within five days from the date of establishment of the panel of experts, the terms of reference shall be:\n\"to examine, in the light of the relevant provisions, the matter referred to in the request for the establishment of the panel of experts, and to deliver a report in accordance with this Article that makes findings on the conformity of the measure with the relevant provisions\".\n6.   In respect of matters related to multilateral standards or agreements covered in this Title, the panel of experts should seek information from the ILO or relevant bodies established under those agreements, including any pertinent available interpretative guidance, findings or decisions adopted by the ILO and those bodies.\n7.   The panel of experts may request and receive written submissions or any other information from persons with relevant information or specialised knowledge.\n8.   The panel of experts shall make available such information to each Party, allowing them to submit their comments within 20 days of its receipt.\n9.   The panel of experts shall issue to the Parties an interim report and a final report setting out the findings of fact, its determinations on the matter including as to whether the respondent Party has conformed with its obligations under the relevant Chapter or Chapters and the rationale behind any findings and determinations that it makes. For greater certainty, the Parties share the understanding that if the Panel makes recommendations in its report, the respondent Party does not need to follow these recommendations in ensuring conformity with this Agreement.\n10.   The panel of experts shall deliver to the Parties the interim report within 100 days after the date of establishment of the panel of experts. When the panel of experts considers that this deadline cannot be met, the chairperson of the panel of experts shall notify the Parties in writing, stating the reasons for the delay and the date on which the panel of experts plans to deliver its interim report. The panel of experts shall, under no circumstances, deliver its interim report later than 125 days after the date of establishment of the panel of experts.\n11.   Each Party may deliver to the panel of experts a reasoned request to review particular aspects of the interim report within 25 days of its delivery. A Party may comment on the other Party's request within 15 days of the delivery of the request.\n12.   After considering those comments, the panel of experts shall prepare the final report. If no request to review particular aspects of the interim report are delivered within the time period referred to in paragraph 11, the interim report shall become the final report of the panel of experts.\n13.   The panel of experts shall deliver its final report to the Parties within 175 days of the date of establishment of the panel of experts. When the panel of experts considers that this time limit cannot be met, its chairperson shall notify the Parties in writing, stating the reasons for the delay and the date on which the panel of experts plans to deliver its final report. The panel of experts shall, under no circumstances, deliver its final report later than 195 days after the date of establishment of the panel of experts.\n14.   The final report shall include a discussion of any written request by the Parties on the interim report and clearly address the comments of the Parties.\n15.   The Parties shall make the final report available to the public within 15 days of its delivery by the panel of experts.\n16.   If the final report of the panel of experts determines that a Party has not conformed with its obligations under the relevant Chapter or Chapters, the Parties shall, within 90 days of the delivery of the final report, discuss appropriate measures to be implemented taking into account the report of the panel of experts. No later than 105 days after the report has been delivered to the Parties, the respondent Party shall inform its domestic advisory groups established under Article 13 and the complaining Party of its decision on any measures to be implemented.\n17.   The Trade Specialised Committee on Level Playing Field for Open and Fair Competition and Sustainable Development shall monitor the follow-up to the report of the panel of experts. The domestic advisory groups of the Parties established under Article 13 may submit observations to the Trade Specialised Committee on Level Playing Field for Open and Fair Competition and Sustainable Development in that regard.\n18.   When the Parties disagree on the existence of, or the consistency with, the relevant provisions of any measure taken to address the non-conformity, the complaining Party may deliver a request, which shall be in writing, to the original panel of experts to decide on the matter. The request shall identify any measure at issue and explain how that measure is not in conformity with the relevant provisions in a manner sufficient to present the complaint clearly. The panel of experts shall deliver its findings to the Parties within 45 days of the date of the delivery of the request.\n19.   Except as otherwise provided for in this Article, Article 739(1), Article 740 and Articles 753 to 758, as well as Annexes 48 and 49, shall apply mutatis mutandis.\nArticle 410\nPanel of experts for non-regression areas\n1.   Article 409 shall apply to disputes between the Parties concerning the interpretation and application of Chapters 6 and 7.\n2.   For the purposes of such disputes, in addition to the Articles listed in Article 409(19), Articles 749 and 750 shall apply mutatis mutandis.\n3.   The Parties recognise that, where the respondent Party chooses not take any action to conform with the report of the panel of experts and with this Agreement, any remedies authorised under Article 749 continue to be available to the complaining Party.\nArticle 411\nRebalancing\n1.   The Parties recognise the right of each Party to determine its future policies and priorities with respect to labour and social, environmental or climate protection, or with respect to subsidy control, in a manner consistent with each Party's international commitments, including those under this Agreement. At the same time, the Parties acknowledge that significant divergences in these areas can be capable of impacting trade or investment between the Parties in a manner that changes the circumstances that have formed the basis for the conclusion of this Agreement.\n2.   If material impacts on trade or investment between the Parties are arising as a result of significant divergences between the Parties in the areas referred to in paragraph 1, either Party may take appropriate rebalancing measures to address the situation. Such measures shall be restricted with respect to their scope and duration to what is strictly necessary and proportionate in order to remedy the situation. Priority shall be given to such measures as will least disturb the functioning of this Agreement. A Party's assessment of those impacts shall be based on reliable evidence and not merely on conjecture or remote possibility.\n3.   The following procedures shall apply to rebalancing measures taken under paragraph 2:\n(a)\nthe concerned Party shall, without delay, notify the other Party through the Partnership Council of the rebalancing measures it intends to take, providing all relevant information. The Parties shall immediately enter into consultations. Consultations shall be deemed concluded within 14 days from the date of delivery of the notification, unless they are jointly concluded before that time limit;\n(b)\nif no mutually acceptable solution is found, the concerned Party may adopt rebalancing measures no sooner than five days from the conclusion of the consultations, unless the notified Party requests within the same five day period, in accordance with Article 739(2) (64), the establishment of an arbitration tribunal by means of a written request delivered to the other Party in order for the arbitration tribunal to decide whether the notified rebalancing measures are consistent with paragraph 2 of this Article;\n(c)\nthe arbitration tribunal shall conduct its proceeding in accordance with Article 760 and deliver its final ruling within 30 days from its establishment. If the arbitration tribunal does not deliver its final ruling within that time period, the concerned Party may adopt the rebalancing measures no sooner than three days after the expiry of that 30 day time period. In that case, the other Party may take countermeasures proportionate to the adopted rebalancing measures until the arbitration tribunal delivers its ruling. Priority shall be given to such countermeasures as will least disturb the functioning of this Agreement. Point (a) shall apply mutatis mutandis to such countermeasures, which may be adopted no sooner than three days after the conclusion of consultations;\n(d)\nif the arbitration tribunal has found the rebalancing measures to be consistent with paragraph 2, the concerned Party may adopt the rebalancing measures as notified to the other Party;\n(e)\nif the arbitration tribunal has found the rebalancing measures to be inconsistent with paragraph 2 of this Article, the concerned Party shall, within three days from the delivery of the ruling, notify the complaining Party of the measures (65) it intends to adopt to comply with the ruling of the arbitration tribunal. Article 748(2) and Articles 749 (66) and 750 shall apply mutatis mutandis, if the complaining Party considers that the notified measures are not in compliance with the ruling of the arbitration tribunal. The procedures under Article 748(2) and Articles 749 and 750 shall have no suspensive effect on the application of the notified measures pursuant to this paragraph;\n(f)\nif rebalancing measures were adopted prior to the arbitration ruling in accordance with point (c), any countermeasures adopted pursuant to that point shall be withdrawn immediately, and in no case later than five days, after delivery of the ruling of the arbitration tribunal;\n(g)\na Party shall not invoke the WTO Agreement or any other international agreement to preclude the other Party from taking measures pursuant to paragraphs 2 and 3, including when those measures consist of suspension of obligations under this Agreement;\n(h)\nif the notified Party does not submit a request pursuant to point (b) of this paragraph within the time period laid down therein, that Party may without having prior recourse to consultations in accordance with Article 738 initiate the arbitration procedure referred to in Article 739. An arbitration tribunal shall treat the issue as a case of urgency for the purposes of Article 744.\n4.   In order to ensure an appropriate balance between the commitments made by the Parties in this Agreement on a more durable basis, either Party may request, no sooner than four years after the entry into force of this Agreement, a review of the operation of this Heading. The Parties may agree that other Headings of this Agreement may be added to the review.\n5.   Such a review shall commence at a Party's request, if that Party considers that measures under paragraph 2 or 3 have been taken frequently by either or both Parties, or if a measure that has a material impact on trade or investment between the Parties has been applied for a period of 12 months. For the purposes of this paragraph, the measures in question are those which were not challenged or not found by an arbitration tribunal to be strictly unnecessary pursuant to point (d) or (h) of paragraph 3. This review may commence earlier than four years after the entry into force of this Agreement.\n6.   The review requested pursuant to paragraph 4 or 5 shall begin within three months of the request and be completed within six months.\n7.   A review on the basis of paragraph 4 or 5 may be repeated at subsequent intervals of no less than four years after the conclusion of the previous review. If a Party has requested a review under paragraph 4 or 5, it may not request a further review under either paragraph 4 or 5 for at least four years from the conclusion of the previous review or, if applicable, from the entry into force of any amending agreement.\n8.   The review shall address whether this Agreement delivers an appropriate balance of rights and obligations between the Parties, in particular with regard to the operation of this Heading, and whether, as a result, there is a need for any modification of the terms of this Agreement.\n9.   The Partnership Council may decide that no action is required as a result of the review. If a Party considers that following the review there is a need for an amendment of this Agreement, the Parties shall use their best endeavours to negotiate and conclude an agreement making the necessary amendments. Such negotiations shall be limited to matters identified in the review.\n10.   If an amending agreement referred to in paragraph 9 is not concluded within one year from the date the Parties started negotiations, either Party may give notice to terminate this Heading or any other Heading of this Agreement that was added to the review, or the Parties may decide to continue negotiations. If a Party terminates this Heading, Heading Three shall be terminated on the same date. The termination shall take effect three months after the date of such notice.\n11.   If this Heading is terminated pursuant to paragraph 10 of this Article, Heading Two shall be terminated on the same date, unless the Parties agree to integrate the relevant parts of Title XI of this Heading in Heading Two.\n12.   Title I of Part Six does not apply to paragraphs 4 to 9 of this Article.\nTITLE XII\nEXCEPTIONS\nArticle 412\nGeneral exceptions\n1.   Nothing in Chapter 1 and Chapter 5 of Title I, Chapter 2 of Title II, Title III, Title VIII and Chapter 4 of Title XI shall be construed as preventing a Party from adopting or maintaining measures compatible with Article XX of GATT 1994. To that end, Article XX of GATT 1994, including its Notes and Supplementary Provisions, is incorporated into and made part of this Agreement, mutatis mutandis.\n2.   Subject to the requirement that such measures are not applied in a manner which would constitute a means of arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination between countries where like conditions prevail, or a disguised restriction on investment liberalisation or trade in services, nothing in Title II, Title III, Title IV, Title VIII and Chapter 4 of Title XI shall be construed to prevent the adoption or enforcement by either Party of measures:\n(a)\nnecessary to protect public security or public morals or to maintain public order (67);\n(b)\nnecessary to protect human, animal or plant life or health;\n(c)\nnecessary to secure compliance with laws or regulations which are not inconsistent with the provisions of this Agreement including those relating to:\n(i)\nthe prevention of deceptive and fraudulent practices or to deal with the effects of a default on contracts;\n(ii)\nthe protection of the privacy of individuals in relation to the processing and dissemination of personal data and the protection of confidentiality of individual records and accounts; and\n(iii)\nsafety.\n3.

Before a Party takes any measures provided for in points (i) and (j) of Article XX of GATT 1994, that Party shall provide the other Party with all relevant information, with a view to seeking a solution acceptable to the Parties. If no agreement is reached within 30 days of providing the information, the Party may apply the relevant measures. Where exceptional and critical circumstances requiring immediate action make prior information or examination impossible, the Party intending to take the measures may apply forthwith precautionary measures necessary to deal with the situation. That Party shall inform the other Party immediately thereof.\nArticle 413\nTaxation\n1.   Nothing in Titles I to VII, Chapter 4 of Title VIII, Titles IX to XII of this Heading or Heading Six shall affect the rights and obligations of either the Union or its Member States and the United Kingdom, under any tax convention. In the event of any inconsistency between this Agreement and any such tax convention, the tax convention shall prevail to the extent of the inconsistency. With regard to a tax convention between the Union or its Member States and the United Kingdom, the relevant competent authorities under this Agreement and that tax convention shall jointly determine whether an inconsistency exists between this Agreement and the tax convention. (68)\n2.   Articles 130 and 138 shall not apply to an advantage accorded pursuant to a tax convention.\n3.   Subject to the requirement that tax measures are not applied in a manner which would constitute a means of arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination between countries where like conditions prevail, or a disguised restriction on trade and investment, nothing in Titles I to VII, Chapter 4 of Title VIII, Titles IX to XII of this Heading or Heading Six shall be construed to prevent the adoption, maintenance or enforcement by a Party of any measure that:\n(a)\naims at ensuring the equitable or effective (69) imposition or collection of direct taxes; or\n(b)\ndistinguishes between taxpayers, who are not in the same situation, in particular with regard to their place of residence or with regard to the place where their capital is invested.\n4.   For the purposes of this Article, the following definitions apply:\n(a)\n\"residence\" means residence for tax purposes;\n(b)\n\"tax convention\" means a convention for the avoidance of double taxation or any other international agreement or arrangement relating wholly or mainly to taxation; and\n(c)\n\"direct taxes\" comprise all taxes on income or capital, including taxes on gains from the alienation of property, taxes on estates, inheritances and gifts, taxes on wages or salaries paid by enterprises and taxes on capital appreciation.\nArticle 414\nWTO Waivers\nIf an obligation in Titles I to XII of this Heading or Heading Six of this Part is substantially equivalent to an obligation contained in the WTO Agreement, any measure taken in conformity with a waiver adopted pursuant to Article IX of the WTO Agreement is deemed to be in conformity with the substantially equivalent provision in this Agreement.\nArticle 415\nSecurity exceptions\nNothing in Titles I to XII of this Heading or Heading Six shall be construed:\n(a)\nto require a Party to furnish or allow access to any information the disclosure of which it considers contrary to its essential security interests; or\n(b)\nto prevent a Party from taking an action which it considers necessary for the protection of its essential security interests:\n(i)\nconnected to the production of or traffic in arms, ammunition and implements of war and to such production, traffic and transactions in other goods and materials, services and technology, and to economic activities, carried out directly or indirectly for the purpose of supplying a military establishment;\n(ii)\nrelating to fissionable and fusionable materials or the materials from which they are derived; or\n(iii)\nin time of war or other emergency in international relations; or\n(c)\nto prevent a Party from taking any action in pursuance of its obligations under the United Nations Charter for the maintenance of international peace and security.\nArticle 416\nConfidential information\n1.   With the exception of Article 384, nothing in Titles I to XII of this Heading or Heading Six of this Part shall be construed as requiring a Party to make available confidential information, the disclosure of which would impede law enforcement, or otherwise be contrary to the public interest, or which would prejudice the legitimate commercial interests of particular enterprises, public or private, except where an arbitration tribunal requires such confidential information in dispute settlement proceedings under Title I of Part Six, or where a panel of experts requires such confidential information in proceedings under Article 409 or 410. In such cases, the arbitration tribunal, or, as the case may be, the panel of experts shall ensure that confidentiality is fully protected in accordance with Annex 48.\n2.

The initiating Party shall submit a written request for consultations to the other Party (the \"responding Party\"). Consultations shall start within a period of 30 days from the receipt of the request, unless otherwise agreed by the Parties.\n4.

Baggage and cargo in direct transit across the territory of a Party shall be exempt from taxes, customs duties, fees and other similar charges.\n7.   Equipment and supplies referred to in paragraph 2 may be required to be kept under the supervision or control of the competent authorities.\n8.   The provisions of the respective conventions in force between the United Kingdom and Member States for the avoidance of double taxation on income and on capital remain unaffected by this Title.\n9.   The relief from customs duties, national excise duties and similar national fees shall not extend to charges based on the cost of services provided to an air carrier of a Party in the territory of the other Party.\nArticle 431\nUser charges\n1.   User charges that may be imposed by one Party on the air carriers of the other Party for the use of air navigation and air traffic control shall be cost-related and non-discriminatory. In any event, any such user charges shall be assessed on the air carriers of the other Party on terms not less favourable than the most favourable terms available to any other air carrier in like circumstances at the time the charges are applied.\n2.   Without prejudice to Article 429(5), each Party shall ensure that user charges other than those mentioned in paragraph 1 that may be imposed on the air carriers of the other Party are just, reasonable, not unjustly discriminatory, and equitably apportioned among categories of users. User charges imposed on the air carriers of the other Party may reflect, but not exceed, the full cost of providing appropriate airport, airport environmental and aviation security facilities and services at the airport or within the airport system. Such charges may include a reasonable return on assets after depreciation. Facilities and services for which user charges are imposed shall be provided on an efficient and economic basis. In any event, any such user charges shall be assessed on the air carrier of the other Party on terms no less favourable than the most favourable terms available to any other air carrier in like circumstances at the time the charges are applied.\n3.   In order to ensure the correct application of the principles set out in paragraphs 1 and 2, each Party shall ensure that consultations take place between the competent charging authorities or bodies in its territory and the air carriers using the services and facilities concerned and that the competent charging authorities or bodies and the air carriers exchange such information as may be necessary. Each Party shall ensure that the competent charging authorities provide users with reasonable notice of any proposal for changes in user charges to enable users to express their views before any changes are made.\nArticle 432\nTariffs\n1.   The Parties shall allow tariffs to be freely established by the air carriers of the Parties on the basis of fair competition in accordance with this Title.\n2.   The Parties shall not subject the tariffs of each other's air carriers to approval.\nArticle 433\nStatistics\n1.   The Parties shall cooperate within the framework of the Specialised Committee on Air Transport to facilitate the exchange of statistical information related to air transport under this Title.\n2.   Upon request, each Party shall provide the other Party with non-confidential and non-commercially sensitive available statistics related to air transport under this Title, as required by the respective laws and regulations of the Parties, on a non-discriminatory basis, and as may reasonably be required.\nArticle 434\nAviation safety\n1.   The Parties reaffirm the importance of close cooperation in the field of aviation safety.\n2.   Certificates of airworthiness, certificates of competency and licences issued or rendered valid by one Party and still in force shall be recognised as valid by the other Party and its competent authorities, for the purpose of operating air services under this Title, provided that such certificates or licences were issued or rendered valid pursuant to, and in conformity with, as a minimum, the relevant international standards established under the Convention.\n3.   Each Party may request consultations at any time concerning the safety standards maintained and administered by the other Party in areas relating to aeronautical facilities, flight crew, aircraft and the operation of aircraft. Such consultations shall take place within 30 days of the request.\n4.   If, following such consultations, one Party finds that the other Party does not effectively maintain and administer safety standards in the areas referred to in paragraph 2 that are at least equal to the minimum standards established at that time pursuant to the Convention, the first Party shall notify the other Party of those findings and the steps considered necessary to conform with those minimum standards, and the other Party shall take appropriate corrective action. Failure by the other Party to take appropriate action within 15 days or such other period as may be agreed shall be grounds for the requesting Party to refuse, revoke, suspend, impose conditions on or limit the operating authorisations or technical permissions, or to otherwise refuse, revoke, suspend, impose conditions on or limit the operations of the air carriers under the safety oversight of the other Party.\n5.   Any aircraft operated by, or, under a lease arrangement, on behalf of, an air carrier or air carriers of one Party may, while within the territory of the other Party, be made the subject of a ramp inspection, provided that this does not lead to unreasonable delay in the operation of the aircraft.\n6.   The ramp inspection or series of ramp inspections can give rise to:\n(a)\nserious concerns that an aircraft or the operation of an aircraft does not comply with the minimum standards established at that time pursuant to the Convention; or\n(b)\nserious concerns that there is a lack of effective maintenance and administration of safety standards established at that time pursuant to the Convention.\nIn the event that the Party that conducted the ramp inspection or inspections establishes serious concerns as referred to in point (a) or (b), it shall notify the competent authorities of the other Party that are responsible for the safety oversight of the air carrier operating the aircraft of such findings and inform them of the steps considered necessary to conform with those minimum standards. Failure to take appropriate corrective action within 15 days or such other period as may be agreed shall constitute grounds for the first Party to refuse, revoke, suspend, impose conditions on or limit the operating authorisations or technical permissions or to otherwise refuse, revoke, suspend, impose conditions on or limit the operations of the air carrier operating the aircraft.\n7.   In the event that access for the purpose of undertaking a ramp inspection of an aircraft operated by the air carrier or air carriers of one Party in accordance with paragraph 5 is denied, the other Party shall be free to infer that serious concerns as referred to in paragraph 6 arise and proceed in accordance with paragraph 6.\n8.   Each Party reserves the right to immediately revoke, suspend or limit the operating authorisations or technical permissions or to otherwise suspend or limit the operations of an air carrier or air carriers of the other Party, if the first Party concludes as a result of a ramp inspection, a series of ramp inspections, a denial of access for ramp inspection, consultation or otherwise, that immediate action is essential to the safety of an air carrier operation. The Party taking such measures shall promptly inform the other Party, providing reasons for its action.\n9.   Any action by one Party in accordance with paragraph 4, 6 or 8 shall be discontinued once the basis for the taking of that action ceases to exist.\n10.   Where measures have been taken by a Party pursuant to paragraph 4, 6 or 8, in the event of a dispute a Party may have recourse to arbitration in accordance with Article 739, without having prior recourse to consultations in accordance with Article 738. An arbitration tribunal shall treat the issue as a case of urgency for the purpose of Article 744. At the request of the complaining Party, the tribunal may, pending its final ruling, order the adoption of interim relief measures, including the modification or suspension of measures taken by either Party under this Article.\nArticle 435\nAviation security\n1.   The Parties shall provide upon request all necessary assistance to each other to address any threat to the security of civil aviation, including the prevention of acts of unlawful seizure of civil aircraft and other unlawful acts against the safety of such aircraft, of their passengers and crew, airports and air navigation facilities, and any other threat to the security of civil aviation.\n2.   The Parties shall, in their mutual relations, act in conformity with the aviation security standards established by ICAO. They shall require that operators of the aircraft in their registries and the operators of airports in their territory, act, at least, in conformity with such aviation security standards. Each Party shall, on request, provide the other Party notification of any difference between its laws, regulations and practices and the aviation security standards referred to in this paragraph. Each Party may at any time request consultations, to be held without delay, with the other Party to discuss those differences.\n3.   Each Party shall ensure that effective measures are taken within its territory to protect civil aviation against acts of unlawful interference, including, but not limited to, screening of passengers and their cabin baggage, screening of hold baggage, screening and security controls for persons other than passengers, including crew, and their items carried, screening and security controls for cargo, mail, in-flight and airport supplies, and access control to airside and security restricted areas. Each Party agrees that the security provisions of the other Party relating to the admission to, operating within, or departure from its territory of aircraft shall be observed.\n4.   The Parties shall endeavour to cooperate on aviation security matters to the highest extent, to exchange information on threat, vulnerability and risk, subject to the mutual agreement of appropriate arrangements for the secure transfer, use, storage and disposal of classified information, to discuss and share best practices, performance and detection standards of security equipment, compliance monitoring best practices and results, and in any other area that the Parties may identify. In particular, the Parties shall endeavour to develop and maintain cooperation arrangements between technical experts on the development and recognition of aviation security standards with the aim of facilitating such cooperation, reducing administrative duplication and fostering early notice and prior discussion of new security initiatives and requirements.\n5.   Each Party shall make available to the other Party on request the results of audits carried out by ICAO and the corrective actions taken by the audited state, subject to the mutual agreement of appropriate arrangements for the secure transfer, use, storage and disposal of such information.\n6.   The Parties agree to cooperate on security inspections undertaken by them in the territory of either Party through the establishment of mechanisms, including administrative arrangements, for the reciprocal exchange of information on results of such security inspections. The Parties agree to consider positively requests to participate, as observers, in security inspections undertaken by the other Party.\n7.   Subject to paragraph 9, and with full regard and mutual respect for the other Party's sovereignty, a Party may adopt security measures for entry into its territory. Where possible, that Party shall take into account the security measures already applied by the other Party and any views that the other Party may offer. Each Party recognises that nothing in this Article limits the right of a Party to refuse entry into its territory of any flight or flights that it deems to present a threat to its security.\n8.   A Party may take emergency measures to meet a specific security threat. Such measures shall be notified immediately to the other Party. Without prejudice to the need to take immediate action in order to protect aviation security, when considering security measures, a Party shall evaluate possible adverse effects on international air transport and, unless constrained by law, shall take such effects into account when it determines what measures are necessary and appropriate to address the security concerns.\n9.   With regard to air services bound for its territory, a Party may not require security measures to be implemented in the territory of the other Party. Where a Party considers that a specific threat urgently requires the implementation of temporary measures in addition to the measures already in place in the territory of the other Party, it shall, inform the other Party of the particulars of that threat to the extent consistent with the need to protect security information, and of the proposed measures. The other Party shall give positive consideration to such a proposal, and may decide to implement additional measures as it deems necessary. Such measures shall be proportionate and limited in time.\n10.   When an incident or threat of an incident of unlawful seizure of civil aircraft or other unlawful acts against the safety of aircraft, passengers, crew, airports or air navigation facilities occurs, the Parties shall assist each other by facilitating communications and other appropriate measures intended to rapidly and safely terminate such incident or threat.\n11.   Each Party shall take all measures it finds practicable to ensure that an aircraft subjected to an act of unlawful seizure or other acts of unlawful interference which is on the ground in its territory is detained on the ground unless its departure is necessitated by the overriding duty to protect human life. Where practicable, such measures shall be taken on the basis of consultations between the Parties.\n12.   When a Party has reasonable grounds to believe that the other Party does not comply with this Article, that Party may request immediate consultations with the other Party. Such consultations shall start within 30 days of the receipt of such a request. Failure to reach a satisfactory agreement within 15 days or such other period as may be agreed from the date of such request shall constitute grounds for the Party that requested the consultations to take action to refuse, revoke, suspend, impose conditions on or limit the operating authorisation and technical permissions of an air carrier or air carriers of the other Party to ensure compliance with this Article. When required by an emergency, or to prevent further non-compliance with this Article, a Party may take interim action prior to the expiry of the 15 day-period referred to in this paragraph.\n13.   Any action taken in accordance with paragraph 8 shall be discontinued when the Party in question considers that the action is no longer required or has been superseded by other measures to mitigate the threat. Any action taken in accordance with paragraph 12 shall be discontinued upon compliance by the other Party with this Article. In the case of action taken in accordance with paragraph 8 or 12, this may be discontinued as mutually agreed by the Parties.\n14.   Where measures or actions have been taken in accordance with paragraph 7, 8, 9 or 12 of this Article, a Party may have recourse to the dispute settlement provisions of Title I of Part Six. An arbitration tribunal shall treat the issue as a case of urgency for the purpose of Article 744.\nArticle 436\nAir traffic management\n1.   The Parties and their respective competent authorities and air navigation service providers shall cooperate with each other in such a way as to enhance the safe and efficient functioning of air traffic in the European region. The Parties shall seek interoperability between each other's service providers.\n2.   The Parties agree to cooperate on matters concerning the performance and charging of air navigation services and network functions, with a view to optimising overall flight efficiency, reducing costs, minimising environmental impact and enhancing the safety and capacity of air traffic flows between the existing air traffic management systems of the Parties.\n3.   The Parties agree to promote cooperation between their air navigation service providers in order to exchange flight data and coordinate traffic flows to optimise flight efficiency, with a view to achieving improved predictability, punctuality and service continuity for air traffic.\n4.   The Parties agree to cooperate on their air traffic management modernisation programmes, including research, development and deployment activities, and to encourage cross-participation in validation and demonstration activities with the goal of ensuring global interoperability.\nArticle 437\nAir carrier liability\nThe Parties reaffirm their obligations under the Convention for the Unification of Certain Rules for International Carriage by Air, done at Montreal on 28 May 1999 (the \"Montreal Convention\").\nArticle 438\nConsumer protection\n1.   The Parties share the objective of achieving a high level of consumer protection and shall cooperate to that effect.\n2.   The Parties shall ensure that effective and non-discriminatory measures are taken to protect the interests of consumers in air transport. Such measures shall include the appropriate access to information, assistance including for persons with disabilities and reduced mobility, reimbursement and, if applicable, compensation in case of denied boarding, cancellation or delays, and efficient complaint handling procedures.\n3.   The Parties shall consult each other on any matter related to consumer protection, including their planned measures in that regard.\nArticle 439\nRelationship to other agreements\n1.   Subject to paragraphs 4 and 5, earlier agreements and arrangements relating to the subject matter of this Title between the United Kingdom and the Member States, to the extent that they may not have been superseded by the law of the Union, shall be superseded by this Agreement.\n2.   The United Kingdom and a Member State may not grant each other any rights in connection with air transport to, from or within their respective territories other than those expressly laid down in this Title, save as provided for in Article 419(4) and (9).\n3.   If the Parties become party to a multilateral agreement, or endorse a decision adopted by ICAO or another international organisation that addresses matters covered by this Title, they shall consult in the Specialised Committee on Air Transport to determine whether this Title should be revised to take into account such developments.\n4.   Nothing in this Title shall affect the validity and application of existing and future air transport agreements between the Member States and the United Kingdom as regards territories under their respective sovereignty which are not covered by Article 774.\n5.   Nothing in this Title shall affect any rights available to the United Kingdom and Member States under the Multilateral Agreement on Commercial Rights of Non-Scheduled Air Services in Europe, signed at Paris on 30 April 1956, to the extent that such rights go beyond those laid down in this Title.\nArticle 440\nSuspension and Termination\n1.   A suspension of this Title, in whole or in part, pursuant to Article 749, may be implemented no earlier than the first day of the International Air Transport Association (IATA) traffic season following the season during which the suspension has been notified.\n2.   Upon termination of this Agreement pursuant to Article 779 or upon termination of this Title pursuant to Article 441 or Article 521 or Article 509, the provisions governing the matters falling within the scope of this Title shall continue to apply beyond the date of cessation referred to in Article 779 or Article 441 or Article 521 or Article 509, until the end of the IATA traffic season in progress on that date.\n3.   The Party suspending this Title, in whole or in part, or terminating this Agreement or this Title shall inform ICAO thereof.\nArticle 441\nTermination of this Title\nWithout prejudice to Article 779, Article 521, and Article 509 each Party may at any moment terminate this Title, by written notification through diplomatic channels.

Authorisations shall be issued in agreement with the competent authorities in the Parties in whose territory passengers are picked up or set down. The authorising authority shall forward to such competent authorities, as well as to the competent authorities whose territories are crossed without passengers being picked up or set down, a copy of the application, together with copies of any other relevant documentation, and its assessment.\nIn respect of the Union, the competent authorities referred to in the first subparagraph shall be those of the Member States in whose territories passengers are picked up or set down and whose territories are crossed without passengers being picked up or set down.\n2.   The competent authorities whose agreement has been requested shall notify the authorising authority of their decision regarding the application within four months. This time limit shall be calculated from the date of receipt of the request for agreement which is shown in the acknowledgement of receipt. If the decision received from the competent authorities whose agreement has been requested is negative, it shall contain a proper statement of reasons. If the authorising authority does not receive a reply within four months, the competent authorities consulted shall be deemed to have given their agreement and the authorising authority may grant the authorisation.\nThe competent authorities whose territory is crossed without passengers being picked up or set down may notify the authorising authority of their comments within four months.\n3.   In respect of services that had been authorised under Regulation (EC) No 1073/2009 of the European Parliament and the Council (70) before the end of the transition period and in respect of which the authorisation lapses at the end of the transition period, the following shall apply:\n(a)\nwhere, subject to the changes necessary to comply with Article 475, the operating conditions are the same as those having been set in the authorisation granted under Regulation (EC) No 1073/2009, the relevant authorising authority under this Title may, on application or otherwise, issue the road transport operator with a corresponding authorisation granted under this Title. Where such an authorisation is issued, the agreement of the competent authorities in whose territories passengers are picked up or set down, as referred to in paragraph 2, shall be deemed to be provided. Those competent authorities and the competent authorities whose territory is crossed without passengers being picked up or set down may, at any time, notify the authorising authority of any comments they may have;\n(b)\nwhere point (a) is applied, the validity period of the corresponding authorisation granted under this Title shall not extend beyond the last day of the validity period specified in the authorisation previously granted under Regulation (EC) No 1073/2009.\n4.   The authorising authority shall take a decision on the application no later than six months from the date of submission of the application by the road passenger transport operator.\n5.   Authorisation shall be granted unless:\n(a)\nthe applicant is unable to provide the service which is the subject of the application with equipment directly available to the applicant;\n(b)\nthe applicant has not complied with national or international legislation on road transport, and in particular the conditions and requirements relating to authorisations for international road passenger services, or has committed serious infringements of a Party's road transport legislation in particular with regard to the rules applicable to vehicles and driving and rest periods for drivers;\n(c)\nin the case of an application for renewal of authorisation, the conditions of authorisation have not been complied with;\n(d)\na Party decides on the basis of a detailed analysis that the service concerned would seriously affect the viability of a comparable service covered by one or more public service contracts conforming to the Party's law on the direct sections concerned. In such a case, the Party shall set up criteria, on a non-discriminatory basis, for determining whether the service applied for would seriously affect the viability of the abovementioned comparable service and shall communicate them to the other Party referred to in paragraph 1; or\n(e)\na Party decides on the basis of a detailed analysis that the principal purpose of the service is not to carry passengers between stops located in the territories of the Parties.\nIn the event that an existing service seriously affects the viability of a comparable service covered by one or more public service contracts which conform to a Party's law on the direct sections concerned, due to exceptional reasons which could not have been foreseen at the time of granting the authorisation, a Party may, with the agreement of the other Party, suspend or withdraw the authorisation to run the international coach and bus service after having given six months' notice to the road passenger transport operator.\nThe fact that a road passenger transport operator of a Party offers lower prices than those offered by other road passenger transport operators or the fact that the link in question is already operated by other road passenger transport operators shall not in itself constitute justification for rejecting the application.\n6.   Having completed the procedure laid down in paragraphs 1 to 5, the authorising authority shall grant the authorisation or formally refuse the application.\nDecisions rejecting an application shall state the reasons on which they are based. The Parties shall ensure that transport undertakings are given the opportunity to make representations in the event of their application being rejected.\nThe authorising authority shall inform the competent authorities of the other Party of its decision and shall send them a copy of any authorisation.\nArticle 480\nRenewal and alteration of authorisation\n1.

In the event of a minor alteration to the operating conditions, in particular the adjustment of intervals, fares and timetables, the authorising authority needs only supply the competent authorities of the other Party with information relating to the alteration. Changing the timetables or intervals in a manner that affects the timing of controls at the borders between the Parties or at third country borders shall not be considered a minor alteration.\nArticle 481\nLapse of an authorisation\n1.   Without prejudice to Article 479(3), an authorisation for a service referred to in Article 475 shall lapse at the end of its period of validity or three months after the authorising authority has received notice from its holder of his or her intention to withdraw the service. Such notice shall contain a proper statement of reasons.\n2.   Where demand for a service has ceased to exist, the period of notice provided for in paragraph 1 shall be one month.\n3.

By 31 January of each year, the Parties shall cooperate to set the schedule for consultations with the aim of agreeing TACs for the stocks listed in Annex 35 for the following year or years. That schedule shall take into account other annual consultations among coastal States that affect either or both of the Parties.\n2.   The Parties shall hold consultations annually to agree, by 10 December of each year, the TACs for the following year for the stocks listed in Annex 35. This shall include an early exchange of views on priorities as soon as advice on the level of the TACs is received. The Parties shall agree those TACs:\n(a)\non the basis of the best available scientific advice, as well as other relevant factors, including socio-economic aspects; and\n(b)\nin compliance with any applicable multi-year strategies for conservation and management agreed by the Parties.\n3.   The Parties' shares of the TACs for the stocks listed in Annex 35 shall be allocated between the Parties in accordance with the quota shares set out in that Annex.\n4.   Annual consultations may also cover, inter alia:\n(a)\ntransfers of parts of one Party's shares of TACs to the other Party;\n(b)\na list of stocks for which fishing is prohibited;\n(c)\nthe determination of the TAC for any stock which is not listed in Annex 35 or Annex 36 and the Parties' respective shares of those stocks;\n(d)\nmeasures for fisheries management, including, where appropriate, fishing effort limits;\n(e)\nstocks of mutual interest to the Parties other than those listed in the Annexes to this Heading.\n5.   The Parties may hold consultations with the aim of agreeing amended TACs if either Party so requests.\n6.   A written record documenting the arrangements made between the Parties as a result of consultations under this Article shall be produced and signed by the heads of delegation of the Parties.\n7.   Each Party shall give sufficient notice to the other Party before setting or amending TACs for the stocks listed in Annex 37.\n8.   The Parties shall set up a mechanism for voluntary in-year transfers of fishing opportunities between the Parties, to take place each year. The Specialised Committee on Fisheries shall decide on the details of this mechanism. The Parties shall consider making transfers of fishing opportunities for stocks which are, or are projected to be, underfished available at market value through that mechanism.\nArticle 499\nProvisional TACs\n1.   If the Parties have not agreed a TAC for a stock listed in Annex 35 or tables A or B of Annex 36 by 10 December, they shall immediately resume consultations with the continued aim of agreeing the TAC. The Parties shall engage frequently with a view to exploring all possible options for reaching agreement in the shortest possible time.\n2.   If a stock listed in Annex 35 or in tables A and B of Annex 36 remains without an agreed TAC on 20 December, each Party shall set a provisional TAC corresponding to the level advised by ICES, applying from 1 January.\n3.   By way of derogation from paragraph 2, the TACs for special stocks shall be set in accordance with guidelines adopted under paragraph 5.\n4.   For the purposes of this Article, \"special stocks\" means:\n(a)\nstocks where the ICES advice is for a zero TAC;\n(b)\nstocks caught in a mixed fishery, if that stock or another stock in the same fishery is vulnerable; or\n(c)\nother stocks which the Parties consider require special treatment.\n5.   The Specialised Committee on Fisheries shall adopt guidelines by 1 July 2021 for the setting of provisional TACs for special stocks.\n6.   Each year when advice is received from ICES on TACs, the Parties shall discuss, as a priority, the special stocks and the application of any guidelines set under paragraph 5 to the setting of provisional TACs by each Party.\n7.   Each Party shall set its share for each of the provisional TACs, which shall not exceed its share as set out in the corresponding Annex.\n8.   The provisional TACs and shares referred to in paragraphs 2, 3 and 7 shall apply until agreement is reached under paragraph 1.\n9.   Each Party shall, immediately, notify the other Party of its provisional TACs under paragraphs 2 and 3 and its provisional share of each of those TACs under paragraph 7.\nArticle 500\nAccess to waters\n1.   Provided that TACs have been agreed, each Party shall grant vessels of the other Party access to fish in its waters in the relevant ICES sub-areas that year. Access shall be granted at a level and on conditions determined in those annual consultations.\n2.   The Parties may agree, in annual consultations, further specific access conditions in relation to:\n(a)\nthe fishing opportunities agreed;\n(b)\nany multi-year strategies for non-quota stocks developed under point (c) of Article 508(1); and\n(c)\nany technical and conservation measures agreed by the Parties, without prejudice to Article 496.\n3.   The Parties shall conduct the annual consultations, including on the level and conditions of access referred to in paragraph 1, in good faith and with the objective of ensuring a mutually satisfactory balance between the interests of both Parties.\n4.   In particular, the outcome of the annual consultations should normally result in each Party granting:\n(a)\naccess to fish the stocks listed in Annex 35 and tables A, B and F of Annex 36 in each other's EEZ (or if access is granted under point (c), in EEZs and in the divisions mentioned in that point) at a level that is reasonably commensurate with the Parties' respective shares of the TACs;\n(b)\naccess to fish non-quota stocks in each other's EEZ (or if access is granted under point (c), in EEZs and in the divisions mentioned in that point), at a level that at least equates to the average tonnage fished by that Party in the waters of the other Party during the period 2012-2016; and\n(c)\naccess to the waters of the Parties between six and twelve nautical miles from the baselines in ICES divisions 4c and 7d-g for qualifying vessels to the extent that Union fishing vessels and United Kingdom fishing vessels had access to those waters on 31 December 2020.\nFor the purposes of point (c), \"qualifying vessel\" means a vessel of a Party which fished in the zone mentioned in the previous sentence in four of the years between 2012 and 2016, or its direct replacement.\nAnnual consultations referred to in point (c) may include appropriate financial commitments and quota transfers between the Parties.\n5.   During the application of a provisional TAC, and pending an agreed TAC, the Parties shall grant provisional access to fish in the relevant ICES sub-areas as follows:\n(a)\nfor stocks listed in Annex 35 and non-quota stocks, from 1 January until 31 March at the levels provided for in points (a) and (b) of paragraph 4;\n(b)\nfor stocks listed in Annex 36 from 1 January until 14 February at the levels provided for in point (a) of paragraph 4; and\n(c)\nin relation to access to fish in the six to twelve nautical miles zone, access in accordance with point (c) of paragraph 4 from 1 January to 31 January at a level equivalent to the average monthly tonnage fished in that zone in the previous three months.\nSuch access, for each of the relevant stocks in points (a) and (b), shall be in proportion to the average percentage of a Party's share of the annual TAC which that Party's vessels fished in the other Party's waters in the relevant ICES sub-areas during the same period of the previous three calendar years. The same shall apply, mutatis mutandis, to access to fish non-quota stocks.\nBy 15 January in relation to the situation in point (c) of this paragraph, by 31 January in respect of the stocks listed in Annex 36, and by 15 March in respect of all other stocks, each Party shall notify the other Party of the change in the level and conditions of access to waters that will apply as of 1 February in relation to the situation in point (c) of this paragraph, as of 15 February in respect of the stocks listed in Annex 36, and as of 1 April in respect of all other stocks for the relevant ICES sub-areas.\n6.   Without prejudice to Article 499(1) and (8), after the period of one month in relation to the situation in point (c) of paragraph 5 of this Article, one and a half months in respect of the stocks listed in Annex 36 and three months in respect of all other stocks, the Parties shall seek to agree further provisional access arrangements at the appropriate geographical level with the aim of minimising disruption to fishing activities.\n7.   In granting access under paragraph 1 of this Article, a Party may take into account compliance of individual or groups of vessels with the applicable rules in its waters during the preceding year, and measures taken by the other Party pursuant to Article 497(2) during the preceding year.\n8.   This Article shall apply subject to Annex 38.\nArticle 501\nCompensatory measures in case of withdrawal or reduction of access\n1.   Following a notification by a Party (\"host Party\") under Article 500(5), the other Party (\"fishing Party\") may take compensatory measures commensurate to the economic and societal impact of the change in the level and conditions of access to waters. Such impact shall be measured on the basis of reliable evidence and not merely on conjecture and remote possibility. Giving priority to those compensatory measures which will least disturb the functioning of this Agreement, the fishing Party may suspend, in whole or in part, access to its waters and the preferential tariff treatment granted to fishery products under Article 21.\n2.   A compensatory measure referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article may take effect at the earliest seven days after the fishing Party has given notice to the host Party of the intended suspension under paragraph 1 of this Article and, in any case, not earlier than 1 February in relation to the situation in point (c) of Article 500(5), 15 February in respect of Annex 36 and 1 April in respect of other stocks. The Parties shall consult within the Specialised Committee with a view to reaching a mutually agreeable solution. That notification shall identify:\n(a)\nthe date upon which the fishing Party intends to suspend; and\n(b)\nthe obligations to be suspended and the level of the intended suspension.\n3.   After the notification of the compensatory measures in accordance with paragraph 2 of this Article, the host Party may request the establishment of an arbitration tribunal pursuant to Article 739, without having recourse to consultations in accordance with Article 738. The arbitration tribunal may only review the conformity of the compensatory measures with paragraph 1 of this Article. The arbitration tribunal shall treat the issue as a case of urgency for the purpose of Article 744.\n4.   When the conditions for taking compensatory measures referred to in paragraph 1 are no longer met, such measures shall be withdrawn immediately.\n5.   Following a finding against the fishing Party in the procedure referred to in paragraph 3 of this Article, the host Party may request the arbitration tribunal, within 30 days from its ruling, to determine a level of suspension of obligations under this Agreement not exceeding the level equivalent to the nullification or impairment caused by the application of the compensatory measures, if it finds that the inconsistency of the compensatory measures with paragraph 1 of this Article is significant. The request shall propose a level of suspension in accordance with the principles set out in paragraph 1 of this Article and any relevant principles set out in Article 761. The host Party may apply the level of suspension of obligations under this Agreement in accordance with the level of suspension determined by the arbitration tribunal, no sooner than 15 days following such ruling.\n6.   A Party shall not invoke the WTO Agreement or any other international agreement to preclude the other Party from suspending obligations under this Article.\nArticle 502\nSpecific access arrangements relating to the Bailiwick of Guernsey, the Bailiwick of Jersey and the Isle of Man\n1.   By way of derogation from Article 500(1) and (3) to (7), Article 501 and Annex 38, each Party shall grant vessels of the other Party access to fish in its waters reflecting the actual extent and nature of fishing activity that it can be demonstrated was carried out during the period beginning on 1 February 2017 and ending on 31 January 2020 by qualifying vessels of the other Party in the waters and under any treaty arrangements that existed on 31 January 2020.\n2.   For the purposes of this Article and, in so far as the other Articles in this Heading apply in relation to the arrangements for access established under this Article:\n(a)\n\"qualifying vessel\" means, in respect of fishing activity carried out in waters adjacent to the Bailiwick of Guernsey, the Bailiwick of Jersey, the Isle of Man or a Member State, any vessel which fished in the territorial sea adjacent to that territory or that Member State on more than 10 days in any of the three 12 month periods ending on 31 January, or between 1 February 2017 and 31 January 2020;\n(b)\n\"vessel\" (of a Party)\" means, in respect of the United Kingdom, a fishing vessel flying the flag of the United Kingdom and registered in the Bailiwick of Guernsey, the Bailiwick of Jersey or the Isle of Man, and licensed by a United Kingdom fisheries administration;\n(c)\n\"waters\" (of a Party) means:\n(i)\nin respect of the Union, the territorial sea adjacent to a Member State; and\n(ii)\nin respect of the United Kingdom, the territorial sea adjacent to each of the Bailiwick of Guernsey, the Bailiwick of Jersey and the Isle of Man.\n3.   At the request of either Party, the Partnership Council shall decide, within 90 days of the entry into force of this Agreement, that this Article, Article 503 and any other provisions of this Heading in so far as they relate to the arrangements provided for in those Articles as well as Article 520(3) to (8) shall cease to apply in respect of one or more of the Bailiwick of Guernsey, the Bailiwick of Jersey and the Isle of Man, following 30 days from this decision.\n4.   The Partnership Council may decide to amend this Article, Article 503 and any other provisions of this Heading in so far as they relate to the arrangements provided for in those Articles.\nArticle 503\nNotification periods relating to the importation and direct landing of fishery products\n1.   The Union shall apply the following notification periods to fishery products caught by vessels flying the flag of the United Kingdom and registered in the Bailiwick of Guernsey or the Bailiwick of Jersey in the territorial sea adjacent to those territories or in the territorial sea adjacent to a Member State:\n(a)\nprior notification of between three and five hours before landing fresh fishery products into the Union's territory;\n(b)\nprior notification of between one and three hours of the validated catch certificate for the direct movement of consignments of fishery products by sea before the estimated time of arrival at the place of entry into the Union's territory.\n2.   For the purposes of this Article only, \"fishery products\" means all species of marine fish, molluscs and crustaceans.\nArticle 504\nAlignment of management areas\n1.   By 1 July 2021, the Parties shall request advice from ICES on the alignment of the management areas and the assessment units used by ICES for the stocks marked with an asterisk in Annex 35.\n2.   Within six months of receipt of the advice referred to in paragraph 1, the Parties shall jointly review that advice and shall jointly consider adjustments to the management areas of the stocks concerned, with a view to agreeing consequential changes to the list of stocks and shares set out in Annex 35.\nArticle 505\nShares of TACs for certain other stocks\n1.   The Parties' respective shares of the TACs for certain other stocks are set out in Annex 36.\n2.   Each Party shall notify the relevant States and international organisations of its shares in accordance with the sharing arrangement set out in tables A to D of Annex 36.\n3.   Any subsequent changes to those shares in tables C and D of Annex 36 are a matter for the relevant multilateral fora.\n4.   Without prejudice to the powers of the Partnership Council in Article 508(3), any subsequent changes to the shares in tables A and B of Annex 36 after 30 June 2026 are a matter for the relevant multilateral fora.\n5.   Both Parties shall approach the management of those stocks in tables A to D of Annex 36 in accordance with the objectives and principles set out in Article 494.\nCHAPTER 4\nARRANGEMENTS ON GOVERNANCE\nArticle 506\nRemedial measures and dispute resolution\n1.   In relation to an alleged failure by a Party (the \"respondent Party\") to comply with this Heading (other than in relation to alleged failures dealt with under paragraph 2), the other Party (the \"complaining Party\") may, after giving notice to the respondent Party:\n(a)\nsuspend, in whole or in part, access to its waters and the preferential tariff treatment granted to fishery products under Article 21; and\n(b)\nif it considers that the suspension referred to in point (a) of this paragraph is not commensurate to the economic and societal impact of the alleged failure, it may suspend, in whole or in part, the preferential tariff treatment of other goods under Article 21; and\n(c)\nif it considers that the suspension referred to in points (a) and (b) of this paragraph is not commensurate to the economic and societal impact of the alleged failure, it may suspend, in whole or in part, obligations under Heading One of this Part with the exception of Title XI. If Heading One of this Part is suspended in whole, Heading Three of this part is also suspended.\n2.   In relation to an alleged failure by a Party (the \"respondent Party\") to comply with Article 502, 503 or any other provision of this Heading in so far as it relates to the arrangements provided for in those Articles, the other Party (the \"complaining Party\"), after giving notice to the respondent Party:\n(a)\nmay suspend, in whole or in part, access to its waters within the meaning of Article 502;\n(b)\nif it considers that the suspension referred to in point (a) of this paragraph is not commensurate to the economic and societal impact of the alleged failure, may suspend, in whole or in part, the preferential tariff treatment granted to fishery products under Article 21;\n(c)\nif it considers that the suspension referred to in points (a) and (b) of this paragraph is not commensurate to the economic and societal impact of the alleged failure, may suspend, in whole or in part, the preferential tariff treatment of other goods under Article 21.\nBy way of derogation from paragraph 1 of this Article, remedial measures affecting the arrangements established under Article 502, Article 503 or any other provision of this Heading in so far as it relates to the arrangements provided for in those Articles may not be taken as a result of an alleged failure by a Party to comply with provisions of this Heading unconnected to those arrangements.\n3.   Measures referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 shall be proportionate to the alleged failure by the respondent Party and the economic and societal impact thereof.\n4.   A measure referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 may take effect at the earliest seven days after the complaining Party has given the respondent Party notice of the proposed suspension. The Parties shall consult within the Specialised Committee on Fisheries with a view to reaching a mutually agreeable solution. That notification shall identify:\n(a)\nthe way in which the complaining Party considers that the respondent Party has failed to comply;\n(b)\nthe date upon which the complaining Party intends to suspend; and\n(c)\nthe level of intended suspension.\n5.   The complaining Party must, within 14 days of the notification referred to in paragraph 4 of this Article, challenge the alleged failure by the respondent Party to comply with this Heading, as referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Article, by requesting the establishment of an arbitration tribunal under Article 739. Recourse to arbitration under this Article shall be made without having prior recourse to consultations under Article 738. An arbitration tribunal shall treat the issue as a case of urgency for the purpose of Article 744.\n6.   The suspension shall cease to apply when:\n(a)\nthe complaining Party is satisfied that the respondent Party is complying with its relevant obligations under this Heading; or\n(b)\nthe arbitration tribunal has decided that the respondent Party has not failed to comply with its relevant obligations under this Heading.\n7.   Following a finding against the complaining Party in the procedure referred to in paragraph 5 of this Article, the respondent Party may request the arbitration tribunal, within 30 days from its ruling, to determine a level of suspension of obligations under this Agreement not exceeding the level equivalent to the nullification or impairment caused by the application of the remedial measures, if it finds that the inconsistency of the remedial measures with paragraph 1 or 2 of this Article is significant. The request shall propose a level of suspension in accordance with paragraph 1 or 2 of this Article and any relevant principles set out in Article 761. The respondent Party may apply the level of suspension of obligations under this Agreement in accordance with the level of suspension determined by the arbitration tribunal, no sooner than 15 days following such ruling.\n8.

Paragraph 11 applies due to the special circumstances that prevent the United Kingdom from making the technical adjustments necessary to transform the PNR processing systems which the United Kingdom operated whilst Union law applied to it into systems which would enable PNR data to be deleted in accordance with paragraph 4.\n11.   The United Kingdom may derogate from paragraph 4 on a temporary basis for an interim period, the duration of which is provided for in paragraph 13, pending the implementation by the United Kingdom of technical adjustments as soon as possible. During the interim period, the United Kingdom competent authority shall prevent the use of the PNR data that is to be deleted in accordance with paragraph 4 by applying the following additional safeguards to that PNR data:\n(a)\nthe PNR data shall be accessible only to a limited number of authorised officials and only where necessary to determine whether the PNR data should be deleted in accordance with paragraph 4;\n(b)\nthe request to use the PNR data shall be refused in cases where the data is to be deleted in accordance with paragraph 4, and no further access shall be granted to that data where the documentation referred to in point (d) of this paragraph indicates that an earlier request for use has been refused;\n(c)\ndeletion of the PNR data shall be ensured as soon as possible using best efforts, taking into account the special circumstances referred to in paragraph 10; and\n(d)\nthe following shall be documented in accordance with Article 554, and such documentation shall be made available to the independent administrative body referred to in paragraph 7 of this Article:\n(i)\nany requests to use the PNR data;\n(ii)\nthe date and time of the access to the PNR data for the purpose of assessing whether deletion of the PNR data was required;\n(iii)\nthat the request to use the PNR data was refused on the basis that the PNR data should have been deleted under paragraph 4, including the date and time of the refusal; and\n(iv)\nthe date and time of the deletion of the PNR data in accordance with point (c) of this paragraph.\n12.   The United Kingdom shall provide to the Specialised Committee on Law Enforcement and Judicial Cooperation, nine months after the entry into force of this Agreement and again a year later if the interim period is extended for a further year:\n(a)\na report from the independent administrative body referred to in paragraph 7 of this Article, which shall include the opinion of the United Kingdom supervisory authority referred to in Article 525(3) as to whether the safeguards provided for in paragraph 11 of this Article have been effectively applied; and\n(b)\nthe assessment of the United Kingdom of whether the special circumstances referred to in paragraph 10 of this Article persist, together with a description of the efforts made to transform the PNR processing systems of the United Kingdom into systems which would enable PNR data to be deleted in accordance with paragraph 4 of this Article.\n13.   The Specialised Committee on Law Enforcement and Judicial Cooperation shall meet within one year of the entry into force of this Agreement to consider the report and assessment provided under paragraph 12. Where the special circumstances referred to in paragraph 10 persist, the Partnership Council shall extend the interim period referred to in paragraph 11 for one year. The Partnership Council shall extend the interim period for one further final year, under the same conditions and following the same procedure as for the first extension where, in addition, substantial progress has been made, although it has not yet been possible to transform the United Kingdom PNR processing systems into systems which would enable PNR data to be deleted in accordance with paragraph 4.\n14.   If the United Kingdom considers that a refusal by the Partnership Council to grant either of those extensions was not justified, it may suspend this Title with one month's notice.\n15.   On the third anniversary of the date of entry into force of this Agreement, paragraphs 10 to 14 shall cease to apply.\nArticle 553\nConditions for the use of PNR data\n1.

Where the receiving competent authority, on the basis of information already in its possession, comes to the conclusion that the assessment of information or of its source supplied by the transferring competent authority in accordance with paragraphs 1 and 2 needs correction, it shall inform that competent authority and shall attempt to agree on an amendment to the assessment. The receiving competent authority shall not change the assessment of information received or of its source without such agreement.\n4.   If a competent authority receives information without an assessment, it shall attempt as far as possible and where possible in agreement with the transferring competent authority to assess the reliability of the source or the accuracy of the information on the basis of information already in its possession.\n5.

If damages are awarded either against Europol or against the competent authorities of the United Kingdom because of the use by either of them of information which was erroneously communicated by the other, or communicated as a result of a failure on the part of the other to comply with their obligations, the amount paid as compensation under paragraph 1 either by Europol or by the competent authorities of the United Kingdom shall be repaid by the other, unless the information was used in breach of this Title.\n3.

or\n(ii)\nhave been committed outside the territory of the issuing State, and the law of the executing State does not allow prosecution for the same offences if committed outside its territory;\n(h)\nif there are reasons to believe on the basis of objective elements that the arrest warrant has been issued for the purpose of prosecuting or punishing a person on the grounds of the person's sex, race, religion, ethnic origin, nationality, language, political opinions or sexual orientation, or that that person's position may be prejudiced for any of those reasons;\n(i)\nif the arrest warrant has been issued for the purpose of executing a custodial sentence or a detention order and the requested person did not appear in person at the trial resulting in the decision, unless the arrest warrant states that the person, in accordance with further procedural requirements defined in the domestic law of the issuing State:\n(i)\nin due time:\n(A)\neither was summoned in person and thereby informed of the scheduled date and place of the trial which resulted in the decision, or by other means actually received official information of the scheduled date and place of that trial in such a manner that it was unequivocally established that the person was aware of the date and place of the scheduled trial ;\nand\n(B)\nwas informed that a decision may be handed down if that person did not appear for the trial;\nor\n(ii)\nbeing aware of the date and place of the scheduled trial, had given a mandate to a lawyer, who was either appointed by the person concerned or by the State, to defend him or her at the trial, and was indeed defended by that lawyer at the trial;\nor\n(iii)\nafter being served with the decision and being expressly informed about the right to a retrial or appeal in which the person has the right to participate and which allows the merits of the case, including fresh evidence, to be re-examined, and which may lead to the original decision being reversed:\n(A)\nexpressly stated that the person did not contest the decision;\nor\n(B)\ndid not request a retrial or appeal within the applicable time frame;\nor\n(iv)\nwas not personally served with the decision but:\n(A)\nwill be personally served with it without delay after the surrender and will be expressly informed of the right to a retrial or appeal in which the person has the right to participate and which allows the merits of the case, including fresh evidence, to be re-examined, and which may lead to the original decision being reversed;\nand\n(B)\nwill be informed of the time frame within which the person has to request such a retrial or appeal, as mentioned in the relevant arrest warrant.\n2.   Where the arrest warrant is issued for the purpose of executing a custodial sentence or detention order under the conditions in point (i) (iv) of paragraph 1 and the person concerned has not previously received any official information about the existence of the criminal proceedings against him or her, that person may, when being informed about the content of the arrest warrant, request to receive a copy of the judgment before being surrendered. Immediately after having been informed about the request, the issuing authority shall provide the copy of the judgment via the executing authority to the person concerned. The request of the person concerned shall neither delay the surrender procedure nor delay the decision to execute the arrest warrant. The provision of the judgment to the person concerned shall be for information purposes only; it shall not be regarded as a formal service of the judgment nor actuate any time limits applicable for requesting a retrial or appeal.\n3.   Where a person is surrendered under the conditions in point (i) (iv) of paragraph 1 and that person has requested a retrial or appeal, until those proceedings are finalised the detention of that person awaiting such retrial or appeal shall be reviewed in accordance with the domestic law of the issuing State, either on a regular basis or upon request of the person concerned. Such a review shall in particular include the possibility of suspension or interruption of the detention. The retrial or appeal shall begin within due time after the surrender.\nArticle 602\nPolitical offence exception\n1.   The execution of an arrest warrant may not be refused on the grounds that the offence may be regarded by the executing State as a political offence, as an offence connected with a political offence or as an offence inspired by political motives.\n2.   However, the United Kingdom and the Union, acting on behalf of any of its Member States, may each notify the Specialised Committee on Law Enforcement and Judicial Cooperation that paragraph 1 will be applied only in relation to:\n(a)\nthe offences referred to in Articles 1 and 2 of the European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism;\n(b)\noffences of conspiracy or association to commit one or more of the offences referred to in Articles 1 and 2 of the European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism, if those offences of conspiracy or association correspond to the description of behaviour referred to in Article 599(3) of this Agreement; and\n(c)\nterrorism as defined in Annex 45 to this Agreement.\n3.   Where an arrest warrant has been issued by a State having made a notification as referred to in paragraph 2 or by a State on behalf of which such a notification has been made, the State executing the arrest warrant may apply reciprocity.\nArticle 603\nNationality exception\n1.   The execution of an arrest warrant may not be refused on the grounds that the requested person is a national of the executing State.\n2.   The United Kingdom, and the Union, acting on behalf of any of its Member States, may each notify the Specialised Committee on Law Enforcement and Judicial Cooperation that that State's own nationals will not be surrendered or that the surrender of their own nationals will be authorised only under certain specified conditions. The notification shall be based on reasons related to the fundamental principles or practice of the domestic legal order of the United Kingdom or the State on behalf of which a notification was made. In such a case, the Union, on behalf of any of its Member States or the United Kingdom, as the case may be, may notify the Specialised Committee on Law Enforcement and Judicial Cooperation within a reasonable time after the receipt of the other Party's notification that the executing judicial authorities of the Member State or the United Kingdom, as the case may be, may refuse to surrender its nationals to that State or that surrender shall be authorised only under certain specified conditions.\n3.   In circumstances where a State has refused to execute an arrest warrant on the basis that, in the case of the United Kingdom, it has made a notification or, in the case of a Member State, the Union has made a notification on its behalf, as referred to in paragraph 2, that State shall consider instituting proceedings against its own national which are commensurate with the subject matter of the arrest warrant, having taken into account the views of the issuing State. In circumstances where a judicial authority decides not to institute such proceedings, the victim of the offence on which the arrest warrant is based shall be able to receive information on the decision in accordance with the applicable domestic law.\n4.   Where a State's competent authorities institute proceedings against its own national in accordance with paragraph 3, that State shall ensure that its competent authorities are able to take appropriate measures to assist the victims and witnesses in circumstances where they are residents of another State, particularly with regard to the way in which the proceedings are conducted.\nArticle 604\nGuarantees to be given by the issuing State in particular cases\nThe execution of the arrest warrant by the executing judicial authority may be subject to the following guarantees:\n(a)\nif the offence on which the arrest warrant is based is punishable by a custodial life sentence or a lifetime detention order in the issuing State, the executing State may make the execution of the arrest warrant subject to the condition that the issuing State gives a guarantee deemed sufficient by the executing State that the issuing State will review the penalty or measure imposed, on request or at the latest after 20 years, or will encourage the application of measures of clemency for which the person is entitled to apply under the law or practice of the issuing State, aiming at the non-execution of such penalty or measure;\n(b)\nif a person who is the subject of an arrest warrant for the purposes of prosecution is a national or resident of the executing State, the surrender of that person may be subject to the condition that the person, after being heard, is returned to the executing State in order to serve there the custodial sentence or detention order passed against him or her in the issuing State; if the consent of the requested person to the transfer of the sentence or detention order to the executing State is required, the guarantee that the person be returned to the executing State to serve the person's sentence is subject to the condition that the requested person, after being heard, consents to be returned to the executing State;\n(c)\nif there are substantial grounds for believing that there is a real risk to the protection of the fundamental rights of the requested person, the executing judicial authority may require, as appropriate, additional guarantees as to the treatment of the requested person after the person's surrender before it decides whether to execute the arrest warrant.\nArticle 605\nRecourse to the central authority\n1.   The United Kingdom and the Union, acting on behalf of any of its Member States, may each notify the Specialised Committee on Law Enforcement and Judicial Cooperation of, in the case of the United Kingdom, its central authority and, in the case of the Union, the central authority for each State, having designated such an authority, or, if the legal system of the relevant State so provides, of more than one central authority to assist the competent judicial authorities.\n2.   When notifying the Specialised Committee on Law Enforcement and Judicial Cooperation under paragraph 1, the United Kingdom and the Union, acting on behalf of any of its Member States, may each indicate that, as a result of the organisation of the internal judicial system of the relevant States, the central authority or central authorities are responsible for the administrative transmission and receipt of arrest warrants as well as for all other official correspondence relating to the administrative transmission and receipt of arrest warrants. Such indication shall be binding upon all the authorities of the issuing State.\nArticle 606\nContent and form of the arrest warrant\n1.   The arrest warrant shall contain the following information set out in accordance with the form contained in Annex 43:\n(a)\nthe identity and nationality of the requested person;\n(b)\nthe name, address, telephone and fax numbers and e-mail address of the issuing judicial authority;\n(c)\nevidence of an enforceable judgment, an arrest warrant or any other enforceable judicial decision having the same effect that fall within the scope of Article 599;\n(d)\nthe nature and legal classification of the offence, particularly in respect of Article 599;\n(e)\na description of the circumstances in which the offence was committed, including the time, place and degree of participation in the offence by the requested person;\n(f)\nthe penalty imposed, if there is a final judgment, or the prescribed scale of penalties for the offence under the law of the issuing State; and\n(g)\nif possible, other consequences of the offence.\n2.   The arrest warrant shall be translated into the official language or one of the official languages of the executing State. The United Kingdom and the Union, acting on behalf of any of its Member States, may each notify the Specialised Committee on Law Enforcement and Judicial Cooperation that a translation in one or more other official languages of a State will be accepted.\nArticle 607\nTransmission of an arrest warrant\nIf the location of the requested person is known, the issuing judicial authority may transmit the arrest warrant directly to the executing judicial authority.\nArticle 608\nDetailed procedures for transmitting an arrest warrant\n1.   If the issuing judicial authority does not know which authority is the competent executing judicial authority, it shall make the requisite enquiries, in order to obtain that information from the executing State.\n2.   The issuing judicial authority may request the International Criminal Police Organisation (\"Interpol\") to transmit an arrest warrant.\n3.   The issuing judicial authority may transmit the arrest warrant by any secure means capable of producing written records under conditions allowing the executing State to establish the authenticity of the arrest warrant.\n4.   All difficulties concerning the transmission or the authenticity of any document needed for the execution of the arrest warrant shall be dealt with by direct contacts between the judicial authorities involved, or, where appropriate, with the involvement of the central authorities of the States.\n5.   If the authority which receives an arrest warrant is not competent to act upon it, it shall automatically forward the arrest warrant to the competent authority in its State and shall inform the issuing judicial authority accordingly.\nArticle 609\nRights of a requested person\n1.   If a requested person is arrested for the purpose of the execution of an arrest warrant, the executing judicial authority, in accordance with its domestic law, shall inform that person of the arrest warrant and of its contents, and also of the possibility of consenting to surrender to the issuing State.\n2.   A requested person who is arrested for the purpose of the execution of an arrest warrant and who does not speak or understand the language of the arrest warrant proceedings shall have the right to be assisted by an interpreter and to be provided with a written translation in the native language of the requested person or in any other language which that person speaks or understands, in accordance with the domestic law of the executing State.\n3.   A requested person shall have the right to be assisted by a lawyer in accordance with the domestic law of the executing State upon arrest.\n4.   The requested person shall be informed of the person's right to appoint a lawyer in the issuing State for the purpose of assisting the lawyer in the executing State in the arrest warrant proceedings. This paragraph is without prejudice to the time limits set out in Article 621.\n5.   A requested person who is arrested shall have the right to have the consular authorities of that person's State of nationality, or if that person is stateless, the consular authorities of the State where that person usually resides, informed of the arrest without undue delay and to communicate with those authorities, if that person so wishes.\nArticle 610\nKeeping the person in detention\nWhen a person is arrested on the basis of an arrest warrant, the executing judicial authority shall take a decision on whether the requested person should remain in detention, in accordance with the law of the executing State. The person may be released provisionally at any time in accordance with the domestic law of the executing State, provided that the competent authority of that State takes all the measures it deems necessary to prevent the person from absconding.\nArticle 611\nConsent to surrender\n1.   If the arrested person indicates that he or she consents to surrender, that consent and, if appropriate, the express renunciation of entitlement to the speciality rule referred to in Article 625(2) must be given before the executing judicial authority, in accordance with the domestic law of the executing State.\n2.   Each State shall adopt the measures necessary to ensure that the consent and, where appropriate, the renunciation referred to in paragraph 1 are established in such a way as to show that the person concerned has expressed them voluntarily and in full awareness of the consequences. To that end, the requested person shall have the right to a lawyer.\n3.   The consent and, where appropriate, the renunciation referred to in paragraph 1 shall be formally recorded in accordance with the procedure laid down by the domestic law of the executing State.\n4.   In principle, consent may not be revoked. Each State may provide that the consent and, if appropriate, the renunciation referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article may be revoked in accordance with the rules applicable under its domestic law. In such a case, the period between the date of the consent and that of its revocation shall not be taken into consideration in establishing the time limits laid down in Article 621. The United Kingdom and the Union, acting on behalf of any of its Member States, may each notify the Specialised Committee on Law Enforcement and Judicial Cooperation that it wishes to have recourse to this possibility, specifying the procedures whereby revocation of the consent is possible and any amendments to those procedures.\nArticle 612\nHearing of the requested person\nWhere the arrested person does not consent to surrender as referred to in Article 611, that person shall be entitled to be heard by the executing judicial authority, in accordance with the law of the executing State.\nArticle 613\nSurrender decision\n1.   The executing judicial authority shall decide whether the person is to be surrendered within the time limits and in accordance with the conditions defined in this Title, in particular the principle of proportionality as set out in Article 597.\n2.   If the executing judicial authority finds the information communicated by the issuing State to be insufficient to allow it to decide on surrender, it shall request that the necessary supplementary information, in particular with respect to Article 597, Articles 600 to 602, Article 604 and Article 606, be furnished as a matter of urgency and may fix a time limit for the receipt thereof, taking into account the need to observe the time limits provided for in Article 615.\n3.   The issuing judicial authority may forward any additional useful information to the executing judicial authority at any time.\nArticle 614\nDecision in the event of multiple requests\n1.   If two or more States have issued a European arrest warrant or an arrest warrant for the same person, the decision as to which of those arrest warrants is to be executed shall be taken by the executing judicial authority, with due consideration of all the circumstances, especially the relative seriousness of the offences and place of the offences, the respective dates of the arrest warrants or European arrest warrants and whether they have been issued for the purposes of prosecution or for the execution of a custodial sentence or detention order, and of legal obligations of Member States deriving from Union law regarding, in particular, the principles of freedom of movement and non-discrimination on grounds of nationality.\n2.   The executing judicial authority of a Member State may seek the advice of Eurojust when making the choice referred to in paragraph 1.\n3.   In the event of a conflict between an arrest warrant and a request for extradition presented by a third country, the decision as to whether the arrest warrant or the extradition request takes precedence shall be taken by the competent authority of the executing State with due consideration of all the circumstances, in particular those referred to in paragraph 1 and those mentioned in the applicable convention.\n4.   This Article is without prejudice to the States' obligations under the Statute of the International Criminal Court.\nArticle 615\nTime limits and procedures for the decision to execute the arrest warrant\n1.   An arrest warrant shall be dealt with and executed as a matter of urgency.\n2.   In cases where the requested person consents to surrender, the final decision on the execution of the arrest warrant shall be taken within ten days after the consent was given.\n3.   In other cases, the final decision on the execution of the arrest warrant shall be taken within 60 days after the arrest of the requested person.\n4.   Where in specific cases the arrest warrant cannot be executed within the time limits laid down in paragraph 2 or 3, the executing judicial authority shall immediately inform the issuing judicial authority of that fact, giving the reasons for the delay. In such cases, the time limits may be extended by a further 30 days.\n5.   As long as the executing judicial authority has not taken a final decision on the arrest warrant, it shall ensure that the material conditions necessary for the effective surrender of the person remain fulfilled.\n6.   Reasons must be given for any refusal to execute an arrest warrant.\nArticle 616\nSituation pending the decision\n1.   Where the arrest warrant has been issued for the purpose of conducting a criminal prosecution, the executing judicial authority shall either:\n(a)\nagree that the requested person should be heard according to Article 617; or\n(b)\nagree to the temporary transfer of the requested person.\n2.   The conditions and the duration of the temporary transfer shall be determined by mutual agreement between the issuing and executing judicial authorities.\n3.   In the case of temporary transfer, the person must be able to return to the executing State to attend hearings which concern that person as part of the surrender procedure.\nArticle 617\nHearing the person pending the decision\n1.   The requested person shall be heard by a judicial authority. To that end, the requested person shall be assisted by a lawyer designated in accordance with the law of the issuing State.\n2.   The requested person shall be heard in accordance with the law of the executing State and with the conditions determined by mutual agreement between the issuing and executing judicial authorities.\n3.   The competent executing judicial authority may assign another judicial authority of its State to take part in the hearing of the requested person in order to ensure the proper application of this Article.\nArticle 618\nPrivileges and immunities\n1.   Where the requested person enjoys a privilege or immunity regarding jurisdiction or execution in the executing State, the time limits referred to in Article 615 only start running when, or if, the executing judicial authority is informed of the fact that the privilege or immunity has been waived.\n2.   The executing State shall ensure that the material conditions necessary for effective surrender are fulfilled when the person no longer enjoys such privilege or immunity.\n3.   Where power to waive the privilege or immunity lies with an authority of the executing State, the executing judicial authority shall request that authority to exercise that power without delay. Where power to waive the privilege or immunity lies with an authority of another State, third country or international organisation, the issuing judicial authority shall request that authority to exercise that power.\nArticle 619\nCompeting international obligations\n1.   This Agreement does not prejudice the obligations of the executing State where the requested person has been extradited to that State from a third country and where that person is protected by provisions of the arrangement under which that person was extradited concerning the speciality rule. The executing State shall take all necessary measures for requesting without delay the consent of the third country from which the requested person was extradited so that the requested person can be surrendered to the State which issued the arrest warrant. The time limits referred to in Article 615 do not start running until the day on which the speciality rule ceases to apply.\n2.   Pending the decision of the third country from which the requested person was extradited, the executing State shall ensure that the material conditions necessary for effective surrender remain fulfilled.\nArticle 620\nNotification of the decision\nThe executing judicial authority shall notify the issuing judicial authority immediately of the decision on the action to be taken on the arrest warrant.\nArticle 621\nTime limits for surrender of the person\n1.   The requested person shall be surrendered as soon as possible on a date agreed between the authorities concerned.\n2.   The requested person shall be surrendered no later than ten days after the final decision on the execution of the arrest warrant.\n3.   If the surrender of the requested person within the time limit in paragraph 2 is prevented by circumstances beyond the control of any of the States, the executing and issuing judicial authorities shall immediately contact each other and agree on a new surrender date. In that event, the surrender shall take place within ten days of the new date thus agreed.\n4.   The surrender may exceptionally be temporarily postponed for serious humanitarian reasons, for example if there are substantial grounds for believing that the surrender would manifestly endanger the requested person's life or health. The execution of the arrest warrant shall take place as soon as those grounds have ceased to exist. The executing judicial authority shall immediately inform the issuing judicial authority and agree on a new surrender date. In that event, the surrender shall take place within ten days of the new date agreed.\n5.   Upon the expiry of the time limits referred to in paragraphs 2 to 4, if the requested person is still being held in custody, that person shall be released. The executing and issuing judicial authorities shall contact each other as soon as it appears that a person is to be released under this paragraph and agree the arrangements for the surrender of that person.\nArticle 622\nPostponed or conditional surrender\n1.   After deciding to execute the arrest warrant, the executing judicial authority may postpone the surrender of the requested person so that the requested person may be prosecuted in the executing State or, if the requested person has already been sentenced, so that the requested person may serve, a sentence passed for an act other than that referred to in the arrest warrant in the territory of the executing State.\n2.   Instead of postponing the surrender, the executing judicial authority may temporarily surrender the requested person to the issuing State under conditions to be determined by mutual agreement between the executing and the issuing judicial authorities. The agreement shall be made in writing and the conditions shall be binding on all the authorities in the issuing State.\nArticle 623\nTransit\n1.   Each State shall permit the transit through its territory of a requested person who is being surrendered provided that it has been given information on:\n(a)\nthe identity and nationality of the person subject to the arrest warrant;\n(b)\nthe existence of an arrest warrant;\n(c)\nthe nature and legal classification of the offence; and\n(d)\nthe description of the circumstances of the offence, including the date and place.\n2.   The State, on behalf of which a notification has been made in accordance with Article 603(2) to the effect that its own nationals will not be surrendered or that surrender will be authorised only under certain specified conditions, may, refuse the transit of its own nationals through its territory under the same terms or submit it to the same conditions.\n3.   The States shall designate an authority responsible for receiving transit requests and the necessary documents, as well as any other official correspondence relating to transit requests.\n4.   The transit request and the information referred to in paragraph 1 may be addressed to the authority designated pursuant to paragraph 3 by any means capable of producing a written record. The State of transit shall notify its decision by the same procedure.\n5.   This Article does not apply in the case of transport by air without a scheduled stopover. However, if an unscheduled landing occurs, the issuing State shall provide the authority designated pursuant to paragraph 3 with the information referred to in paragraph 1.\n6.   Where a transit concerns a person who is to be extradited from a third country to a State, this Article applies mutatis mutandis. In particular, references to an \"arrest warrant\" shall be treated as references to an \"extradition request\".\nArticle 624\nDeduction of the period of detention served in the executing State\n1.   The issuing State shall deduct all periods of detention arising from the execution of an arrest warrant from the total period of detention to be served in the issuing State as a result of a custodial sentence or detention order being passed.\n2.   All information concerning the duration of the detention of the requested person on the basis of the arrest warrant shall be transmitted by the executing judicial authority or the central authority designated under Article 605 to the issuing judicial authority at the time of the surrender.\nArticle 625\nPossible prosecution for other offences\n1.   The United Kingdom and the Union, acting on behalf of any of its Member States, may each notify the Specialised Committee on Law Enforcement and Judicial Cooperation that, in relations with other States to which the same notification applies, consent is presumed to have been given for the prosecution, sentencing or detention of a person with a view to the carrying out of a custodial sentence or detention order for an offence committed prior to the person's surrender, other than that for which that person was surrendered, unless in a particular case the executing judicial authority states otherwise in its decision on surrender.\n2.   Except in the cases referred to in paragraphs 1 and 3, a person surrendered may not be prosecuted, sentenced or otherwise deprived of liberty for an offence committed prior to that person's surrender other than that for which the person was surrendered.\n3.   Paragraph 2 of this Article does not apply in the following cases:\n(a)\nthe person, having had an opportunity to leave the territory of the State to which that person has been surrendered, has not done so within 45 days of that person's final discharge or has returned to that territory after leaving it;\n(b)\nthe offence is not punishable by a custodial sentence or detention order;\n(c)\nthe criminal proceedings do not give rise to the application of a measure restricting personal liberty;\n(d)\nthe person could be liable to a penalty or a measure not involving the deprivation of liberty, in particular a financial penalty or a measure in lieu of a financial penalty, even if the penalty or measure may give rise to a restriction of the person's personal liberty;\n(e)\nthe person consented to be surrendered, where appropriate at the same time as the person renounced the speciality rule, in accordance with Article 611;\n(f)\nthe person, after the person's surrender, has expressly renounced entitlement to the speciality rule with regard to specific offences preceding the person's surrender; renunciation must be given before the competent judicial authority of the issuing State and be recorded in accordance with that State's domestic law; the renunciation must be drawn up in such a way as to make clear that the person concerned has given it voluntarily and in full awareness of the consequences; to that end, the person shall have the right to a lawyer; and\n(g)\nthe executing judicial authority which surrendered the person gives its consent in accordance with paragraph 4 of this Article.\n4.   A request for consent shall be submitted to the executing judicial authority, accompanied by the information referred to in Article 606(1) and a translation as referred to in Article 606(2). Consent shall be given where the offence for which it is requested is itself subject to surrender in accordance with the provisions of this Title. Consent shall be refused on the grounds referred to in Article 600 and otherwise may be refused only on the grounds referred to in Article 601, or Article 602(2) and Article 603(2). The decision shall be taken no later than 30 days after receipt of the request. For the situations laid down in Article 604 the issuing State must give the guarantees provided for therein.\nArticle 626\nSurrender or subsequent extradition\n1.   The United Kingdom and the Union, acting on behalf of any of its Member States, may each notify the Specialised Committee on Law Enforcement and Judicial Cooperation that, in relations with other States to which the same notification applies, the consent for the surrender of a person to a State other than the executing State pursuant to an arrest warrant or European arrest warrant issued for an offence committed prior to that person's surrender is presumed to have been given, unless in a particular case the executing judicial authority states otherwise in its decision on surrender.\n2.   In any case, a person who has been surrendered to the issuing State pursuant to an arrest warrant or European arrest warrant may be surrendered to a State other than the executing State pursuant to an arrest warrant or European arrest warrant issued for any offence committed prior to the person's surrender without the consent of the executing State in the following cases:\n(a)\nthe requested person, having had an opportunity to leave the territory of the State to which that person has been surrendered, has not done so within 45 days of that person's final discharge, or has returned to that territory after leaving it;\n(b)\nthe requested person consents to be surrendered to a State other than the executing State pursuant to an arrest warrant or European arrest warrant; consent must be given before the competent judicial authorities of the issuing State and be recorded in accordance with that State's domestic law; it must be drawn up in such a way as to make clear that the person concerned has given it voluntarily and in full awareness of the consequences; to that end, the requested person shall have the right to a lawyer; and\n(c)\nthe requested person is not subject to the speciality rule, in accordance with point (a), (e), (f) or (g) of Article 625(3).\n3.   The executing judicial authority shall consent to the surrender to another State in accordance with the following rules:\n(a)\nthe request for consent shall be submitted in accordance with Article 607, accompanied by the information set out in Article 606(1) and a translation as referred to in Article 606(2);\n(b)\nconsent shall be given where the offence for which it is requested is itself subject to surrender in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement;\n(c)\nthe decision shall be taken no later than 30 days after receipt of the request; and\n(d)\nconsent shall be refused on the grounds referred to in Article 600 and otherwise may be refused only on the grounds referred to in Article 601, Article 602(2) and Article 603(2).\n4.   For the situations referred to in Article 604, the issuing State shall give the guarantees provided for therein.\n5.   Notwithstanding paragraph 1, a person who has been surrendered pursuant to an arrest warrant shall not be extradited to a third country without the consent of the competent authority of the State which surrendered the person. Such consent shall be given in accordance with the Conventions by which that State is bound, as well as with its domestic law.\nArticle 627\nHanding over of property\n1.   At the request of the issuing judicial authority or on its own initiative, the executing judicial authority shall, in accordance with its domestic law, seize and hand over property which:\n(a)\nmay be required as evidence; or\n(b)\nhas been acquired by the requested person as a result of the offence.\n2.   The property referred to in paragraph 1 shall be handed over even if the arrest warrant cannot be carried out owing to the death or escape of the requested person.\n3.   If the property referred to in paragraph 1 is liable to seizure or confiscation in the territory of the executing State, that State may, if the property is needed in connection with pending criminal proceedings, temporarily retain it or hand it over to the issuing State on condition that it is returned.\n4.   Any rights which the executing State or third parties may have acquired in the property referred to in paragraph 1 shall be preserved.

The requested State may consult the requesting State if the competent authority of the requested State is of the view that the conditions in paragraph 1 are not met. After the consultation, the competent authority of the requesting State may decide to withdraw the request for mutual assistance.\nArticle 637\nRecourse to a different type of investigative measure\n1.   Wherever possible, the competent authority of the requested State shall consider recourse to an investigative measure other than the measure indicated in the request for mutual assistance if:\n(a)\nthe investigative measure indicated in the request does not exist under the law of the requested State; or\n(b)\nthe investigative measure indicated in the request would not be available in a similar domestic case.\n2.

If a request for mutual assistance is made to take provisional measures pursuant to Article 24 of the Second Additional Protocol to the European Mutual Assistance Convention, the competent authority of the requested State shall decide on the provisional measure, and shall communicate that decision to the competent authority of the requesting State, as soon as possible after the receipt of the request. Before lifting any provisional measure taken pursuant to this Article, the competent authority of the requested State, wherever possible, shall give the competent authority of the requesting State an opportunity to present its reasons in favour of continuing the measure.\n5.   If in a specific case, the time limit provided for in paragraph 1 or 2, or the time limit or specific date referred to in paragraph 3 cannot be met, or the decision on taking provisional measures in accordance with paragraph 4 is delayed, the competent authority of the requested State shall, without delay, inform the competent authority of the requesting State by any means, giving the reasons for the delay, and shall consult with the competent authority of the requesting State on the appropriate timing to execute the request for mutual assistance.\n6.

Such notifications may be made subject to the principle of reciprocity.\nArticle 662\nSpontaneous information\nWithout prejudice to its own investigations or proceedings, a State may without prior request forward to another State information on instrumentalities, proceeds and other property liable to confiscation, where it considers that the disclosure of such information might assist the receiving State in initiating or carrying out investigations or proceedings or might lead to a request by that State under this Title.\nArticle 663\nObligation to take provisional measures\n1.   At the request of another State which has instituted a criminal investigation or proceedings, or an investigation or proceedings for the purposes of confiscation, the requested State shall take the necessary provisional measures, such as freezing or seizing, to prevent any dealing in, transfer or disposal of property which, at a later stage, may be the subject of a request for confiscation or which might satisfy the request.\n2.   A State which has received a request for confiscation pursuant to Article 665 shall, if so requested, take the measures referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article in respect of any property which is the subject of the request or which might satisfy the request.\n3.   Where a request is received under this Article, the requested State shall take all necessary measures to comply with the request without delay and with the same speed and priority as for a similar domestic case and send confirmation without delay and by any means of producing a written record to the requesting State.\n4.   Where the requesting State states that immediate freezing is necessary since there are legitimate grounds to believe that the property in question will immediately be removed or destroyed, the requested State shall take all necessary measures to comply with the request within 96 hours of receiving the request and send confirmation to the requesting State by any means of producing a written record and without delay.\n5.   Where the requested State is unable to comply with the time limits under paragraph 4, the requested State shall immediately inform the requesting State, and consult with the requesting State on the appropriate next steps.\n6.   Any expiration of the time limits under paragraph 4 does not extinguish the requirements placed on the requested State by this Article.\nArticle 664\nExecution of provisional measures\n1.   After the execution of the provisional measures requested in conformity with Article 663(1), the requesting State shall provide spontaneously and as soon as possible to the requested State all information which may question or modify the extent of those measures. The requesting State shall also provide without delay all complementary information required by the requested State and which is necessary for the implementation of and the follow-up to the provisional measures.\n2.   Before lifting any provisional measure taken pursuant to Article 663, the requested State shall, wherever possible, give the requesting State an opportunity to present its reasons in favour of continuing the measure.\nArticle 665\nObligation to confiscate\n1.   The State which has received a request for confiscation of property situated in its territory shall:\n(a)\nenforce a confiscation order made by a court of the requesting State in relation to such property; or\n(b)\nsubmit the request to its competent authorities for the purpose of obtaining an order of confiscation and, if such an order is granted, enforce it.\n2.   For the purposes of point (b) of paragraph 1, the States shall, whenever necessary, have competence to institute confiscation proceedings under their own domestic law.\n3.   Paragraph 1 also applies to confiscation consisting in a requirement to pay a sum of money corresponding to the value of proceeds, if property against which the confiscation can be enforced is located in the requested State. In such cases, when enforcing confiscation pursuant to paragraph 1, the requested State shall, if payment is not obtained, realise the claim on any property available for that purpose.\n4.   If a request for confiscation concerns a specific item of property, the requesting State and requested State may agree that the requested State may enforce the confiscation in the form of a requirement to pay a sum of money corresponding to the value of the property.\n5.   A State shall cooperate to the widest extent possible under its domestic law with a State requesting the execution of measures equivalent to confiscation of property, where the request has not been issued in the framework of proceedings in criminal matters, in so far as such measures are ordered by a judicial authority of the requesting State in relation to a criminal offence, provided that it has been established that the property constitutes proceeds or:\n(a)\nother property into which the proceeds have been transformed or converted;\n(b)\nproperty acquired from legitimate sources, if proceeds have been intermingled, in whole or in part, with such property, up to the assessed value of the intermingled proceeds; or\n(c)\nincome or other benefit derived from the proceeds, from property into which proceeds of crime have been transformed or converted or from property with which the proceeds of crime have been intermingled, up to the assessed value of the intermingled proceeds, in the same manner and to the same extent as proceeds.\n6.   The measures referred to in paragraph 5 include measures which allow the seizure, detention and forfeiture of property and assets by means of applications to civil courts.\n7.   The requested State shall take the decision on the execution of the confiscation order without delay, and, without prejudice to paragraph 8 of this Article, no later than 45 days after receiving the request. The requested State shall send confirmation to the requesting State by any means of producing a written record and without delay. Unless grounds for postponement under Article 672 exist, the requested State shall take the concrete measures necessary to execute the confiscation order without delay and, at least, with the same speed and priority as for a similar domestic case.\n8.   Where the requested State is unable to comply with the time limit under paragraph 7, the requested State shall immediately inform the requesting State, and consult with the requesting State on the appropriate next steps.\n9.   Any expiration of the time limit under paragraph 7 does not extinguish the requirements placed on the requested State by this Article.\nArticle 666\nExecution of confiscation\n1.   The procedures for obtaining and enforcing the confiscation under Article 665 shall be governed by the domestic law of the requested State.\n2.   The requested State shall be bound by the findings as to the facts in so far as they are stated in a conviction or judicial decision issued by a court of the requesting State or in so far as such conviction or judicial decision is implicitly based on them.\n3.   If the confiscation consists in the requirement to pay a sum of money, the competent authority of the requested State shall convert the amount thereof into the currency of that State at the rate of exchange applicable at the time when the decision to enforce the confiscation is taken.\nArticle 667\nConfiscated property\n1.   Subject to paragraphs 2 and 3 of this Article, property confiscated pursuant to Articles 665 and 666 shall be disposed of by the requested State in accordance with its domestic law and administrative procedures.\n2.   When acting on the request made by another State pursuant to Article 665, the requested State shall, to the extent permitted by its domestic law and if so requested, give priority consideration to returning the confiscated property to the requesting State so that it can give compensation to the victims of the crime or return such property to their legitimate owners.\n3.   Where acting on the request made by another State in accordance with Article 665, and after having taken into account the right of a victim to restitution or compensation of property pursuant to paragraph 2 of this Article, the requested State shall dispose of the money obtained as a result of the execution of a confiscation order as follows:\n(a)\nif the amount is equal to or less than EUR 10 000, the amount shall accrue to the requested State; or\n(b)\nif the amount is greater than EUR 10 000, the requested State shall transfer 50 % of the amount recovered to the requesting State.\n4.   Notwithstanding paragraph 3, the requesting State and requested State may, on a case-by-case basis, give special consideration to concluding other such agreements or arrangements on disposal of property as they deem appropriate.\nArticle 668\nRight of enforcement and maximum amount of confiscation\n1.   A request for confiscation made under Article 665 does not affect the right of the requesting State to enforce the confiscation order itself.\n2.   Nothing in this Title shall be interpreted as permitting the total value of the confiscation to exceed the amount of the sum of money specified in the confiscation order. If a State finds that this might occur, the States concerned shall enter into consultations to avoid such an effect.\nArticle 669\nImprisonment in default\nThe requested State shall not impose imprisonment in default or any other measure restricting the liberty of a person as a result of a request under Article 665 without the consent of the requesting State.\nArticle 670\nGrounds for refusal\n1.   Cooperation under this Title may be refused if:\n(a)\nthe requested State considers that executing the request would be contrary to the principle of ne bis in idem; or\n(b)\nthe offence to which the request relates does not constitute an offence under the domestic law of the requested State if committed within its jurisdiction; however, this ground for refusal applies to cooperation under Articles 658 to 662 only in so far as the assistance sought involves coercive action.\n2.   The United Kingdom and the Union, acting on behalf of any of its Member States, may each notify the Specialised Committee on Law Enforcement and Judicial Cooperation that, on the basis of reciprocity, the condition of double criminality referred to in point (b) of paragraph 1 of this Article will not be applied provided that the offence giving rise to the request is:\n(a)\none of the offences listed in Article 599(5), as defined by the law of the requesting State; and\n(b)\npunishable by the requesting State by a custodial sentence or a detention order for a maximum period of at least three years.\n3.   Cooperation under Articles 658 to 662, in so far as the assistance sought involves coercive action, and under Articles 663 and 664 may also be refused if the measures sought could not be taken under the domestic law of the requested State for the purposes of investigations or proceedings in a similar domestic case.\n4.   Where the domestic law of the requested State so requires, cooperation under Articles 658 to 662, in so far as the assistance sought involves coercive action, and under Articles 663 and 664 may also be refused if the measures sought or any other measures having similar effects would not be permitted under the domestic law of the requesting State, or, as regards the competent authorities of the requesting State, if the request is not authorised by a judicial authority acting in relation to criminal offences.\n5.   Cooperation under Articles 665 to 669 may also be refused if:\n(a)\nunder the domestic law of the requested State, confiscation is not provided for in respect of the type of offence to which the request relates;\n(b)\nwithout prejudice to the obligation pursuant to Article 665(3), it would be contrary to the principles of the domestic law of the requested State concerning the limits of confiscation in respect of the relationship between an offence and:\n(i)\nan economic advantage that might be qualified as its proceeds; or\n(ii)\nproperty that might be qualified as its instrumentalities;\n(c)\nunder the domestic law of the requested State, confiscation may no longer be imposed or enforced because of the lapse of time;\n(d)\nwithout prejudice to Article 665(5) and (6), the request does not relate to a previous conviction, or a decision of a judicial nature or a statement in such a decision that an offence or several offences have been committed, on the basis of which the confiscation has been ordered or is sought;\n(e)\nconfiscation is either not enforceable in the requesting State, or it is still subject to ordinary means of appeal; or\n(f)\nthe request relates to a confiscation order resulting from a decision rendered in absentia of the person against whom the order was issued and, in the opinion of the requested State, the proceedings conducted by the requesting State leading to such decision did not satisfy the minimum rights of defence recognised as due to everyone against whom a criminal charge is made.\n6.   For the purposes of point (f) of paragraph 5 a decision is not considered to have been rendered in absentia if:\n(a)\nit has been confirmed or pronounced after opposition by the person concerned; or\n(b)\nit has been rendered on appeal, provided that the appeal was lodged by the person concerned.\n7.   When considering, for the purposes of point (f) of paragraph 5, whether the minimum rights of defence have been satisfied, the requested State shall take into account the fact that the person concerned has deliberately sought to evade justice or the fact that that person, having had the possibility of lodging a legal remedy against the decision made in absentia, elected not to do so. The same applies where the person concerned, having been duly served with the summons to appear, elected not to do so nor to ask for adjournment.\n8.   The States shall not invoke bank secrecy as a ground to refuse any cooperation under this Title. Where its domestic law so requires, a requested State may require that a request for cooperation which would involve the lifting of bank secrecy be authorised by a judicial authority acting in relation to criminal offences.\n9.   The requested State shall not invoke the fact that:\n(a)\nthe person under investigation or subject to a confiscation order by the authorities of the requesting State is a legal person as an obstacle to affording any cooperation under this Title;\n(b)\nthe natural person against whom an order of confiscation of proceeds has been issued has died or a legal person against whom an order of confiscation of proceeds has been issued has subsequently been dissolved as an obstacle to affording assistance in accordance with point (a) of Article 665(1); or\n(c)\nthe person under investigation or subject to a confiscation order by the authorities of the requesting State is mentioned in the request both as the author of the underlying criminal offence and of the offence of money laundering as an obstacle to affording any cooperation under this Title.\nArticle 671\nConsultation and information\nWhere there are substantial grounds for believing that the execution of a freezing or confiscation order would entail a real risk for the protection of fundamental rights, the requested State shall, before it decides on the execution of the freezing or confiscation order, consult the requesting State and may require any necessary information to be provided.\nArticle 672\nPostponement\nThe requested State may postpone action on a request if such action would prejudice investigations or proceedings by its authorities.\nArticle 673\nPartial or conditional granting of a request\nBefore refusing or postponing cooperation under this Title, the requested State shall, where appropriate after having consulted the requesting State, consider whether the request may be granted partially or subject to such conditions as it deems necessary.\nArticle 674\nNotification of documents\n1.   The States shall afford each other the widest measure of mutual assistance in the serving of judicial documents to persons affected by provisional measures and confiscation.\n2.   Nothing in this Article is intended to interfere with:\n(a)\nthe possibility of sending judicial documents, by postal channels, directly to persons abroad; and\n(b)\nthe possibility for judicial officers, officials or other competent authorities of the State of origin to effect service of judicial documents directly through the consular authorities of that State or through the judicial authorities, including judicial officers and officials, or other competent authorities of the State of destination.\n3.   When serving judicial documents to persons abroad affected by provisional measures or confiscation orders issued in the sending State, that State shall indicate what legal remedies are available under its domestic law to such persons.\nArticle 675\nRecognition of foreign decisions\n1.   When dealing with a request for cooperation under Articles 663 to 669 the requested State shall recognise any decision issued by a judicial authority taken in the requesting State regarding rights claimed by third parties.\n2.   Recognition may be refused if:\n(a)\nthird parties did not have adequate opportunity to assert their rights;\n(b)\nthe decision is incompatible with a decision already taken in the requested State on the same matter;\n(c)\nit is incompatible with the ordre public of the requested State; or\n(d)\nthe decision was taken contrary to provisions on exclusive jurisdiction provided for by the domestic law of the requested State.\nArticle 676\nAuthorities\n1.   Each State shall designate a central authority to be responsible for sending and answering requests made under this Title, the execution of such requests or their transmission to the authorities competent for their execution.\n2.   The Union may designate a Union body which may, in addition to the competent authorities of the Member States, make and, if appropriate, execute requests under this Title. Any such request is to be treated for the purposes of this Title as a request by a Member State. The Union may also designate that Union body as the central authority responsible for the purpose of sending and answering requests made under this Title by, or to, that body.\nArticle 677\nDirect communication\n1.   The central authorities shall communicate directly with one another.\n2.   In urgent cases, requests or communications under this Title may be sent directly by the judicial authorities of the requesting State to judicial authorities of the requested State. In such cases, a copy shall be sent at the same time to the central authority of the requested State through the central authority of the requesting State.\n3.   Where a request is made pursuant to paragraph 2 and the authority is not competent to deal with the request, it shall refer the request to the competent national authority and shall directly inform the requesting State that it has done so.\n4.   Requests or communications under Articles 658 to 662, which do not involve coercive action, may be directly transmitted by the competent authorities of the requesting State to the competent authorities of the requested State.\n5.   Draft requests or communications under this Title may be sent directly by the judicial authorities of the requesting State to the judicial authorities of the requested State prior to a formal request to ensure that the formal request can be dealt with efficiently upon receipt and that it contains sufficient information and supporting documentation for it to meet the requirements of the law of the requested State.\nArticle 678\nForm of request and languages\n1.   All requests under this Title shall be made in writing. They may be transmitted electronically, or by any other means of telecommunication, provided that the requesting State is prepared, upon request, to produce a written record of such communication and the original at any time.\n2.   Requests under paragraph 1 shall be made in one of the official languages of the requested State or in any other language notified by or on behalf of the requested State in accordance with paragraph 3.\n3.   The United Kingdom and the Union, acting on behalf of any of its Member States, may each notify the Specialised Committee on Law Enforcement and Judicial Cooperation of the language or languages which, in addition to the official language or languages of that State, may be used for making requests under this Title.\n4.   Requests under Article 663 for provisional measures shall be made using the prescribed form at Annex 46.\n5.   Requests under Article 665 for confiscation shall be made using the prescribed form at Annex 46.\n6.   The Specialised Committee on Law Enforcement and Judicial Cooperation may amend the forms referred to in paragraphs 4 and 5 as may be necessary.\n7.   The United Kingdom and the Union, acting on behalf of any of its Member States may each notify the Specialised Committee on Law Enforcement and Judicial Cooperation that it requires the translation of any supporting documents into one of the official languages of the requested State or any other language indicated in accordance with paragraph 3 of this Article. In the case of requests pursuant to Article 663(4), such translation of supporting documents may be provided to the requested State within 48 hours after transmitting the request, without prejudice to the time limits provided for in Article 663(4).\nArticle 679\nLegalisation\nDocuments transmitted in application of this Title shall be exempt from all legalisation formalities.\nArticle 680\nContent of request\n1.

A request for provisional measures under Article 663 in relation to seizure of property on which a confiscation order consisting of the requirement to pay a sum of money may be realised shall also indicate a maximum amount for which recovery is sought in that property.\n3.   In addition to the information referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article, any request under Article 665 shall contain:\n(a)\nin the case of point (a) of Article 665(1):\n(i)\na certified true copy of the confiscation order made by the court in the requesting State and a statement of the grounds on the basis of which the order was made, if they are not indicated in the order itself;\n(ii)\nan attestation by the competent authority of the requesting State that the confiscation order is enforceable and not subject to ordinary means of appeal;\n(iii)\ninformation as to the extent to which the enforcement of the order is requested; and\n(iv)\ninformation as to the necessity of taking any provisional measures;\n(b)\nin the case of point (b) of Article 665(1), a statement of the facts relied upon by the requesting State sufficient to enable the requested State to seek the order under its domestic law;\n(c)\nwhere third parties have had the opportunity to claim rights, documents demonstrating that this has been the case.\nArticle 681\nDefective requests\n1.   If a request does not comply with the provisions of this Title or the information supplied is not sufficient to enable the requested State to deal with the request, that State may ask the requesting State to amend the request or to complete it with additional information.\n2.   The requested State may set a time limit for the receipt of such amendments or information.\n3.   Pending receipt of the requested amendments or information in relation to a request under Article 665, the requested State may take any of the measures referred to in Articles 658 to 664.\nArticle 682\nPlurality of requests\n1.   Where the requested State receives more than one request under Article 663 or Article 665 in respect of the same person or property, the plurality of requests shall not prevent that State from dealing with the requests involving the taking of provisional measures.\n2.   In the case of a plurality of requests under Article 665, the requested State shall consider consulting the requesting States.\nArticle 683\nObligation to give reasons\nThe requested State shall give reasons for any decision to refuse, postpone or make conditional any cooperation under this Title.\nArticle 684\nInformation\n1.

The requesting State shall promptly inform the requested State of:\n(a)\nany review, decision or any other fact by reason of which the confiscation order ceases to be wholly or partially enforceable; and\n(b)\nany development, factual or legal, by reason of which any action under this Title is no longer justified.\n3.   Where a State, on the basis of the same confiscation order, requests confiscation in more than one State, it shall inform all States which are affected by the enforcement of the order about the request.\nArticle 685\nRestriction of use\n1.   The requested State may make the execution of a request dependent on the condition that the information or evidence obtained is not, without its prior consent, to be used or transmitted by the authorities of the requesting State for investigations or proceedings other than those specified in the request.\n2.   Without the prior consent of the requested State, information or evidence provided by it under this Title shall not be used or transmitted by the authorities of the requesting State in investigations or proceedings other than those specified in the request.\n3.   Personal data communicated under this Title may be used by the State to which they have been transferred:\n(a)\nfor the purposes of proceedings to which this Title applies;\n(b)\nfor other judicial and administrative proceedings directly related to proceedings referred to in point (a);\n(c)\nfor preventing an immediate and serious threat to public security; or\n(d)\nfor any other purpose, only with the prior consent of the communicating State, unless the State concerned has obtained the consent of the data subject.\n4.

The Titles concerned by the suspension shall provisionally cease to apply on the first day of the third month following the date of the notification referred to in paragraph 1 or 2, unless, no later than two weeks before the expiry of that period, as extended, as the case may be, in accordance with point (d) of paragraph 7, the Party which notified the suspension gives written notification to the other Party, through diplomatic channels, of its withdrawal of the first notification or of a reduction in scope of the suspension. In the latter case, only the Titles referred to in the second notification shall provisionally cease to apply.\n6.   If one Party notifies the suspension of one or several Titles of this Part pursuant to paragraph 1 or 2, the other Party may suspend all of the remaining Titles, by written notification through diplomatic channels, with three months' notice.\n7.   Upon the notification of a suspension pursuant to paragraph 1 or 2, the Partnership Council shall immediately be seized of the matter. The Partnership Council shall explore possible ways of allowing the Party that notified the suspension to postpone its entry into effect, to reduce its scope or to withdraw it. To that end, upon a recommendation of the Specialised Committee on Law Enforcement and Judicial Cooperation, the Partnership Council may:\n(a)\nagree on joint interpretations of provisions of this Part;\n(b)\nrecommend any appropriate action to the Parties;\n(c)\nadopt appropriate adaptations to this Part which are necessary to address the reasons underlying the suspension, with a maximum validity of 12 months; and\n(d)\nextend the period referred to in paragraph 5 by up to three months.\n8.   If either Party gives notification of suspension under this Article, the Specialised Committee on Law Enforcement and Judicial Cooperation shall meet to decide what measures are needed to ensure that any cooperation initiated under this Part and affected by the notification is concluded in an appropriate manner. In any event, with regard to all personal data obtained through cooperation under this Part before the Titles concerned by the suspension provisionally cease to apply, the Parties shall ensure that the level of protection under which the personal data were transferred is maintained after the suspension takes effect.\n9.   The suspended Titles shall be reinstated on the first day of the month following the day on which the Party having notified the suspension pursuant to paragraph 1 or 2 has given written notification to the other Party, through diplomatic channels, of its intention to reinstate the suspended Titles. The Party having notified the suspension pursuant to paragraph 1 or 2 shall do so immediately after the serious and systemic deficiencies on the part of the other Party on which the suspension was based have ceased to exist.\n10.   Upon the notification of the intention to reinstate the suspended Titles in accordance with paragraph 9, the remaining Titles suspended pursuant to paragraph 6 shall be reinstated at the same time as the Titles suspended pursuant to paragraph 1 or 2.\nArticle 694\nExpenses\nThe Parties and the Member States, including institutions, bodies, offices and agencies of the Parties or the Member States, shall bear their own expenses which arise in the course of implementation of this Part, unless otherwise provided for in this Agreement.\nTITLE XIII\nDISPUTE SETTLEMENT\nArticle 695\nObjective\nThe objective of this Title is to establish a swift, effective and efficient mechanism for avoiding and settling disputes between the Parties concerning this Part, including disputes concerning this Part when applied to situations governed by other provisions of this Agreement, with a view to reaching a mutually agreed solution, where possible.\nArticle 696\nScope\n1.

The operational contribution of a programme, activity or part thereof for a year N may be adjusted upwards or downwards retrospectively in one or more subsequent years on the basis of the budgetary commitments made on the commitment appropriations of that year, their implementation through legal commitments and their decommitment.\nThe first adjustment shall be made in year N+1 when the initial contribution shall be adjusted upwards or downwards by the difference between the initial contribution and an adjusted contribution calculated by applying the contribution key of year N to the sum of:\n(a)\nthe amount of budgetary commitments made on commitment appropriations authorised in year N under the European Union adopted budget and on commitment appropriations corresponding to decommitments made available again; and\n(b)\nany external assigned revenue appropriations that do not result from financial contributions to Union programmes and activities from other donors as defined in Protocol I and that were available at the end of year N.\nEach subsequent year, until all the budgetary commitments financed under commitment appropriations originating from year N have been paid or decommitted and at the latest three years after the end of the programme or after the end of the multiannual financial framework corresponding to year N, whichever is earlier, the Union shall calculate an adjustment of the contribution of year N by reducing the United Kingdom contribution by the amount obtained by applying the contribution key of year N to the decommitments made each year on commitments of year N financed under the Union budget or from decommitments made available again.\nIf external assigned revenue appropriations that do not result from financial contributions to Union programmes and activities from other donors as defined in Protocol I are cancelled, the contribution of the United Kingdom shall be reduced by the amount obtained by applying the contribution key of year N to the amount cancelled.\nIn year N+2 or in subsequent years, after having made the adjustments referred to in the second, third and fourth subparagraphs, the contribution of the United Kingdom for year N shall also be reduced by an amount obtained by multiplying the contribution of the United Kingdom for year N and the ratio of:\n(a)\nthe legal commitments of year N, funded under any commitment appropriations available in year N, and resulting from competitive award procedures,\n(i)\nfrom which the United Kingdom and the United Kingdom entities have been excluded; or\n(ii)\nfor which the Specialised Committee on Participation in Union Programmes has decided, in accordance with the procedure established in Article 715 that there has been a quasi-exclusion of United Kingdom or United Kingdom entities; or\n(iii)\nfor which the deadline for submission of applications has expired during the suspension referred to in Article 718 or after termination referred to in Article 720 has taken effect; or\n(iv)\nfor which the participation of the United Kingdom and United Kingdom entities has been limited in accordance with Article 722(3); and\n(b)\nthe total amount of legal commitments funded under any commitment appropriations of year N.\nThis amount of legal commitments shall be calculated by taking all budgetary commitments made in year N and deducting the decommitments that have been made on these commitments in year N+1.\n9.   Upon request, the Union shall provide the United Kingdom with information in relation to its financial participation as included in the budgetary, accounting, performance and evaluation related information provided to the Union budgetary and discharge authorities concerning the Union programmes and activities in which the United Kingdom participates. That information shall be provided having due regard to the Union's and United Kingdom's confidentiality and data protection rules and is without prejudice to the information which the United Kingdom is entitled to receive under Chapter 2.\n10.   All contributions of the United Kingdom or payments from the Union, and the calculation of amounts due or to be received, shall be made in euros.\n11.   Subject to paragraph 5 and the second subparagraph of paragraph 8 of this Article, the detailed provisions for the implementation of this Article are set out in Annex 47. Annex 47 may be amended by the Specialised Committee on Participation in Union Programmes.\nArticle 715\nQuasi exclusion from competitive grant award procedure\n1.   When the United Kingdom considers that certain conditions laid down in a competitive grant award procedure amount to a quasi-exclusion of United Kingdom entities, the United Kingdom shall notify the Specialised Committee on Participation in Union Programmes before the deadline for submission of applications in the procedure concerned and shall provide justification.\n2.   Within three months of the deadline for submission of applications in the award procedure concerned, the Specialised Committee on Participation in Union Programmes shall examine the notification referred to in the paragraph 1 provided that the participation rate of United Kingdom entities in the award procedure concerned is at least 25 % lower compared to:\n(a)\nthe average participation rate of United Kingdom entities in similar competitive award procedures not containing such a condition and launched within the three years preceding the notification; or,\n(b)\nin the absence of similar competitive award procedures, the average participation rate of United Kingdom entities in all competitive award procedures launched under the programme, or the preceding programme, as relevant, within the 3 years preceding the notification.\n3.   The Specialised Committee on Participation in Union Programmes shall by the end of the period referred to in paragraph 2, decide whether there has been a quasi-exclusion of the United Kingdom entities from the award procedure concerned in light of the justification provided by the United Kingdom pursuant to paragraph 1 and the effective participation rate in the award procedure concerned.\n4.   For the purposes of paragraphs 2 and 3, the participation rate shall be the ratio of the number of applications submitted by United Kingdom entities to the total number of applications submitted within the same award procedure.\nArticle 716\nProgrammes to which an automatic correction mechanism applies\n1.   An automatic correction mechanism shall apply in relation to those Union programmes, activities or parts thereof for which the application of an automatic correction mechanism is provided in Protocol I. The application of that automatic correction mechanism may be limited to parts of the programme or activity specified in Protocol I, which are implemented through grants for which competitive calls are organised. Detailed rules on the identification of the parts of the programme or activity to which the automatic correction mechanism does or does not apply may be established in Protocol I.\n2.   The amount of the automatic correction for a programme or activity or parts thereof shall be the difference between the initial amounts of the legal commitments actually entered into with the United Kingdom or United Kingdom entities financed from commitment appropriations of the year in question and the corresponding operational contribution paid by the United Kingdom as adjusted pursuant to Article 714(8), excluding support expenditure, covering the same period if that amount is positive.\n3.   Any amount referred to in paragraph 2 of this Article, which for each of two consecutive years exceeds 8 % of the corresponding contribution of the United Kingdom to the programme as adjusted pursuant to Article 714(8) shall be due by the United Kingdom as an additional contribution under the automatic correction mechanism for each of those two years.\n4.   Detailed rules on the establishment of the relevant amounts of the legal commitments referred to in paragraph 2 of this Article, including in the case of consortia, and on the calculation of the automatic correction may be laid down in Protocol I.\nArticle 717\nFinancing in relation to programmes implemented through financial instruments or budgetary guarantees\n1.

The amount contributed in cash shall increase the Union budgetary guarantee or the financial envelope of the financial instrument.\n2.   Where the United Kingdom participates in a programme referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article that is implemented by the European Investment Bank Group, if the European Investment Bank Group needs to cover losses that are not covered by the guarantee provided by the Union budget, the United Kingdom shall pay to the European Investment Bank Group a percentage of those losses equal to the ratio of the Gross Domestic Product at market prices of the United Kingdom to the sum of the Gross Domestic Product at market prices of the Member States, the United Kingdom and any other third country participating in that programme. The Gross Domestic Product at market prices to be applied shall be the latest available as of 1 January of the year in which the payment is due as provided by EUROSTAT, as soon as the arrangement referred to in Article 730 applies and according to the rules of this arrangement. Before this arrangement applies, the GDP of the United Kingdom shall be the one established on the basis of data provided by the OECD.\n3.   Where appropriate, modalities for the implementation of this Article, in particular ensuring that the United Kingdom receives its share of unused contributions to budgetary guarantees and financial instruments, shall be specified further in Protocol I.\nSECTION 3\nSUSPENSION AND TERMINATION OF THE PARTICIPATION IN UNION PROGRAMMES\nArticle 718\nSuspension of the participation of the United Kingdom in a Union programme by the Union\n1.   The Union may unilaterally suspend the application of Protocol I, in relation to one or more Union programmes, activities, or exceptionally parts thereof in accordance with this Article, if the United Kingdom does not pay its financial contribution in accordance with Section 2 of this Chapter or if the United Kingdom introduces significant changes to one of the following conditions that existed when the United Kingdom participation in a programme, an activity or exceptionally part thereof was agreed and included in Protocol I, and if such changes have a significant impact on their implementation:\n(a)\nthe conditions for entry and residence in the United Kingdom of the persons that are involved in the implementation of these programmes and activities, or parts thereof, including students, researchers, trainees or volunteers are changed. This shall apply, in particular, if the United Kingdom introduces a change in its domestic laws for the conditions for entry and residence in the United Kingdom for these persons, which discriminates between Member States;\n(b)\nthere is a change in financial charges, including fees, that apply to persons referred in point (a) in order to perform the activities that they have to perform in order to implement the programme;\n(c)\nthe conditions referred to in Article 712(3) are changed.\n2.   The Union shall notify the Specialised Committee on Participation in Union Programmes of its intention to suspend the participation of the United Kingdom in the programme or activity concerned. The Union shall identify the scope of the suspension and provide due justification. Unless the Union withdraws its notification, the suspension shall take effect 45 days following the date of notification by the Union. The date on which the suspension takes effect shall constitute the suspension reference date for the purposes of this Article.\nPrior to notification and suspension, and during the suspension period, the Specialised Committee on Participation in Union Programmes may discuss appropriate measures for avoiding or lifting the suspension. In case the Specialised Committee on Participation in Union Programmes finds an agreement for avoiding the suspension within the period referred to in the first subparagraph, the suspension shall not take effect.\nIn any case, the Specialised Committee on Participation in Union Programmes shall meet during the period of 45 days to discuss the matter.\n3.   As of the suspension reference date the United Kingdom shall not be treated as a country participating in the Union programme, activity, or part thereof concerned by the suspension and in particular, the United Kingdom or United Kingdom entities shall no longer be eligible under the conditions laid down in Article 711 and Protocol I, with regard to Union award procedures which have not been completed yet on that date. An award procedure shall be considered completed when legal commitments have been entered into as a result of that procedure.\n4.   The suspension shall not affect legal commitments entered into before the suspension reference date. This Agreement shall continue to apply to such legal commitments.\n5.   The United Kingdom shall notify the Union as soon as it considers that compliance with the conditions for participation has been restored, and shall provide the Union with any relevant evidence to that effect.\nWithin 30 days from that notification the Union shall assess the matter and may, for that purpose, request the United Kingdom to present additional evidence. The time needed to provide such additional evidence shall not be taken into account in the overall period for assessment.\nWhere the Union has found that compliance with the conditions for participation is restored, it shall notify without undue delay the Specialised Committee on Participation in Union Programmes that the suspension is lifted. The lifting shall take effect on the day following the date of notification.\nWhere the Union has found that compliance with the conditions for participation is not restored, the suspension shall remain in force.\n6.   The United Kingdom shall be treated again as a country participating in the Union programme or activity concerned, and in particular United Kingdom and United Kingdom entities shall be again eligible under the conditions laid down in Article 711 and Protocol I, with regard to Union award procedures under that Union programme or activity which were launched after the date on which the lifting of the suspension takes effect, or which were launched before that date, and for which the deadline for the submission of applications has not expired.\n7.   In case of the United Kingdom participation in a programme, activity, or part thereof being suspended, the financial contribution of the United Kingdom that is due during the period of suspension shall be established as follows:\n(a)\nthe Union shall recalculate the operational contribution using the procedure described in point (a)(iii) of the fifth subparagraph of Article 714(8);\n(b)\nthe participation fee shall be adjusted in line with the adjustment of the operational contribution.\nArticle 719\nTermination of the participation of the United Kingdom in a Union programme by the Union\n1.   If, by one year after the reference date referred to in Article 718(2) the Union has not lifted the suspension under Article 718, the Union shall either:\n(a)\nreassess the conditions under which it may offer to allow the United Kingdom to continue participating in the Union programmes, activities or parts thereof concerned and shall propose those conditions to the Specialised Committee on Participation in Union Programmes within 45 days from expiry of the one year suspension period with a view to modifying Protocol I. In the absence of an agreement on those measures by the Specialised Committee within a further period of 45 days, termination shall take effect as referred to in point (b) of this paragraph; or\n(b)\nterminate unilaterally the application of Protocol I, in relation to the Union programmes, activities or parts thereof concerned, in accordance with this Article, taking into account the impact of the change referred to in Article 718 on the implementation of the programme or activity or exceptionally parts thereof, or the amount of the unpaid contribution.\n2.   The Union shall notify the Specialised Committee on Participation in Union Programmes of its intention to terminate the participation of the United Kingdom in one or more Union programmes or activities pursuant to point (b) of paragraph 1. The Union shall identify the scope of the termination and provide due justification. Unless the Union withdraws its notification, the termination shall take effect 45 days following the date of notification by the Union. The date on which the termination takes effect shall constitute the termination reference date for the purposes of this Article.\n3.   As of the termination reference date the United Kingdom shall not be treated as a country participating in the Union programme or activity concerned by the termination, and in particular the United Kingdom or United Kingdom entities shall no longer be eligible under the conditions laid down in Article 711 and in Protocol I, with regard to Union award procedures which have not been completed yet as of that date. An award procedure shall be considered to have been completed if legal commitments have been entered into as a result of that procedure.\n4.   The termination shall not affect legal commitments entered into before the suspension reference date referred to in Article 718(2). This Agreement shall continue to apply to such legal commitments.\n5.   Where the application of Protocol I, or a part thereof, is terminated in respect of the programmes or activities or exceptionally parts thereof concerned:\n(a)\nthe operational contribution covering support expenditure related to legal commitments already entered into shall continue to be due until the completion of those legal commitments or the end of the multiannual financial framework under which the legal commitment has been financed;\n(b)\nno contribution except the one referred to in point (a) shall be made in the following years.\nArticle 720\nTermination of the participation in a programme or activity in the case of substantial modification to Union programmes\n1.   The United Kingdom may unilaterally terminate its participation in a Union programme or activity or part thereof referred to in Protocol I where:\n(a)\nthe basic act of that Union programme or activity is amended to an extent that the conditions for participation of the United Kingdom or of United Kingdom entities in that Union programme or activity have been substantially modified, in particular, as a result of a change of the objectives of the programme or activity and of the corresponding actions; or\n(b)\nthe total amount of commitment appropriations as referred to in Article 714 is increased by more than 15 % compared with the initial financial envelope of that programme or activity or part thereof in which the United Kingdom participates and either the corresponding ceiling of the multiannual financial framework has been increased or the amount of external revenue referred to in Article 714(5) for the whole period of participation has been increased; or\n(c)\nthe United Kingdom or United Kingdom entities are excluded from participation in part of a programme or activity on duly justified grounds, and that exclusion concerns commitment appropriations exceeding 10 % of the commitment appropriations in the Union budget definitively adopted for a year N for that programme or activity.\n2.   To this effect, the United Kingdom shall notify its intention to terminate Protocol I in relation to the Union programme or activity concerned, to the Specialised Committee on Participation in Union Programmes at the latest 60 days after the publication of the amendment or of the adopted annual budget or an amendment to it in the Official Journal of the European Union. The United Kingdom shall explain the reasons for which the United Kingdom considers the amendment to substantially alter the conditions of participation. The Specialised Committee on Participation in Union Programmes shall meet within 45 days of receiving the notification to discuss the matter.\n3.   Unless the United Kingdom withdraws its notification, the termination shall take effect 45 days following the date of notification by the United Kingdom. The date on which the termination takes effect shall constitute the reference date for the purposes of this Article.\n4.   As of the reference date the United Kingdom shall not be treated as a country participating in the Union programme or activity concerned by the termination, and in particular the United Kingdom or United Kingdom entities shall no longer be eligible under the conditions laid down in Article 711 and in Protocol I, with regard to Union award procedures which have not been completed yet as of that date. An award procedure shall be considered to have been completed if legal commitments have been entered into as a result of that procedure.\n5.   The termination shall not affect legal commitments entered into before the reference date. This Agreement shall continue to apply to such legal commitments.\n6.   In case of termination under this Article in respect of the programmes or activities concerned:\n(a)\nthe operational contribution covering support expenditure related to legal commitments already entered into shall continue to be due until the completion of those legal commitments or the end of the multiannual financial framework under which the legal commitment has been financed;\n(b)\nthe Union shall recalculate the operational contribution of the year where termination occurs using the procedure described in point (a)(iii) of the fifth subparagraph of Article 714(8). No contribution except the one referred to in point (a) of this Article shall be made in the following years;\n(c)\nthe participation fee shall be adjusted in line with the adjustment of the operational contribution.\nSECTION 4\nREVIEW OF PERFORMANCE AND FINANCIAL INCREASES\nArticle 721\nPerformance review\n1.   A performance review procedure shall apply in accordance with the conditions laid down in this Article in relation to parts of the Union programme or activity to which the correction mechanism referred to in Article 716 applies.\n2.   The United Kingdom may request the Specialised Committee on Participation in Union Programmes to start the performance review procedure where the amount calculated in accordance with the method laid down in Article 716(2) is negative, and where that amount is higher than 12 % of the corresponding contributions of the United Kingdom to the programme or activity as adjusted pursuant to Article 714(8).\n3.   The Specialised Committee on Participation in Union Programmes, within a period of three months from the date of the request referred to in paragraph 2, shall analyse the relevant performance-related data and adopt a report proposing appropriate measures to address performance related issues.\nThe measures referred to in the first subparagraph shall be applied for a period of twelve months after the adoption of the report. Following the application of the measures, performance data over the period in question shall be used to calculate the difference between the initial amounts due under the legal commitments actually entered into with the United Kingdom or United Kingdom entities during that calendar year and the corresponding operational contribution paid by the United Kingdom for the same year.\nIf the difference referred to in the second subparagraph is negative and exceeds 16 % of the corresponding operational contribution, the United Kingdom may:\n(a)\nnotify its intention to terminate its participation in the Union programme or part of a programme concerned by giving notice 45 days before the intended day of termination, and may terminate its participation in accordance with Article 720(3) to (6); or\n(b)\nrequest the Specialised Committee on Participation in Union Programmes to adopt further measures to address underperformance, including by making adaptations to the participation of the United Kingdom in the Union programme concerned and adjusting future financial contributions of the United Kingdom in respect of that programme.\nArticle 722\nFinancial increases review\n1.   The United Kingdom may notify the Specialised Committee on Participation in Union Programmes that it objects to the amount of its contribution to a Union programme or activity if the total amount of commitment appropriations as referred to in Article 714 is increased by more than 5 % compared with the initial financial envelope for that Union programme or activity and either the corresponding ceiling has been increased or the amount of external revenue referred to in Article 714(5) for the whole period of participation has been increased.\n2.   The notification referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article shall be made within 60 days as of the publication date of the adopted annual budget or an amendment to it in the Official Journal of the European Union. The notification shall be without prejudice to the obligation of the United Kingdom to pay its contribution and to the application of the adjustment mechanism referred to in Article 714(8).\n3.   The Specialised Committee on Participation in Union Programmes shall prepare a report, propose and decide on the adoption of appropriate measures within three months from the date of the notification referred to in paragraph 2 of this Article. Those measures may include limiting the participation of the United Kingdom and United Kingdom entities to certain types of actions or award procedures or, where appropriate, a modification of Protocol I. The limitation of the United Kingdom's participation will be treated as an exclusion for the purposes of the adjustment mechanism referred to in Article 714(8).\n4.   Where the conditions referred to in point (b) of Article 720(1) are fulfilled, the United Kingdom may terminate its participation in a Union programme or activity referred to in Protocol I in accordance with Article 720(2) to (6).\nCHAPTER 2\nSOUND FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT\nArticle 723\nScope\nThis Chapter shall apply in relation to the Union programmes, activities and services under Union programmes referred to in Protocol I and Protocol II on access of the United Kingdom to services established under certain Union programmes and activities in which the United Kingdom does not participate (Protocol II).\nSECTION 1\nPROTECTION OF FINANCIAL INTERESTS AND RECOVERY\nArticle 724\nConduct of activity for the purposes of sound financial management\nFor the purposes of the application of this Chapter, the authorities of the United Kingdom and of the Union referred to in this Chapter shall cooperate closely in accordance with their respective laws and regulations.\nWhen exercising their duties in the territory of the United Kingdom, the agents and investigative bodies of the Union shall act in a manner consistent with United Kingdom law.\nArticle 725\nReviews and audits\n1.

If a Party (the \"complaining Party\") considers that the other Party (the \"respondent Party\") has breached an obligation under this Agreement or under any supplementing agreement, the Parties shall endeavour to resolve the matter by entering into consultations in good faith, with the aim of reaching a mutually agreed solution.\n2.   The complaining Party may seek consultations by means of a written request delivered to the respondent Party. The complaining Party shall specify in its written request the reasons for the request, including the identification of the measures at issue and the legal basis for the request, and the covered provisions it considers applicable.\n3.   The respondent Party shall reply to the request promptly, and in any case no later than 10 days after the date of its delivery. Consultations shall be held within 30 days of the date of delivery of the request in person or by any other means of communication agreed by the Parties. If held in person, consultations shall take place in the territory of the respondent Party, unless the Parties agree otherwise.\n4.   The consultations shall be deemed concluded within 30 days of the date of delivery of the request, unless the Parties agree to continue consultations.\n5.

The consultations shall be deemed concluded within those 20 days unless the Parties agree to continue consultations.\n6.   Each Party shall provide sufficient factual information to allow a complete examination of the measure at issue, including an examination of how that measure could affect the application of this Agreement or any supplementing agreement. Each Party shall endeavour to ensure the participation of personnel of their competent authorities who have expertise in the matter subject to the consultations.\n7.   For any dispute concerning an area other than Titles I to VII, Chapter 4 of Title VIII, Titles IX to XII of Heading One or Heading Six of Part Two, at the request of the complaining Party, the consultations referred to in paragraph 3 of this Article shall be held in the framework of a Specialised Committee or of the Partnership Council. The Specialised Committee may at any time decide to refer the matter to the Partnership Council. The Partnership Council may also seize itself of the matter.

The venue of meetings shall be governed by the rules of procedure of the Specialised Committee or, as the case may be, the Partnership Council.\n8.   Consultations, and in particular all information designated as confidential and positions taken by the Parties during consultations, shall be confidential, and shall be without prejudice to the rights of either Party in any further proceedings.\nArticle 739\nArbitration procedure\n1.

An arbitration tribunal shall be composed of three arbitrators.\n2.   No later than 10 days after the date of delivery of the request for the establishment of an arbitration tribunal, the Parties shall consult with a view to agreeing on the composition of the arbitration tribunal.\n3.

If a Party fails to appoint an arbitrator from its sub-list within that time period, the co-chair of the Partnership Council from the complaining Party shall select, no later than five days after the expiry of that time period, an arbitrator by lot from the sub-list of the Party that has failed to appoint an arbitrator. The co-chair of the Partnership Council from the complaining Party may delegate such selection by lot of the arbitrator.\n4.   If the Parties do not agree on the chairperson of the arbitration tribunal within the time period provided for in paragraph 2 of this Article, the co-chair of the Partnership Council from the complaining Party shall select, no later than five days after the expiry of that time period, the chairperson of the arbitration tribunal by lot from the sub-list of chairpersons established pursuant to Article 752. The co-chair of the Partnership Council from the complaining Party may delegate such selection by lot of the chairperson of the arbitration tribunal.\n5.   Should any of the lists provided for in Article 752 not be established or not contain sufficient names at the time a selection is made pursuant to paragraph 3 or 4 of this Article, the arbitrators shall be selected by lot from the individuals who have been formally proposed by one Party or both Parties in accordance with Annex 48.\n6.   The date of establishment of the arbitration tribunal shall be the date on which the last of the three arbitrators has notified to the Parties the acceptance of his or her appointment in accordance with Annex 48.\nArticle 741\nRequirements for arbitrators\n1.   All arbitrators shall:\n(a)\nhave demonstrated expertise in law and international trade, including on specific matters covered by Titles I to VII, Chapter 4 of Title VIII, Titles IX to XII of Heading One of Part Two or Heading Six of Part Two, or in law and any other matter covered by this Agreement or by any supplementing agreement and, in the case of a chairperson, also have experience in dispute settlement procedures;\n(b)\nnot be affiliated with or take instructions from either Party;\n(c)\nserve in their individual capacities and not take instructions from any organisation or government with regard to matters related to the dispute; and\n(d)\ncomply with Annex 49.\n2.

The arbitration tribunal shall deliver an interim report to the Parties within 100 days after the date of establishment of the arbitration tribunal. If the arbitration tribunal considers that this deadline cannot be met, the chairperson of the arbitration tribunal shall notify the Parties in writing, stating the reasons for the delay and the date on which the arbitration tribunal plans to deliver its interim report. The arbitration tribunal shall not deliver its interim report later than 130 days after the date of establishment of the arbitration tribunal under any circumstances.\n2.   Each Party may deliver to the arbitration tribunal a written request to review precise aspects of the interim report within 14 days of its delivery. A Party may comment on the other Party's request within six days of the delivery of the request.\n3.   If no written request to review precise aspects of the interim report is delivered within the time period referred to in paragraph 2, the interim report shall become the ruling of the arbitration tribunal.\n4.   The arbitration tribunal shall deliver its ruling to the Parties within 130 days of the date of establishment of the arbitration tribunal. When the arbitration tribunal considers that that deadline cannot be met, its chairperson shall notify the Parties in writing, stating the reasons for the delay and the date on which the arbitration tribunal plans to deliver its ruling. The arbitration tribunal shall not deliver its ruling later than 160 days after the date of establishment of the arbitration tribunal under any circumstances.\n5.   The ruling shall include a discussion of any written request by the Parties on the interim report and clearly address the comments of the Parties.\n6.   For greater certainty, a \"ruling\" or \"rulings\" as referred to in Articles 742, 743 and 753 and Article 754(1), (3), (4) and (6) shall be understood to refer also to the interim report of the arbitration tribunal.\nCHAPTER 3\nCOMPLIANCE\nArticle 746\nCompliance measures\n1.   If, in its ruling referred to in Article 745(4), the arbitration tribunal finds that the respondent Party has breached an obligation under this Agreement or under any supplementing agreement, that Party shall take the necessary measures to comply immediately with the ruling of the arbitration tribunal in order to bring itself in compliance with the covered provisions.\n2.   The respondent Party, no later than 30 days after delivery of the ruling, shall deliver a notification to the complaining Party of the measures which it has taken or which it envisages to take in order to comply.\nArticle 747\nReasonable Period of Time\n1.   If immediate compliance is not possible, the respondent Party, no later than 30 days after delivery of the ruling referred to in Article 745(4), shall deliver a notification to the complaining Party of the length of the reasonable period of time it will require for compliance with the ruling referred to in Article 745(4). The Parties shall endeavour to agree on the length of the reasonable period of time to comply.\n2.   If the Parties have not agreed on the length of the reasonable period of time, the complaining Party may, at the earliest 20 days after the delivery of the notification referred to in paragraph 1, request in writing that the original arbitration tribunal determines the length of the reasonable period of time. The arbitration tribunal shall deliver its decision to the Parties within 20 days of the date of delivery of the request.\n3.   The respondent Party shall deliver a written notification of its progress in complying with the ruling referred to in Article 745(4) to the complaining Party at least one month before the expiry of the reasonable period of time.\n4.   The Parties may agree to extend the reasonable period of time.\nArticle 748\nCompliance Review\n1.   The respondent Party shall, no later than the date of expiry of the reasonable period of time, deliver a notification to the complaining Party of any measure that it has taken to comply with the ruling referred to in Article 745(4).\n2.   When the Parties disagree on the existence of, or the consistency with the covered provisions of, any measure taken to comply, the complaining Party may deliver a request, which shall be in writing, to the original arbitration tribunal to decide on the matter. The request shall identify any measure at issue and explain how that measure constitutes a breach of the covered provisions in a manner sufficient to present the legal basis for the complaint clearly. The arbitration tribunal shall deliver its decision to the Parties within 45 days of the date of delivery of the request.\nArticle 749\nTemporary Remedies\n1.   The respondent Party shall, at the request of and after consultations with the complaining Party, present an offer for temporary compensation if:\n(a)\nthe respondent Party delivers a notification to the complaining Party that it is not possible to comply with the ruling referred to in Article 745(4); or\n(b)\nthe respondent Party fails to deliver a notification of any measure taken to comply within the deadline referred to in Article 746 or before the date of expiry of the reasonable period of time; or\n(c)\nthe arbitration tribunal finds that no measure taken to comply exists or that the measure taken to comply is inconsistent with the covered provisions.\n2.   In any of the conditions referred to in points (a), (b) and (c) of paragraph 1, the complaining Party may deliver a written notification to the respondent Party that it intends to suspend the application of obligations under the covered provisions if:\n(a)\nthe complaining Party decides not to make a request under paragraph 1; or\n(b)\nthe Parties do not agree on the temporary compensation within 20 days after the expiry of the reasonable period of time or the delivery of the arbitration tribunal decision under Article 748 if a request under paragraph 1 of this Article is made.\nThe notification shall specify the level of intended suspension of obligations.\n3.   Suspension of obligations shall be subject to the following conditions:\n(a)\nobligations under Heading Four of Part Two, the Protocol on Social Security Coordination or its annexes or Part Five may not be suspended under this Article;\n(b)\nby way of derogation from point (a), obligations under Part Five may be suspended only where the ruling referred to in Article 745(4) concerns the interpretation and implementation of Part Five;\n(c)\nobligations outside Part Five may not be suspended where the ruling referred to in Article 745(4) concerns the interpretation and implementation of Part Five; and\n(d)\nobligations under Title II of Heading One of Part Two in respect of financial services may not be suspended under this Article, unless the ruling referred to in Article 745(4) concerns the interpretation and application of obligations under Title II of Heading One of Part two in respect of financial services.\n4.   Where a Party persists in not complying with a ruling of an arbitration panel established under an earlier agreement concluded between the Parties, the other Party may suspend obligations under the covered provisions referred to in Article 735. With the exception of the rule in point (a) of paragraph 3 of this Article, all rules relating to temporary remedies in case of non-compliance and to review of any such measures shall be governed by the earlier agreement.\n5.   The suspension of obligations shall not exceed the level equivalent to the nullification or impairment caused by the violation.\n6.   If the arbitration tribunal has found the violation in Heading One or Heading Three of Part Two, the suspension may be applied in another Title of the same Heading as that in which the tribunal has found the violation, in particular if the complaining party is of the view that such suspension is effective in inducing compliance.\n7.   If the arbitration tribunal has found the violation in Heading Two of Part Two:\n(a)\nthe complaining party should first seek to suspend obligations in the same Title as that in which the arbitration tribunal has found the violation;\n(b)\nif the complaining party considers that it is not practicable or effective to suspend obligations with respect to the same Title as that in which the tribunal has found the violation, it may seek to suspend obligations in the other Title under the same Heading.\n8.   If the arbitration tribunal has found the violation in Heading One, Heading Two, Heading Three or Heading Five of Part Two, and if the complaining party considers that it is not practicable or effective to suspend obligations within the same Heading as that in which the arbitration tribunal has found the violation, and that the circumstances are serious enough, it may seek to suspend obligations under other covered provisions.\n9.   In the case of point (b) of paragraph 7 and paragraph 8, the complaining Party shall state the reasons for its decision.\n10.   The complaining Party may suspend the obligations 10 days after the date of delivery of the notification referred to in paragraph 2 unless the respondent Party made a request under paragraph 11.\n11.   If the respondent Party considers that the notified level of suspension of obligations exceeds the level equivalent to the nullification or impairment caused by the violation or that the principles and procedures set forth in point (b) of paragraph 7, paragraph 8 or paragraph 9 have not been followed, it may deliver a written request to the original arbitration tribunal before the expiry of the 10 day period set out in paragraph 10 to decide on the matter. The arbitration tribunal shall deliver its decision on the level of the suspension of obligations to the Parties within 30 days of the date of the request. Obligations shall not be suspended until the arbitration tribunal has delivered its decision. The suspension of obligations shall be consistent with that decision.\n12.   The arbitration tribunal acting pursuant to paragraph 11 shall not examine the nature of the obligations to be suspended but shall determine whether the level of such suspension exceeds the level equivalent to the nullification or impairment caused by the violation. However, if the matter referred to arbitration includes a claim that the principles and procedures set forth in point (b) of paragraph 7, paragraph 8 or paragraph 9 have not been followed, the arbitration tribunal shall examine that claim. In the event the arbitration tribunal determines that those principles and procedures have not been followed, the complaining party shall apply them consistently with point (b) of paragraph 7, paragraph 8 and paragraph 9. The parties shall accept the arbitration tribunal's decision as final and shall not seek a second arbitration procedure. This paragraph shall under no circumstances delay the date as of which the complaining Party is entitled to suspend obligations under this Article.\n13.   The suspension of obligations or the compensation referred to in this Article shall be temporary and shall not be applied after:\n(a)\nthe Parties have reached a mutually agreed solution pursuant to Article 756;\n(b)\nthe Parties have agreed that the measure taken to comply brings the respondent Party into compliance with the covered provisions; or\n(c)\nany measure taken to comply which the arbitration tribunal has found to be inconsistent with the covered provisions has been withdrawn or amended so as to bring the respondent Party into compliance with those covered provisions.\nArticle 750\nReview of any measure taken to comply after the adoption of temporary remedies\n1.   The respondent Party shall deliver a notification to the complaining Party of any measure it has taken to comply following the suspension of obligations or following the application of temporary compensation, as the case may be. With the exception of cases under paragraph 2, the complaining Party shall terminate the suspension of obligations within 30 days from the delivery of the notification. In cases where compensation has been applied, with the exception of cases under paragraph 2, the respondent Party may terminate the application of such compensation within 30 days from the delivery of its notification that it has complied.\n2.   If the Parties do not reach an agreement on whether the notified measure brings the respondent Party into compliance with the covered provisions within 30 days of the date of delivery of the notification, the complaining Party shall deliver a written request to the original arbitration tribunal to decide on the matter. The arbitration tribunal shall deliver its decision to the Parties within 46 days of the date of the delivery of the request. If the arbitration tribunal finds that the measure taken to comply is in conformity with the covered provisions, the suspension of obligations or compensation, as the case may be, shall be terminated. When relevant, the level of suspension of obligations or of compensation shall be adjusted in light of the arbitration tribunal decision.\nCHAPTER 4\nCOMMON PROCEDURAL PROVISIONS\nArticle 751\nReceipt of information\n1.

They shall not create any rights or obligations with respect to natural or legal persons.\n3.   Decisions and rulings of the arbitration tribunal cannot add to or diminish the rights and obligations of the Parties under this Agreement or under any supplementing agreement.\n4.   For greater certainty, the arbitration tribunal shall have no jurisdiction to determine the legality of a measure alleged to constitute a breach of this Agreement or of any supplementing agreement, under the domestic law of a Party. No finding made by the arbitration tribunal when ruling on a dispute between the Parties shall bind the domestic courts or tribunals of either Party as to the meaning to be given to the domestic law of that Party.\n5.   For greater certainty, the courts of each Party shall have no jurisdiction in the resolution of disputes between the Parties under this Agreement.\n6.   Each Party shall make the rulings and decisions of the arbitration tribunal publicly available, subject to the protection of confidential information.\n7.   The information submitted by the Parties to the arbitration tribunal shall be treated in accordance with the confidentiality rules laid down in Annex 48.\nArticle 755\nSuspension and termination of the arbitration proceedings\nAt the request of both Parties, the arbitration tribunal shall suspend its work at any time for a period agreed by the Parties and not exceeding 12 consecutive months. The arbitration tribunal shall resume its work before the end of the suspension period at the written request of both Parties, or at the end of the suspension period at the written request of either Party. The requesting Party shall deliver a notification to the other Party accordingly.

In the event of a suspension of the work of the arbitration tribunal, the relevant time periods shall be extended by the same time period for which the work of the arbitration tribunal was suspended.\nArticle 756\nMutually agreed solution\n1.   The Parties may at any time reach a mutually agreed solution with respect to any dispute referred to in Article 735.\n2.

By way of derogation from Article 740 and Annex 48, if the Parties do not agree on the composition of the arbitration tribunal within two days, the co-chair of the Partnership Council from the complaining Party shall select, no later than one day after the expiry of the two-day time period, an arbitrator by lot from the sub-list of each Party and the chairperson of the arbitration tribunal by lot from the sub-list of chairpersons established pursuant to Article 752.

The level of suspension of obligations shall not exceed the level equivalent to the nullification or impairment of benefits under this Agreement or under a supplementing agreement that is directly caused by the remedial or compensatory measures from the date the remedial or compensatory measures enter into effect until the date of the delivery of the arbitration ruling.\n2.   The level of suspension of obligations requested by the complaining Party and the determination of the level of suspension of obligations by the arbitration tribunal shall be based on facts demonstrating that the nullification or impairment arises directly from the application of the remedial or compensatory measure and affects specific goods, service suppliers, investors or other economic actors and not merely on allegation, conjecture or remote possibility.\n3.   The level of nullified or impaired benefits requested by the complaining Party or determined by the arbitration tribunal:\n(a)\nshall not include punitive damages, interest or hypothetical losses of profits or business opportunities;\n(b)\nshall be reduced by any prior refunds of duties, indemnification of damages or other forms of compensation already received by the concerned operators or the concerned Party; and\n(c)\nshall not include the contribution to the nullification or impairment by wilful or negligent action or omission of the concerned Party or any person or entity in relation to whom remedies are sought pursuant to the intended suspension of obligations.\nArticle 762\nConditions for rebalancing, remedial, compensatory and safeguard measures\nWhere a Party takes a measure under Article 374, Article 411, Article 469, Article 501, Article 506 or Article 773, that measure shall only be applied in respect of covered provisions within the meaning of Article 735 and shall comply, mutatis mutandis, with the conditions set out in Article 749(3).\nTITLE II\nBASIS FOR COOPERATION\nArticle 763\nDemocracy, rule of law and human rights\n1.   The Parties shall continue to uphold the shared values and principles of democracy, the rule of law, and respect for human rights, which underpin their domestic and international policies. In that regard, the Parties reaffirm their respect for the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the international human rights treaties to which they are parties.\n2.   The Parties shall promote such shared values and principles in international forums. The Parties shall cooperate in promoting those values and principles, including with or in third countries.\nArticle 764\nFight against climate change\n1.   The Parties consider that climate change represents an existential threat to humanity and reiterate their commitment to strengthening the global response to this threat. The fight against human-caused climate change as elaborated in the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (\"UNFCCC\") process, and in particular in the Paris Agreement adopted by the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change at its 21st session (the \"Paris Agreement\"), inspires the domestic and external policies of the Union and the United Kingdom. Accordingly, each Party shall respect the Paris Agreement and the process set up by the UNFCCC and refrain from acts or omissions that would materially defeat the object and purpose of the Paris Agreement.\n2.   The Parties shall advocate the fight against climate change in international forums, including by engaging with other countries and regions to increase their level of ambition in the reduction of greenhouse emissions.\nArticle 765\nCountering proliferation of weapons of mass destruction\n1.   The Parties consider that the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction (\"WMD\") and their means of delivery, to both state and non-state actors, represents one of the most serious threats to international stability and security. The Parties therefore agree to cooperate and to contribute to countering the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery through full compliance with and national implementation of existing obligations under international disarmament and non-proliferation treaties and agreements and other relevant international obligations.\n2.   The Parties, furthermore, agree to cooperate on and to contribute to countering the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery by:\n(a)\ntaking steps to sign, ratify, or accede to, as appropriate, and fully implement all other relevant international instruments; and\n(b)\nestablishing an effective system of national export controls, controlling the export as well as transit of WMD-related goods, including a WMD end-use control on dual use technologies and containing effective sanctions for breaches of export controls.\n3.   The Parties agree to establish a regular dialogue on those matters.\nArticle 766\nSmall arms and light weapons and other conventional weapons\n1.   The Parties recognise that the illicit manufacture, transfer and circulation of small arms and light weapons (\"SALW\"), including their ammunition, their excessive accumulation, their poor management, inadequately secured stockpiles and their uncontrolled spread continue to pose a serious threat to peace and international security.\n2.   The Parties agree to observe and fully implement their respective obligations to deal with the illicit trade in SALW, including their ammunition, under existing international agreements and UN Security Council resolutions, as well as their respective commitments within the framework of other international instruments applicable in this area, such as the UN Programme of Action to prevent, combat and eradicate the illicit trade in SALW in all its aspects.\n3.   The Parties recognise the importance of domestic control systems for the transfer of conventional arms in line with existing international standards. The Parties recognise the importance of applying such controls in a responsible manner, as a contribution to international and regional peace, security and stability, and to the reduction of human suffering, as well as to the prevention of diversion of conventional weapons.\n4.   The Parties undertake, in that regard, to fully implement the Arms Trade Treaty and to cooperate with each other within the framework of that Treaty, including in promoting the universalisation and full implementation of that Treaty by all UN member states.\n5.   The Parties therefore undertake to cooperate in their efforts to regulate or improve the regulation of international trade in conventional arms and to prevent, combat and eradicate the illicit trade in arms.\n6.   The Parties agree to establish a regular dialogue on those matters.\nArticle 767\nThe most serious crimes of concern to the international community\n1.   The Parties reaffirm that the most serious crimes of concern to the international community as a whole must not go unpunished and that their effective prosecution must be ensured by taking measures at the national level and by enhancing international cooperation, including with the International Criminal Court. The Parties agree to fully support the universality and integrity of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court and related instruments.\n2.   The Parties agree to establish a regular dialogue on those matters.\nArticle 768\nCounter-terrorism\n1.   The Parties shall cooperate at the bilateral, regional and international levels to prevent and combat acts of terrorism in all its forms and manifestations in accordance with international law, including, where applicable, international counterterrorism-related agreements, international humanitarian law and international human rights law, as well as in accordance with the principles of the Charter of the United Nations.\n2.   The Parties shall enhance cooperation on counter-terrorism, including preventing and countering violent extremism and the financing of terrorism, with the aim of advancing their common security interests, taking into account, the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy and relevant United Nations Security Council resolutions, without prejudice to law enforcement and judicial cooperation in criminal matters and intelligence exchanges.\n3.   The Parties agree to establish a regular dialogue on those matters. This dialogue will, inter alia, aim to promote and facilitate:\n(a)\nthe sharing of assessments on the terrorist threat;\n(b)\nthe exchange of best practices and expertise on counter terrorism;\n(c)\noperational cooperation and exchange of information; and\n(d)\nexchanges on cooperation in the framework of multilateral organisations.\nArticle 769\nPersonal data protection\n1.   The Parties affirm their commitment to ensuring a high level of personal data protection. They shall endeavour to work together to promote high international standards.\n2.   The Parties recognise that individuals have a right to the protection of personal data and privacy and that high standards in this regard contribute to trust in the digital economy and to the development of trade, and are a key enabler for effective law enforcement cooperation. To that end, the Parties shall undertake to respect, each in the framework of their respective laws and regulations, the commitments they have made in this Agreement in connection with that right.\n3.   The Parties shall cooperate at bilateral and multilateral levels, while respecting their respective laws and regulations. Such cooperation may include dialogue, exchanges of expertise, and cooperation on enforcement, as appropriate, with respect to personal data protection.\n4.   Where this Agreement or any supplementing agreement provide for the transfer of personal data, such transfer shall take place in accordance with the transferring Party's rules on international transfers of personal data. For greater certainty, this paragraph is without prejudice to the application of any specific provisions in this Agreement relating to the transfer of personal data, in particular Article 202 and Article 525, and to Title I of Part Six. Where needed, each Party will make best efforts, while respecting its rules on international transfers of personal data, to establish safeguards necessary for the transfer of personal data, taking into account any recommendations of the Partnership Council under point (h) of Article 7(4).\nArticle 770\nGlobal cooperation on issues of shared economic, environmental and social interest\n1.   The Parties recognise the importance of global cooperation to address issues of shared economic, environmental and social interest. Where it is in their mutual interest, they shall promote multilateral solutions to common problems.\n2.   While preserving their decision-making autonomy, and without prejudice to other provisions of this Agreement or any supplementing agreement, the Parties shall endeavour to cooperate on current and emerging global issues of common interest such as peace and security, climate change, sustainable development, cross-border pollution, environmental protection, digitalisation, public health and consumer protection, taxation, financial stability, and free and fair trade and investment. To that end, they shall endeavour to maintain a constant and effective dialogue and to coordinate their positions in multilateral organisations and forums in which the Parties participate, such as the United Nations, the Group of Seven (G-7) and the Group of Twenty (G-20), the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and the World Trade Organization.\nArticle 771\nEssential elements\nArticle 763(1), Article 764(1) and Article 765(1) constitute essential elements of the partnership established by this Agreement and any supplementing agreement.\nTITLE III\nFULFILLMENT OF OBLIGATIONS AND SAFEGUARD MEASURES\nArticle 772\nFulfilment of obligations described as essential elements\n1.   If either Party considers that there has been a serious and substantial failure by the other Party to fulfil any of the obligations that are described as essential elements in Article 771, it may decide to terminate or suspend the operation of this Agreement or any supplementing agreement in whole or in part.\n2.   Before doing so, the Party invoking the application of this Article shall request that the Partnership Council meet immediately with a view to seeking a timely and mutually agreeable solution. If no mutually agreeable solution is found within 30 days from the date of the request to the Partnership Council, the Party may take the measures referred to in paragraph 1.\n3.   The measures referred to in paragraph 1 shall be in full respect of international law and shall be proportionate. Priority shall be given to the measures which least disturb the functioning of this Agreement and of any supplementing agreements.\n4.   The Parties consider that, for a situation to constitute a serious and substantial failure to fulfil any of the obligations described as essential elements in Article 771, its gravity and nature would have to be of an exceptional sort that threatens peace and security or that has international repercussions. For greater certainty, an act or omission which materially defeats the object and purpose of the Paris Agreement shall always be considered as a serious and substantial failure for the purposes of this Article.\nArticle 773\nSafeguard measures\n1.   If serious economic, societal or environmental difficulties of a sectorial or regional nature, including in relation to fishing activities and their dependent communities, that are liable to persist arise, the Party concerned may unilaterally take appropriate safeguard measures. Such safeguard measures shall be restricted with regard to their scope and duration to what is strictly necessary in order to remedy the situation. Priority shall be given to those measures which will least disturb the functioning of this Agreement.\n2.   The Party concerned shall, without delay, notify the other Party through the Partnership Council and shall provide all relevant information. The Parties shall immediately enter into consultations in the Partnership Council with a view to finding a mutually agreeable solution.\n3.   The Party concerned may not take safeguard measures until one month has elapsed after the date of notification referred to in paragraph 2, unless the consultation procedure pursuant to paragraph 2 has been jointly concluded before the expiration of the stated time limit. When exceptional circumstances requiring immediate action exclude prior examination, the Party concerned may apply forthwith the safeguard measures strictly necessary to remedy the situation.\nThe Party concerned shall, without delay, notify the measures taken to the Partnership Council and shall provide all relevant information.\n4.   If a safeguard measure taken by the Party concerned creates an imbalance between the rights and obligations under this Agreement or under any supplementing agreement, the other Party may take such proportionate rebalancing measures as are strictly necessary to remedy the imbalance. Priority shall be given to those measures which will least disturb the functioning of this Agreement. Paragraphs 2 to 4 shall apply mutatis mutandis to such rebalancing measures.\n5.   Either Party may, without having prior recourse to consultations pursuant to Article 738, initiate the arbitration procedure referred to in Article 739 to challenge a measure taken by the other Party in application of paragraphs 1 to 5 of this Article.\n6.   The safeguard measures referred to in paragraph 1 and the rebalancing measures referred to in paragraph 5 may also be taken in relation to a supplementing agreement, unless otherwise provided therein.\nPART SEVEN\nFINAL PROVISIONS\nArticle 774\nTerritorial scope\n1.

For the duration of the specified period, transmission of personal data from the Union to the United Kingdom shall not be considered as a transfer to a third country under Union law, provided that the data protection legislation of the United Kingdom on 31 December 2020, as it is saved and incorporated into United Kingdom law by the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 and as modified by the Data Protection, Privacy and Electronic Communications (Amendments etc) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (SI 2019/419) (88) (the \"applicable data protection regime\"), applies and provided that the United Kingdom does not exercise the designated powers without the agreement of the Union within the Partnership Council.\n2.   Subject to paragraphs 3 to 11, paragraph 1 shall also apply in respect of transfers of personal data from Iceland, the Principality of Liechtenstein and the Kingdom of Norway to the United Kingdom during the specified period made under Union law as applied in those states by the Agreement on the European Economic Area done at Porto on 2 May 1992, for so long as paragraph 1 applies to transfers of personal data from the Union to the United Kingdom, provided that those states notify both Parties in writing of their express acceptance to apply this provision.\n3.

The references to exercising the designated powers in paragraphs 1 and 5 do not include the exercise of such powers the effect of which is limited to alignment with the relevant Union data protection law.\n7.   Anything that would otherwise be an amendment to the applicable data protection regime which is:\n(a)\nmade with the agreement of the Union within the Partnership Council; or\n(b)\nlimited to alignment with the relevant Union data protection law;\nshall not be treated as an amendment to the applicable data protection regime for the purposes of paragraph 5 and instead should be treated as being part of the applicable data protection regime for the purposes of paragraph 1.\n8.

If no such meeting is requested, the Union is deemed to have given agreement to such exercise or amendment during the specified period.\n11.

and\n(d)\n\"subheading\" means the first six-digits in the tariff classification number under the Harmonised System.\n6.\nFor the purposes of the product-specific rules of origin, the following abbreviations apply:\n\"CC\" means production from non-originating materials of any Chapter, except that of the product; this means that any non-originating material used in the production of the product must be classified under a Chapter (2-digit level of the Harmonised System) other than that of the product (i.e. a change in Chapter);\n\"CTH\" means production from non-originating materials of any heading, except that of the product; this means that any non-originating material used in the production of the product must be classified under a heading (4-digit level of the Harmonised System) other than that of the product (i.e. a change in heading);\n\"CTSH\" means production from non-originating materials of any subheading, except that of the product; this means that any non-originating material used in the production of the product must be classified under a subheading (6-digit level of the Harmonised System) other than that of the product (i.e. a change in subheading).\nNOTE 3\nApplication of the product-specific rules of origin\n1.\nArticle 39 of this Agreement, concerning products having acquired originating status which are used in the production of other products, applies whether or not this status has been acquired inside the same factory in a Party where these products are used.\n2.\nIf a product-specific rule of origin specifically excludes certain non-originating material or provides that the value or weight of a specified non-originating material shall not exceed a specific threshold, these conditions do not apply to non-originating materials classified elsewhere in the Harmonised System.\nExample 1: when the rule for bulldozers (subheading 8429.11) requires: \"CTH except from non-originating materials of heading 84.31\", the use of non-originating materials classified elsewhere than 84.29 and 84.31- such as screws (HS heading 73.18), insulated wires and electric conductors (heading 85.44) and various electronics (Chapter 85) - is not limited.\nExample 2: When the rule for heading 35.05 (dextrins and other modified starches;

or\n(ii)\nif there is no price paid or payable or if the actual price paid does not reflect all costs related to the production of the product which are actually incurred in the production of the product, the value of all the materials used and all other costs incurred in the production of the product in the exporting Party:\n(A)\nincluding selling, general and administrative expenses, as well as profit, that can reasonably be allocated to the product; and\n(B)\nexcluding the cost of freight, insurance, all other costs incurred in transporting the product and any internal taxes of the exporting Party which are, or may be, repaid when the product obtained is exported;\n(iii)\nfor the purposes of point (i), where the last production has been contracted to a producer, the term \"producer\" in point (i) refers to the person who has employed the subcontractor.\n(c)\n\"MaxNOM\" means the maximum value of non-originating materials expressed as a percentage and shall be calculated according to the following formula:\n(d)\n\"VNM\" means the value of the non-originating materials used in the production of the product which is its customs value at the time of importation including freight, insurance if appropriate, packing and all other costs incurred in transporting the materials to the importation port in the Party where the producer of the product is located; where the value of the non-originating materials is not known and cannot be ascertained, the first ascertainable price paid for the non-originating materials in the Union or in the United Kingdom is used; the value of the non-originating materials used in the production of the product may be calculated on the basis of the weighted average value formula or other inventory valuation method under accounting principles which are generally accepted in the Party.\nNOTE 5\nDefinitions of processes referred to in Sections V to VII of Annex 3\nFor the purposes of product-specific rules of origin, the following definitions apply:\n(a)\n\"biotechnological processing\" means:\n(i)\nbiological or biotechnological culturing (including cell culture), hybridisation or genetic modification of micro-organisms (bacteria, viruses (including phages) etc.) or human, animal or plant cells;

and\n(ff)\nmetal fibres.\n2.\nWhere reference to this Note is made in Annex 3, the requirements set out in its Column 2 shall not apply, as a tolerance, to non-originating basic textile materials which are used in the production of a product, provided that:\n(a)\nthe product contains two or more basic textile materials; and\n(b)\nthe weight of the non-originating basic textile materials, taken together, does not exceed 10 % of the total weight of all the basic textile materials used.\nExample: For a woollen fabric of heading 51.12 containing woollen yarn of heading 51.07, synthetic yarn of staple fibres of heading 55.09 and materials other than basic textile materials, non-originating woollen yarn which does not satisfy the requirement set out in Annex 3, or non-originating synthetic yarn which does not satisfy the requirement set out in Annex 3, or a combination of both, may be used, provided that their total weight does not exceed 10 % of the weight of all the basic textile materials.\n3.\nNotwithstanding point (b) of paragraph 2, for products containing \"yarn made of polyurethane segmented with flexible segments of polyether, whether or not gimped\", the maximum tolerance is 20 %. However, the percentage of the other non-originating basic textile materials shall not exceed 10 %.\n4.\nNotwithstanding point (b) of paragraph 2, for products containing \"strip consisting of a core of aluminium foil or of a core of plastic film irrespective of whether or not coated with aluminium powder, of a width not exceeding 5 mm, sandwiched by means of a transparent or coloured adhesive between two layers of plastic film\", the maximum tolerance is 30 %. However, the percentage of the other non-originating basic textile materials shall not exceed 10 %.\nNOTE 8\nOther tolerances applicable to certain textile products\n1.\nWhere reference to this Note is made in Annex 3, non-originating textile materials (with the exception of linings and interlinings) which do not satisfy the requirements set out in its Column 2 for a made-up textile product may be used, provided that they are classified under a heading other than that of the product and that their value does not exceed 8 % of the EXW of the product.\n2.\nNon-originating materials which are not classified under Chapters 50 to 63 may be used without restriction in the production of textile products classified under Chapters 50 to 63, whether or not they contain textiles.\nExample: If a requirement set out in Annex 3 provides that yarn shall be used, for a certain textile item (such as trousers), this does not prevent the use of non-originating metal items (such as buttons), because metal items are not classified under Chapters 50 to 63. For the same reasons, it does not prevent the use of non-originating slide fasteners, even though slide-fasteners normally contain textiles.\n3.\nWhere a requirement set out in Annex 3 consists in a maximum value of non-originating materials, the value of the non-originating materials which are not classified under Chapters 50 to 63 shall be taken into account in the calculation of the value of the non-originating materials.\nNOTE 9\nAgricultural products\nAgricultural products classified under Section II of the Harmonised System and heading 24.01, which are grown or harvested in the territory of a Party, shall be treated as originating in the territory of that Party, even if grown from seeds, bulbs, rootstock, cuttings, slips, grafts, shoots, buds, or other live parts of plants imported from a third country.\nANNEX 3\nPRODUCT-SPECIFIC RULES OF ORIGIN\nColumn 1\nHarmonised System classification (2017) including specific description\nColumn 2\nProduct-specific rule of origin\nSECTION I\nLIVE ANIMALS;

to in paragraph 1, shall be made on the basis of available information about the markets within the Parties, such as the availability of sufficient and suitable originating materials, the balance between supply and demand and other relevant information.\n3.\nOn the basis of the results of the review carried out pursuant to paragraph 1, the Partnership Council may adopt a decision to amend the product-specific rules for heading 85.07 applicable as from 1 January 2027, contained in Annex 3.\nANNEX 6\nSUPPLIER’S DECLARATION\n1.\nA supplier’s declaration shall have the content set out in this Annex.\n2.\nExcept in the cases referred to in point 3, a supplier’s declaration shall be made out by the supplier for each consignment of products in the form provided for in Appendix 6-A and annexed to the invoice, or to any other document describing the products concerned in sufficient detail to enable them to be identified.\n3.\nWhere a supplier regularly supplies a particular customer with products for which the production carried out in a Party is expected to remain constant for a period of time, that supplier may provide a single supplier’s declaration to cover subsequent consignments of those products (the \"long-term supplier’s declaration\"). A long-term supplier’s declaration is normally valid for a period of up to two years from the date of making out the declaration. The customs authorities of the Party where the declaration is made out may lay down the conditions under which longer periods may be used. The long-term supplier’s declaration shall be made out by the supplier in the form provided for in Appendix 6-B and shall describe the products concerned in sufficient detail to enable them to be identified. The supplier shall inform the customer immediately if the long-term supplier’s declaration ceases to apply to the products supplied.\n4.\nThe supplier making out a declaration shall be prepared to submit at any time, at the request of the customs authorities of the Party where the declaration is made out, all appropriate documents proving that the information given on that declaration is correct.\nAppendix 6-A\nSUPPLIER'S DECLARATION\nThe supplier's declaration, the text of which is provided below, must be made out in accordance with the footnotes. However, the footnotes do not have to be reproduced.\nSUPPLIER'S DECLARATION\nI, the undersigned, the supplier of the products covered by the annexed document, declare that:\n1.\nThe following materials which do not originate in [indicate the name of the relevant Party] have been used in [indicate the name of the relevant Party] to produce these products:\nDescription of the products supplied(1)\nDescription of non-originating materials used\nHS heading of non-originating materials used(2)\nValue of non-originating materials used(2)(3)\nTotal value\n2.\nAll the other materials used in [indicate the name of the relevant Party] to produce those products originate in [indicate the name of the relevant Party]\nI undertake to make available any further supporting documents required.\n… (Place and Date)\n… (Name and position of the undersigned, name and address of company)\n… (Signature)(6)\nAppendix 6-B\nLONG-TERM SUPPLIER'S DECLARATION\nThe long-term supplier's declaration, the text of which is given below, must be made out in accordance with the footnotes. However, the footnotes do not have to be reproduced.\nLONG-TERM SUPPLIER'S DECLARATION\nI, the undersigned, the supplier of the products covered by the annexed document, which are regularly supplied to\n(4)\n …, declare that:\n1.\nThe following materials which do not originate in [indicate the name of the relevant Party] have been used in [indicate the name of the relevant Party] to produce these products:\nDescription of the products supplied(1)\nDescription of non-originating materials used\nHS heading of non-originating materials used(2)\nValue of non-originating materials used(2)(3)\nTotal value\n2.\nAll the other materials used in [indicate the name of the relevant Party] to produce those products originate in a Party [indicate the name of the relevant Party];\nThis declaration is valid for all subsequent consignments of these products dispatched\nfrom … to … (5)\nI undertake to inform … (4) immediately if this declaration ceases to be valid.\n… (Place and Date)\n…\n(Name and position of the undersigned, name and address of company)\n… (Signature)(6)\nFootnotes\n(1)\nWhere the invoice or other document to which the declaration is annexed relates to different kinds of products, or to products which do not incorporate non-originating materials to the same extent, the supplier must clearly differentiate them.\n(2)\nThe information requested does not have to be given unless it is necessary.\nExamples:\nOne of the rules for garments of Chapter 62 provides \"Weaving combined with making-up including cutting of fabric\". If a manufacturer of such garments in a Party uses fabric imported from the other Party which has been obtained there by weaving non-originating yarn, it is sufficient for the supplier in the latter Party to describe in his declaration the non-originating material used as yarn, without it being necessary to indicate the HS heading and the value of such yarn.\nA producer of wire of iron of HS heading 72.17 who has produced it from non-originating iron bars should indicate in the second column \"bars of iron\". Where that wire is to be used in the production of a machine for which the rule contains a limitation for all non-originating materials used to a certain percentage value, it is necessary to indicate in the third column the value of non-originating bars.\n(3)\n\"Value of non-originating materials used\" means the value of the non-originating materials used in the production of the product, which is its customs value at the time of importation, including freight, insurance if appropriate, packing and all other costs incurred in transporting the materials to the importation port in the Party where the producer of the product is located; where the value of the non-originating materials is not known and cannot be ascertained, the first ascertainable price paid for the non-originating materials in the Union or in the United Kingdom is used.\n(4)\nName and address of the customer\n(5)\nInsert dates\n(6)\nThis field may contain an electronic signature, a scanned image or other visual representation of the signer’s handwritten signature instead of original signatures, where appropriate.\nANNEX 7\nTEXT OF THE STATEMENT ON ORIGIN\nThe statement on origin referred to in Article 56 of this Agreement shall be made out using the text set out below in one of the following language versions and in accordance with the laws and regulations of the exporting Party.

Terms referred to in this Annex shall have the same meaning as they have in the 1958 Agreement or in Annex 1 to the TBT Agreement.\nArticle 2\nProduct scope\nThis Annex applies to the trade between the Parties of all categories of motor vehicles, equipment and parts thereof, as defined in Paragraph 1 of UNECE Consolidated Resolution on the Construction of Vehicles (R.E.3) (1), falling under, inter alia, Chapters 40, 84, 85, 87 and 94 of the HS 2017 (hereinafter referred to as \"products covered\").\nArticle 3\nObjectives\nWith regard to the products covered, the objectives of this Annex are to:\n(a)\neliminate and prevent any unnecessary technical barriers to bilateral trade;\n(b)\npromote the compatibility and convergence of regulations based on international standards;\n(c)\npromote the recognition of approvals based on approval schemes applied under the agreements administered by WP.29;\n(d)\nreinforce competitive market conditions based on principles of openness, non-discrimination and transparency;\n(e)\npromote high levels of protection of human health, safety and the environment; and\n(f)\nmaintain cooperation on issues of mutual interest to foster continued mutually beneficial development in trade.\nArticle 4\nRelevant international standards\nThe Parties recognise that the WP.29 is the relevant international standardising body and that UN Regulations and GTRs under the 1958 Agreement and 1998 Agreement are relevant international standards for the products covered by this Annex.\nArticle 5\nRegulatory convergence based on relevant international standards\n1.   The Parties shall refrain from introducing or maintaining any domestic technical regulation, marking, or conformity assessment procedure diverging from UN Regulations or GTRs in areas covered by such Regulations or GTRs, including where the relevant UN Regulations or GTRs have not been completed but their completion is imminent, unless there are substantiated reasons why a specific UN Regulation or GTR is an ineffective or inappropriate means for the fulfilment of legitimate objectives pursued, for example, in the areas of road safety or the protection of the environment or human health.\n2.   A Party which introduces a divergent domestic technical regulation, marking, or conformity assessment procedure as referred to in paragraph 1, at the request of the other Party, shall identify the parts of the domestic technical regulation, marking, or conformity assessment procedure which substantially diverge from the relevant UN Regulations or GTRs and provide justification for the divergence.\n3.   Each Party shall systematically consider applying UN Regulations adopted after the entry into force of this Agreement, and shall inform each other of any changes regarding the implementation of those UN Regulations in its respective domestic legal system following the protocol established under the 1958 Agreement and in line with Articles 8 and 9.\n4.   Insofar as a Party has introduced or maintains domestic technical regulations, markings or conformity assessment procedures that diverge from UN Regulations or GTRs as permitted by paragraph 1, that Party shall review those domestic technical regulations, markings or conformity assessment procedures at regular intervals, preferably not exceeding five years, with a view to increasing their convergence with the relevant UN Regulations or GTRs. When reviewing their domestic technical regulations, markings and conformity assessment procedures, each Party shall consider whether the justification for the divergence still exists. The outcome of these reviews, including any scientific and technical information used, shall be notified to the other Party upon request.\n5.   Each Party shall refrain from introducing or maintaining domestic technical regulations, markings, or conformity assessment procedures which have the effect of prohibiting, restricting or increasing the burden for the importation and putting into service on their domestic market of products type-approved under UN Regulations for the areas covered by those UN Regulations unless such domestic technical regulations, markings or conformity assessment procedures are explicitly provided for by those UN Regulations.\nArticle 6\nType approval and market surveillance\n1.   Each Party shall accept on its market products which are covered by a valid UN type-approval certificate as compliant with its domestic technical regulations, markings and conformity assessment procedures, without requiring any further testing or marking to verify or attest compliance with any requirement covered by the UN type-approval certificate concerned. In the case of vehicle approvals, the UN Universal International Whole Vehicle Type Approval (U-IWVTA) shall be considered valid in respect of the requirements covered by the U-IWVTA. UN type-approval certificates issued by a Party can only be considered valid if that Party has acceded to the relevant UN Regulations.\n2.   Each Party shall only be required to accept valid UN type-approval certificates issued pursuant to the latest version of the UN Regulations it has acceded to.\n3.   For the purpose of paragraph 1, the following shall be considered sufficient proof of the existence of a valid UN type-approval:\n(a)\nfor whole vehicles, a valid UN Declaration of Conformance certifying compliance with a U-IWVTA;\n(b)\nfor equipment and parts, a valid UN type-approval mark affixed to the product; or\n(c)\nfor equipment and parts to which a UN type-approval mark cannot be affixed, a valid UN type-approval certificate.\n4.   For the purpose of conducting market surveillance, the competent authorities of a Party may verify that the products covered comply, as appropriate, with\n(a)\nall the domestic technical regulations of that Party; or\n(b)\nthe UN Regulations with which compliance has been attested, in accordance with this Article, by a valid UN Declaration of Conformance certifying compliance with a U-IWVTA in the case of whole vehicles, or by a valid UN type-approval mark affixed to the product or a valid UN type-approval certificate in the case of equipment and parts.\nSuch verifications shall be carried out by random sampling in the market and in accordance with the technical regulations referred to in point (a) or (b) of this paragraph, as the case may be.\n5.   The Parties shall endeavour to cooperate in the field of market surveillance to support the identification and addressing of non-conformities of vehicles, systems, components or separate technical units.\n6.   A Party may take any appropriate measures with respect to vehicles, systems, components or separate technical units that present a serious risk to the health or safety of persons or with regard to other aspects of the protection of public interests, or that otherwise do not comply with applicable requirements. Such measures may include prohibiting or restricting the making available on the market, the registration or the entry into service of the vehicles, systems, components or separate technical units concerned, or withdrawing them from the market or recalling them. A Party that adopts or maintains such measures shall promptly inform the other Party of those measures and, at the request of the other Party, shall provide its reasons for adopting those measures.\nArticle 7\nProducts with new technologies or new features\n1.   Neither Party shall refuse or restrict the access to its market of a product that is covered by this Annex and that has been approved by the exporting Party on the grounds that the product incorporates a new technology or a new feature that the importing Party has not yet regulated, unless it can demonstrate that it has reasonable grounds for believing that the new technology or new feature creates a risk for human health, safety or the environment.\n2.   If a Party decides to refuse the access to its market or requires the withdrawal from its market of a product of the other Party covered by this Annex on the grounds that it incorporates a new technology or a new feature creating a risk for human health, safety or the environment, it shall promptly notify that decision to the other Party and to the economic operator or operators concerned. The notification shall include all relevant scientific or technical information taken into account in the decision.\nArticle 8\nCooperation\n1.   In order to further facilitate trade in motor vehicles, their parts and equipment, and to prevent market access problems, while ensuring human health, safety and environmental protection, the Parties shall endeavour to cooperate and to exchange information as appropriate.\n2.   Areas of cooperation under this Article may include in particular:\n(a)\nthe development and establishment of technical regulations or related standards;\n(b)\nthe exchange, to the extent possible, of research, information and results linked to the development of new vehicle safety regulations or related standards, advanced emission reduction, and emerging vehicle technologies;\n(c)\nthe exchange of available information on the identification of safety-related or emission-related defects and non-compliance with technical regulations; and\n(d)\nthe promotion of greater international harmonisation of technical requirements through multilateral fora, such as the 1958 Agreement and the 1998 Agreement, including through cooperation in the planning of initiatives in support of such harmonisation.\nArticle 9\nWorking Group on Motor Vehicles and Parts\n1.

A Party shall recognise inspections carried out by the other Party and shall accept official GMP documents issued by the other Party in accordance with the laws, regulations and technical guidelines listed in Appendix 12-B.\n2.   An authority of a Party may in specific circumstances opt not to accept an official GMP document issued by an authority of the other Party for manufacturing facilities located in the territory of the issuing authority. Examples of such circumstances include the indication of material inconsistencies or inadequacies in an inspection report, quality defects identified in post-market surveillance or other specific evidence of serious concern in relation to product quality or patient safety. Each Party shall ensure that where an authority of a Party opts not to accept an official GMP document issued by an authority of the other Party, that authority notifies the relevant authority of the other Party of the reasons for not accepting the document and may request clarification from the authority of the other Party. The relevant Party shall ensure that its authority endeavours to respond to the request for clarification in a timely manner.\n3.   A Party may accept official GMP documents issued by an authority of the other Party for manufacturing facilities located outside the territory of the issuing authority.\n4.   Each Party may determine the terms and conditions under which it accepts official GMP documents issued under paragraph 3.\nArticle 6\nExchange of official GMP documents\n1.   Each Party shall ensure that if an authority of a Party requests an official GMP document from the authority of the other Party, the authority of the other Party shall endeavour to transmit the document within 30 calendar days of the date of the request.\n2.   Each Party shall treat the information in a document obtained pursuant to paragraph 1 as confidential.\nArticle 7\nSafeguards\n1.   Each Party has the right to conduct its own inspection of manufacturing facilities that have been certified as compliant by the other Party.\n2.   Each Party shall ensure that, prior to conducting an inspection under paragraph 1, the authority of the Party that intends to conduct the inspection notifies the relevant authority of the other Party of the inspection in writing, stating the reasons for conducting its own inspection.

The specified criteria for qualification as an Authorised Economic Operator (\"AEO\") referred to in Article 110 of this Agreement, shall be established by the Parties' laws, regulations or procedures. The specified criteria, which shall be published, shall include:\n(a)\nthe absence of any serious infringement or repeated infringements of customs legislation and taxation rules, including no record of serious criminal offences relating to the economic activity of the applicant;\n(b)\nthe demonstration by the applicant of a high level of control of his or her operations and of the flow of goods, by means of a system of managing commercial and, where appropriate, transport records, which allows appropriate customs controls;\n(c)\nfinancial solvency which shall be deemed to be proven where the applicant has good financial standing, which enables him or her to fulfil his or her commitments, with due regard to the characteristics of the type of business activity concerned; and\n(d)\nappropriate security and safety standards which shall be considered as fulfilled where the applicant demonstrates that he or she maintains appropriate measures to ensure the security and safety of the international supply chain including in the areas of physical integrity and access controls, logistical processes and handling of specific types of goods, personnel and identification of his or her business partners.\n2.   The specified criteria for qualification as an AEO shall not be designed or applied so as to afford or create arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination between operators where the same conditions prevail. Those criteria shall allow small and medium-sized enterprises to qualify as AEOs.\n3.   The trade partnership programme referred to in Article 110 of this Agreement shall include the following treatment:\n(a)\ntaking the AEO status granted by the other Party favourably into account in its risk assessment to reduce inspections or controls and in other security and safety-related measures;\n(b)\ngiving priority to the inspection of consignments covered by exit or entry summary declarations lodged by an AEO, if the customs authority decides to proceed with an inspection;\n(c)\ntaking the AEO status granted by the other Party into account with a view to treating the AEO as a secure and safe partner when assessing requirements concerning business partners for applicants under its own Programme; and\n(d)\nendeavouring to establish a joint business continuity mechanism to respond to disruptions in trade flows due to increases in security alerts levels, border closures and/or natural disasters, hazardous emergencies or other major incidents where priority cargos related to AEOs could be facilitated and expedited to the extent possible by the customs authorities of the Parties.\nArticle 2\nMutual recognition and responsibility for implementation\n1.   AEO Status under the trade partnership programmes of the Union and the United Kingdom are recognised to be compatible, and holders of the AEO status granted under each programme shall be treated in a manner consistent with Article 4.\n2.

Such suspension shall be promptly communicated to the other customs authority together with any additional information regarding the basis for suspension, as appropriate.\n3.   Each Party shall promptly inform the other Party in cases where it identifies any irregularity committed by an AEO authorised by the other customs authority to allow it to take an informed decision on the possible revocation or suspension of the membership of the operator concerned.\nArticle 5\nExchange of information and communication\n1.

That review shall include:\n(a)\njoint validations of AEOs granted status by each Party to identify strengths and weaknesses in implementing this Annex;\n(b)\nexchanges of views on data to be shared and treatment of operators.\nArticle 8\nSuspension and discontinuation\n1.   A Party may pursue the procedure set out in paragraph 2 in the event that either of the following circumstances arise:\na)\nBefore or within three months of entry into force of this Agreement the other Party has made material changes to the legal provisions referred to in Article 2(2) that were assessed in order to establish that the trade partnership programmes are compatible, such that the compatibility required for recognition under Article 2(1) has ceased to exist.\nb)\nThe provisions under Article 5(2) are not operational.\n2.   In the event that either of the circumstances set out in point (a) or (b) of paragraph 1 arise, a Party may suspend the recognition provided for in Article 2(1) 60 days after notifying the other Party of their intention.\n3.

In the event that either of the circumstances set out in point (a) or (b) of paragraph 4 arise, a Party may request consultations with the other Party in the framework of the Trade Specialised Committee on Customs Cooperation and Rules of Origin. These consultations shall be held within 60 days from the request. If 90 days after the request a Party still considers that the compatibility required for recognition under Article 2(1) has ceased to exist, it may notify the other Party of its intention to suspend recognition of its programme. Suspension shall take effect 30 days after notification.\nANNEX 19\nEXISTING MEASURES\nHeadnotes\n1.\nThe Schedules of the United Kingdom and the Union set out, under Articles 133, 139 and 195 of this Agreement, the reservations taken by the United Kingdom and the Union with respect to existing measures that do not conform with obligations imposed by:\n(a)\nArticle 128 or 135 of this Agreement;\n(b)\nArticle 136 of this Agreement;\n(c)\nArticle 129 or 137 of this Agreement;\n(d)\nArticle 130 or 138 of this Agreement;\n(e)\nArticle 131 of this Agreement;\n(f)\nArticle 132 of this Agreement; or\n(g)\nArticle 194 of this Agreement.\n2.\nThe reservations of a Party are without prejudice to the rights and obligations of the Parties under GATS.\n3.\nEach reservation sets out the following elements:\n(a)\n\"sector\" refers to the general sector in which the reservation is taken;\n(b)\n\"sub-sector\" refers to the specific sector in which the reservation is taken;\n(c)\n\"industry classification\" refers, where applicable, to the activity covered by the reservation according to the CPC, ISIC Rev. 3.1, or as expressly otherwise described in that reservation;\n(d)\n\"type of reservation\" specifies the obligation referred to in paragraph 1 for which a reservation is taken;\n(e)\n\"level of government\" indicates the level of government maintaining the measure for which a reservation is taken;\n(f)\n\"measures\" identifies the laws or other measures as qualified, where indicated, by the \"description\" element for which the reservation is taken. A \"measure\" cited in the \"measures\" element:\n(i)\nmeans the measure as amended, continued or renewed as of the date of entry into force of this Agreement;\n(ii)\nincludes any subordinate measure adopted or maintained under the authority of and consistent with the measure; and\n(iii)\nin respect of the Schedule of the Union, includes any laws or other measures which implement a directive at Member State level; and\n(g)\n\"description\" sets out the non-conforming aspects of the existing measure for which the reservation is taken.\n4.\nFor greater certainty, if a Party adopts a new measure at a level of government different to that at which the reservation was originally taken, and this new measure effectively replaces – within the territory to which it applies – the non-conforming aspect of the original measure cited in the \"measures\" element, the new measure shall be deemed to constitute \"modification\" to the original measure within the meaning of point (c) of Article 133(1), point (c) of Article 139(1), point (c) of Article 144 and point (c) of Article 195(1) of this Agreement.\n5.\nIn the interpretation of a reservation, all elements of the reservation shall be considered. A reservation shall be interpreted in the light of the relevant obligations of the Chapters or Sections against which the reservation is taken. The \"measures\" element shall prevail over all other elements.\n6.\nFor the purposes of the Schedules of the United Kingdom and the Union:\n(a)\n\"ISIC Rev. 3.1\" means the International Standard Industrial Classification of All Economic Activities as set out in Statistical Office of the United Nations, Statistical Papers, Series M, No.4, ISIC Rev. 3.1, 2002;\n(b)\n\"CPC\" means the Provisional Central Product Classification (Statistical Papers, Series M No. 77, Department of International Economic and Social Affairs, Statistical Office of the United Nations, New York, 1991).\n7.\nFor the purposes of the Schedules of the United Kingdom and the Union, a reservation for a requirement to have a local presence in the territory of the Union or the United Kingdom is taken against Article 136 of this Agreement, and not against Article 135 or 137 of this Agreement. Furthermore, such a requirement is not taken as a reservation against Article 129 of this Agreement.\n8.\nA reservation taken at the level of the Union applies to a measure of the Union, to a measure of a Member State at the central level or to a measure of a government within a Member State, unless the reservation excludes a Member State. A reservation taken by a Member State applies to a measure of a government at the central, regional or local level within that Member State. For the purposes of the reservations of Belgium, the central level of government covers the federal government and the governments of the regions and the communities as each of them holds equipollent legislative powers. For the purposes of the reservations of the Union and its Member States, a regional level of government in Finland means the Åland Islands. A reservation taken at the level of the United Kingdom applies to a measure of the central government, a regional government or a local government.\n9.\nThe list of reservations below does not include measures relating to qualification requirements and procedures, technical standards and licensing requirements and procedures where they do not constitute a limitation within the meaning of Article 128, 129, 135, 136, 137 or 194 of this Agreement. These measures may include, in particular, the need to obtain a licence, to satisfy universal service obligations, to have recognised qualifications in regulated sectors, to pass specific examinations, including language examinations, to fulfil a membership requirement of a particular profession, such as membership in a professional organisation, to have a local agent for service, or to maintain a local address, or any other non-discriminatory requirements that certain activities may not be carried out in protected zones or areas. While not listed, such measures continue to apply.\n10.\nFor greater certainty, for the Union, the obligation to grant national treatment does not entail the requirement to extend to natural or legal persons of the United Kingdom the treatment granted in a Member State, pursuant to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, or any measure adopted pursuant to that Treaty, including their implementation in the Member States, to:\n(i)\nnatural persons or residents of another Member State; or\n(ii)\nlegal persons constituted or organised under the law of another Member State or of the Union and having their registered office, central administration or principal place of business in the Union.\n11.\nTreatment granted to legal persons established by investors of a Party in accordance with the law of the other Party (including, in the case of the Union, the law of a Member State) and having their registered office, central administration or principal place of business within that other Party, is without prejudice to any condition or obligation, consistent with Chapter 2 of Title II of Heading One of Part Two of this Agreement, which may have been imposed on such legal person when it was established in that other Party, and which shall continue to apply.\n12.\nThe Schedules apply only to the territories of the United Kingdom and the Union in accordance with Article 520(2) and Article 774 of this Agreement and are only relevant in the context of trade relations between the Union and its Member States with the United Kingdom.

Furthermore, such a requirement is not taken as a reservation against Article 129 of this Agreement.\n7.\nA reservation taken at the level of the Union applies to a measure of the Union, to a measure of a Member State at the central level or to a measure of a government within a Member State, unless the reservation excludes a Member State. A reservation taken by a Member State applies to a measure of a government at the central, regional or local level within that Member State. For the purposes of the reservations of Belgium, the central level of government covers the federal government and the governments of the regions and the communities as each of them holds equipollent legislative powers. For the purposes of the reservations of the Union and its Member States, a regional level of government in Finland means the Åland Islands. A reservation taken at the level of the United Kingdom applies to a measure of the central government, a regional government or a local government.\n8.\nThe list of reservations below does not include measures relating to qualification requirements and procedures, technical standards and licensing requirements and procedures where they do not constitute a market access or a national treatment limitation within the meaning of Article 128, 129, 135, 136, 137 or 194 of this Agreement. These measures may include, in particular the need to obtain a licence, to satisfy universal service obligations, to have recognised qualifications in regulated sectors, to pass specific examinations, including language examinations, to fulfil a membership requirement of a particular profession, such as membership in a professional organisation, to have a local agent for service, or to maintain a local address, or any other non-discriminatory requirements that certain activities may not be carried out in protected zones or areas. While not listed, such measures continue to apply.\n9.\nFor greater certainty, for the Union, the obligation to grant national treatment does not entail the requirement to extend to natural or legal persons of the United Kingdom the treatment granted in a Member State, pursuant to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, or any measure adopted pursuant to that Treaty, including their implementation in the Member States, to:\n(a)\nnatural persons or residents of another Member State; or\n(b)\nlegal persons constituted or organised under the law of another Member State or of the Union and having their registered office, central administration or principal place of business in the Union.\n10.\nTreatment granted to legal persons established by investors of a Party in accordance with the law of the other Party (including, in the case of the Union, the law of a Member State) and having their registered office, central administration or principal place of business within that other Party, is without prejudice to any condition or obligation, consistent with Chapter 2 of Title II of Heading One of Part Two of this Agreement, which may have been imposed on such legal person when it was established in that other Party, and which shall continue to apply.\n11.\nThe Schedules apply only to the territories of the United Kingdom and the European Union in accordance with Article 520(2) and Article 774 of this Agreement and are only relevant in the context of trade relations between the Union and its Member States with the United Kingdom. They do not affect the rights and obligations of the Member States under Union law.\n12.\nFor greater certainty, non-discriminatory measures do not constitute a market access limitation within the meaning of Article 128, 135 or 194 of this Agreement for any measure:\n(a)\nrequiring the separation of the ownership of infrastructure from the ownership of the goods or services provided through that infrastructure to ensure fair competition, for example in the fields of energy, transportation and telecommunications;\n(b)\nrestricting the concentration of ownership to ensure fair competition;\n(c)\nseeking to ensure the conservation and protection of natural resources and the environment, including a limitation on the availability, number and scope of concessions granted, and the imposition of a moratorium or ban;\n(d)\nlimiting the number of authorisations granted because of technical or physical constraints, for example telecommunications spectra and frequencies; or\n(e)\nrequiring that a certain percentage of the shareholders, owners, partners, or directors of an enterprise be qualified or practice a certain profession such as lawyers or accountants.\n13.\nWith respect to financial services: Unlike foreign subsidiaries, branches established directly in a Member State by a non-European Union financial institution are not, with certain limited exceptions, subject to prudential regulations harmonised at European Union level which enable such subsidiaries to benefit from enhanced facilities to set up new establishments and to provide cross-border services throughout the Union. Therefore, such branches receive an authorisation to operate in the territory of a Member State under conditions equivalent to those applied to domestic financial institutions of that Member State, and may be required to satisfy a number of specific prudential requirements such as, in the case of banking and securities, separate capitalisation and other solvency requirements and reporting and publication of accounts requirements or, in the case of insurance, specific guarantee and deposit requirements, a separate capitalisation, and the localisation in the Member State concerned of the assets representing the technical reserves and at least one third of the solvency margin.\nThe following abbreviations are used in the list of reservations below:\nUK\nUnited Kingdom\nEU\nEuropean Union, including all its Member States\nAT\nAustria\nBE\nBelgium\nBG\nBulgaria\nCY\nCyprus\nCZ\nCzechia\nDE\nGermany\nDK\nDenmark\nEE\nEstonia\nEL\nGreece\nES\nSpain\nFI\nFinland\nFR\nFrance\nHR\nCroatia\nHU\nHungary\nIE\nIreland\nIT\nItaly\nLT\nLithuania\nLU\nLuxembourg\nLV\nLatvia\nMT\nMalta\nNL\nThe Netherlands\nPL\nPoland\nPT\nPortugal\nRO\nRomania\nSE\nSweden\nSI\nSlovenia\nSK\nSlovak Republic\nSchedule of the Union\nReservation No. 1 - All sectors\nReservation No. 2 - Professional services – other than health related services\nReservation No. 3 - Professional services – health related and retail of pharmaceuticals\nReservation No. 4 - Business Services - Research and development services\nReservation No. 5 - Business Services - Real estate services\nReservation No. 6 - Business services - Rental or leasing services\nReservation No. 7 - Business Services - Collection agency services and Credit reporting services\nReservation No. 8 - Business Services - Placement services\nReservation No. 9 - Business Services - Security and investigation services\nReservation No. 10 - Business Services - Other business services\nReservation No. 11 - Telecommunication\nReservation No. 12 - Construction\nReservation No. 13 - Distribution services\nReservation No. 14 - Education services\nReservation No. 15 - Environmental services\nReservation No. 16 – Financial Services\nReservation No. 17 - Health services and social services\nReservation No. 18 - Tourism and travel related services\nReservation No. 19 - Recreational, cultural and sporting services\nReservation No. 20 - Transport services and auxiliary transport services\nReservation No. 21 - Agriculture, fishing and water\nReservation No. 22 - Energy related activities\nReservation No. 23 - Other services not included elsewhere\nReservation No. 1 - All sectors\nSector:\nAll sectors\nType of reservation:\nMarket access\nNational treatment\nMost-favoured-nation treatment\nSenior management and boards of directors\nPerformance requirements\nLocal presence\nObligations for legal services\nChapter/Section:\nInvestment liberalisation, Cross-border trade in services and Regulatory framework for legal services\nDescription:\nThe EU reserves the right to adopt or maintain any measure with respect to the following:\n(a)   Establishment\nWith respect to Investment liberalisation – Market access:\nThe EU: Services considered as public utilities at a national or local level may be subject to public monopolies or to exclusive rights granted to private operators.\nPublic utilities exist in sectors such as related scientific and technical consulting services, research and development (R&D) services on social sciences and humanities, technical testing and analysis services, environmental services, health services, transport services and services auxiliary to all modes of transport.

They set out the typical content of arrangements, and provide general indications as to the economic value of an arrangement and the compatibility of the respective professional qualifications regimes.\n4.\nNot all elements of these guidelines may be relevant in all cases and professional bodies and authorities are free to include in their joint recommendations any other element that they consider pertinent for the arrangements of the profession and the professional activities concerned, consistent with this Agreement.\n5.\nThe guidelines should be taken into account by the Partnership Council when deciding whether to develop and adopt arrangements. They are without prejudice to its review of the consistency of joint recommendations with Title II of Heading One of Part Two of this Agreement and its discretion to take into account the elements it deems relevant, including those contained in joint recommendations.\nSECTION B\nFORM AND CONTENT OF AN ARRANGEMENT\n6.\nThis section sets out the typical content of an arrangement, some of which is not within the remit of the professional bodies or authorities preparing joint recommendations. These aspects constitute, nonetheless, useful information to be taken into account in the preparation of joint recommendations, so that they are better adapted to the possible scope of an arrangement.\n7.\nMatters addressed specifically in this Agreement which apply to arrangements (such as the geographical scope of an arrangement, its interaction with scheduled non-conforming measures, the system of dispute resolution, appeal mechanisms, monitoring and review mechanisms of the arrangement) should not be addressed by joint recommendations.\n8.\nAn arrangement may specify different mechanisms for the recognition of professional qualifications within a Party. It may also be limited, but not necessarily so, to setting the scope of the arrangement, the procedural provisions, the effects of recognition and additional requirements, and the administrative arrangements.\n9.\nAn arrangement which is adopted by the Partnership Council should reflect the degree of discretion that is intended to be preserved for competent authorities deciding on recognition.\nScope of an Arrangement\n10.\nThe arrangement should set out:\n(a)\nthe specific regulated profession(s), relevant professional title(s) and the activity or group of activities covered by the scope of practice of the regulated profession in both Parties (\"scope of practice\"); and\n(b)\nwhether it covers the recognition of professional qualifications for the purpose of access to professional activities on a fixed-term or an indefinite basis.\nConditions for recognition\n11.\nThe arrangement may specify in particular:\n(a)\nthe professional qualifications necessary for recognition under the arrangement (for example, evidence of formal qualification, professional experience, or other attestation of competence);\n(b)\nthe degree of discretion preserved by recognition authorities when assessing requests for recognition of these qualifications; and\n(c)\nthe procedures to deal with variations and gaps between professional qualifications and means to bridge the differences, including the possibility for imposing any compensatory measures or any other relevant conditions and limitations.\nProcedural provisions\n12.\nThe arrangement may set out:\n(a)\nthe documents required and the form in which they should be presented (for example, by electronic or other means, whether they should be supported by translations or certifications of authenticity, etc.);\n(b)\nthe steps and procedures in the recognition process, including those relating to possible compensatory measures, corresponding obligations and timelines; and\n(c)\nthe availability of information relevant to all aspects of the recognition processes and requirements.\nEffects of recognition and additional requirements\n13.\nThe arrangement may set out provisions on the effects of recognition (if relevant, also in respect of different modes of supply).\n14.\nThe arrangement may describe any additional requirements for the effective exercise of the regulated profession in the host Party. Such requirements may include:\n(a)\nregistration requirements with local authorities;\n(b)\nappropriate language skills;\n(c)\nproof of good character;\n(d)\ncompliance with the requirements of the host Party for use of trade or firm names;\n(e)\ncompliance with the rules of ethics, independence and professional conduct requirements of the host Party;\n(f)\nneed to obtain professional indemnity insurance;\n(g)\nrules on disciplinary action, financial responsibility and professional liability; and\n(h)\nrequirements for continuous professional development.\nAdministration of the arrangement\n15.\nThe arrangement should set out the terms under which it can be reviewed or revoked, and the effects of any revision or revocation. Consideration may also be given to the inclusion of provisions concerning the effects of any recognition previously accorded.\nSECTION C\nECONOMIC VALUE OF AN ENVISAGED ARRANGEMENT\n16.\nPursuant to Article 158(2) of this Agreement, joint recommendations shall be supported by an evidence-based assessment of the economic value of an envisaged arrangement. This may consist of an evaluation of the economic benefits that an arrangement is expected to bring to the economies of both Parties. Such an assessment may assist the Partnership Council when developing and adopting an arrangement.\n17.\nAspects such as the existing level of market openness, industry needs, market trends and developments, client expectations and requirements and business opportunities would constitute useful elements.\n18.\nThe evaluation is not required to be a full and detailed economic analysis, but should provide an explanation of the interest of the profession in, and the expected benefits for the Parties ensuing from, the adoption of an arrangement.\nSECTION D\nCOMPATIBILITY OF RESPECTIVE PROFESSIONAL QUALIFICATION REGIMES\n19.\nPursuant to Article 158(2) of this Agreement, joint recommendations shall be supported by an evidence-based assessment of the compatibility of the respective professional qualification regimes. This assessment may assist the Partnership Council when developing and adopting an arrangement.\n20.\nThe following process aims at guiding professional bodies and authorities when assessing the compatibility of the respective professional qualifications and activities with a view to simplifying and facilitating the recognition of professional qualifications.\nStep One: Assessment of the scope of practice and the professional qualifications required to practise the regulated profession in each Party.\n21.\nThe assessment of the scope of practice and of the professional qualifications required to practise a regulated profession in each of the Parties should be based on all relevant information.\n22.\nThe following elements should be identified:\n(a)\nactivities or groups of activities covered by the scope of practice of the regulated profession in each Party; and\n(b)\nthe professional qualifications required in each Party to practise the regulated profession, which may include any of the following elements:\n(i)\nthe minimum education required, for example, entry requirements, level of education, length of study and contents of study;\n(ii)\nthe minimum professional experience required, for example, location, length and conditions of practical training or supervised professional practice prior to registration, licensing or equivalent;\n(iii)\nexaminations passed, especially examinations of professional competency; and\n(iv)\nthe acquisition of a licence, or equivalent, certifying, inter alia, the fulfilment of the necessary professional qualification requirements for the pursuit of the profession.\nStep Two: Evaluation of the divergence between the scope of practice of, or the professional qualifications required to practise, the regulated profession in each Party.\n23.\nThe evaluation of the divergence in the scope of practice of, or in the professional qualifications required to practise, the regulated profession, in each Party, should in particular identify divergence that is substantial.\n24.\nSubstantial divergence in the scope of practice may exist if all of the following conditions are met:\n(a)\none or more activities covered by a regulated profession in the host Party are not covered by the corresponding profession in the Party of origin;\n(b)\nsuch activities are subject to specific training in the host Party;\n(c)\nthe training for such activities in the host Party covers matters substantially diverging from those covered by the applicant's qualification.\n25.\nSubstantial divergence in the professional qualifications required to practise a regulated profession may exist if there are divergences in the Parties' requirements with regard to the level, duration or content of the training that is required for the pursuit of activities covered by the regulated profession.\nStep Three: Recognition mechanisms\n26.\nThere may be different mechanisms for the recognition of professional qualifications, depending on the circumstances. There may be different mechanisms within a Party.\n27.\nIf there is no substantial divergence in the scope of practice and in the professional qualifications required to practise a regulated profession, an arrangement may provide for a simpler, more streamlined recognition process than would be the case where substantial divergence exists.\n28.\nIf there is substantial divergence, the arrangement may provide for compensatory measures which are sufficient to remedy such divergence.\n29.\nWhere compensatory measures are used to reduce substantial divergence, they should be proportionate to the divergence that they seek to address. Any practical professional experience or formally validated training could be taken into account to assess the extent of the compensatory measures needed.\n30.\nWhether or not the divergence is substantial, the arrangement may take account of the degree of discretion that is intended to be preserved for competent authorities deciding on recognition requests.\n31.\nCompensatory measures may take different forms, including:\n(a)\na period of supervised practice of a regulated profession in the host Party, possibly accompanied by further training, under the responsibility of a qualified person and subject to a regulated assessment;\n(b)\na test made or recognised by the relevant authorities of the host Party to assess the applicant's ability to practice a regulated profession in that Party; or\n(c)\na temporary limitation of the scope of practice; or a combination of those.\n32.\nThe arrangement could envisage that a choice be given to applicants between different compensatory measures where this could limit the administrative burden for applicants and such measures are equivalent.\nANNEX 25\nPUBLIC PROCUREMENT\nSECTION A\nRELEVANT PROVISIONS OF THE GPA\nArticles I to III, IV.1.a, IV.2 to IV.7, VI to XV, XVI.1 to XVI.3, XVII and XVIII.\nSECTION B:\nMARKET ACCESS COMMITMENTS\nFor the purposes of this Section, \"CPC\" means the Provisional Central Product Classification (Statistical Papers, Series M No. 77, Department of International Economic and Social Affairs, Statistical Office of the United Nations, New York, 1991).\nSUB-SECTION B1\nEuropean Union\nIn accordance with Article 277(2) and (3) of this Agreement, Title VI of Heading One of Part Two of this Agreement applies, in addition to the procurement covered by the annexes of the European Union to Appendix I to the GPA, to the procurement covered by this Sub-section.\nThe Notes in Annexes 1 to 7 of the European Union to Appendix I to the GPA also apply to the procurement covered by this Sub-section, unless otherwise provided for in this Sub-section.\nProcurement covered by this Sub-section\n1.

For the implementation of this Annex, each Party shall ensure that, in its regulatory system for civil aviation safety, the capability of any design organisation to assume its responsibilities is sufficiently controlled through a system of certification for design organisations.\nArticle 9\nValidation process\n1.   An application for the validation of a design certificate of a civil aeronautical product shall be made to the validating authority through the certificating authority as detailed in the technical implementation procedures.\n2.   The certificating authority shall ensure that the validating authority receives all the relevant data and information necessary for the validation of the design certificate, as detailed in the technical implementation procedures.\n3.   Upon receiving the application for the validation of the design certificate, the validating authority shall determine the certification basis for the validation in accordance with Article 11, as well as the level of involvement of the validating authority in the validation process in accordance with Article 12.\n4.   The validating authority shall, as detailed in the technical implementation procedures, base its validation to the maximum extent practicable on the technical evaluations, tests, inspections, and findings of compliance made by the certificating authority.\n5.   The validating authority shall, after examining relevant data and information provided by the certificating authority, issue its design certificate for the validated civil aeronautical product (\"validated design certificate\") when:\n(a)\nit is confirmed that the certificating authority has issued its own design certificate for the civil aeronautical product;\n(b)\nit has been stated by the certificating authority that the civil aeronautical product complies with the certification basis referred to in Article 11;\n(c)\nall issues raised during the validation process conducted by the validating authority have been resolved; and\n(d)\nadditional administrative requirements, as detailed in the technical implementation procedures, have been met by the applicant.\n6.   Each Party shall ensure that in order to obtain and maintain a validated design certificate, the applicant holds and retains at the disposal of the certificating authority all relevant design information, drawings and test reports, including inspection records for the certified civil aeronautical product, in order to provide the information necessary to ensure the continued airworthiness and compliance with applicable environmental protection requirements of the civil aeronautical product.\nArticle 10\nModalities of the validation of design certificates\n1.   Type certificates issued by the technical agent of the Union as certificating authority shall be validated by the technical agent of the United Kingdom as validating authority. The following data shall be subject to acceptance:\n(a)\nengine installation manual (for engine type certificate);\n(b)\nstructural repair manual;\n(c)\ninstruction for continued airworthiness of electrical wiring interconnection systems; and\n(d)\nweight balance manual.\nBy way of technical implementation procedures, procedural detail may be established in respect of acceptance of the relevant data. Any such procedural detail must not affect the requirement of acceptance established in the first subparagraph.\n2.   Significant supplemental type certificates and approvals for significant major changes issued by the technical agent of the Union as certificating authority shall be validated by the technical agent of the United Kingdom as validating authority. A streamlined validation process limited to the technical familiarisation without the involvement of the validating authority in the showing of compliance activities by the applicant shall be used as a matter of principle, unless otherwise decided by the technical agents on a case-by-case basis.\n3.   Type certificates issued by the technical agent of the United Kingdom as certificating authority shall be validated by the technical agent of the Union as validating authority.\n4.   Supplemental type certificates, approvals for major changes, major repairs and technical standard order authorisations issued by the technical agent of the United Kingdom as certificating authority or by an approved organisation under laws and regulations of the United Kingdom shall be validated by the technical agent of the Union as validating authority. A streamlined validation process limited to the technical familiarisation without the involvement of the validating authority in the showing of compliance activities by the applicant may be used when decided by the technical agents on a case-by-case basis.\nArticle 11\nCertification basis for the validation\n1.   For the purpose of validating a design certificate of a civil aeronautical product, the validating authority shall refer to the following requirements set out in laws, regulations and administrative provisions of its Party in determining the certification basis:\n(a)\nthe airworthiness requirements for a similar civil aeronautical product that were in effect on the effective application date established by the certificating authority, and complemented when applicable by additional technical conditions as detailed in the technical implementation procedures; and\n(b)\nthe environmental protection requirements for the civil aeronautical product that were in effect on the date of the application for the validation to the validating authority.\n2.   The validating authority shall specify, when applicable, any:\n(a)\nexemption to the applicable requirements;\n(b)\ndeviation from the applicable requirements; or\n(c)\ncompensating factors that provide an equivalent level of safety when applicable requirements are not complied with.\n3.   In addition to the requirements set out in paragraphs 1 and 2, the validating authority shall specify any special condition to be applied if the related airworthiness codes, laws, regulations and administrative provisions do not contain adequate or appropriate safety requirements for the civil aeronautical product, because:\n(a)\nthe civil aeronautical product has novel or unusual design features relative to the design practices on which the applicable airworthiness codes, laws, regulations and administrative provisions are based;\n(b)\nthe intended use of the civil aeronautical product is unconventional; or\n(c)\nexperience obtained from other, similar civil aeronautical products in service or civil aeronautical products having similar design features has shown that unsafe conditions may develop.\n4.   When specifying exemptions, deviations, compensating factors or special conditions, the validating authority shall give due consideration to these applied by the certificating authority and they shall not be more demanding for the civil aeronautical products to be validated than they would be for its own similar products. The validating authority shall notify the certificating authority of any such exemptions, deviations, compensating factors or special conditions.\nArticle 12\nLevel of involvement of the validating authority\n1.   The level of involvement of the validating authority of a Party during the validation process referred to in Article 9 and as detailed in the technical implementation procedures, shall be mainly determined by:\n(a)\nthe experience and records of the competent authority of the other Party as certificating authority;\n(b)\nthe experience already gained by that validating authority during previous validation exercises with the competent authority of the other Party;\n(c)\nthe nature of the design to be validated;\n(d)\nthe performance and experience of the applicant with the validating authority; and\n(e)\nthe outcome of qualification requirements assessments referred to in Articles 28 and Article 29.\n2.   The validating authority shall exercise special procedures and scrutiny, in particular regarding the certificating authority's processes and methods, during the first validation of any certificate, where the certificating authority has not previously issued a certificate in the category of civil aeronautical products concerned after 30 September 2004. The procedures and criteria to be applied shall be detailed in the technical implementation procedures.\n3.   The effective implementation of the principles set out in paragraphs 1 and 2 shall be regularly measured, monitored, reviewed by the Certification Oversight Board, using metrics as detailed in the technical implementation procedures.\nArticle 13\nAcceptance\n1.   For a design certificate subject to acceptance, the validating authority shall accept the design certificate issued by the certificating authority without any validation activities. In that case, the design certificate shall be recognised by the validating authority as equivalent to a certificate issued in accordance with laws, regulations and administrative provisions of its Party and the validating authority shall not issue its corresponding certificate.\n2.   Non-significant supplemental type certificates, non-significant major changes and technical standard order authorisations issued by the technical agent of the Union as certificating authority or by an approved organisation under Union law shall be accepted by the technical agent of the United Kingdom as validating authority.\n3.   Minor changes and repairs approved by the technical agent of the Union as certificating authority or by an approved organisation under Union law shall be accepted by the technical agent of the United Kingdom as validating authority.\n4.   Minor changes and minor repairs approved by the technical agent of the United Kingdom as certificating authority or by an approved organisation under laws and regulations of the United Kingdom shall be accepted by the technical agent of the Union as validating authority.\nArticle 14\nImplementation provisions for Articles 10 and 13\n1.   The minor change or major change classifications shall be made by the certificating authority in accordance with the definitions set out in this Annex and interpreted in accordance with the applicable rules and procedures of the certificating authority.\n2.   For classifying a supplemental type certificate or major change as significant or non-significant, the certificating authority shall consider the change in the context of all previous relevant design changes and all related revisions to the applicable certification specifications incorporated in the type certificate for the civil aeronautical product. Changes that meet either of the following criteria are automatically considered as significant:\n(a)\nthe general configuration or the principles of construction are not retained; or\n(b)\nthe assumptions used for certification of the product to be changed do not remain valid.\nArticle 15\nExisting design certificates\nFor the purposes of this Annex, the following apply:\n(a)\ntype certificates, supplemental type certificates, approvals for changes and repairs, as well as technical standard order authorisations and changes thereto issued by the technical agent of the Union to United Kingdom applicants, or by an approved design organisation located in the United Kingdom, on the basis of Union law and valid on 31 December 2020 are deemed to have been issued by the technical agent of the United Kingdom as certificating authority or by an approved organisation under the laws and regulations of the United Kingdom and to have been accepted by the technical agent of the Union as validating authority in accordance with Article 13(1);\n(b)\ntype certificates, supplemental type certificates, approvals for changes and repairs, as well as technical standard order authorisations and changes thereto issued by the technical agent of the Union to Union applicants, or by a design organisation located in the Union, on the basis of Union law and valid on 31 December 2020 are deemed to have been accepted by the technical agent of the United Kingdom as validating authority in accordance with Article 13(1).\nArticle 16\nTransfer of a design certificate\nIn the event that a design certificate is transferred to another entity, the certificating authority responsible for the design certificate shall promptly notify the validating authority of the transfer and apply the procedure related to the transfer of design certificates as detailed in the technical implementation procedures.\nArticle 17\nDesign-related operational requirements\n1.   The technical agents shall ensure that, where necessary, data and information related to design-related operational requirements shall be exchanged during the validation process.\n2.   Subject to decision by the technical agents for some design-related operational requirements, the validating authority may accept the compliance statement of the certificating authority through the validation process.\nArticle 18\nOperational documents and data related to the type\n1.   Some type-specific sets of operational documents and data, including operational suitability data in the Union system and the equivalent data in the United Kingdom system, provided by the type certificate holder shall be approved or accepted by the certificating authority and, where necessary, exchanged during the validation process.\n2.   Operational documents and data referred to in paragraph 1 may be either accepted or validated by the validating authority as detailed in the technical implementation procedures.\nArticle 19\nConcurrent validation\nWhen decided by the applicant and the technical agents, a concurrent certification and validation process may be used, where appropriate and as detailed in the technical implementation procedures.\nArticle 20\nContinuing airworthiness\n1.   The competent authorities shall take action to address unsafe conditions in civil aeronautical products for which they are the certificating authority.\n2.   Upon request, a competent authority of a Party shall, in respect of civil aeronautical products designed or manufactured under its regulatory system, assist the competent authority of the other Party in determining any action considered to be necessary for the continued airworthiness of the civil aeronautical products.\n3.   When in-service difficulties or other potential safety issues affecting a civil aeronautical product within the scope of this Annex lead to an investigation conducted by the technical agent of a Party that is the certificating authority for the civil aeronautical product, the technical agent of the other Party shall, upon request, support that investigation, including by providing relevant information reported by relevant entities on failures, malfunctions, defects or other occurrences affecting that civil aeronautical product.\n4.   The reporting obligations of the design certificate holders to the certificating authority and the information exchange mechanism established under this Annex shall be considered to fulfil the obligation of each design certificate holder to report failures, malfunctions, defects or other occurrences affecting that civil aeronautical product to the validating authority.\n5.   Actions to address unsafe conditions and exchange of safety information referred to in paragraphs 1 to 4 shall be detailed in the technical implementation procedures.\n6.   The technical agent of a Party shall keep the technical agent of the other Party informed of all its mandatory continuing airworthiness information in relation to civil aeronautical products designed or manufactured under its oversight system, and which are within the scope of this Annex.\n7.   Any changes to the airworthiness status of a certificate issued by a Party's technical agent shall be communicated in a timely manner to the other Party's technical agent.\nSECTION E\nPRODUCTION CERTIFICATION\nArticle 21\nRecognition of production certification and production oversight systems\n1.   The importing Party shall recognise the production certification and production oversight system of the exporting Party, since the system is considered sufficiently equivalent to the system of the importing Party within the scope of this Annex, subject to the provisions of this Article.\n2.   The recognition of the production certification and production oversight system of the United Kingdom by the Union is limited to the recognition of the production of categories of civil aeronautical products that were already subject to that system on 31 December 2020, as detailed in the technical implementation procedures.\n3.   In the event that a new category of civil aeronautical products is added to the exporting Party's production certification and production oversight system, the competent authority of the exporting Party shall notify the technical agent of the importing Party. Before extending the recognition of the production certification and production oversight system to the new category of civil aeronautical products, the technical agent of the importing Party may decide to conduct an assessment to confirm that the production certification and production oversight system of the exporting Party for this category of civil aeronautical products is sufficiently equivalent to the production certification and production oversight system of the importing Party. That assessment shall be performed as detailed in the technical implementation procedures, and may include an assessment of the production approval holder under the oversight of the competent authority of the exporting Party. The process for the extension of the recognition of the production certification and production oversight system of the exporting Party to the new category of civil aeronautical products by the importing Party shall be detailed in the technical implementation procedures.\n4.   The recognition of the production certification and production oversight system of the exporting Party by the importing Party shall be subject to the level of safety provided by the production certification and production oversight system of the exporting Party remaining sufficiently equivalent to that provided by the system of the importing Party. The equivalence of the production certification and production oversight system shall be continuously monitored through the procedures set out in Article 29.\n5.   Paragraphs 1 to 3 also apply to the production of a civil aeronautical product for which the State of Design responsibilities are exercised by a country other than the exporting Party of the civil aeronautical product, provided that the competent authority of the exporting Party has established and implemented the necessary procedures with the relevant authority of the State of Design to control the interface between the design certificate holder and the production approval holder for that civil aeronautical product.\nArticle 22\nExtension of production approval\n1.   A production approval issued by the competent authority of the exporting Party to a manufacturer primarily located in the territory of that exporting Party and recognised under Article 21(1) may be extended to include manufacturing sites and facilities of the manufacturer located in the territory of the other Party or in the territory of a third country, irrespective of the legal status of those manufacturing sites and facilities, and irrespective of the type of civil aeronautical product manufactured in those sites and facilities. In that case, the competent authority of the exporting Party shall remain responsible for the oversight of those manufacturing sites and facilities and the competent authority of the importing Party shall not issue its own production approval to these manufacturing sites and facilities for the same civil aeronautical product.\n2.   If facilities and manufacturing sites for a manufacturer primarily located in the territory of the exporting Party are located in the other Party, the competent authorities of both Parties shall cooperate with each other, in the framework of Article 32, with a view to having the importing Party participating in the oversight activities of the exporting Party in relation to these facilities.\nArticle 23\nInterface between the production approval holder and the design certificate holder\n1.   In cases where the production approval holder for a civil aeronautical product is regulated by the competent authority of a Party, and the design certificate holder for the same civil aeronautical product is regulated by the competent authority of the other Party, the competent authorities of the Parties shall establish procedures to define the responsibilities of each Party to control the interface between the production approval holder and the design certificate holder.\n2.   For the purpose of export of civil aeronautical products within the framework of this Annex, when the design certificate holder and the production approval holder are not the same legal entity, the competent authorities of the Parties shall ensure that the design certificate holder establishes proper arrangements with the production approval holder to ensure satisfactory coordination between design and production and the proper support of the continued airworthiness of the civil aeronautical product.\nSECTION F\nEXPORT CERTIFICATES\nArticle 24\nForms\nThe exporting Party's forms are:\n(a)\nwhen the exporting Party is the United Kingdom, CAA Form 52 for new aircraft, export certificate of airworthiness for used aircraft, and CAA Form 1 for other new products; and\n(b)\nwhen the exporting Party is the Union, EASA Form 52 for new aircraft, export certificate of airworthiness for used aircraft, and EASA Form 1 for other new products.\nArticle 25\nIssuance of an export certificate\n1.   When issuing an export certificate, the competent authority or production approval holder of the exporting Party shall ensure that such civil aeronautical product:\n(a)\nconforms to the design automatically accepted or validated, or certified by the importing Party in accordance with this Annex and as detailed in the technical implementation procedures;\n(b)\nis in a condition for safe operation;\n(c)\nmeets all additional requirements notified by the importing Party; and\n(d)\nas regards civil aircraft, aircraft engines and aircraft propellers, complies with the applicable mandatory continuing airworthiness information, including airworthiness directives of the importing Party, as notified by that Party.\n2.   When issuing an export certificate of airworthiness for a used aircraft registered in the exporting Party, in addition to the requirements referred to in points (a) to (d) of paragraph 1, the competent authority of the exporting Party shall ensure that such aircraft has been properly maintained using approved procedures and methods of the exporting Party during its service life, as evidenced by logbooks and maintenance records.\nArticle 26\nAcceptance of an export certificate for a new civil aeronautical product\nThe competent authority of the importing Party shall accept an export certificate issued by the competent authority or a production approval holder of the exporting Party for a civil aeronautical product, in accordance with the terms and conditions set out in this Annex and as detailed in the technical implementation procedures.\nArticle 27\nAcceptance of an export certificate of airworthiness for a used aircraft\n1.   The competent authority of the importing Party shall accept an export certificate of airworthiness issued by the competent authority of the exporting Party for a used aircraft in accordance with the terms and conditions set out in this Annex and the technical implementation procedures only if a holder of either a type certificate or a restricted type certificate exists for the used aircraft to support continued airworthiness of that type of aircraft.\n2.   For an export certificate of airworthiness for a used aircraft manufactured under the production oversight of the exporting Party to be accepted in accordance with paragraph 1, the competent authority of the exporting Party shall assist, upon request, the competent authority of the importing Party in obtaining data and information regarding:\n(a)\nthe configuration of the aircraft at the time of dispatch from the manufacturer; and\n(b)\nsubsequent changes and repairs applied to the aircraft that it has approved.\n3.   The importing Party may request inspection and maintenance records as detailed in the technical implementation procedures.\n4.   If, in the process of assessing the airworthiness status of a used aircraft considered for export, the competent authority of the exporting Party is unable to satisfy all of the requirements set out in Article 25(2) and in paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Article, it shall:\n(a)\nnotify the competent authority of the importing Party;\n(b)\ncoordinate with the competent authority of the importing Party, as detailed in the technical implementation procedures, their acceptance or rejection of the exceptions to the applicable requirements; and\n(c)\nkeep a record of any accepted exceptions when exporting.\nSECTION G\nQUALIFICATION OF COMPETENT AUTHORITIES\nArticle 28\nQualification requirements for the acceptance of findings of compliance and certificates\n1.   Each Party shall maintain a structured and effective certification and oversight system for the implementation of this Annex, including:\n(a)\na legal and regulatory framework, ensuring in particular regulatory powers over entities regulated under the regulatory system for civil aviation safety of the Party;\n(b)\nan organisational structure, including a clear description of responsibilities;\n(c)\nsufficient resources, including qualified staff with sufficient knowledge, experience and training;\n(d)\nadequate processes documented in policies and procedures;\n(e)\ndocumentation and records; and\n(f)\nan established inspection programme ensuring uniform level of implementation of the legal and regulatory framework among the various components of the oversight system.\nArticle 29\nContinued qualifications of the competent authorities\n1.   In order to maintain mutual confidence in each Party's regulatory system concerning the implementation of this Annex so that they ensure a sufficiently equivalent level of safety, the technical agent of each Party shall regularly assess the other Party's competent authorities' compliance with the qualification requirements referred to in Article 28. The modalities of such continued mutual assessments shall be detailed in the technical implementation procedures.\n2.   The competent authority of a Party shall cooperate with the competent authority of the other Party whenever such assessments are required and ensure that regulated entities subject to its oversight provide access to the technical agents of the Parties.\n3.   If the technical agent of either Party believes that the technical competence of a competent authority of the other Party is no longer adequate, or that the acceptance of findings of compliance made or certificates issued by that competent authority should be suspended as the other Party's systems concerning the implementation of this Annex no longer ensure a sufficiently equivalent level of safety to permit such acceptance, the technical agents of the Parties shall consult in order to identify remedial actions.\n4.   If mutual confidence is not restored through mutually acceptable means, the technical agent of each Party may refer the matter referred to in paragraph 3 to the Certification Oversight Board.\n5.   If the matter is not resolved by the Certification Oversight Board, each Party may refer the matter referred to in paragraph 3 to the Specialised Committee on Aviation Safety.\nSECTION H\nCOMMUNICATIONS, CONSULTATIONS AND SUPPORT\nArticle 30\nCommunications\nSubject to the exceptions decided by the technical agents of the Parties on a case-by-case basis, all communications between the competent authorities of the Parties, including documentation as detailed in the technical implementation procedures, shall be made in the English language.\nArticle 31\nTechnical consultations\n1.   The technical agents of the Parties shall address issues concerning the implementation of this Annex through consultations.\n2.

The sole fact of requiring a visa for natural persons of certain countries and not for those of others shall not be regarded as nullifying or impairing benefits under this Section.\nNothing in this Section shall affect the application on the Union territory of the Union rules on the posting of drivers in road transport to Union road haulage operators.\nArticle 2\nDefinitions\nFor the purposes of this Section, \"posted driver\" means a driver who, for a limited period, carries out his or her work in the territory of a Party other than the Party in which the driver normally works.\nArticle 3\nPrinciples\n1.   The provisions of this Section apply to the extent that the road haulage operator posts drivers to the territory of the other Party on its account and under its direction, under a contract concluded between the road haulage operator making the posting and the party for whom the transport services are intended, and those drivers operate in the territory of that Party, provided that there is an employment relationship between the road haulage operator making the posting and the driver during the period of posting.\n2.   For the purposes of paragraph 1, a posting shall be considered to start when the driver enters the territory of the other Party for the loading and/or unloading of goods and to end when the driver leaves the territory of that Party.\nFor the purposes of paragraph 1, in the case of posting in the Union, a posting shall, be considered to start when the driver enters the territory of a Member State for the loading and/or unloading of goods in that Member State and to end when the driver leaves the territory of that Member State.\n3.   Notwithstanding the paragraphs 1 and 2, a driver shall not be considered to be posted when performing transport operations, based on a transport contract, as defined in point (a) of Article 462(1) of this Agreement.\n4.   A driver shall not be considered to be posted in the United Kingdom where the driver transits through the territory of the United Kingdom without loading or unloading of goods. For the Union, a driver shall not be considered to be posted in a Member State when the driver transits through the territory of that Member State without loading or unloading of goods.\nArticle 4\nTerms and conditions of employment\n1.   Each Party shall ensure, irrespective of which law applies to the employment relationship, that road haulage operators guarantee, on the basis of equality of treatment, to drivers who are posted to their territory the terms and conditions of employment covering the following matters which, in the Party or, in the case of the Union, in the Member State where the work is carried out, are laid down:\n—\nby law, regulation or administrative provision, and/or\n—\nby collective agreements or arbitration awards which have been declared universally applicable or otherwise apply in accordance with paragraph 4:\n(a)\nmaximum work periods and minimum rest periods;\n(b)\nminimum paid annual leave;\n(c)\nremuneration, including overtime rates; this point does not apply to supplementary occupational retirement pension schemes;\n(d)\nhealth, safety and hygiene at work;\n(e)\nprotective measures with regard to the terms and conditions of employment of pregnant women or women who have recently given birth, of children and of young people; and\n(f)\nequality of treatment between men and women and other provisions on non-discrimination.\n2.   For the purposes of this Section, the concept of remuneration shall be determined by the national law and/or practice of the Party and, in the case of the Union, by the national law and/or practice of the Member State, to whose territory the driver is posted and means all the constituent elements of remuneration rendered mandatory by national law, regulation or administrative provision, or by collective agreements or arbitration awards which, in that Party or in that Member State, have been declared universally applicable or otherwise apply in accordance with paragraph 4.\n3.   Allowances specific to the posting shall be considered to be part of remuneration, unless they are paid in reimbursement of expenditure actually incurred on account of the posting, such as expenditure on travel, board and lodging. The road haulage operator shall reimburse the posted driver for such expenditure in accordance with the law and/or practice applicable to the employment relationship.\nWhere the terms and conditions of employment applicable to the employment relationship do not determine which elements of the allowance specific to the posting are paid in reimbursement of expenditure actually incurred on account of the posting or which are part of remuneration, then the entire allowance shall be considered to be paid in reimbursement of expenditure.\n4.

Nothing in this Section shall affect the application on the Union territory of the Union rules on recording equipment in road transport to Union road haulage operators.\nArticle 4\nData protection\n1.   Each Party shall ensure that the processing of personal data in the context of this Section is carried out solely for the purpose of verifying compliance with this Section.\n2.   Each Party shall, in particular, ensure that personal data are protected against uses other than the one strictly referred to in paragraph 1 in relation to:\n(a)\nthe use of a global navigation satellite system (GNSS) for the recording of location data as referred to in the technical specification for smart tachograph 1 and smart tachograph 2;\n(b)\nthe electronic exchange of information on driver cards as referred to in Article 13, and in particular any cross-border exchanges of such data with third Parties; and\n(c)\nthe keeping of records by road haulage operators as referred to in Article 15.\n3.   Digital tachographs shall be designed in such a way as to ensure privacy. Only data necessary for the purposes referred to in paragraph 1 shall be processed.\n4.   Owners of vehicles, road haulage operators and any other entity concerned shall comply with the relevant provisions on the protection of personal data.\nArticle 5\nInstallation and repair\n1.   Tachographs may be installed or repaired only by fitters, workshops or vehicle manufacturers approved by the competent authorities in a Party for that purpose in accordance with Article 7.\n2.   Approved fitters, workshops or vehicle manufacturers shall seal the tachograph after having verified that it is functioning properly, and, in particular, in such a way as to ensure that no manipulation device can tamper with or alter the data recorded.\n3.   The approved fitter, workshop or vehicle manufacturer shall place a special mark on the seals which it affixes and, in addition, for digital, smart 1 and smart 2 tachographs, shall enter the electronic security data for carrying out authentication checks. Each Party shall keep and publish a register of the marks and electronic security data used and the necessary information related to the electronic security data used.\n4.   For the purpose of certifying that the installation of the tachograph took place in accordance with the requirements of this Section, an installation plaque shall be affixed in such a way as to be clearly visible and easily accessible.\n5.   Tachograph components shall be sealed. Any connections to the tachograph which are potentially vulnerable to tampering, including the connection between the motion sensor and the gearbox, and the installation plaque where relevant, shall be sealed.\nA seal shall be removed or broken only:\n—\nby fitters or workshops approved by the competent authorities under Article 7 for repair, maintenance or recalibration purposes of the tachograph, or by control officers properly trained and, where required authorised, for control purposes; or\n—\nfor the purpose of vehicle repair or modification which affects the seal. In such cases, a written statement stating the date and time at which the seal was broken and giving the reasons for the seal removal shall be kept on board the vehicle.\nThe removed or broken seals shall be replaced by an approved fitter or a workshop without undue delay and at the latest within seven days of their removal or breaking. When the seals have been removed or broken for control purposes, they may be replaced by a control officer equipped with sealing equipment and a unique special mark without undue delay.\nWhen a control officer removes a seal, the control card shall be inserted in the tachograph from the moment of the removal of the seal until the inspection is finished, including in the case of the placement of a new seal. The control officer shall issue a written statement containing at least the following information:\n—\nvehicle identification number;\n—\nname of the officer;\n—\ncontrol authority and country;\n—\nnumber of the control card;\n—\nnumber of the removed seal;\n—\ndate and time of seal removal; and\n—\nnumber of the new seal, where the control officer has placed a new seal.\nBefore replacing the seals, a check and calibration of the tachograph shall be performed by an approved workshop, except where a seal has been removed or broken for control purposes and replaced by a control officer.\nArticle 6\nInspections of tachographs\n1.   Tachographs shall be subject to regular inspection by approved workshops. Regular inspections shall be carried out at least every two years.\n2.   The inspections referred to in paragraph 1 shall check at least the following:\n—\nthe tachograph is correctly fitted and appropriate for the vehicle;\n—\nthe tachograph is working properly;\n—\nthe tachograph carries the type-approval mark;\n—\nthe installation plaque is affixed;\n—\nall seals are intact and effective;\n—\nthere are no manipulation devices attached to the tachograph or traces of the use of such devices; and\n—\nthe tyre size and the actual circumference of the tyres.\n3.   Workshops shall draw up an inspection report in cases where irregularities in the functioning of the tachograph had to be remedied, whether as a result of a periodic inspection or of an inspection carried out at the specific request of the national competent authority. They shall keep a list of all inspection reports drawn up.\n4.   Inspection reports shall be retained for a minimum period of two years from the time the report was made. Each Party shall decide whether inspection reports are to be retained or sent to the competent authority during that period. In cases where the inspection reports are kept by the workshop, upon request from the competent authority, the workshop shall make available the reports of inspections and calibrations carried out during that period.\nArticle 7\nApproval of fitters, workshops and vehicle manufacturers\n1.   Each Party or, in the case of the Union, each Member State shall approve, regularly control and certify the fitters, workshops and vehicle manufacturers which may carry out installations, checks, inspections and repairs of tachographs.\n2.   Each Party or, in the case of the Union, each Member State shall ensure that fitters, workshops and vehicle manufacturers are competent and reliable. For that purpose, they shall establish and publish a set of clear national procedures and shall ensure that the following minimum criteria are met:\n(a)\nthe staff are properly trained;\n(b)\nthe equipment necessary to carry out the relevant tests and tasks is available; and\n(c)\nthe fitters, workshops and vehicle manufacturers are of good repute.\n3.   Audits of approved fitters or workshops shall be carried out as follows:\n(a)\napproved fitters or workshops shall be subject, at least every two years, to an audit of the procedures they apply when handling tachographs. The audit shall focus in particular on the security measures taken and the handling of workshop cards. Parties or, in the case of the Union, Member States may carry out these audits without conducting a site visit; and\n(b)\nunannounced technical audits of approved fitters or workshops shall also take place in order to check the calibrations, inspections and installations carried out. Those audits shall cover at least 10 % of the approved fitters and workshops annually.\n4.   Each Party and their competent authorities shall take appropriate measures to prevent conflicts of interests between fitters or workshops and road haulage operators. In particular, where there is a serious risk of a conflict of interests, additional specific measures shall be taken to ensure that the fitter or workshop complies with this Section.\n5.   The competent authorities of each Party shall withdraw approvals, either temporarily or permanently, from fitters, workshops and vehicle manufacturers which fail to meet their obligations under this Section.\nArticle 8\nWorkshop cards\n1.   The period of validity of workshop cards shall not exceed one year. When renewing the workshop card, the competent authority shall ensure that the criteria listed in Article 7(2) are met by the fitter, workshop or vehicle manufacturer.\n2.   The competent authority shall renew a workshop card within 15 working days after receipt of a valid renewal request and all the necessary documentation. If a workshop card is damaged, malfunctions, or is lost or stolen, the competent authority shall supply a replacement card within five working days of receiving a detailed request to that effect. Competent authorities shall maintain a register of lost, stolen or defective cards.\n3.   If a Party or, in the case of the Union, a Member State withdraws the approval of a fitter, workshop or vehicle manufacturer as provided for in Article 7, it shall also withdraw the workshop cards issued thereto.\n4.   Each Party shall take all necessary measures to prevent the workshop cards distributed to approved fitters, workshops and vehicle manufacturers from being falsified.\nArticle 9\nIssuing of driver cards\n1.   Driver cards shall be issued, at the request of the driver, by the competent authority in a Party where the driver has his normal residence. Where the competent authorities in a Party issuing the driver card have doubts as to the validity of a statement as to normal residence, or for the purpose of certain specific controls, they may request any additional information or evidence from the driver.\nFor the purposes of this Article, \"normal residence\" means the place where a person usually lives, that is for at least 185 days in each calendar year, because of personal and occupational ties, or, in the case of a person with no occupational ties, because of personal ties which show close links between that person and the place where he is living.\nHowever, the normal residence of a person whose occupational ties are in a place different from their personal ties and who consequently lives in turn in different places situated in the two Parties shall be regarded as being the place of their personal ties, provided that such person returns there regularly. This last condition need not be complied with where the person is living in a Party in order to carry out a fixed-term assignment.\n2.   In duly justified and exceptional cases, each Party or, in the case of the Union, a Member State may issue a temporary and non-renewable driver card valid for a maximum period of 185 days to a driver who does not have his normal residence in a Party, provided that such driver is in a labour law relationship with an undertaking established in the issuing Party and, in so far, presents a driver attestation when required.\n3.   The competent authorities of the issuing Party shall take appropriate measures to ensure that an applicant does not already hold a valid driver card and shall personalise the driver card, ensuring that its data are visible and secure.\n4.   The driver card shall not be valid for more than five years.\n5.   A valid driver card shall not be withdrawn or suspended unless the competent authorities of a Party find that the card has been falsified, or the driver is using a card of which he is not the holder, or the card held has been obtained on the basis of false declarations and/or forged documents. If such suspension or withdrawal measures are taken by a Party or, in the case of the Union, a Member State other than the issuing Party or, in the case of the Union, other than the issuing Member State, the former shall return the card to the authorities of the Party or, in the case of the Union, the authorities of the Member State which issued it, as soon as possible, indicating the reasons for the withdrawal or suspension. If the return of the card is expected to take longer than two weeks, the suspending or withdrawing Party or, in the case of the Union, the suspending or withdrawing Member State shall inform the issuing Party or, in the case of the Union, the issuing Member State within those two weeks of the reasons for suspension or withdrawal.\n6.   The competent authority of the issuing Party may require a driver to replace the driver card by a new one if this is necessary to comply with the relevant technical specifications.\n7.   Each Party shall take all necessary measures to prevent driver cards from being falsified.\n8.   This Article shall not prevent a Party or, in the case of the Union, a Member State from issuing a driver card to a driver who has his normal residence in a part of that Party's territory, to which this Annex does not apply, provided that the relevant provisions of this Section are applied in such cases.\nArticle 10\nRenewal of driver cards\n1.   Where, in the case of renewals, the Party of the driver's normal residence is different from that which issued his current card, and where the authorities of the former Party are requested to renew the driver card, they shall inform the authorities which issued the earlier card of the reasons for its renewal.\n2.   In the event of a request for the renewal of a card which is imminently about to expire, the competent authority shall supply a new card before the expiry date, provided that the request was sent within the time-limits laid down in Article 5 of Section 4 of Part B.\nArticle 11\nStolen, lost or defective driver cards\n1.   Issuing authorities shall keep records of issued, stolen, lost or defective driver cards for a period at least equivalent to their period of validity.\n2.   If the driver card is damaged, malfunctions or is lost or stolen, the competent authorities in the Party of his normal residence shall supply a replacement card within eight working days after their receipt of a detailed request to that effect.\nArticle 12\nMutual acceptance of driver cards\n1.   Each Party shall accept the driver cards issued by the other Party.\n2.   Where the holder of a valid driver card issued by a Party has established his normal residence in the other Party and has asked for his card to be exchanged for an equivalent driver card, it shall be the responsibility of the Party or, in the case of the Union, the Member State which carries out the exchange to verify whether the card produced is still valid.\n3.   Parties or, in the case of the Union, Member States carrying out an exchange shall return the old card to the authorities of the issuing Party or, in the case of the Union, the issuing Member State and indicate the reasons for so doing.\n4.   Where a Party or, in the case of the Union, a Member State replaces or exchanges a driver card, the replacement or exchange, and any subsequent replacement or exchange, shall be registered in that Party or, in the case of the Union, in that Member State.\nArticle 13\nElectronic exchange of information on driver cards\n1.   In order to ensure that an applicant does not already hold a valid driver card, Parties or, in the case of the Union, Member States shall maintain national electronic registers containing the following information on driver cards for a period at least equivalent to the period of validity of those cards:\n—\nsurname and first name of the driver;\n—\nbirth date and, if available, place of birth of the driver;\n—\nvalid driving licence number and country of issue of the driving licence (if applicable);\n—\nstatus of the driver card; and\n—\ndriver card number.\n2.   The electronic registers of the Parties or, in the case of the Union, the Member States shall be interconnected and accessible throughout the territory of the Parties, using the TACHOnet messaging system or a compatible system. In the case of the use of a compatible system, the exchange of electronic data with the other Party shall be possible through the TACHOnet messaging system.\n3.   When issuing, replacing and, where necessary, renewing a driver card, Parties or, in the case of the Union, Member States shall verify through electronic data exchange that the driver does not already hold another valid driver card. The data exchanged shall be limited to the data necessary for the purpose of this verification.\n4.   Control officers may have access to the electronic register in order to check the status of a driver card.\nArticle 14\nSettings of tachographs\n1.   Digital tachographs shall not be set in such a way that they automatically switch to a specific category of activity when the vehicle's engine or ignition is switched off, unless the driver remains able to choose manually the appropriate category of activity.\n2.   Vehicles shall not be fitted with more than one tachograph, except for the purposes of field tests.\n3.   Each Party shall forbid the production, distribution, advertising and/or selling of devices constructed and/or intended for the manipulation of tachographs.\nArticle 15\nResponsibility of road haulage operators\n1.   Road haulage operators shall be responsible for ensuring that their drivers are properly trained and instructed as regards the correct functioning of tachographs, whether digital, smart or analogue, shall make regular checks to ensure that their drivers make correct use thereof, and shall not give to their drivers any direct or indirect incentives that could encourage the misuse of tachographs.\nRoad haulage operators shall issue a sufficient number of record sheets to drivers of vehicles fitted with analogue tachographs, taking into account the fact that record sheets are personal in character, the length of the period of service and the possible need to replace record sheets which are damaged or have been taken by an authorised control officer. Road haulage operators shall issue to drivers only record sheets of an approved model suitable for use in the equipment installed in the vehicle.\nThe road haulage operator shall ensure that, taking into account the length of the period of service, the printing of data from the tachograph at the request of a control officer can be carried out correctly in the event of an inspection.\n2.   Road haulage operators shall keep record sheets and printouts, whenever printouts have been made to comply with Article 9 of Section 4 of Part B of this Annex, in chronological order and in a legible form, for at least a year after their use, and shall give copies to the drivers concerned who request them. Road haulage operators shall also give copies of data downloaded from driver cards to the drivers concerned who request them, together with printed paper versions of those copies. Record sheets, printouts and downloaded data shall be produced or handed over at the request of any authorised control officer.\n3.   Road haulage operators shall be liable for infringements of this Section and of Section 4 of Part B of this Annex committed by their drivers or by drivers at their disposal. However, each Party may make such liability conditional on the road haulage operator's infringement of the first subparagraph of paragraph 1 of this Article and Article 7(1) and (2) of Section 2 of Part B of this Annex.\nArticle 16\nProcedures for road haulage operators in the event of malfunctioning equipment\n1.   In the event of the breakdown or faulty operation of a tachograph, the road haulage operator shall have it repaired by an approved fitter or workshop, as soon as circumstances permit.\n2.   If the vehicle is unable to return to the road haulage operator's premises within a period of one week calculated from the day of the breakdown or of the discovery of defective operation, the repair shall be carried out en route.\n3.   Each Party or, in the case of the Union, the Member States shall give the competent authorities power to prohibit the use of the vehicle in cases where the breakdown or faulty operation has not been remedied as provided in paragraphs 1 and 2 in so far as this is in accordance with the national legislation in the Party concerned.\nArticle 17\nProcedure for the issuing of tachograph cards\nThe European Commission shall provide to the competent authorities of the United Kingdom the cryptographic material for the issuing of tachograph cards for drivers, workshops and control authorities, in accordance with the European Root Certification Authority (ERCA) certificate policy and the certificate policy of the United Kingdom.\n(1)  Established by Regulation (EU) No 1024/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 October 2012 on administrative cooperation through the Internal Market Information System and repealing Commission Decision 2008/49/EC (\"the IMI Regulation\") (OJ EU L 316, 14.11.2012, p. 1).\n(2)  Regulation (EU) No 1024/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 October 2012 on administrative cooperation through the Internal Market Information System and repealing Commission Decision 2008/49/EC (\"the IMI Regulation\") (OJ EU L 316, 14.11.2012, p. 1).\n(3)  Regulation (EU) No 165/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 4 February 2014 on tachographs in road transport, repealing Council Regulation (EEC) No 3821/85 on recording equipment in road transport and amending Regulation (EC) No 561/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council on the harmonisation of certain social legislation relating to road transport (OJ EU L 60, 28.2.2014, p. 1).\n(4)  Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2016/799 of 18 March 2016 implementing Regulation (EU) No 165/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council laying down the requirements for the construction, testing, installation, operation and repair of tachographs and their components (OJ EU L 139, 26.5.2016, p. 1).\n(5)  Regulation (EU) No 165/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 4 February 2014 on tachographs in road transport, repealing Council Regulation (EEC) No 3821/85 on recording equipment in road transport and amending Regulation (EC) No 561/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council on the harmonisation of certain social legislation relating to road transport (OJ EU L 60, 28.2.2014, p. 1).\n(6)  Council Regulation (EC) No 2135/98 of 24 September 1998 amending Regulation (EEC) No 3821/85 on recording equipment in road transport and Directive 88/599/EEC concerning the application of Regulations (EEC) No 3820/84 and (EEC) No 3821/85 (OJ EC L 274, 9.10.1998, p. 1).\n(7)  Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2016/68 of 21 January 2016 on common procedures and specifications necessary for the interconnection of electronic registers of driver cards (OJ EU L 15, 22.1.2016, p. 51).\nANNEX 32\nMODEL OF AUTHORISATION FOR AN INTERNATIONAL REGULAR AND SPECIAL REGULAR SERVICE\n(First page of authorisation)\n(Orange paper – DIN A4)\n(To be worded in the official language(s) or one of the official languages of the Party where the request is made)\nAuthorisation\nIn accordance with Title II of Heading Three of Part Two of the Trade and Cooperation Agreement between the European Union and the European Atomic Energy Community, of the one part, and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, of the other part,\nISSUING STATE: …\nAuthorising authority: …\nIssuing State distinguishing sign: … (1)\nAUTHORISATION No.: … for a regular service ☐ (\n2\n) for a special regular service ☐ (2)\nby coach and bus between the Parties to the Trade and Cooperation Agreement between the European Union and the European Atomic Energy Community, of the one part, and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, of the other part,\nTo: …\n…\nLast name, first name or trade name of the operator or of the managing operator in the case of a group of undertakings or in the case of a partnership:\nAddress:\n…\n…\nTelephone and fax or e-mail:\n…\n…\n(Second page of authorisation)\nName, address, telephone and fax or e-mails of the operator, or, in the case of groups of operators or partnerships, the names of all operators of the group or of the partnership;

The adjustment period shall last from 1 January 2021 until 30 June 2026.\nArticle 2\n1.   By way of derogation from Article 500(1), (3), (4), (5), (6) and (7) of this Agreement, during the adjustment period each Party shall grant to vessels of the other Party full access to its waters to fish:\n(a)\nstocks listed in Annex 35 and in tables A, B and F of Annex 36 at a level that is reasonably commensurate with the Parties’ respective shares of the fishing opportunities;\n(b)\nnon quota stocks at a level that equates to the average tonnage fished by that Party in the waters of the other Party during the period 2012-2016;\n(c)\nfor qualifying vessels to the zone in the waters of the Parties between six and twelve nautical miles from the baselines in ICES divisions 4c and 7d-g to the extent that each Party's qualifying vessels had access to that zone on 31 December 2020.\nFor the purposes point (c), \"qualifying vessel\" means a vessel of a Party, which fished in the zone mentioned in the previous sentence in at least four years between 2012 and 2016, or its direct replacement.\n2.   The Parties shall notify the other Party of any change in the level and conditions of access to waters that will apply from 1 July 2026.\n3.   Article 501 of this Agreement shall apply mutatis mutandis in relation to any change under paragraph 2 of this Article in respect of the period from 1 July 2026 to 31 December 2026.\nANNEX 39\nEXCHANGES OF DNA, FINGERPRINTS AND VEHICLE REGISTRATION DATA\nCHAPTER 0\nGENERAL PROVISIONS\nArticle 1\nAim\nThe aim of this Annex is to lay down the necessary data protection, administrative and technical provisions for the implementation of Title II of Part Three of this Agreement.\nArticle 2\nTechnical specifications\nStates shall observe common technical specifications in connection with all requests and answers related to searches and comparisons of DNA profiles, dactyloscopic data and vehicle registration data. These technical specifications are laid down in Chapters 1 to 3.\nArticle 3\nCommunications network\nThe electronic exchange of DNA data, dactyloscopic data and vehicle registration data between States shall take place using the Trans European Services for Telematics between Administrations (TESTA II) communications network and further developments thereof.\nArticle 4\nAvailability of automated data exchange\nStates shall take all necessary measures to ensure that automated searching or comparison of DNA data, dactyloscopic data and vehicle registration data is possible 24 hours a day and seven days a week. In the event of a technical fault, the States' national contact points shall immediately inform each other and shall agree on temporary alternative information exchange arrangements in accordance with the legal provisions applicable. Automated data exchange shall be re-established as quickly as possible.\nArticle 5\nReference numbers for DNA data and dactyloscopic data\nThe reference numbers referred to in Articles 529 and 533 of this Agreement shall consist of a combination of the following:\n(a)\na code allowing the States, in the case of a match, to retrieve personal data and other information in their databases in order to supply it to one, several or all of the States in accordance with Article 536 of this Agreement;\n(b)\na code to indicate the national origin of the DNA profile or dactyloscopic data; and\n(c)\nwith respect to DNA data, a code to indicate the type of DNA profile.\nArticle 6\nPrinciples of DNA data exchange\n1.   States shall use existing standards for DNA data exchange, such as the European Standard Set (ESS) or the Interpol Standard Set of Loci (ISSOL).\n2.   The transmission procedure, in the case of automated searching and comparison of DNA profiles, shall take place within a decentralised structure.\n3.   Appropriate measures shall be taken to ensure confidentiality and integrity of data being sent to other States, including their encryption.\n4.   States shall take the necessary measures to guarantee the integrity of the DNA profiles made available or sent for comparison to the other States and to ensure that those measures comply with international standards such as ISO 17025.\n5.   States shall use State codes in accordance with the ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 standard.\nArticle 7\nRules for requests and answers in connection with DNA data\n1.   A request for an automated search or comparison, as referred to in Article 530 or 531 of this Agreement, shall include only the following information:\n(a)\nthe State code of the requesting State;\n(b)\nthe date, time and indication number of the request;\n(c)\nDNA profiles and their reference numbers;\n(d)\nthe types of DNA profiles transmitted (unidentified DNA profiles or reference DNA profiles); and\n(e)\ninformation required for controlling the database systems and quality control for the automatic search processes.\n2.   The answer (matching report) to the request referred to in paragraph 1 shall contain only the following information:\n(a)\nan indication as to whether there were one or more matches (HITs) or no matches (No-HITs);\n(b)\nthe date, time and indication number of the request;\n(c)\nthe date, time and indication number of the answer;\n(d)\nthe State codes of the requesting and requested States;\n(e)\nthe reference numbers of the requesting and requested States;\n(f)\nthe type of DNA profiles transmitted (unidentified DNA profiles or reference DNA profiles);\n(g)\nthe requested and matching DNA profiles; and\n(h)\ninformation required for controlling the database systems and quality control for the automatic search processes.\n3.   Automated notification of a match shall only be provided if the automated search or comparison has resulted in a match of a minimum number of loci. That minimum is set out in Chapter 1.\n4.   The States shall ensure that requests comply with declarations issued pursuant to Article 529(3) of this Agreement.\nArticle 8\nTransmission procedure for automated searching of unidentified DNA profiles in accordance with Article 530\n1.   If, in a search with an unidentified DNA profile, no match has been found in the national database or a match has been found with an unidentified DNA profile, the unidentified DNA profile may then be transmitted to all other States' databases and if, in a search with this unidentified DNA profile, matches are found with reference DNA profiles and/or unidentified DNA profiles in other States' databases, these matches shall be automatically communicated and the DNA reference data transmitted to the requesting State; if no matches can be found in other States' databases, it shall be automatically communicated to the requesting State.\n2.   If, in a search with an unidentified DNA profile, a match is found in other States' databases, each State concerned may insert a note to that effect in its national database.\nArticle 9\nTransmission procedure for automated search of reference DNA profiles in accordance with Article 530\nIf, in a search with a reference DNA profile, no match has been found in the national database with a reference DNA profile or a match has been found with an unidentified DNA profile, this reference DNA profile may then be transmitted to all other States' databases and if, in a search with this reference DNA profile, matches are found with reference DNA profiles and/or unidentified DNA profiles in other States' databases, these matches shall be automatically communicated and the DNA reference data transmitted to the requesting State; if no matches can be found in other States' databases, it shall be automatically communicated to the requesting State.\nArticle 10\nTransmission procedure for automated comparison of unidentified DNA profiles in accordance with Article 531\n1.   If, in a comparison with unidentified DNA profiles, matches are found in other States' databases with reference DNA profiles and/or unidentified DNA profiles, these matches shall be automatically communicated and the DNA reference data transmitted to the requesting State.\n2.   If, in a comparison with unidentified DNA profiles, matches are found in other States' databases with unidentified DNA profiles or reference DNA profiles, each State concerned may insert a note to that effect in its national database.\nArticle 11\nPrinciples for the exchange of dactyloscopic data\n1.   The digitalisation of dactyloscopic data and their transmission to the other States shall be carried out in accordance with the uniform data format specified in Chapter 2.\n2.   Each State shall ensure that the dactyloscopic data it transmits are of sufficient quality for a comparison by the automated fingerprint identification systems (AFIS).\n3.   The transmission procedure for the exchange of dactyloscopic data shall take place within a decentralised structure.\n4.

The States shall use State codes in accordance with the ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 standard.\nArticle 12\nSearch capacities for dactyloscopic data\n1.   Each State shall ensure that its search requests do not exceed the search capacities specified by the requested State. The United Kingdom shall declare their maximum search capacities per day for dactyloscopic data of identified persons and for dactyloscopic data of persons not yet identified.\n2.   The maximum numbers of candidates accepted for verification per transmission are set out in Chapter 2.\nArticle 13\nRules for requests and answers in connection with dactyloscopic data\n1.   The requested State shall check the quality of the transmitted dactyloscopic data without delay by a fully automated procedure. Should the data be unsuitable for an automated comparison, the requested State shall inform the requesting State without delay.\n2.   The requested State shall conduct searches in the order in which requests are received. Requests shall be processed within 24 hours by a fully automated procedure. The requesting State may, if its domestic law so prescribes, ask for accelerated processing of its requests and the requested State shall conduct these searches without delay. If deadlines cannot be met for reasons of force majeure, the comparison shall be carried out without delay as soon as the impediments have been removed.\nArticle 14\nPrinciples of automated searching of vehicle registration data\n1.   For automated searching of vehicle registration data States shall use a version of the European Vehicle and Driving Licence Information System (Eucaris) software application especially designed for the purposes of Article 537 of this Agreement, and amended versions of that software.\n2.   Automated searching of vehicle registration data shall take place within a decentralised structure.\n3.   The information exchanged via the Eucaris system shall be transmitted in encrypted form.\n4.   The data elements of the vehicle registration data to be exchanged are specified in Chapter 3.\n5.   In the implementation of Article 537 of this Agreement, States may give priority to searches related to combating serious crime.\nArticle 15\nCosts\nEach State shall bear the costs arising from the administration, use and maintenance of the Eucaris software application referred to in Article 14(1).\nArticle 16\nPurpose\n1.   Processing of personal data by the receiving State shall be permitted solely for the purposes for which the data have been supplied in accordance with Title II of Part Three of this Agreement. Processing for other purposes shall be permitted solely with the prior authorisation of the State administering the file and subject only to the domestic law of the receiving State. Such authorisation may be granted provided that processing for such other purposes is permitted under the domestic law of the State administering the file.\n2.   Processing of data supplied pursuant to Articles 530, 531 and 534 of this Agreement by the searching or comparing State shall be permitted solely in order to:\n(a)\nestablish whether the compared DNA profiles or dactyloscopic data match;\n(b)\nprepare and submit a police or judicial request for legal assistance in compliance with domestic law if those data match;\n(c)\nrecord within the meaning of Article 19 of this Chapter.\n3.   The State administering the file may process the data supplied to it in accordance with Articles 530, 531 and 534 of this Agreement solely where this is necessary for the purposes of comparison, providing automated replies to searches or recording pursuant to Article 19 of this Chapter. The supplied data shall be deleted immediately following data comparison or automated replies to searches unless further processing is necessary for the purposes referred to in points (b) and (c) of paragraph 2 of this Article.\n4.   Data supplied in accordance with Article 537 of this Agreement may be used by the State administering the file solely where this is necessary for the purpose of providing automated replies to search procedures or recording pursuant to Article 19 of this Chapter. The data supplied shall be deleted immediately following automated replies to searches unless further processing is necessary for recording pursuant to Article 19 of this Chapter. The Member State may use data received in a reply solely for the procedure for which the search was made.\nArticle 17\nAccuracy, current relevance and storage time of data\n1.   The States shall ensure the accuracy and current relevance of personal data. The receiving State shall be notified without delay if it transpires ex officio, or from a notification by the data subject, that incorrect data or data which should not have been supplied have been supplied. The State(s) concerned shall be obliged to correct or delete the data. Moreover, personal data supplied shall be corrected if they are found to be incorrect. If the receiving body has reason to believe that the supplied data are incorrect or should be deleted, the supplying body shall be informed forthwith.\n2.   Data, the accuracy of which the data subject contests and the accuracy or inaccuracy of which cannot be established shall, in accordance with the domestic law of the States, be marked with a flag at the request of the data subject. If a flag exists, this may be removed subject to the domestic law of the States and only with the permission of the data subject or on the basis of a decision of the competent court or independent data protection authority.\n3.   Personal data supplied which should not have been supplied or received shall be deleted. Data which are lawfully supplied and received shall be deleted:\n(a)\nif they are not or no longer necessary for the purpose for which they were supplied; if personal data have been supplied without request, the receiving body shall immediately check if they are necessary for the purposes for which they were supplied;\n(b)\nfollowing the expiry of the maximum period for keeping data laid down in the domestic law of the supplying State, where the supplying body informed the receiving body of that maximum period at the time of supplying the data.\n4.   Where there is reason to believe that deletion would prejudice the interests of the data subject, the data shall be blocked instead of being deleted in compliance with domestic law. Blocked data may be supplied or used solely for the purpose which prevented their deletion.\nArticle 18\nTechnical and organisational measures to ensure data protection and data security\n1.   The supplying and receiving bodies shall take steps to ensure that personal data is effectively protected against accidental or unauthorised destruction, accidental loss, unauthorised access, unauthorised or accidental alteration and unauthorised disclosure.\n2.   The features of the technical specification of the automated search procedure are regulated in the implementing measures as referred to in Article 539 of this Agreement which guarantee that:\n(a)\nstate-of-the-art technical measures are taken to ensure data protection and data security, in particular data confidentiality and integrity;\n(b)\nencryption and authorisation procedures recognised by the competent authorities are used when having recourse to generally accessible networks; and\n(c)\nthe admissibility of searches in accordance with paragraphs 2, 5 and 6 of Article 19 of this Chapter can be checked.\nArticle 19\nLogging and recording: special rules governing automated and non-automated supply\n1.   Each State shall guarantee that every non-automated supply and every non-automated receipt of personal data by the body administering the file and by the searching body is logged in order to verify the admissibility of the supply. Logging shall contain the following information:\n(a)\nthe reason for the supply;\n(b)\nthe data supplied;\n(c)\nthe date of the supply; and\n(d)\nthe name or reference code of the searching body and of the body administering the file.\n2.   The following shall apply to automated searches for data based on Articles 530, 534 and 537 of this Agreement and to automated comparison pursuant to Article 531 of this Agreement:\n(a)\nonly specially authorised officers of the national contact points may carry out automated searches or comparisons; the list of officers authorised to carry out automated searches or comparisons shall be made available upon request to the supervisory authorities referred to in paragraph 6 and to the other States;\n(b)\neach State shall ensure that each supply and receipt of personal data by the body administering the file and the searching body is recorded, including notification of whether or not a HIT exists; recording shall include the following information:\n(i)\nthe data supplied;\n(ii)\nthe date and exact time of the supply; and\n(iii)\nthe name or reference code of the searching body and of the body administering the file.\n3.   The searching body shall also record the reason for the search or supply as well as an identifier for the official who carried out the search and the official who ordered the search or supply.\n4.   The recording body shall immediately communicate the recorded data upon request to the competent data protection authorities of the relevant State at the latest within four weeks following receipt of the request; recorded data may be used solely for the following purposes:\n(a)\nmonitoring data protection;\n(b)\nensuring data security.\n5.   The recorded data shall be protected with suitable measures against inappropriate use and other forms of improper use and shall be kept for two years. After the conservation period, the recorded data shall be deleted immediately.\n6.   Responsibility for legal checks on the supply or receipt of personal data lies with the independent data protection authorities or, as appropriate, the judicial authorities of the respective States. Anyone can request those authorities to check the lawfulness of the processing of data in respect of their person in compliance with domestic law. Independently of such requests, those authorities and the bodies responsible for recording shall carry out random checks on the lawfulness of supply, based on the files involved.\n7.   The results of such checks shall be kept for inspection for 18 months by the independent data protection authorities. After that period, they shall be immediately deleted. Each data protection authority may be requested by the independent data protection authority of another State to exercise its powers in accordance with domestic law. The independent data protection authorities of the States shall perform the inspection tasks necessary for mutual cooperation, in particular by exchanging relevant information.\nArticle 20\nData subjects' rights to damages\nWhere a body of one State has supplied personal data under Title II of Part Three of this Agreement, the receiving body of the other State cannot use the inaccuracy of the data supplied as grounds to evade its liability vis-à-vis the injured party under domestic law. If damages are awarded against the receiving body because of its use of inaccurate transfer data, the body which supplied the data shall refund the amount paid in damages to the receiving body in full.\nArticle 21\nInformation requested by the States\nThe receiving State shall inform the supplying State on request of the processing of supplied data and the result obtained.\nArticle 22\nDeclarations and designations\n1.   The United Kingdom shall communicate its declarations pursuant to Article 529(3) of this Agreement, and Article 12(1) of this Chapter, as well as its designations pursuant to Articles 535(1) and 537(3) of this Agreement to the Specialised Committee on Law Enforcement and Judicial Cooperation.\n2.   Factual information provided by the United Kingdom through these declarations and designations, and by Member States in accordance with Article 539(3) of this Agreement, are included in the Manual as referred to in Article 18(2) of Decision 2008/616/JHA.\n3.   States may amend declarations and designations submitted in accordance with paragraph 1 at any time by means of a notification submitted to the Specialised Committee on Law Enforcement and Judicial Cooperation. The Specialised Committee on Law Enforcement and Judicial Cooperation shall forward any declarations received to the General Secretariat of the Council.\n4.   The General Secretariat of the Council shall communicate any changes in the Manual referred to in paragraph 2 to the Specialised Committee on Law Enforcement and Judicial Cooperation.\nArticle 23\nPreparation of decisions as referred to in Article 540\n1.   The Council shall take a decision as referred to in Article 540 of this Agreement on the basis of an evaluation report which shall be based on a questionnaire.\n2.   With respect to the automated data exchange in accordance with Title II of Part Three of this Agreement, the evaluation report shall also be based on an evaluation visit and a pilot run that shall be carried out if required when the United Kingdom has informed the Specialised Committee on Law Enforcement and Judicial Cooperation that they have implemented the obligations imposed on them under Title II of Part Three of this Agreement and submit the declarations provided for in Article 22 of this Chapter. Further details of the procedure are set out in Chapter 4 of this Annex.\nArticle 24\nStatistics and reporting\n1.   An evaluation of the administrative, technical and financial application of the data exchange pursuant to Title II of Part Three of this Agreement shall be carried out on a regular basis. The evaluation shall be carried out with respect to the data categories for which data exchange has started among the States concerned. The evaluation shall be based on reports of the respective States.\n2.   Each State shall compile statistics on the results of the automated data exchange. In order to ensure comparability, the model for statistics will be compiled by the relevant Council Working Group. These statistics will be forwarded annually to the Specialised Committee on Law Enforcement and Judicial Cooperation.\n3.   In addition, States will be requested on a regular basis not to exceed once per year to provide further information on the administrative, technical and financial implementation of automated data exchange as needed to analyse and improve the process.\n4.   Statistics and reporting made by Member States in accordance with Decisions 2008/615/JHA and 2008/616/JHA shall apply in relation to this Article.\nCHAPTER 1\nEXCHANGE OF DNA-DATA\n1.   DNA related forensic issues, matching rules and algorithms\n1.1.   Properties of DNA-profiles\nThe DNA profile may contain 24 pairs of numbers representing the alleles of 24 loci which are also used in the DNA-procedures of Interpol. The names of those loci are provided in the following table:\nVWA\nTH01\nD21S11\nFGA\nD8S1179\nD3S1358\nD18S51\nAmelogenin\nTPOX\nCSF1P0\nD13S317\nD7S820\nD5S818\nD16S539\nD2S1338\nD19S433\nPenta D\nPenta E\nFES\nF13A1\nF13B\nSE33\nCD4\nGABA\nThe seven grey loci in the top row are both the present ESS and the ISSOL.\nInclusion Rules:\nThe DNA-profiles made available by the States for searching and comparison as well as the DNA-profiles sent out for searching and comparison shall contain at least six full designated (1) loci and may contain additional loci or blanks depending on their availability. The reference DNA profiles shall contain at least six of the seven ESS of loci. In order to raise the accuracy of matches, all available alleles shall be stored in the indexed DNA profile database and be used for searching and comparison. Each State should implement as soon as practically possible any new ESS of loci adopted by the EU.\nMixed profiles are not allowed, so that the allele values of each locus will consist of only two numbers, which may be the same in the case of homozygosity at a given locus.\nWild-cards and Micro-variants are to be dealt with using the following rules:\n—\nAny non-numerical value except amelogenin contained in the profile (e.g. \"o\", \"f\", \"r\", \"na\", \"nr\" or \"un\") has to be automatically converted for the export to a wild card (*) and searched against all,\n—\nNumerical values \"0\", \"1\" or \"99\" contained in the profile have to be automatically converted for the export to a wild card (*) and searched against all,\n—\nIf three alleles are provided for one locus the first allele will be accepted and the remaining two alleles have to be automatically converted for the export to a wild card (*) and searched against all,\n—\nWhen wild card values are provided for allele 1 or 2 then both permutations of the numerical value given for the locus will be searched (e.g. 12, * could match against 12,14 or 9,12),\n—\nPentanucleotide (Penta D, Penta E and CD4) micro-variants will be matched according to the following:\n—\nx.1 = x, x.1, x.2\n—\nx.2 = x.1, x.2, x.3\n—\nx.3 = x.2, x.3, x.4\n—\nx.4 = x.3, x.4, x + 1,\n—\nTetranucleotide (the rest of the loci are tetranucleotides) micro-variants will be matched according to the following:\n—\nx.1 = x, x.1, x.2\n—\nx.2 = x.1, x.2, x.3\n—\nx.3 = x.2, x.3, x + 1.\n1.2.   Matching rules\nThe comparison of two DNA-profiles will be performed on the basis of the loci for which a pair of allele values is available in both DNA-profiles. At least six full designated loci (exclusive of amelogenin) must match between both DNA-profiles before a HIT response is provided.\nA full match (Quality 1) is defined as a match, when all allele values of the compared loci commonly contained in the requesting and requested DNA-profiles are the same. A near match is defined as a match, when the value of only one of all the compared alleles is different in the two DNA profiles (Quality 2, 3 and 4). A near match is only accepted if there are at least six full designated matched loci in the two compared DNA profiles.\nThe reason for a near match may be:\n—\na human typing error at the point of entry of one of the DNA-profiles in the search request or the DNA-database,\n—\nan allele-determination or allele-calling error during the generation procedure of the DNA-profile.\n1.3.   Reporting rules\nFull matches, near matches and \"No-HITs\" will all be reported.\nThe matching report will be sent to the requesting national contact point and will also be made available to the requested national contact point (to enable it to estimate the nature and number of possible follow-up requests for further available personal data and other information associated with the DNA-profile corresponding to the HIT in accordance with Article 536 of this Agreement.\n2.   State code number table\nIn accordance with Title II of Part Three of this Agreement, ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 code are used for setting up the domain names and other configuration parameters required in the Prüm DNA data exchange applications over a closed network.\nISO 3166-1 alpha-2 codes are the following two-letter State codes:\nState names\nCode\nState names\nCode\nBelgium\nBE\nLithuania\nLT\nBulgaria\nBG\nLuxemburg\nLU\nCzech Republic\nCZ\nHungary\nHU\nDenmark\nDK\nMalta\nMT\nGermany\nDE\nNetherlands\nNL\nEstonia\nEE\nAustria\nAT\nIreland\nIE\nPoland\nPL\nGreece\nEL\nPortugal\nPT\nSpain\nES\nRomania\nRO\nFrance\nFR\nSlovakia\nSK\nCroatia\nHR\nSlovenia\nSI\nItaly\nIT\nFinland\nFI\nCyprus\nCY\nSweden\nSE\nLatvia\nLV\nUnited Kingdom\nUK\n3.   Functional analysis\n3.1.   Availability of the system\nRequests pursuant to Article 530 of this Agreement should reach the targeted database in the chronological order that each request was sent; responses should be dispatched to reach the requesting State within 15 minutes of the arrival of requests.\n3.2.   Second step\nWhen a State receives a report of a match, its national contact point is responsible for comparing the values of the profile submitted as a question and the values of the profile(s) received as an answer to validate and check the evidential value of the profile. National contact points can contact each other directly for validation purposes.\nLegal assistance procedures start after validation of an existing match between two profiles, on the basis of a \"full match\" or a \"near match\" obtained during the automated consultation phase.\n4.   DNA interface control document\n4.1.   Introduction\n4.1.1.   Objectives\nThis Chapter defines the requirements for the exchange of DNA profile information between the DNA database systems of all States. The header fields are defined specifically for the Prüm DNA exchange; the data part is based on the DNA profile data part in the XML schema defined for the Interpol DNA exchange gateway.\nData are exchanged by Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) and other state-of-the-art technologies, using a central relay mail server provided by the network provider. The XML file is transported as mail body.\n4.1.2.   Scope\nThis ICD defines the content of the message (or \"mail\") only. All network-specific and mail-specific topics are defined uniformly in order to allow a common technical base for the DNA data exchange.\nThis includes:\n—\nthe format of the subject field in the message to enable/allow for an automated processing of the messages,\n—\nwhether content encryption is necessary and if yes which methods should be chosen,\n—\nthe maximum length of messages.\n4.1.3.   XML structure and principles\nThe XML message is structured into:\n—\nthe header part, which contains information about the transmission, and\n—\nthe data part, which contains profile specific information, as well as the profile itself.\nThe same XML schema shall be used for request and response.\nFor the purpose of complete checks of unidentified DNA profiles, as provided for in Article 531 of this Agreement, it shall be possible to send a batch of profiles in one message. A maximum number of profiles within one message must be defined. The number depends on the maximum allowed mail size and shall be defined after selection of the mail server.\nXML example:\n<?version=\"1.0\" standalone=\"yes\"?>\n<PRUEMDNAx xmlns:msxsl=\"urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt\"\nxmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\">\n<header>\n(…)\n</header>\n<datas>\n(…)\n</datas>\n[<datas> datas structure repeated, if multiple profiles sent by (…) a single SMTP message, only allowed for Article 531 of this Agreement cases\n</datas>]\n</PRUEMDNA>\n4.2.

Application, security and communication architecture\n5.1.   Overview\nIn implementing applications for the DNA data exchange within the framework of Title II of Part Three of this Agreement, a common communication network shall be used, which will be logically closed among the States. In order to exploit this common communication infrastructure of sending requests and receiving replies in a more effective way, an asynchronous mechanism to convey DNA and dactyloscopic data requests in a wrapped SMTP e-mail message is adopted. In fulfilment of security concerns, the mechanism s/MIME as extension to the SMTP functionality will be used to establish a true end-to-end secure tunnel over the network.\nThe operational Trans European Services for Telematics between Administrations (TESTA) is used as the communication network for data exchange among the States. TESTA is under the responsibility of the European Commission. Taking into account that national DNA databases and the current national access points of TESTA may be located on different sites in the States, access to TESTA may be set up either by:\n1.\nusing the existing national access point or establishing a new national TESTA access point; or\n2.\nsetting up a secure local link from the site where the DNA database is located and managed by the competent national agency to the existing national TESTA access point.\nThe protocols and standards deployed in the implementation of Title II of Part Three of this Agreement applications comply with the open standards and meet the requirements imposed by national security policy makers of the States.\n5.2.   Upper Level Architecture\nIn the scope of Title II of Part Three of this Agreement, each State will make its DNA data available to be exchanged with and/or searched by other States in conformity with the standardised common data format. The architecture is based upon an any-to-any communication model. There exists neither a central computer server nor a centralised database to hold DNA profiles.\nIn addition to the fulfilment of domestic legal constraints at States' sites, each State may decide what kind of hardware and software should be deployed for the configuration at its site to comply with the requirements set out in Title II of Part Three of this Agreement.\n5.3.   Security Standards and Data Protection\nThree levels of security concerns have been considered and implemented.\n5.3.1.   Data Level\nDNA profile data provided by each State shall have to be prepared in compliance with a common data protection standard, so that requesting States will receive an answer mainly to indicate HIT or No-HIT along with an identification number in case of a HIT, which does not contain any personal information. The further investigation after the notification of a HIT will be conducted at bilateral level pursuant to the existing domestic legal and organisational regulations of the respective States' sites.\n5.3.2.   Communication Level\nMessages containing DNA profile information (requesting and replying) will be encrypted by means of a state-of-the-art mechanism in conformity with open standards, such as s/MIME, before they are forwarded to the sites of other States.\n5.3.3.   Transmission Level\nAll encrypted messages containing DNA profile information will be forwarded onto other States' sites through a virtual private tunnelling system administered by a trusted network provider at the international level and the secure links to this tunnelling system under national responsibility. This virtual private tunnelling system does not have a connection point with the open Internet.\n5.4.   Protocols and Standards to be used for encryption mechanism: s/MIME and related packages\nThe open standard s/MIME as extension to de facto e-mail standard SMTP will be deployed to encrypt messages containing DNA profile information. The protocol s/MIME (V3) allows signed receipts, security labels, and secure mailing lists and is layered on Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS), an Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) specification for cryptographic protected messages. It can be used to digitally sign, digest, authenticate or encrypt any form of digital data.\nThe underlying certificate used by the s/MIME mechanism has to be in compliance with X.509 standard. In order to ensure common standards and procedures with other Prüm applications, the processing rules for s/MIME encryption operations or to be applied under various Commercial Product of the Shelves (COTS) environments, are as follows:\n—\nthe sequence of the operations is: first encryption and then signing,\n—\nthe encryption algorithm AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) with 256 bit key length and RSA with 1024 bit key length shall be applied for symmetric and asymmetric encryption respectively,\n—\nthe hash algorithm SHA-1 shall be applied.\ns/MIME functionality is built into the vast majority of modern e-mail software packages including Outlook, Mozilla Mail as well as Netscape Communicator 4.x and inter-operates among all major e-mail software packages.\nBecause of s/MIME's easy integration into national IT infrastructure at all States' sites, it is selected as a viable mechanism to implement the communication security level. For achieving the goal \"Proof of Concept\" in a more efficient way and reducing costs the open standard JavaMail API is however chosen for prototyping DNA data exchange. JavaMail API provides simple encryption and decryption of e-mails using s/MIME and/or OpenPGP. The intent is to provide a single, easy-to-use API for e-mail clients that want to send and receive encrypted e-mail in either of the two most popular e-mail encryption formats. Therefore any state-of-the-art implementations to JavaMail API will suffice for the requirements set by Title II of Part Three of this Agreement, such as the product of Bouncy Castle JCE (Java Cryptographic Extension), which will be used to implement s/MIME for prototyping DNA data exchange among all States.\n5.5.   Application Architecture\nEach State will provide the other States with a set of standardised DNA profile data which are in conformity with the current common ICD. This can be done either by providing a logical view over individual national database or by establishing a physical exported database (indexed database).\nThe four main components: E-mail server/s/MIME, Application Server, Data Structure Area for fetching/feeding data and registering incoming/outgoing messages, and Match Engine implement the whole application logic in a product-independent way.\nIn order to provide all States with an easy integration of the components into their respective national sites, the specified common functionality has been implemented by means of open source components, which could be selected by each State depending on its national IT policy and regulations. Because of the independent features to be implemented to get access to indexed databases containing DNA profiles covered by Title II of Part Three of this Agreement, each State can freely select its hardware and software platform, including database and operating systems.\nA prototype for the DNA Data Exchange has been developed and successfully tested over the existing common network. The version 1.0 has been deployed in the productive environment and is used for daily operations. States may use the jointly developed product but may also develop their own products. The common product components will be maintained, customised and further developed according to changing IT, forensic and/or functional police requirements.\n5.6.   Protocols and Standards to be used for application architecture:\n5.6.1.   XML\nThe DNA data exchange will fully exploit XML-schema as attachment to SMTP e-mail messages. The eXtensible Markup Language (XML) is a W3C-recommended general-purpose markup language for creating special-purpose markup languages, capable of describing many different kinds of data. The description of the DNA profile suitable for exchange among all States has been done by means of XML and XML schema in the ICD document.\n5.6.2.   ODBC\nOpen DataBase Connectivity provides a standard software API method for accessing database management systems and making it independent of programming languages, database and operating systems. ODBC has, however, certain drawbacks. Administering a large number of client machines can involve a diversity of drivers and DLLs. This complexity can increase system administration overhead.\n5.6.3.   JDBC\nJava DataBase Connectivity (JDBC) is an API for the Java programming language that defines how a client may access a database. In contrast to ODBC, JDBC does not require to use a certain set of local DLLs at the Desktop.\nThe business logic of processing DNA profile requests and replies at each States' site is described in the following diagram. Both requesting and replying flows interact with a neutral data area comprising different data pools with a common data structure.\n5.7.   Communication Environment\n5.7.1.   Common Communication Network: TESTA and its follow-up infrastructure\nThe application DNA data exchange will exploit the e-mail, an asynchronous mechanism, to send requests and to receive replies among the States. As all States have at least one national access point to the TESTA network, the DNA data exchange will be deployed over the TESTA network. TESTA provides a number of added-value services through its e-mail relay. In addition to hosting TESTA specific e-mail boxes, the infrastructure can implement mail distribution lists and routing policies. This allows TESTA to be used as a clearing house for messages addressed to administrations connected to the EU wide Domains. Virus check mechanisms may also be put in place.\nThe TESTA e-mail relay is built on a high availability hardware platform located at the central TESTA application facilities and protected by firewall. The TESTA Domain Name Systems (DNS) will resolve resource locators to IP addresses and hide addressing issues from the user and from applications.\n5.7.2.   Security Concern\nThe concept of a Virtual Private Network (VPN) has been implemented within the framework of TESTA. Tag Switching Technology used to build this VPN will evolve to support Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) standard developed by the IETF.\nMPLS is an IETF standard technology that speeds up network traffic flow by avoiding packet analysis by intermediate routers (hops). This is done on the basis of so-called labels that are attached to packet by the edge routers of the backbone, on the basis of information stored in the forwarding information base (FIB). Labels are also used to implement VPNs.\nMPLS combines the benefits of layer 3 routing with the advantages of layer 2 switching. Because IP addresses are not evaluated during transition through the backbone, MPLS does not impose any IP addressing limitations.\nFurthermore, e-mail messages over the TESTA will be protected by s/MIME driven encryption mechanism. Without knowing the key and possessing the right certificate, nobody can decrypt messages over the network.\n5.7.3.   Protocols and Standards to be used over the communication network\n5.7.3.1.\nSMTP\nSMTP is the de facto standard for e-mail transmission across the Internet. SMTP is a relatively simple, text-based protocol, where one or more recipients of a message are specified and then the message text is transferred. SMTP uses TCP port 25 upon the specification by the IETF. To determine the SMTP server for a given domain name, the MX (Mail eXchange) DNS (Domain Name Systems) record is used.\nSince this protocol started as purely ASCII text-based it did not deal well with binary files. Standards such as MIME were developed to encode binary files for transfer through SMTP. Today, most SMTP servers support the 8BITMIME and s/MIME extension, permitting binary files to be transmitted almost as easily as plain text. The processing rules for s/MIME operations are described in the section s/MIME (see Section 5.4).\nSMTP is a \"push\" protocol that does not allow one to \"pull\" messages from a remote server on demand. To do this a mail client shall use POP3 or IMAP. Within the framework of implementing DNA data exchange it is decided to use the protocol POP3.\n5.7.3.2.\nPOP\nLocal e-mail clients use the Post Office Protocol version 3 (POP3), an application-layer Internet standard protocol, to retrieve e-mail from a remote server over a TCP/IP connection. By using the SMTP Submit profile of the SMTP protocol, e-mail clients send messages across the Internet or over a corporate network. MIME serves as the standard for attachments and non-ASCII text in e-mail. Although neither POP3 nor SMTP requires MIME-formatted e-mail, essentially Internet e-mail comes MIME-formatted, so POP clients must also understand and use MIME. The whole communication environment of Title II of Part Three of this Agreement will therefore include the components of POP.\n5.7.4.   Network Address Assignment\nOperative environment\nA dedicated block half B class subnet has currently been allocated by the European IP registration authority (RIPE) to TESTA. The assignment of IP addresses to States is based upon a geographical schema in Europe. The data exchange among States within the framework of Title II of Part Three of this Agreement is operated over a European wide logically closed IP network.\nTesting Environment\nIn order to provide a smooth running environment for the daily operation among all connected States, it is necessary to establish a testing environment over the closed network for new States which prepare to join the operations. A sheet of parameters including IP addresses, network settings, e-mail domains as well as application user accounts has been specified and should be set up at the corresponding State's site. Moreover, a set of pseudo DNA profiles has been constructed for test purposes.\n5.7.5.   Configuration Parameters\nA secure e-mail system is set up using the eu-admin.net domain. That domain with the associated addresses will not be accessible from a location not on the TESTA EU wide domain, because the names are only known on the TESTA central DNS server, which is shielded from the Internet.\nThe mapping of these TESTA site addresses (host names) to their IP addresses is done by the TESTA DNS service. For each Local Domain, a Mail entry will be added to this TESTA central DNS server, relaying all e-mail messages sent to TESTA Local Domains to the TESTA central Mail Relay. That TESTA central Mail Relay will then forward them to the specific Local Domain e-mail server using the Local Domain e-mail addresses. By relaying the e-mail in this way, critical information contained in e-mails will only pass the Europe-wide closed network infrastructure and not the insecure Internet.\nIt is necessary to establish sub-domains (bold italics) at the sites of all States upon the following syntax:\n\"application-type.State-code.pruem.testa.eu\", where:\n\"State-code\" takes the value of one of the two letter-code State codes (i.e. AT, BE, etc.);\n\"application-type\" takes one of the values: DNA, FP and CAR.\nBy applying the above syntax, the sub domains for the States are shown in the following table:\nStates' sub domains syntax\nState\nSub

2\nEXCHANGE OF DACTYLOSCOPIC DATA (INTERFACE CONTROL DOCUMENT)\nThe purpose of the following document interface Control Document is to define the requirements for the exchange of dactyloscopic information between the Automated Fingerprint Identification Systems (AFIS) of the States. It is based on the Interpol-Implementation of ANSI/NIST-ITL 1-2000 (INT-I, Version 4.22b).\nThis version shall cover all basic definitions for Logical Records Type-1, Type-2, Type-4, Type-9, Type-13 and Type-15 required for image- and minutiæ-based dactyloscopic processing.\n1.   File Content Overview\nA dactyloscopic file consists of several logical records. There are sixteen types of record specified in the original ANSI/NIST-ITL 1-2000 standard. Appropriate ASCII separation characters are used between each record and the fields and subfields within the records.\nOnly 6 record types are used to exchange information between the originating and the destination agency:\nType-1\n→\nTransaction information\nType-2\n→\nAlphanumeric persons/case data\nType-4\n→\nHigh resolution greyscale dactyloscopic images\nType-9\n→\nMinutiæ Record\nType-13\n→\nVariable resolution latent image record\nType-15\n→\nVariable resolution palmprint image record\n1.1.   Type-1 — File header\nThis record contains routing information and information describing the structure of the rest of the file. This record type also defines the types of transaction which fall under the following broad categories:\n1.2.   Type-2 — Descriptive text\nThis record contains textual information of interest to the sending and receiving agencies.\n1.3.   Type-4 — High resolution greyscale image\nThis record is used to exchange high resolution greyscale (eight bit) dactyloscopic images sampled at 500 pixels/inch. The dactyloscopic images shall be compressed using the WSQ algorithm with a ratio of not more than 15:1. Other compression algorithms or uncompressed images shall not be used.\n1.4.   Type-9 — Minutiæ record\nType-9 records are used to exchange ridge characteristics or minutiæ data. Their purpose is partly to avoid unnecessary duplication of AFIS encoding processes and partly to allow the transmission of AFIS codes which contain less data than the corresponding images.\n1.5.   Type-13 — Variable-Resolution Latent Image Record\nThis record shall be used to exchange variable-resolution latent fingerprint and latent palmprint images together with textural alphanumerical information. The scanning resolution of the images shall be 500 pixels/inch with 256 grey-levels. If the quality of the latent image is sufficient it shall be compressed using WSQ-algorithm. If necessary the resolution of the images may be expanded to more than 500 pixels/inch and more than 256 grey-levels by mutual agreement. In that case, it is strongly recommended to use JPEG 2000 (see Appendix 39-7).\n1.6.   Variable-Resolution Palmprint Image Record\nType-15 tagged field image records shall be used to exchange variable-resolution palmprint images together with textural alphanumerical information. The scanning resolution of the images shall be 500 pixels/inch with 256 grey-levels. To minimise the amount of data, all palmprint images shall be compressed using WSQ-algorithm. If necessary the resolution of the images may be expanded to more than 500 pixels/inch and more than 256 grey-levels by mutual agreement. In that case, it is strongly recommended to use JPEG 2000 (see Appendix 39-7).\n2.   Record format\nA transaction file shall consist of one or more logical records. For each logical record contained in the file, several information fields appropriate to that record type shall be present. Each information field may contain one or more basic single-valued information items. Taken together these items are used to convey different aspects of the data contained in that field. An information field may also consist of one or more information items grouped together and repeated multiple times within a field. Such a group of information items is known as a subfield. An information field may therefore consist of one or more subfields of information items.\n2.1.   Information separators\nIn the tagged-field logical records, mechanisms for delimiting information are implemented by use of four ASCII information separators. The delimited information may be items within a field or subfield, fields within a logical record, or multiple occurrences of subfields. These information separators are defined in the standard ANSI X3.4. These characters are used to separate and qualify information in a logical sense. Viewed in a hierarchical relationship, the File Separator \"FS\" character is the most inclusive followed by the Group Separator \"GS\", the Record Separator \"RS\", and finally the Unit Separator \"US\" characters. Table 1 lists these ASCII separators and a description of their use within this standard.\nInformation separators should be functionally viewed as an indication of the type data that follows. The \"US\" character shall separate individual information items within a field or subfield. This is a signal that the next information item is a piece of data for that field or subfield. Multiple subfields within a field separated by the \"RS\" character signals the start of the next group of repeated information item(s). The \"GS\" separator character used between information fields signals the beginning of a new field preceding the field identifying number that shall appear. Similarly, the beginning of a new logical record shall be signalled by the appearance of the \"FS\" character.\nThe four characters are only meaningful when used as separators of data items in the fields of the ASCII text records. There is no specific meaning attached to these characters occurring in binary image records and binary fields — they are just part of the exchanged data.\nNormally, there should be no empty fields or information items and therefore only one separator character should appear between any two data items. The exception to this rule occurs for those instances where the data in fields or information items in a transaction are unavailable, missing, or optional, and the processing of the transaction is not dependent upon the presence of that particular data. In those instances, multiple and adjacent separator characters shall appear together rather than requiring the insertion of dummy data between separator characters.\nFor the definition of a field that consists of three information items, the following applies. If the information for the second information item is missing, then two adjacent \"US\" information separator characters would occur between the first and third information items. If the second and third information items were both missing, then three separator characters should be used — two \"US\" characters in addition to the terminating field or subfield separator character. In general, if one or more mandatory or optional information items are unavailable for a field or subfield, then the appropriate number of separator character should be inserted.\nIt is possible to have side-by-side combinations of two or more of the four available separator characters. When data are missing or unavailable for information items, subfields, or fields, there shall be one separator character less than the number of data items, subfields, or fields required.\nTable 1\nSeparators Used\nCode\nType\nDescription\nHexadecimal Value\nDecimal Value\nUS\nUnit Separator\nSeparates information items\n1F\n31\nRS\nRecord Separator\nSeparates subfields\n1E\n30\nGS\nGroup Separator\nSeparates fields\n1D\n29\nFS\nFile Separator\nSeparates logical records\n1C\n28\n2.2.   Record layout\nFor tagged-field logical records, each information field that is used shall be numbered in accordance with this standard. The format for each field shall consist of the logical record type number followed by a period \".\", a field number followed by a colon \":\", followed by the information appropriate to that field. The tagged-field number can be any one-to-nine digit number occurring between the period \".\" and the colon \":\". It shall be interpreted as an unsigned integer field number. This implies that a field number of \"2.123:\" is equivalent to and shall be interpreted in the same manner as a field number of \"2.000000123:\".\nFor purposes of illustration throughout this document, a three-digit number shall be used for enumerating the fields contained in each of the tagged-field logical records described herein. Field numbers will have the form of \"TT.xxx:\" where the \"TT\" represents the one- or two-character record type followed by a period. The next three characters comprise the appropriate field number followed by a colon. Descriptive ASCII information or the image data follows the colon.\nLogical Type-1 and Type-2 records contain only ASCII textual data fields. The entire length of the record (including field numbers, colons, and separator characters) shall be recorded as the first ASCII field within each of these record types. The ASCII File Separator \"FS\" control character (signifying the end of the logical record or transaction) shall follow the last byte of ASCII information and shall be included in the length of the record.\nIn contrast to the tagged-field concept, the Type-4 record contains only binary data recorded as ordered fixed-length binary fields. The entire length of the record shall be recorded in the first four-byte binary field of each record. For this binary record, neither the record number with its period, nor the field identifier number and its following colon, shall be recorded. Furthermore, as all the field lengths of this record is either fixed or specified, none of the four separator characters (\"US\", \"RS\", \"GS\", or \"FS\") shall be interpreted as anything other than binary data. For the binary record, the \"FS\" character shall not be used as a record separator or transaction terminating character.\n3.   Type-1 Logical Record: the File Header\nThis record describes the structure of the file, the type of the file, and other important information. The character set used for Type-1 fields shall contain only the 7-bit ANSI code for information interchange.\n3.1.   Fields for Type-1 Logical Record\n3.1.1.   Field 1.001: Logical Record Length (LEN)\nThis field contains the total count of the number of bytes in the whole Type-1 logical record. The field begins with \"1.001:\", followed by the total length of the record including every character of every field and the information separators.\n3.1.2.   Field 1.002: Version Number (VER)\nTo ensure that users know which version of the ANSI/NIST standard is being used, this four byte field specifies the version number of the standard being implemented by the software or system creating the file. The first two bytes specify the major version reference number, the second two the minor revision number. For example, the original 1986 Standard would be considered the first version and designated \"0100\" while the present ANSI/NIST-ITL 1-2000 standard is \"0300\".\n3.1.3.   Field 1.003: File Content (CNT)\nThis field lists each of the records in the file by record type and the order in which the records appear in the logical file. It consists of one or more subfields, each of which in turn contains two information items describing a single logical record found in the current file. The subfields are entered in the same order in which the records are recorded and transmitted.\nThe first information item in the first subfield is \"1\", to refer to this Type-1 record. It is followed by a second information item which contains the number of other records contained in the file. This number is also equal to the count of the remaining subfields of field 1.003.\nEach of the remaining subfields is associated with one record within the file, and the sequence of subfields corresponds to the sequence of records. Each subfield contains two items of information. The first is to identify the Type of the record. The second is the record's IDC. The \"US\" character shall be used to separate the two information items.\n3.1.4.   Field 1.004: Type of Transaction (TOT)\nThis field contains a three letter mnemonic designating the type of the transaction.

Field 1.005: Date of Transaction (DAT)\nThis field indicates the date on which the transaction was initiated and shall conform to the ISO standard notation of: YYYYMMDD\nwhere YYYY is the year, MM is the month and DD is the day of the month. Leading zeros are used for single figure numbers. For example, \"19931004\" represents 4 October 1993.\n3.1.6.   Field 1.006: Priority (PRY)\nThis optional field defines the priority, on a level of 1 to 9, of the request. \"1\" is the highest priority and \"9\" the lowest. Priority \"1\" transactions shall be processed immediately.\n3.1.7.   Field 1.007: Destination Agency Identifier (DAI)\nThis field specifies the destination agency for the transaction.\nIt consists of two information items in the following format: CC/agency.\nThe first information item contains the Country Code, defined in ISO 3166, two alpha-numeric characters long. The second item, agency, is a free text identification of the agency, up to a maximum of 32 alpha-numeric characters.\n3.1.8.   Field 1.008: Originating Agency Identifier (ORI)\nThis field specifies the file originator and has the same format as the DAI (Field 1.007).\n3.1.9.   Field 1.009: Transaction Control Number (TCN)\nThis is a control number for reference purposes. It should be generated by the computer and have the following format: YYSSSSSSSSA\nwhere YY is the year of the transaction, SSSSSSSS is an eight-digit serial number, and A is a check character generated by following the procedure given in Appendix 39-2.\nWhere a TCN is not available, the field, YYSSSSSSSS, is filled with zeros and the check character generated as above.\n3.1.10.   Field 1.010: Transaction Control Response (TCR)\nWhere a request was sent out, to which this is the response, this optional field will contain the transaction control number of the request message. It therefore has the same format as TCN (Field 1.009).\n3.1.11.

The resolution is expressed in pixels/mm in the same format as NSR (Field 1.011).\n3.1.13.   Field 1.013: Domain name (DOM)\nThis mandatory field identifies the domain name for the user-defined Type-2 logical record implementation. It consists of two information items and shall be \"INT-I{}{US}}4.22{}{GS}}\".\n3.1.14.   Field 1.014: Greenwich mean time (GMT)\nThis mandatory field provides a mechanism for expressing the date and time in terms of universal Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) units. If used, the GMT field contains the universal date that will be in addition to the local date contained in Field 1.005 (DAT). Use of the GMT field eliminates local time inconsistencies encountered when a transaction and its response are transmitted between two places separated by several time zones. The GMT provides a universal date and 24-hour clock time independent of time zones. It is represented as \"CCYYMMDDHHMMSSZ\", a 15-character string that is the concatenation of the date with the GMT and concludes with a \"Z\". The \"CCYY\" characters shall represent the year of the transaction, the \"MM\" characters shall be the tens and units values of the month, and the \"DD\" characters shall be the tens and units values of the day of the month, the \"HH\" characters represent the hour, the \"MM\" the minute, and the \"SS\" represents the second.

The record contains information of specific interest to the agencies sending or receiving the file. To ensure that communicating dactyloscopic systems are compatible, it is required that only the fields listed below are contained within the record. This document specifies which fields are mandatory and which optional, and also defines the structure of the individual fields.\n4.1.   Fields for Type-2 Logical Record\n4.1.1.   Field 2.001: Logical Record Length (LEN)\nThis mandatory field contains the length of this Type-2 record, and specifies the total number of bytes including every character of every field contained in the record and the information separators.\n4.1.2.   Field 2.002: Image Designation Character (IDC)\nThe IDC contained in this mandatory field is an ASCII representation of the IDC as defined in the File Content field (CNT) of the Type-1 record (Field 1.003).\n4.1.3.   Field 2.003: System Information (SYS)\nThis field is mandatory and contains four bytes which indicate which version of the INT-I this particular Type-2 record complies with.\nThe first two bytes specify the major version number, the second two the minor revision number. For example, this implementation is based on INT-I version 4 revision 22 and would be represented as \"0422\".\n4.1.4.   Field 2.007: Case Number (CNO)\nThis is a number assigned by the local dactyloscopic bureau to a collection of latents found at a scene-of-crime. The following format is adopted: CC/number\nwhere CC is the Interpol Country Code, two alpha-numeric characters in length, and the number complies with the appropriate local guidelines and may be up to 32 alpha-numeric characters long.\nThis field allows the system to identify latents associated with a particular crime.\n4.1.5.   Field 2.008: Sequence Number (SQN)\nThis specifies each sequence of latents within a case. It can be up to four numeric characters long. A sequence is a latent or series of latents which are grouped together for the purposes of filing and/or searching. This definition implies that even single latents will still have to be assigned a sequence number.\nThis field together with MID (Field 2.009) may be included to identify a particular latent within a sequence.\n4.1.6.   Field 2.009: Latent Identifier (MID)\nThis specifies the individual latent within a sequence. The value is a single letter or two letters, with \"A\" assigned to the first latent, \"B\" to the second, and so on up to a limit of \"ZZ\". This field is used analogue to the latent sequence number discussed in the description for SQN (Field 2.008).\n4.1.7.   Field 2.010: Criminal Reference Number (CRN)\nThis is a unique reference number assigned by a national agency to an individual who is charged for the first time with committing an offence. Within one country no individual ever has more than one CRN, or shares it with any other individual. However, the same individual may have Criminal Reference Numbers in several countries, which will be distinguishable by means of the country code.\nThe following format is adopted for CRN field: CC/number\nwhere CC is the Country Code, defined in ISO 3166, two alpha-numeric characters in length, and the number complies with the appropriate national guidelines of the issuing agency, and may be up to 32 alpha-numeric characters long.\nFor transactions pursuant to Articles 533 and 534 of this Agreement this field will be used for the national criminal reference number of the originating agency which is linked to the images in Type-4 or Type-15 Records.\n4.1.8.   Field 2.012: Miscellaneous Identification Number (MN1)\nThis fields contains the CRN (Field 2.010) transmitted by a CPS or PMS transaction without the leading country code.\n4.1.9.

Field 2.014: Miscellaneous Identification Number (MN3)\nThis fields contains the SQN (Field 2.008) transmitted by an MPS or MMS transaction.\n4.1.11.   Field 2.015: Miscellaneous Identification Number (MN4)\nThis fields contains the MID (Field 2.009) transmitted by an MPS or MMS transaction.\n4.1.12.   Field 2.063: Additional Information (INF)\nIn case of an SRE transaction to a PMS request this field gives information about the finger which caused the possible HIT. The format of the field is:\nNN where NN is the finger position code defined in Table 5, two digits in length.\nIn all other cases the field is optional. It consists of up to 32 alpha-numeric characters and may give additional information about the request.\n4.1.13.   Field 2.064: Respondents List (RLS)\nThis field contains at least two subfields. The first subfield describes the type of search that has been carried out, using the three-letter mnemonics which specify the transaction type in TOT (Field 1.004). The second subfield contains a single character. An \"I\" shall be used to indicate that a HIT has been found and an \"N\" shall be used to indicate that no matching cases have been found (No-HIT). The third subfield contains the sequence identifier for the candidate result and the total number of candidates separated by a slash. Multiple messages will be returned if multiple candidates exist.\nIn case of a possible HIT the fourth subfield shall contain the score up to six digits long. If the HIT has been verified the value of this subfield is defined as \"999999\".\nExample: \"CPS{}{RS}}I{}{RS}}001/001{}{RS}}999999{}{GS}}\"\nIf the remote AFIS does not assign scores, then a score of zero should be used at the appropriate point.\n4.1.14.   Field 2.074: Status/Error Message Field (ERM)\nThis field contains error messages resulting from transactions, which will be sent back to the requester as part of an Error Transaction.\nTable 3\nError messages\nNumeric code (1-3)\nMeaning (5-128)\n003\nERROR: UNAUTHORISED ACCESS\n101\nMandatory field missing\n102\nInvalid record type\n103\nUndefined field\n104\nExceed the maximum occurrence\n105\nInvalid number of subfields\n106\nField length too short\n107\nField length too long\n108\nField is not a number as expected\n109\nField number value too small\n110\nField number value too big\n111\nInvalid character\n112\nInvalid date\n115\nInvalid item value\n116\nInvalid type of transaction\n117\nInvalid record data\n201\nERROR: INVALID TCN\n501\nERROR: INSUFFICIENT FINGERPRINT QUALITY\n502\nERROR: MISSING FINGERPRINTS\n503\nERROR: FINGERPRINT SEQUENCE CHECK FAILED\n999\nERROR: ANY OTHER ERROR. FOR FURTHER DETAILS CALL DESTINATION AGENCY.\nError messages in the range between 100 and 199:\nThese error messages are related to the validation of the ANSI/NIST records and defined as:\n<error_code 1>: IDC <idc_number 1> FIELD <field_id 1> <dynamic text 1> LF\n<error_code 2>: IDC <idc_number 2> FIELD <field_id 2> <dynamic text 2>…\nwhere\n—\nerror_code is a code uniquely related to a specific reason (see Table 3),\n—\nfield_id is the ANSI/NIST field number of the incorrect field (e.g. 1.001, 2.001, …) in the format <record_type>.<field_id>.<sub_field_id>,\n—\ndynamic text is a more detailed dynamic description of the error,\n—\nLF is a Line Feed separating errors if more than one error is encountered,\n—\nfor type-1 record the ICD is defined as \"-1\".\nExample:\n201: IDC - 1 FIELD 1.009 WRONG CONTROL CHARACTER {}{LF}} 115: IDC 0 FIELD 2.003 INVALID SYSTEM INFORMATION\nThis field is mandatory for error transactions.\n4.1.15.   Field 2.320: Expected Number of Candidates (ENC)\nThis field contains the maximum number of candidates for verification expected by the requesting agency. The value of ENC shall not exceed the values defined in Table 11.\n5.   Type-4 Logical Record: High Resolution GreyScale Image\nIt should be noted that Type-4 records are binary rather than ASCII in nature. Therefore each field is assigned a specific position within the record, which implies that all fields are mandatory.\nThe standard allows both image size and resolution to be specified within the record. It requires Type-4 Logical Records to contain dactyloscopic image data that are being transmitted at a nominal pixel density of 500 to 520 pixels per inch. The preferred rate for new designs is at a pixel density of 500 pixels per inch or 19,68 pixels per mm. 500 pixels per inch is the density specified by the INT-I, except that similar systems may communicate with each other at a non-preferred rate, within the limits of 500 to 520 pixels per inch.\n5.1.   Fields for Type-4 Logical Record\n5.1.1.   Field 4.001: Logical Record Length (LEN)\nThis four-byte field contains the length of this Type-4 record, and specifies the total number of bytes including every byte of every field contained in the record.\n5.1.2.   Field 4.002: Image Designation Character (IDC)\nThis is the one-byte binary representation of the IDC number given in the header file.\n5.1.3.   Field 4.003: Impression Type (IMP)\nThe impression type is a single-byte field occupying the sixth byte of the record.\nTable 4\nFinger Impression Type\nCode\nDescription\n0\nLive-scan of plain fingerprint\n1\nLive-scan of rolled fingerprint\n2\nNon-live scan impression of plain fingerprint captured from paper\n3\nNon-live scan impression of rolled fingerprint captured from paper\n4\nLatent impression captured directly\n5\nLatent tracing\n6\nLatent photo\n7\nLatent lift\n8\nSwipe\n9\nUnknown\n5.1.4.   Field 4.004: Finger Position (FGP)\nThis fixed-length field of six bytes occupies the seventh through twelfth byte positions of a Type-4 record. It contains possible finger positions beginning in the left most byte (byte seven of the record). The known or most probable finger position is taken from Table 5. Up to five additional fingers may be referenced by entering the alternate finger positions in the remaining five bytes using the same format. If fewer than five finger position references are to be used the unused bytes are filled with binary 255. To reference all finger positions code 0, for unknown, is used.\nTable 5\nFinger position code and maximum size\nFinger position\nFinger code\nWidth\n(mm)\nLength\n(mm)\nUnknown\n0\n40,0\n40,0\nRight thumb\n1\n45,0\n40,0\nRight index finger\n2\n40,0\n40,0\nRight middle finger\n3\n40,0\n40,0\nRight ring finger\n4\n40,0\n40,0\nRight little finger\n5\n33,0\n40,0\nLeft thumb\n6\n45,0\n40,0\nLeft index finger\n7\n40,0\n40,0\nLeft middle finger\n8\n40,0\n40,0\nLeft ring finger\n9\n40,0\n40,0\nLeft little finger\n10\n33,0\n40,0\nPlain right thumb\n11\n30,0\n55,0\nPlain left thumb\n12\n30,0\n55,0\nPlain right four fingers\n13\n70,0\n65,0\nPlain left four fingers\n14\n70,0\n65,0\nFor scene of crime latents only the codes 0 to 10 should be used.\n5.1.5.   Field 4.005: Image Scanning Resolution (ISR)\nThis one-byte field occupies the 13th byte of a Type-4 record. If it contains \"0\" then the image has been sampled at the preferred scanning rate of 19,68 pixels/mm (500 pixels per inch). If it contains \"1\" then the image has been sampled at an alternative scanning rate as specified in the Type-1 record.\n5.1.6.   Field 4.006: Horizontal Line Length (HLL)\nThis field is positioned at bytes 14 and 15 within the Type-4 record. It specifies the number of pixels contained in each scan line. The first byte will be the most significant.\n5.1.7.   Field 4.007: Vertical Line Length (VLL)\nThis field records in bytes 16 and 17 the number of scan lines present in the image. The first byte is the most significant.\n5.1.8.   Field 4.008: Greyscale Compression Algorithm (GCA)\nThis one-byte field specifies the greyscale compression algorithm used to encode the image data. For this implementation, a binary code 1 indicates that WSQ compression (Appendix 39-7) has been used.\n5.1.9.   Field 4.009: The Image\nThis field contains a byte stream representing the image. Its structure will obviously depend on the compression algorithm used.\n6.   Type-9 Logical Record: Minutiæ Record\nType-9 records shall contain ASCII text describing minutiæ and related information encoded from a latent. For latent search transaction, there is no limit for these Type-9 records in a file, each of which shall be for a different view or latent.\n6.1.   Minutiæ extraction\n6.1.1.   Minutia type identification\nThis standard defines three identifier numbers that are used to describe the minutia type. These are listed in Table 6. A ridge ending shall be designated Type 1. A bifurcation shall be designated Type 2. If a minutia cannot be clearly categorised as one of the above two types, it shall be designated as \"other\", Type 0.\nTable 6\nMinutia types\nType\nDescription\n0\nOther\n1\nRidge ending\n2\nBifurcation\n6.1.2.   Minutia placement and type\nFor templates to be compliant with Section 5 of the ANSI INCITS 378-2004 standard, the following method, which enhances the current INCITS 378-2004 standard, shall be used for determining placement (location and angular direction) of individual minutiæ.\nThe position or location of a minutia representing a ridge ending shall be the point of forking of the medial skeleton of the valley area immediately in front of the ridge ending. If the three legs of the valley area were thinned down to a single-pixel-wide skeleton, the point of the intersection is the location of the minutia. Similarly, the location of the minutia for a bifurcation shall be the point of forking of the medial skeleton of the ridge. If the three legs of the ridge were each thinned down to a single-pixel-wide skeleton, the point where the three legs intersect is the location of the minutia.\nAfter all ridge endings have been converted to bifurcations, all of the minutiæ of the dactyloscopic image are represented as bifurcations. The X and Y pixel coordinates of the intersection of the three legs of each minutia can be directly formatted. Determination of the minutia direction can be extracted from each skeleton bifurcation. The three legs of every skeleton bifurcation shall be examined and the endpoint of each leg determined. Figure 6.1.2 illustrates the three methods used for determining the end of a leg that is based on a scanning resolution of 500 ppi.\nThe ending is established according to the event that occurs first. The pixel count is based on a scan resolution of 500 ppi. Different scan resolutions would imply different pixel counts.\n—\na distance of 0,064\" (the 32nd pixel),\n—\nthe end of skeleton leg that occurs between a distance of 0,02\" and 0,064\" (the 10th through the 32nd pixels); shorter legs are not used,\n—\na second bifurcation is encountered within a distance of 0,064\" (before the 32nd pixel).\nThe angle of the minutiæ is determined by constructing three virtual rays originating at the bifurcation point and extending to the end of each leg. The smallest of the three angles formed by the rays is bisected to indicate the minutiæ direction.\n6.1.3.   Coordinate system\nThe coordinate system used to express the minutiæ of a fingerprint shall be a Cartesian coordinate system. Minutiæ locations shall be represented by their x and y coordinates. The origin of the coordinate system shall be the upper left corner of the original image with x increasing to the right and y increasing downward. Both x and y coordinates of a minutiæ shall be represented in pixel units from the origin. It should be noted that the location of the origin and units of measure is not in agreement with the convention used in the definitions of the Type 9 in the ANSI/NIST-ITL 1-2000.\n6.1.4.   Minutiæ direction\nAngles are expressed in standard mathematical format, with zero degrees to the right and angles increasing in the counter clockwise direction. Recorded angles are in the direction pointing back along the ridge for a ridge ending and toward the centre of the valley for a bifurcation. This convention is 180 degrees opposite of the angle convention described in the definitions of the Type 9 in the ANSI/NIST-ITL 1-2000.\n6.2.   Fields for Type-9 Logical record INCITS-378 Format\nAll fields of the Type-9 records shall be recorded as ASCII text. No binary fields are permissible in this tagged-field record.\n6.2.1.   Field 9.001: Logical record length (LEN)\nThis mandatory ASCII field shall contain the length of the logical record specifying the total number of bytes, including every character of every field contained in the record.\n6.2.2.

Field 9.126: CBEFF information\nThis field shall contain three information items. The first information item shall contain the value \"27\" (0x1B). This is the identification of the CBEFF Format Owner assigned by the International Biometric Industry Association (IBIA) to INCITS Technical Committee M1. The <US> character shall delimit this item from the CBEFF Format Type that is assigned a value of \"513\" (0x0201) to indicate that this record contains only location and angular direction data without any Extended Data Block information. The <US> character shall delimit this item from the CBEFF Product Identifier (PID) that identifies the \"owner\" of the encoding equipment. The vendor establishes this value. It can be obtained from the IBIA website (www.ibia.org) if it is posted.\n6.2.6.   Field 9.127: Capture equipment identification\nThis field shall contain two information items separated by the <US> character. The first shall contain \"APPF\" if the equipment used originally to acquire the image was certified to comply with Appendix F (IAFIS Image Quality Specification, 29 January 1999) of CJIS-RS-0010, the Federal Bureau of Investigation's Electronic Fingerprint Transmission Specification. If the equipment did not comply, it will contain the value of \"NONE\". The second information item shall contain the Capture Equipment ID which is a vendor-assigned product number of the capture equipment. A value of \"0\" indicates that the capture equipment ID is unreported.\n6.2.7.   Field 9.128: Horizontal line length (HLL)\nThis mandatory ASCII field shall contain the number of pixels contained on a single horizontal line of the transmitted image. The maximum horizontal size is limited to 65534 pixels.\n6.2.8.

The maximum vertical size is limited to 65534 pixels.\n6.2.9.   Field 9.130: Scale units (SLC)\nThis mandatory ASCII field shall specify the units used to describe the image sampling frequency (pixel density). A \"1\" in this field indicates pixels per inch, or a \"2\" indicates pixels per centimetre. A \"0\" in this field indicates no scale is given. In this case, the quotient of HPS/VPS gives the pixel aspect ratio.\n6.2.10.   Field 9.131: Horizontal pixel scale (HPS)\nThis mandatory ASCII field shall specify the integer pixel density used in the horizontal direction providing the SLC contains a \"1\" or a \"2\". Otherwise, it indicates the horizontal component of the pixel aspect ratio.\n6.2.11.

A code between 1 and 10 taken from Table 5 or the appropriate palm code from Table 10 shall be used to indicate the finger or palm position.\n6.2.14.   Field 9.135: Finger quality\nThe field shall contain the quality of the overall finger minutiæ data and shall be between 0 and 100. This number is an overall expression of the quality of the finger record, and represents quality of the original image, of the minutia extraction and any additional operations that may affect the minutiæ record.\n6.2.15.   Field 9.136: number of minutiæ\nThe mandatory field shall contain a count of the number of minutiæ recorded in this logical record.\n6.2.16.   Field 9.137: Finger minutiæ data\nThis mandatory field has six information items separated by the <US> character. It consists of several subfields, each containing the details of single minutiae. The total number of minutiae subfields must agree with the count found in field 136. The first information item is the minutiae index number, which shall be initialised to \"1\" and incremented by \"1\" for each additional minutia in the fingerprint. The second and third information items are the \"x\" coordinate and \"y\" coordinates of the minutiae in pixel units. The fourth information item is the minutiae angle recorded in units of two degrees. This value shall be nonnegative between 0 and 179. The fifth information item is the minutiae type. A value of \"0\" is used to represent minutiae of type \"OTHER\", a value of \"1\" for a ridge ending and a value of \"2\" for a ridge bifurcation.

Each subfield shall be separated from the next with the use of the <RS> separator character.\n6.2.17.   Field 9.138: Ridge count information\nThis field consists of a series of subfields each containing three information items. The first information item of the first subfield shall indicate the ridge count extraction method. A \"0\" indicates that no assumption shall be made about the method used to extract ridge counts, nor their order in the record. A \"1\" indicates that for each centre minutiæ, ridge count data was extracted to the nearest neighbouring minutiæ in four quadrants, and ridge counts for each centre minutia are listed together. A \"2\" indicates that for each centre minutiæ, ridge count data was extracted to the nearest neighbouring minutiæ in eight octants, and ridge counts for each centre minutia are listed together. The remaining two information items of the first subfield shall both contain \"0\". Information items shall be separated by the <US> separator character. Subsequent subfields will contain the centre minutiæ index number as the first information item, the neighbouring minutiæ index number as the second information item, and the number of ridges crossed as the third information item. Subfields shall be separated by the <RS> separator character.\n6.2.18.   Field 9.139: Core information\nThis field will consist of one subfield for each core present in the original image. Each subfield consists of three information items. The first two items contain the \"x\" and \"y\" coordinate positions in pixel units.

Type-13 variable-resolution latent image record\nThe Type-13 tagged-field logical record shall contain image data acquired from latent images. These images are intended to be transmitted to agencies that will automatically extract or provide human intervention and processing to extract the desired feature information from the images.\nInformation regarding the scanning resolution used, the image size, and other parameters required to process the image, are recorded as tagged-fields within the record.\nTable 7\nType-13 variable-resolution latent record layout\nIdent\nCond. code\nField Number\nField name\nChar type\nField size per occurrence\nOccur count\nMax byte count\nmin.\nmax.\nmin\nmax\nLEN\nM\n13.001\nLOGICAL RECORD LENGTH\nN\n4\n8\n1\n1\n15\nIDC\nM\n13.002\nIMAGE DESIGNATION CHARACTER\nN\n2\n5\n1\n1\n12\nIMP\nM\n13.003\nIMPRESSION TYPE\nA\n2\n2\n1\n1\n9\nSRC\nM\n13.004\nSOURCE AGENCY/ORI\nAN\n6\n35\n1\n1\n42\nLCD\nM\n13.005\nLATENT CAPTURE DATE\nN\n9\n9\n1\n1\n16\nHLL\nM\n13.006\nHORIZONTAL LINE LENGTH\nN\n4\n5\n1\n1\n12\nVLL\nM\n13.007\nVERTICAL LINE LENGTH\nN\n4\n5\n1\n1\n12\nSLC\nM\n13.008\nSCALE UNITS\nN\n2\n2\n1\n1\n9\nHPS\nM\n13.009\nHORIZONTAL PIXEL SCALE\nN\n2\n5\n1\n1\n12\nVPS\nM\n13.010\nVERTICAL PIXEL SCALE\nN\n2\n5\n1\n1\n12\nCGA\nM\n13.011\nCOMPRESSION ALGORITHM\nA\n5\n7\n1\n1\n14\nBPX\nM\n13.012\nBITS PER PIXEL\nN\n2\n3\n1\n1\n10\nFGP\nM\n13.013\nFINGER POSITION\nN\n2\n3\n1\n6\n25\nRSV\n13.014\nRESERVED FOR FUTURE DEFINITION\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\n13.019\nCOM\nO\n13.020\nCOMMENT\nA\n2\n128\n0\n1\n135\nRSV\n13.021\nRESERVED FOR FUTURE DEFINITION\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\n13.199\nUDF\nO\n13.200\nUSER-DEFINED FIELDS\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\n13.998\nDAT\nM\n13.999\nIMAGE DATA\nB\n2\n—\n1\n1\n—\nKey for character type: N = Numeric; A = Alphabetic; AN = Alphanumeric; B = Binary\n7.1.   Fields for the Type-13 logical record\nThe following paragraphs describe the data contained in each of the fields for the Type-13 logical record.\nWithin a Type-13 logical record, entries shall be provided in numbered fields. It is required that the first two fields of the record are ordered, and the field containing the image data shall be the last physical field in the record. For each field of the Type-13 record, Table 7 lists the \"condition code\" as being mandatory \"M\" or optional \"O\", the field number, the field name, character type, field size, and occurrence limits. Based on a three digit field number, the maximum byte count size for the field is given in the last column. As more digits are used for the field number, the maximum byte count will also increase. The two entries in the \"field size per occurrence\" include all character separators used in the field. The \"maximum byte count\" includes the field number, the information, and all the character separators including the \"GS\" character.\n7.1.1.   Field 13.001: Logical record length (LEN)\nThis mandatory ASCII field shall contain the total count of the number of bytes in the Type-13 logical record. Field 13.001 shall specify the length of the record including every character of every field contained in the record and the information separators.\n7.1.2.   Field 13.002: Image designation character (IDC)\nThis mandatory ASCII field shall be used to identify the latent image data contained in the record. This IDC shall match the IDC found in the file content (CNT) field of the Type-1 record.\n7.1.3.   Field 13.003: Impression type (IMP)\nThis mandatory one- or two-byte ASCII field shall indicate the manner by which the latent image information was obtained. The appropriate latent code choice selected from Table 4 (finger) or Table 9 (palm) shall be entered in this field.\n7.1.4.   Field 13.004: Source agency/ORI (SRC)\nThis mandatory ASCII field shall contain the identification of the administration or organisation that originally captured the facial image contained in the record. Normally, the Originating Agency Identifier (ORI) of the agency that captured the image will be contained in this field. It consists of two information items in the following format: CC/agency.\nThe first information item contains the Interpol Country Code, two alpha-numeric characters long. The second item, agency, is a free text identification of the agency, up to a maximum of 32 alpha-numeric characters.\n7.1.5.   Field 13.005: Latent capture date (LCD)\nThis mandatory ASCII field shall contain the date that the latent image contained in the record was captured. The date shall appear as eight digits in the format CCYYMMDD. The CCYY characters shall represent the year the image was captured; the MM characters shall be the tens and unit values of the month; and the DD characters shall be the tens and unit values of the day in the month. For example, 20000229 represents 29 February 2000. The complete date shall be a legitimate date.\n7.1.6.   Field 13.006: Horizontal line length (HLL)\nThis mandatory ASCII field shall contain the number of pixels contained on a single horizontal line of the transmitted image.\n7.1.7.   Field 13.007: Vertical line length (VLL)\nThis mandatory ASCII field shall contain the number of horizontal lines contained in the transmitted image.\n7.1.8.   Field 13.008: Scale units (SLC)\nThis mandatory ASCII field shall specify the units used to describe the image sampling frequency (pixel density). A \"1\" in this field indicates pixels per inch, or a \"2\" indicates pixels per centimetre. A \"0\" in this field indicates no scale is given. In this case, the quotient of HPS/VPS gives the pixel aspect ratio.\n7.1.9.   Field 13.009: Horizontal pixel scale (HPS)\nThis mandatory ASCII field shall specify the integer pixel density used in the horizontal direction providing the SLC contains a \"1\" or a \"2\". Otherwise, it indicates the horizontal component of the pixel aspect ratio.\n7.1.10.   Field 13.010: Vertical pixel scale (VPS)\nThis mandatory ASCII field shall specify the integer pixel density used in the vertical direction providing the SLC contains a \"1\" or a \"2\". Otherwise, it indicates the vertical component of the pixel aspect ratio.\n7.1.11.   Field 13.011: Compression algorithm (CGA)\nThis mandatory ASCII field shall specify the algorithm used to compress greyscale images. See Appendix 39-7 for the compression codes.\n7.1.12.   Field 13.012: Bits per pixel (BPX)\nThis mandatory ASCII field shall contain the number of bits used to represent a pixel. This field shall contain an entry of \"8\" for normal greyscale values of \"0\" to \"255\". Any entry in this field greater than \"8\" shall represent a greyscale pixel with increased precision.\n7.1.13.   Field 13.013: Finger/palm position (FGP)\nThis mandatory tagged-field shall contain one or more of the possible finger or palm positions that may match the latent image. The decimal code number corresponding to the known or most probable finger position shall be taken from Table 5 or the most probable palm position from Table 10 and entered as a one- or two-character ASCII subfield. Additional finger and/or palm positions may be referenced by entering the alternate position codes as subfields separated by the \"RS\" separator character. The code \"0\", for \"Unknown Finger\", shall be used to reference every finger position from one through ten. The code \"20\", for \"Unknown Palm\", shall be used to reference every listed palmprint position.\n7.1.14.   Field 13.014-019: Reserved for future definition (RSV)\nThese fields are reserved for inclusion in future revisions of this standard. None of these fields are to be used at this revision level. If any of these fields are present, they are to be ignored.\n7.1.15.   Field 13.020: Comment (COM)\nThis optional field may be used to insert comments or other ASCII text information with the latent image data.\n7.1.16.   Field 13.021-199: Reserved for future definition (RSV)\nThese fields are reserved for inclusion in future revisions of this standard. None of these fields are to be used at this revision level. If any of these fields are present, they are to be ignored.\n7.1.17.   Fields 13.200-998: User-defined fields (UDF)\nThese fields are user-definable fields and will be used for future requirements. Their size and content shall be defined by the user and be in accordance with the receiving agency. If present they shall contain ASCII textual information.\n7.1.18.   Field 13.999: Image data (DAT)\nThis field shall contain all data from a captured latent image. It shall always be assigned field number 999 and shall be the last physical field in the record. For example, \"13.999:\" is followed by image data in a binary representation.\nEach pixel of uncompressed greyscale data shall normally be quantised to eight bits (256 grey levels) contained in a single byte. If the entry in BPX Field 13.012 is greater or less than \"8\", the number of bytes required to contain a pixel will be different. If compression is used, the pixel data shall be compressed in accordance with the compression technique specified in the GCA field.\n7.2.   End of Type-13 variable-resolution latent image record\nFor the sake of consistency, immediately following the last byte of data from Field 13.999 an \"FS\" separator shall be used to separate it from the next logical record. This separator shall be included in the length field of the Type-13 record.\n8.   Type-15 variable-resolution palmprint image record\nThe Type-15 tagged-field logical record shall contain and be used to exchange palmprint image data together with fixed and user-defined textual information fields pertinent to the digitised image. Information regarding the scanning resolution used, the image size and other parameters or comments required to process the image are recorded as tagged-fields within the record. Palmprint images transmitted to other agencies will be processed by the recipient agencies to extract the desired feature information required for matching purposes.\nThe image data shall be acquired directly from a subject using a live-scan device, or from a palmprint card or other media that contains the subject's palmprints.\nAny method used to acquire the palmprint images shall be capable of capturing a set of images for each hand. This set shall include the writer's palm as a single scanned image, and the entire area of the full palm extending from the wrist bracelet to the tips of the fingers as one or two scanned images. If two images are used to represent the full palm, the lower image shall extend from the wrist bracelet to the top of the interdigital area (third finger joint) and shall include the thenar, and hypothenar areas of the palm. The upper image shall extend from the bottom of the interdigital area to the upper tips of the fingers. This provides an adequate amount of overlap between the two images that are both located over the interdigital area of the palm. By matching the ridge structure and details contained in this common area, an examiner can confidently state that both images came from the same palm.\nAs a palmprint transaction may be used for different purposes, it may contain one or more unique image areas recorded from the palm or hand. A complete palmprint record set for one individual will normally include the writer's palm and the full palm image(s) from each hand. Since a tagged-field logical image record may contain only one binary field, a single Type-15 record will be required for each writer's palm and one or two Type-15 records for each full palm. Therefore, four to six Type-15 records will be required to represent the subject's palmprints in a normal palmprint transaction.\n8.1.   Fields for the Type-15 logical record\nThe following paragraphs describe the data contained in each of the fields for the Type-15 logical record.\nWithin a Type-15 logical record, entries shall be provided in numbered fields. It is required that the first two fields of the record are ordered, and the field containing the image data shall be the last physical field in the record. For each field of the Type-15 record, Table 8 lists the \"condition code\" as being mandatory \"M\" or optional \"O\", the field number, the field name, character type, field size, and occurrence limits. Based on a three digit field number, the maximum byte count size for the field is given in the last column. As more digits are used for the field number, the maximum byte count will also increase. The two entries in the \"field size per occurrence\" include all character separators used in the field. The \"maximum byte count\" includes the field number, the information, and all the character separators including the \"GS\" character.\n8.1.1.   Field 15.001: Logical record length (LEN)\nThis mandatory ASCII field shall contain the total count of the number of bytes in the Type-15 logical record. Field 15.001 shall specify the length of the record including every character of every field contained in the record and the information separators.\n8.1.2.   Field 15.002: Image designation character (IDC)\nThis mandatory ASCII field shall be used to identify the palmprint image contained in the record. This IDC shall match the IDC found in the file content (CNT) field of the Type-1 record.\n8.1.3.   Field 15.003: Impression type (IMP)\nThis mandatory one-byte ASCII field shall indicate the manner by which the palmprint image information was obtained. The appropriate code selected from Table 9 shall be entered in this field.\n8.1.4.   Field 15.004: Source agency/ORI (SRC)\nThis mandatory ASCII field shall contain the identification of the administration or organisation that originally captured the facial image contained in the record. Normally, the Originating Agency Identifier (ORI) of the agency that captured the image will be contained in this field. It consists of two information items in the following format: CC/agency.\nThe first information item contains the Interpol Country Code, two alpha-numeric characters long. The second item, agency, is a free text identification of the agency, up to a maximum of 32 alpha-numeric characters.\n8.1.5.   Field 15.005: Palmprint capture date (PCD)\nThis mandatory ASCII field shall contain the date that the palmprint image was captured. The date shall appear as eight digits in the format CCYYMMDD. The CCYY characters shall represent the year the image was captured; the MM characters shall be the tens and unit values of the month; and the DD characters shall be the tens and units values of the day in the month. For example, the entry 20000229 represents 29 February 2000. The complete date shall be a legitimate date.\n8.1.6.   Field 15.006: Horizontal line length (HLL)\nThis mandatory ASCII field shall contain the number of pixels contained on a single horizontal line of the transmitted image.\n8.1.7.   Field 15.007: Vertical line length (VLL)\nThis mandatory ASCII field shall contain the number of horizontal lines contained in the transmitted image.\n8.1.8.   Field 15.008: Scale units (SLC)\nThis mandatory ASCII field shall specify the units used to describe the image sampling frequency (pixel density). A \"1\" in this field indicates pixels per inch, or a \"2\" indicates pixels per centimetre. A \"0\" in this field indicates no scale is given. In this case, the quotient of HPS/VPS gives the pixel aspect ratio.\n8.1.9.   Field 15.009: Horizontal pixel scale (HPS)\nThis mandatory ASCII field shall specify the integer pixel density used in the horizontal direction providing the SLC contains a \"1\" or a \"2\". Other-wise, it indicates the horizontal component of the pixel aspect ratio.\n8.1.10.   Field 15.010: Vertical pixel scale (VPS)\nThis mandatory ASCII field shall specify the integer pixel density used in the vertical direction providing the SLC contains a \"1\" or a \"2\". Otherwise, it indicates the vertical component of the pixel aspect ratio.\nTable 8\nType-15 variable-resolution palmprint record layout\nIdent\nCond. code\nField number\nField name\nChar type\nField size per occurrence\nOccur count\nMax byte count\nmin.\nmax.\nmin\nmax\nLEN\nM\n15.001\nLOGICAL RECORD LENGTH\nN\n4\n8\n1\n1\n15\nIDC\nM\n15.002\nIMAGE DESIGNATION CHARACTER\nN\n2\n5\n1\n1\n12\nIMP\nM\n15.003\nIMPRESSION TYPE\nN\n2\n2\n1\n1\n9\nSRC\nM\n15.004\nSOURCE AGENCY/ORI\nAN\n6\n35\n1\n1\n42\nPCD\nM\n15.005\nPALMPRINT CAPTURE DATE\nN\n9\n9\n1\n1\n16\nHLL\nM\n15.006\nHORIZONTAL LINE LENGTH\nN\n4\n5\n1\n1\n12\nVLL\nM\n15.007\nVERTICAL LINE LENGTH\nN\n4\n5\n1\n1\n12\nSLC\nM\n15.008\nSCALE UNITS\nN\n2\n2\n1\n1\n9\nHPS\nM\n15.009\nHORIZONTAL PIXEL SCALE\nN\n2\n5\n1\n1\n12\nVPS\nM\n15.010\nVERTICAL PIXEL SCALE\nN\n2\n5\n1\n1\n12\nCGA\nM\n15.011\nCOMPRESSION ALGORITHM\nAN\n5\n7\n1\n1\n14\nBPX\nM\n15.012\nBITS PER PIXEL\nN\n2\n3\n1\n1\n10\nPLP\nM\n15.013\nPALMPRINT POSITION\nN\n2\n3\n1\n1\n10\nRSV\n15.014\nRESERVED FOR FUTURE INCLUSION\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\n15.019\nCOM\nO\n15.020\nCOMMENT\nAN\n2\n128\n0\n1\n128\nRSV\n15.021\nRESERVED FOR FUTURE INCLUSION\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\n15.199\nUDF\nO\n15.200\nUSER-DEFINED FIELDS\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\n15.998\nDAT\nM\n15.999\nIMAGE DATA\nB\n2\n—\n1\n1\n—\nTable 9\nPalm Impression Type\nDescription\nCode\nLive-scan palm\n10\nNonlive-scan palm\n11\nLatent palm impression\n12\nLatent palm tracing\n13\nLatent palm photo\n14\nLatent palm lift\n15\n8.1.11.

Common data-set for automated search of vehicle registration data\n1.1.   Definitions\nThe definitions of mandatory and optional data elements set out in Article 14(4) of Chapter 0 are as follows:\nMandatory (M):\nThe data element has to be communicated when the information is available in a State's national register. Therefore there is an obligation to exchange the information when available.\nOptional (O):\nThe data element may be communicated when the information is available in a State's national register. Therefore there is no obligation to exchange the information even when the information is available.\nAn indication (Y) is given for each element in the data set where the element is specifically identified as important in relation with Article 537 of this Agreement.\n1.2.   Vehicle/owner/holder search\n1.2.1.   Triggers for the search\nThere are two different ways to search for the information as defined in the next paragraph:\n—\nby Chassis Number (VIN), Reference Date and Time (optional),\n—\nby License Plate Number, Chassis Number (VIN) (optional), Reference Date and Time (optional).\nBy means of these search criteria, information related to one and sometimes more vehicles will be returned. If information for only one vehicle has to be returned, all the items are returned in one response. If more than one vehicle is found, the requested State itself can determine which items will be returned; all items or only the items to refine the search (e.g. because of privacy reasons or because of performance reasons).\nThe items necessary to refine the search are pictured in paragraph 1.2.2.1. In paragraph 1.2.2.2 the complete information set is described.\nWhen the search is done by Chassis Number, Reference Date and Time, the search can be done in one or all of the participating States.\nWhen the search is done by License Number, Reference Data and Time, the search has to be done in one specific State.\nNormally the actual Date and Time is used to make a search, but it is possible to conduct a search with a Reference Date and Time in the past. When a search is made with a Reference Date and Time in the past and historical information is not available in the register of the specific State because no such information is registered at all, the actual information can be returned with an indication that the information is actual information.\n1.2.2.

Data Security\n2.1.   Overview\nThe Eucaris software application handles secure communication to the other States and communicates to the back-end legacy systems of States using XML. States exchange messages by directly sending them to the recipient. The data centre of a State is connected to the TESTA network.\nThe XML-messages sent over the network are encrypted. The technique to encrypt these messages is SSL. The messages sent to the back-end are plain text XML-messages since the connection between the application and the back-end shall be in a protected environment.\nA client application is provided which can be used within a State to query their own register or other States' registers. The clients will be identified by means of user-id/password or a client certificate. The connection to a user may be encrypted, but this is the responsibility of each individual State.\n2.2.   Security Features related to message exchange\nThe security design is based on a combination of HTTPS and XML signature. This alternative uses XML-signature to sign all messages sent so the server and can authenticate the sender of the message by checking the signature. 1-sided SSL (only a server certificate) is used to protect the confidentiality and integrity of the message in transit and provides protection against deletion/replay and insertion attacks. Instead of bespoke software development to implement 2-sided SSL, XML-signature is implemented. Using XML-signature is closer to the web services roadmap than 2-sided SSL and therefore more strategic.\nThe XML-signature can be implemented in several ways but the chosen approach is to use XML Signature as part of the Web Services Security (WSS). WSS specifies how to use XML-signature. Since WSS builds upon the SOAP standard, it is logical to adhere to the SOAP standard as much as possible.\n2.3.   Security features not related to message exchange\n2.3.1.   Authentication of users\nThe users of the Eucaris web application authenticate themselves using a username and password. Since standard Windows authentication is used, States can enhance the level of authentication of users if needed by using client certificates.\n2.3.2.   User roles\nThe Eucaris software application supports different user roles. Each cluster of services has its own authorisation. E.g. (exclusive) users of the \"'Treaty of Eucaris' — functionality\" may not use the \"'Prüm' — functionality\". Administrator services are separated from the regular end-user roles.\n2.3.3.   Logging and tracing of message exchange\nLogging of all message types is facilitated by the Eucaris software application. An administrator function allows the national administrator to determine which messages are logged: requests from end-users, incoming requests from other States, provided information from the national registers, etc.\nThe application can be configured to use an internal database for this logging, or an external (Oracle) database. The decision on what messages have to be logged clearly depends on logging facilities elsewhere in the legacy systems and connected client applications.\nThe header of each message contains information on the requesting State, the requesting organisation within that State and the user involved. Also the reason of the request is indicated.\nBy means of the combined logging in the requesting and responding State complete tracing of any message exchange is possible (e.g. on request of a citizen involved).\nLogging is configured through the Eucaris web client (menu Administration, Logging configuration). The logging functionality is performed by the Core System. When logging is enabled, the complete message (header and body) is stored in one logging record. Per defined service, and per message type that passes along the Core System, the logging level can be set.\nLogging Levels\nThe following logging levels are possible:\nPrivate — Message is logged: The logging is NOT available to the extract logging service but is available on a national level only, for audits and problem solving.\nNone — Message is not logged at all.\nMessage Types\nInformation exchange between States consists of several messages, of which a schematic representation is given in Figure 5 below.\nThe possible message types (in Figure 5 shown for the Eucaris Core System of State X) are the following:\n1.\nRequest to Core System_Request message by Client;\n2.\nRequest to Other State_Request message by Core System of this State;\n3.\nRequest to Core System of this State_Request message by Core System of other State;\n4.\nRequest to Legacy Register_Request message by Core System;\n5.\nRequest to Core System_Request message by Legacy Register;\n6.\nResponse from Core System_Request message by Client;\n7.\nResponse from Other State_Request message by Core System of this State;\n8.\nResponse from Core System of this State_Request message by other State;\n9.\nResponse from Legacy Register_Request message by Core System;\n10.\nResponse from Core System_Request message by Legacy Register.\nThe following information exchanges are shown in Figure 5:\n—\nInformation request from State X to State Y — blue arrows. This request and response consists of message types 1, 2, 7 and 6, respectively,\n—\nInformation request from State Z to State X — red arrows. This request and response consists of message types 3, 4, 9 and 8, respectively,\n—\nInformation request from the legacy register to its core system (this route also includes a request from a custom client behind the legacy register) — green arrows. This kind of request consists of message types 5 and 10.\n2.3.4.   Hardware Security Module\nA Hardware Security Module is not used.\nA Hardware Security Module (HSM) provides good protection for the key used to sign messages and to identify servers. This adds to the overall level of security but an HSM is expensive to buy/maintain and there are no requirements to decide for a FIPS 140-2 level 2 or level 3 HSM. Since a closed network is used that mitigates threats effectively, it is decided not to use an HSM initially. If an HSM is necessary e.g. to obtain accreditation, it can be added to the architecture.\n3.   Technical conditions of the data exchange\n3.1.   General description of the Eucaris application\n3.1.1.   Overview\nThe Eucaris application connects all participating States in a mesh network where each State communicates directly to another State. There is no central component needed for the communication to be established. The Eucaris application handles secure communication to the other States and communicates to the back-end legacy systems of States using XML. The following picture visualises this architecture.\nStates exchange messages by directly sending them to the recipient. The data centre of a State is connected to the network used for the message exchange (TESTA). To access the TESTA network, States connect to TESTA via their national gate. A firewall shall be used to connect to the network and a router connects the Eucaris application to the firewall. Depending on the alternative chosen to protect the messages, a certificate is used either by the router or by the Eucaris application.\nA client application is provided which can be used within a State to query its own register or other States' registers. The client application connects to Eucaris. The clients will be identified by means of user-id/password or a client certificate. The connection to a user in an external organisation (e.g. police) may be encrypted but this is the responsibility of each individual State.\n3.1.2.   Scope of the system\nThe scope of the Eucaris system is limited to the processes involved in the exchange of information between the Registration Authorities in the States and a basic presentation of this information. Procedures and automated processes in which the information is to be used, are outside the scope of the system.\nStates can choose either to use the Eucaris client functionality or to set up their own customised client application. The table below describes which aspects of the Eucaris system are mandatory to use and/or prescribed and which are optional to use and/or free to determine by the States.\nEucaris aspects\nM/O (9)\nRemark\nNetwork concept\nM\nThe concept is an \"any-to-any\" communication.\nPhysical network\nM\nTESTA\nCore application\nM\nThe core application of Eucaris has to be used to connect to the other States. The following functionality is offered by the core:\n—\nEncrypting and signing of the messages;\n—\nChecking of the identity of the sender;\n—\nAuthorisation of States and local users;\n—\nRouting of messages;\n—\nQueuing of asynchronous messages if the recipient service is temporally unavailable;\n—\nMultiple country inquiry functionality;\n—\nLogging of the exchange of messages;\n—\nStorage of incoming messages\nClient application\nO\nIn addition to the core application the Eucaris II client application can be used by a State. When applicable, the core and client application are modified under auspices of the Eucaris organisation.\nSecurity concept\nM\nThe concept is based on XML-signing by means of client certificates and SSL-encryption by means of service certificates.\nMessage specifications\nM\nEvery State has to comply with the message specifications as set by the Eucaris organisation and this Chapter. The specifications can only be changed by the Eucaris organisation in consultation with the States.\nOperation and Support\nM\nThe acceptance of new States or a new functionality is under auspices of the Eucaris organisation. Monitoring and help desk functions are managed centrally by an appointed State.\n3.2.   Functional and Non-Functional Requirements\n3.2.1.   Generic functionality\nIn this section the main generic functions have been described in general terms.\nNo\nDescription\n1.\nThe system allows the Registration Authorities of the States to exchange request and response messages in an interactive way.\n2.\nThe system contains a client application, enabling end-users to send their requests and presenting the response information for manual processing\n3.\nThe system facilitates \"broadcasting\", allowing a State to send a request to all other States. The incoming responses are consolidated by the core application in one response message to the client application (this functionality is called a \"Multiple Country Inquiry\").\n4.\nThe system is able to deal with different types of messages. User roles, authorisation, routing, signing and logging are all defined per specific service.\n5.\nThe system allows the States to exchange batches of messages or messages containing a large number of requests or replies. These messages are dealt with in an asynchronous way.\n6.\nThe system queues asynchronous messages if the recipient State is temporarily unavailable and guarantees the deliverance as soon as the recipient is up again.\n7.\nThe system stores incoming asynchronous messages until they can be processed.\n8.\nThe system only gives access to Eucaris applications of other States, not to individual organisations within those other States, i.e. each Registration Authority acts as the single gateway between its national end-users and the corresponding Authorities in the other States.\n9.\nIt is possible to define users of different States on one Eucaris server and to authorise them following the rights of that State.\n10.\nInformation on the requesting State, organisation and end user are included in the messages.\n11.\nThe system facilitates logging of the exchange of messages between the different States and between the core application and the national registration systems.\n12.\nThe system allows a specific secretary, which is an organisation or State explicitly appointed for this task, to gather logged information on messages sent/received by all the participating States, in order to produce statistical reports.\n13.\nEach State indicates itself what logged information is made available for the secretary and what information is \"private\".\n14.\nThe system allows the National Administrators of each State to extract statistics of use.\n15.\nThe system enables addition of new States through simple administrative tasks.\n3.2.2.   Usability\nNo\nDescription\n16.\nThe system provides an interface for automated processing of messages by back-end systems/legacy and enables the integration of the user interface in those systems (customised user-interface).\n17.\nThe system is easy to learn, self-explanatory and contains help-text.\n18.\nThe system is documented to assist States in integration, operational activities and future maintenance (e.g. reference guides, functional/technical documentation, operational guide, …).\n19.\nThe user interface is multi-lingual and offers facilities for the end-user to select a preferred language.\n20.\nThe user interface contains facilities for a Local Administrator to translate both screen-items and coded information to the national language.\n3.2.3.   Reliability\nNo\nDescription\n21.\nThe system is designed as a robust and dependable operational system which is tolerant to operator errors and which will recover cleanly from power cuts or other disasters. It shall be possible to restart the system with no or minimal loss of data.\n22.\nThe system shall give stable and reproducible results.\n23.\nThe system has been designed to function reliably. It is possible to implement the system in a configuration that guarantees an availability of 98 % (by redundancy, the use of back-up servers, etc.) in each bilateral communication.\n24.\nIt is possible to use part of the system, even during failure of some components (if State C is down, States A and B are still able to communicate). The number of single points of failure in the information chain should be minimised.\n25.\nThe recovery time after a severe failure should be less than one day. It should be possible to minimise down-time by using remote support, e.g. by a central service desk.\n3.2.4.   Performance\nNo\nDescription\n26.\nThe system can be used 24x7. This time-window (24x7) is then also required from the States' legacy systems.\n27.\nThe system responds rapidly to user requests irrespective of any background tasks. This is also required from the Parties legacy systems to ensure acceptable response time. An overall response time of 10 seconds maximum for a single request is acceptable.\n28.\nThe system has been designed as a multi-user system and in such a way that background tasks can continue while the user performs foreground tasks.\n29.\nThe system has been designed to be scaleable in order to support the potential increase of number of messages when new functionality is added or new organisations or States are added.\n3.2.5.   Security\nNo\nDescription\n30.\nThe system is suited (e.g. in its security measures) for the exchange of messages containing privacy-sensitive personal data (e.g. car owner/holders), classified as EU restricted.\n31.\nThe system is maintained in such a way that unauthorised access to the data is prevented.\n32.\nThe system contains a service for the management of the rights and permissions of national end-users.\n33.\nStates are able to check the identity of the sender (at State level), by means of XML-signing.\n34.\nStates shall explicitly authorise other States to request specific information.\n35.\nThe system provides at application level a full security and encryption policy compatible with the level of security required in such situations. Exclusiveness and integrity of the information is guaranteed by the use of XML-signing and encryption by means of SSL-tunnelling.\n36.\nAll exchange of messages can be traced by means of logging.\n37.\nProtection is provided against deletion attacks (a third party deletes a message) and replay or insertion attacks (a third party replays or inserts a message).\n38.\nThe system makes use of certificates of a Trusted Third Party (TTP).\n39.\nThe system is able to handle different certificates per State, depending on the type of message or service.\n40.\nThe security measures at application level are sufficient to allow the use of non-accredited networks.\n41.\nThe system is able to use novice security techniques such as an XML-firewall.\n3.2.6.   Adaptability\nNo\nDescription\n42.\nThe system is extensible with new messages and new functionality. The costs of adaptations are minimal. Due to the centralised development of application components.\n43.\nStates are able to define new message types for bilateral use. Not all States are required to support all message types.\n3.2.7.   Support and Maintenance\nNo\nDescription\n44.\nThe system provides monitoring facilities for a central service-desk and/or operators concerning the network and servers in the different States.\n45.\nThe system provides facilities for remote support by a central service-desk.\n46.\nThe system provides facilities for problem analysis.\n47.\nThe system can be expanded to new States.\n48.\nThe application can easily be installed by staff with a minimum of IT-qualifications and experience. The installation procedure shall be as much as possible automated.\n49.\nThe system provides a permanent testing and acceptance environment.\n50.\nThe annual costs of maintenance and support has been minimised by adherence to market standards and by creating the application in such a way that as little support as possible from a central service-desk is required.\n3.2.8.   Design requirements\nNo\nDescription\n51.\nThe system is designed and documented for an operational lifetime of many years.\n52.\nThe system has been designed in such a way that it is independent of the network provider.\n53.\nThe system is compliant with the existing HW/SW in the States by interacting with those registration systems using open standard web service technology (XML, XSD, SOAP, WSDL, HTTP(s), Web services, WSS, X.509, etc.).\n3.2.9.   Applicable standards\nNo\nDescription\n54.\nThe system is compliant with data protection issues as stated in Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 (Articles 21, 22 and 23) and Directive 95/46/EC.\n55.\nThe system complies with the IDA Standards.\n56.\nThe system supports UTF8.\nCHAPTER 4\nEVALUATION PROCEDURE REFERRED TO IN ARTICLE 540\nArticle 1\nQuestionnaire\n1.

The administrative penalties, fines, fees and surcharges and the interest and costs referred to in point (b) of Article PVAT.2(1) of this Protocol which, in accordance with the rules in force in the applicant State, may be due from the date of the initial instrument permitting enforcement until the day before the date on which the recovery request is sent, may be added in the uniform instrument permitting enforcement in the requested State.\n2.   A single uniform instrument permitting enforcement in the requested State may be issued in respect of several claims and several persons, corresponding to the initial instrument or instruments permitting enforcement in the applicant State.\n3.   In so far as initial instruments permitting enforcement for several claims in the applicant State have already been replaced by a global instrument permitting enforcement for all those claims in that State, the uniform instrument permitting enforcement in the requested State may be based on the initial instruments permitting enforcement in the applicant State or on that global instrument regrouping those initial instruments in the applicant State.\n4.   Where the initial instrument referred to in paragraph 2 or the global instrument referred to in paragraph 3 contains several claims, one or more of which have already been collected or recovered, the uniform instrument permitting enforcement in the requested State shall only refer to those claims for which recovery assistance is requested.\n5.   Where the initial instrument referred to in paragraph 2 or the global instrument referred to in paragraph 3 contains several claims, the applicant authority may list those claims in different uniform instruments permitting enforcement in the requested State, in line with the tax type related division of competences of the respective recovery offices in the requested State.\n6.   If a request cannot be transmitted by CCN network and is transmitted by post, the uniform instrument permitting enforcement in the requested State shall be signed by a duly authorised official of the applicant authority.\nArticle 4.3\nConversion of the sums to be recovered\n1.   The applicant authority shall express the amount of the claim to be recovered in the currency of the applicant State and in the currency of the requested State.\n2.

Such authorisation shall not be required in the case of a frontier worker.\n2.\nThe competent institution of a State whose legislation provides for meeting the costs of transporting the body of a person killed in an accident at work to the place of burial shall, in accordance with the legislation it applies, meet such costs to the corresponding place in the State where the person was residing at the time of the accident.\nArticle SSC.33\nBenefits for an occupational disease where the person suffering from such a disease has been exposed to the same risk in several States\nWhen a person who has contracted an occupational disease has, under the legislation of two or more States, pursued an activity which by its nature is likely to cause the said disease, the benefits that that person or his or her survivors may claim shall be provided exclusively under the legislation of the last of those States whose conditions are satisfied.\nArticle SSC.34\nAggravation of an occupational disease\nIn the event of aggravation of an occupational disease for which a person suffering from such a disease has received or is receiving benefits under the legislation of a State, the following rules shall apply:\n(a)\nif the person concerned, while in receipt of benefits, has not pursued, under the legislation of another State, an activity as an employed or self-employed person likely to cause or aggravate the disease in question, the competent institution of the first State shall bear the cost of the benefits under the provisions of the legislation which it applies, taking into account the aggravation;\n(b)\nif the person concerned, while in receipt of benefits, has pursued such an activity under the legislation of another State, the competent institution of the first State shall bear the cost of the benefits under the legislation it applies without taking the aggravation into account. The competent institution of the second State shall grant a supplement to the person concerned, the amount of which shall be equal to the difference between the amount of benefits due after the aggravation and the amount which would have been due prior to the aggravation under the legislation it applies, if the disease in question had occurred under the legislation of that State;\n(c)\nthe rules concerning reduction, suspension or withdrawal laid down by the legislation of a State shall not be invoked against persons receiving benefits provided by institutions of two States in accordance with point (b).\nArticle SSC.35\nRules for taking into account the special features of certain legislation\n1.\nIf there is no insurance against accidents at work or occupational diseases in the State in which the person concerned resides or stays, or if such insurance exists but there is no institution responsible for providing benefits in kind, those benefits shall be provided by the institution of the place of residence or stay responsible for providing benefits in kind in the event of sickness.\n2.\nIf there is no insurance against accidents at work or occupational diseases in the competent State, the provisions of this Chapter concerning benefits in kind shall nevertheless be applied to a person who is entitled to those benefits in the event of sickness, maternity or equivalent paternity under the legislation of that State if that person sustains an accident at work or suffers from an occupational disease during a residence or stay in another State.

confirmed previously under the legislation it applies; and\n(b)\nno compensation is due in respect of an accident at work or an occupational disease which had occurred or had been confirmed subsequently, under the legislation of the other State under which the accident at work or the occupational disease had occurred or been confirmed.\nArticle SSC.36\nReimbursements between institutions\n1.\nArticle SSC.30 also applies to benefits falling within this Chapter, and reimbursement shall be made on the basis of actual costs.\n2.\nThe States, or their competent authorities,

under the legislations of two or more States, when that pensioner was residing in a State other than that of the institution responsible for the cost of benefits in kind provided under Articles SSC.22 and SSC.23, the death grants payable under the legislation administered by that institution shall be provided at its own expense as though the pensioner had been residing at the time of their death in the State in which that institution is situated.\n2.\nParagraph 1 applies mutatis mutandis to the members of the family of a pensioner.\nCHAPTER 4\nINVALIDITY BENEFITS\nArticle SSC.39\nCalculation of invalidity benefits\nWithout prejudice to Article SSC.7, where, under the legislation of the State competent under Title II of this Protocol, the amount of invalidity benefits is dependent on the duration of the periods of insurance, employment, self-employment or residence, the competent State is not required to take into account any such periods completed under the legislation of another State for the purposes of calculating the amount of invalidity benefit payable.\nArticle SSC.40\nSpecial provisions on aggregation of periods\nThe competent institution of a State whose legislation makes the acquisition, retention or recovery of the right to benefits conditional upon the completion of periods of insurance or residence shall, where necessary, apply Article SSC.46 mutatis mutandis.\nArticle SSC.41\nAggravation of invalidity\nIn the case of aggravation of an invalidity for which a person is receiving benefits under the legislation of a State in accordance with this Protocol, the benefit shall continue to be provided in accordance with this Chapter, taking the aggravation into account.\nArticle SSC.42\nConversion of invalidity benefits into old-age benefits\n1.\nWhere provided for in the legislation of the State paying invalidity benefit in accordance with this Protocol, invalidity benefits shall be converted into old-age benefits under the conditions laid down by the legislation under which they are provided and in accordance with Chapter 5 of Title III.\n2.\nWhere a person receiving invalidity benefits can establish a claim to old-age benefits under the legislation of one or more other States, in accordance with Article SSC.45, any institution which is responsible for providing invalidity benefits under the legislation of a State shall continue to provide such a person with the invalidity benefits to which he or she is entitled under the legislation it applies until paragraph 1 becomes applicable in respect of that institution, or otherwise for as long as the person concerned satisfies the conditions for such benefits.\nArticle SSC.43\nSpecial provisions for civil servants\nArticles SSC.7, SSC.39, SSC.41, SSC.42 and Article SSC.55(2) and (3) apply mutatis mutandis to persons covered by a special scheme for civil servants.\nCHAPTER 5\nOLD-AGE AND SURVIVORS' PENSIONS\nArticle SSC.44\nTaking into account child-raising periods\n1.\nWhere, under the legislation of the State which is competent under Title II, no child-raising period is taken into account, the institution of the State whose legislation, according to Title II, was applicable to the person concerned on the grounds that he or she was pursuing an activity as an employed or self-employed person at the date when, under that legislation, the child-raising period started to be taken into account for the child concerned, shall remain responsible for taking into account that period as a child-raising period under its own legislation, as if such child-raising took place in its own territory.\n2.\nParagraph 1 shall not apply if the person concerned is, or becomes, subject to the legislation of another State due to the pursuit of an employed or self-employed activity.\nArticle SSC.45\nGeneral provisions\n1.\nAll the competent institutions shall determine entitlement to benefit, under all the legislations of the States to which the person concerned has been subject, when a request for award has been submitted, unless the person concerned expressly requests deferment of the award of old age benefits under the legislation of one or more States.\n2.\nIf at a given moment the person concerned does not satisfy, or no longer satisfies, the conditions laid down by all the legislations of the States to which that person has been subject, the institutions applying legislation the conditions of which have been satisfied shall not take into account, when performing the calculation in accordance with point (a) or (b) of Article SSC.47(1), the periods completed under the legislations the conditions of which have not been satisfied, or are no longer satisfied, where this gives rise to a lower amount of benefit.\n3.\nParagraph 2 shall apply mutatis mutandis when the person concerned has expressly requested deferment of the award of old-age benefits.\n4.\nA new calculation shall be performed automatically as and when the conditions to be fulfilled under the other legislations are satisfied or when a person requests the award of an old-age benefit deferred in accordance with paragraph 1, unless the periods completed under the other legislations have already been taken into account by virtue of paragraph 2 or 3.\nArticle SSC.46\nSpecial provisions on aggregation of periods\n1.\nWhere the legislation of a State makes the granting of certain benefits conditional upon the periods of insurance having been completed only in a specific activity as an employed or self-employed person or in an occupation which is subject to a special scheme for employed or self-employed persons, the competent institution of that State shall take into account periods completed under the legislation of other States only if completed under a corresponding scheme or, failing that, in the same occupation, or where appropriate, in the same activity as an employed or self-employed person.\nIf, account having been taken of the periods thus completed, the person concerned does not satisfy the conditions for receipt of the benefits of a special scheme, these periods shall be taken into account for the purposes of providing the benefits of the general scheme or, failing that, of the scheme applicable to manual or clerical workers, as the case may be, provided that the person concerned had been affiliated to one or other of those schemes.\n2.\nThe periods of insurance completed under a special scheme of a State shall be taken into account for the purposes of providing the benefits of the general scheme or, failing that, of the scheme applicable to manual or clerical workers, as the case may be, of another State, provided that the person concerned had been affiliated to one or other of those schemes, even if those periods have already been taken into account in the latter State under a special scheme.\n3.\nWhere the legislation or specific scheme of a State makes the acquisition, retention or recovery of the right to benefits conditional upon the person concerned being insured at the time of the materialisation of the risk, this condition shall be regarded as having been satisfied if that person has been previously insured under the legislation or specific scheme of that State and is, at the time of the materialisation of the risk, insured under the legislation of another State for the same risk or, failing that, if a benefit is due under the legislation of another State for the same risk. The latter condition shall, however, be deemed to be fulfilled in the cases referred to in Article SSC.52.\nArticle SSC.47\nAward of benefits\n1.\nThe competent institution shall calculate the amount of the benefit that would be due:\n(a)\nunder the legislation it applies, only where the conditions for entitlement to benefits have been satisfied exclusively under national law (independent benefit);\n(b)\nby calculating a theoretical amount and subsequently an actual amount (pro rata benefit), as follows:\n(i)\nthe theoretical amount of the benefit is equal to the benefit which the person concerned could claim if all the periods of insurance and/or of residence which have been completed under the legislations of the other States had been completed under the legislation it applies on the date of the award of the benefit. If, under this legislation, the amount does not depend on the duration of the periods completed, that amount shall be regarded as being the theoretical amount;\n(ii)\nthe competent institution shall then establish the actual amount of the pro rata benefit by applying to the theoretical amount the ratio between the duration of the periods completed before materialisation of the risk under the legislation it applies and the total duration of the periods completed before materialisation of the risk under the legislations of all the States concerned.\n2.\nWhere appropriate, the competent institution shall apply, to the amount calculated in accordance with points (a) and (b) of paragraph 1, all the rules relating to reduction, suspension or withdrawal, under the legislation it applies, within the limits provided for by Articles SSC.48, SSC.49 and SSC.50.\n3.\nThe person concerned shall be entitled to receive from the competent institution of each State the higher of the amounts calculated in accordance with points (a) and (b) of paragraph 1.\n4.\nWhere the calculation pursuant to point (a) of paragraph 1 in one State invariably results in the independent benefit being equal to or higher than the pro rata benefit, calculated in accordance with point (b) of paragraph 1, the competent institution shall waive the pro rata calculation, provided that:\n(a)\nsuch a situation is set out in Part 1 of Annex SSC-4;\n(b)\nno legislation containing rules against overlapping, as referred to in Articles SSC.49 and SSC.50, is applicable unless the conditions laid down in Article SSC.50(2) are fulfilled; and\n(c)\nArticle SSC.52 is not applicable in relation to periods completed under the legislation of another State in the specific circumstances of the case.\n5.\nNotwithstanding paragraphs 1, 2 and 3, the pro rata calculation shall not apply to schemes providing benefits in respect of which periods of time are of no relevance to the calculation, subject to such schemes being listed in Part 2 of Annex SSC-4. In such cases, the person concerned shall be entitled to the benefit calculated in accordance with the legislation of the State concerned.\nArticle SSC.48\nRules to prevent overlapping\n1.\nAny overlapping of old-age and survivors' benefits calculated or provided on the basis of periods of insurance or residence completed by the same person shall be considered to be overlapping of benefits of the same kind.\n2.\nOverlapping of benefits which cannot be considered to be of the same kind within the meaning of paragraph 1 shall be considered to be overlapping of benefits of a different kind.\n3.\nThe following provisions shall be applicable for the purposes of rules to prevent overlapping laid down by the legislation of a State in the case of overlapping of a benefit in respect of old age or survivors with a benefit of the same kind or a benefit of a different kind or with other income:\n(a)\nthe competent institution shall take into account the benefits or incomes acquired in another State only where the legislation it applies provides for benefits or income acquired abroad to be taken into account;\n(b)\nthe competent institution shall take into account the amount of benefits to be paid by another State before deduction of tax, social security contributions and other individual levies or deductions, unless the legislation it applies provides for the application of rules to prevent overlapping after such deductions, under the conditions and the procedures laid down in Annex SSC-7;\n(c)\nthe competent institution shall not take into account the amount of benefits acquired under the legislation of another State on the basis of voluntary insurance or continued optional insurance;\n(d)\nif a single State applies rules to prevent overlapping because the person concerned receives benefits of the same or of a different kind under the legislation of other States or income acquired in other States, the benefit due may be reduced solely by the amount of such benefits or such income.\nArticle SSC.49\nOverlapping of benefits of the same kind\n1.\nWhere benefits of the same kind due under the legislation of two or more States overlap, the rules to prevent overlapping laid down by the legislation of a State shall not be applicable to a pro rata benefit.\n2.\nThe rules to prevent overlapping shall apply to an independent benefit only if the benefit concerned is:\n(a)\na benefit the amount of which does not depend on the duration of periods of insurance or residence; or\n(b)\na benefit the amount of which is determined on the basis of a credited period deemed to have been completed between the date on which the risk materialised and a later date, overlapping with:\n(i)\na benefit of the same type, except where an agreement has been concluded between two or more States to avoid the same credited period being taken into account more than once; or\n(ii)\na benefit referred to in point (a).\nThe benefits and agreements referred to in points (a) and (b) are listed in Annex SSC-5.\nArticle SSC.50\nOverlapping of benefits of a different kind\n1.\nIf the receipt of benefits of a different kind or other income requires the application of the rules to prevent overlapping provided for by the legislation of the States concerned regarding:\n(a)\ntwo or more independent benefits, the competent institutions shall divide the amounts of the benefit or benefits or other income, as they have been taken into account, by the number of benefits subject to the said rules;\nhowever, the application of this point cannot deprive the person concerned of their status as a pensioner for the purposes of the other chapters of this Title under the conditions and the procedures laid down in Annex SSC-7;\n(b)\none or more pro rata benefits, the competent institutions shall take into account the benefit or benefits or other income and all the elements stipulated for applying the rules to prevent overlapping as a function of the ratio between the periods of insurance and/or residence established for the calculation referred to in point (b)(ii) of Article SSC.47(1);\n(c)\none or more independent benefits and one or more pro-rata benefits, the competent institutions shall apply mutatis mutandis point (a) as regards independent benefits and point (b) as regards pro rata benefits.\n2.\nThe competent institution shall not apply the division stipulated in respect of independent benefits, if the legislation it applies provides for account to be taken of benefits of a different kind or other income and all other elements for calculating part of their amount determined as a function of the ratio between periods of insurance and/or residence referred to in point (b)(ii) of Article SSC.47(1).\n3.\nParagraphs 1 and 2 shall apply mutatis mutandis where the legislation of one or more States provides that a right to a benefit cannot be acquired in the case where the person concerned is in receipt of a benefit of a different kind, payable under the legislation of another State, or of other income.\nArticle SSC.51\nAdditional provisions for the calculation of benefits\n1.\nFor the calculation of the theoretical and pro rata amounts referred to in point (b) of Article SSC.47(1), the following rules apply:\n(a)\nwhere the total length of the periods of insurance and/or residence completed before the risk materialised under the legislations of all the States concerned is longer than the maximum period required by the legislation of one of these States for receipt of full benefit, the competent institution of that State shall take into account this maximum period instead of the total length of the periods completed; this method of calculation shall not result in the imposition on that institution of the cost of a benefit greater than the full benefit provided for by the legislation it applies. This provision shall not apply to benefits the amount of which does not depend on the length of insurance;\n(b)\nthe procedure for taking into account overlapping periods is laid down in Annex SSC-7;\n(c)\nif the legislation of a State provides that the benefits are to be calculated on the basis of incomes, contributions, bases of contributions, increases, earnings, other amounts or a combination of more than one of them (average, proportional, fixed or credited), the competent institution shall:\n(i)\ndetermine the basis for calculation of the benefits in accordance only with periods of insurance completed under the legislation it applies;\n(ii)\nuse, in order to determine the amount to be calculated in accordance with the periods of insurance and/or residence completed under the legislation of the other States, the same elements determined or recorded for the periods of insurance completed under the legislation it applies;\nwhere necessary in accordance with the procedures laid down in Annex SSC-6 for the State concerned;\n(d)\nin the event that point (c) is not applicable because the legislation of a State provides for the benefit to be calculated on the basis of elements other than periods of insurance or residence which are not linked to time, the competent institution shall take into account, in respect of each period of insurance or residence completed under the legislation of any other State, the amount of the capital accrued, the capital which is considered as having been accrued or any other element for the calculation under the legislation it administers divided by the corresponding units of periods in the pension scheme concerned.\n2.\nThe provisions of the legislation of a State concerning the revalorisation of the elements taken into account for the calculation of benefits shall apply, as appropriate, to the elements to be taken into account by the competent institution of that State, in accordance with paragraph 1, in respect of the periods of insurance or residence completed under the legislation of other States.\nArticle SSC.52\nPeriods of insurance or residence of less than one year\n1.\nNotwithstanding point (b) of Article SSC.47(1), the institution of a State shall not be required to provide benefits in respect of periods completed under the legislation it applies which are taken into account when the risk materialises, if:\n(a)\nthe duration of the said periods is less than one year; and\n(b)\ntaking only these periods into account no right to benefit is acquired under that legislation.\nFor the purposes of this Article, \"periods\" shall mean all periods of insurance, employment, self-employment or residence which either qualify for, or directly increase, the benefit concerned.\n2.\nThe competent institution of each of the States concerned shall take into account the periods referred to in paragraph 1, for the purposes of point (b)(i) of Article SSC.47(1).\n3.\nIf the effect of applying paragraph 1 would be to relieve all the institutions of the States concerned of their obligations, benefits shall be provided exclusively under the legislation of the last of those States whose conditions are satisfied, as if all the periods of insurance and residence completed and taken into account in accordance with Article SSC.7 and Article SSC.46(1) and (2) had been completed under the legislation of that State.\n4.\nThis Article does not apply to schemes listed in Part 2 of Annex SSC-4.\nArticle SSC.53\nAward of a supplement\n1.\nA recipient of benefits to whom this Chapter applies may not, in the State of residence and under whose legislation a benefit is payable to them, be provided with a benefit which is less than the minimum benefit fixed by that legislation for a period of insurance or residence equal to all the periods taken into account for the payment in accordance with this Chapter.\n2.\nThe competent institution of that State shall pay them throughout the period of their residence in its territory a supplement equal to the difference between the total of the benefits due under this Chapter and the amount of the minimum benefit.\nArticle SSC.54\nRecalculation and revaluation of benefits\n1.\nIf the method for determining benefits or the rules for calculating benefits are altered under the legislation of a State, or if the personal situation of the person concerned undergoes a relevant change which, under that legislation, would lead to an adjustment of the amount of the benefit, a recalculation shall be carried out in accordance with Article SSC.47.\n2.\nOn the other hand, if, by reason of an increase in the cost of living or changes in the level of income or other grounds for adjustment, the benefits of the State concerned are altered by a percentage or fixed amount, such percentage or fixed amount shall be applied directly to the benefits determined in accordance with Article SSC.47, without the need for a recalculation.\nArticle SSC.55\nSpecial provisions for civil servants\n1.\nArticles SSC.7 and SSC.45, Article SSC.46(3) and Articles SSC.47 to SSC.54 apply mutatis mutandis to persons covered by a special scheme for civil servants.\n2.\nHowever, if the legislation of a competent State makes the acquisition, liquidation, retention or recovery of the right to benefits under a special scheme for civil servants subject to the condition that all periods of insurance be completed under one or more special schemes for civil servants in that State, or be regarded by the legislation of that State as equivalent to such periods, the competent institution of that State shall take into account only the periods which can be recognised under the legislation it applies.\nIf, account having been taken of the periods thus completed, the person concerned does not satisfy the conditions for the receipt of these benefits, these periods shall be taken into account for the award of benefits under the general scheme or, failing that, the scheme applicable to manual or clerical workers, as the case may be.\n3.\nWhere, under the legislation of a State, benefits under a special scheme for civil servants are calculated on the basis of the last salary or salaries received during a reference period, the competent institution of that State shall take into account, for the purposes of the calculation, only those salaries, duly revalued, which were received during the period or periods for which the person concerned was subject to that legislation.\nCHAPTER 6\nUNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS\nArticle SSC.56\nSpecial provisions on aggregation of periods of insurance, employment or self-employment\n1.\nThe competent institution of a State whose legislation makes the acquisition, retention, recovery or duration of the right to benefits conditional upon the completion of either periods of insurance, employment or self-employment shall, to the extent necessary, take into account periods of insurance, employment or self-employment completed under the legislation of any other State as though they were completed under the legislation it applies.\nHowever, when the applicable legislation makes the right to benefits conditional on the completion of periods of insurance, the periods of employment or self-employment completed under the legislation of another State shall not be taken into account unless such periods would have been considered to be periods of insurance had they been completed in accordance with the applicable legislation.\n2.\nThe application of paragraph 1 of this Article shall be conditional on the person concerned having the most recently completed, in accordance with the legislation under which the

of self-employment, if that legislation requires periods of self-employment.\nArticle SSC.57\nCalculation of unemployment benefits\n1.\nWhere the calculation of unemployment benefits is based on the amount of the previous salary or professional income of the person concerned, the competent State shall take into account the salary or professional income received by the person concerned based exclusively on their last activity as an employed or self-employed person under the legislation of the competent State.\n2.\nWhere the legislation applied by the competent State provides for a specific reference period for the determination of the salary or professional income used to calculate the amount of benefit, and the person concerned was subject to the legislation of another State for all or part of that reference period, the competent State shall only take into account the salary or professional income received during their last activity as an employed or self-employed person under that legislation.\nCHAPTER 7\nPRE-RETIREMENT BENEFITS\nArticle SSC.58\nBenefits\nWhen the applicable legislation makes the right to pre-retirement benefits conditional on the completion of periods of insurance, of employment or of self-employment, Article SSC.7 shall not apply.\nTITLE IV\nMISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS\nArticle SSC.59\nCooperation\n1.\nThe competent authorities of the States shall notify the Specialised Committee on Social Security Coordination of any changes to their legislation as regards the branches of social security covered by Article SSC.3 which are relevant to or

authorities of the States shall communicate to each other measures taken to implement this Protocol that are not notified under paragraph 1 and that are relevant for the implementation of this Protocol.\n3.\nFor the purposes of this Protocol, the authorities and institutions of the States shall lend one another their good offices and act as though implementing their own legislation.

However, the Specialised Committee on Social Security Coordination shall establish the nature of reimbursable expenses and the limits above which their reimbursement is due.\n4.\nThe authorities and institutions of the States may, for the purposes of this Protocol, communicate directly with one another and with the persons involved or their representatives.\n5.\nThe institutions and persons covered by this Protocol shall have a duty of mutual information and cooperation to ensure the correct implementation of this Protocol.\nThe institutions, in accordance with the principle of good administration, shall respond to all queries within a reasonable period of time and shall in this connection provide the persons concerned with any information required for exercising the rights conferred on them by this Protocol.\nThe persons concerned must inform the institutions of the competent State and of the State of residence as soon as possible of any change in their personal or family situation which affects their right to benefits under this Protocol.\n6.\nFailure to respect the obligation of information referred to in the third subparagraph of paragraph 5 may result in the application of proportionate measures in accordance with national law. Nevertheless, these measures shall be equivalent to those applicable to similar situations under domestic law and shall not make it impossible or excessively difficult in practice for claimants to exercise the rights conferred on them by this Protocol.\n7.\nIn the event of difficulties in the interpretation or application of this Protocol which could jeopardise the rights of a person covered by it, the institution of the competent State or of the State of residence of the person concerned, shall contact the institution(s) of the State(s) concerned. If a solution cannot be found within a reasonable period, a Party may request to hold consultations in the framework of the Specialised Committee on Social Security Coordination.\n8.\nThe authorities, institutions and tribunals of one State may not reject applications or other documents submitted to them on the grounds that they are written in an official language of the Union, including in English.\nArticle SSC.60\nData processing\n1.\nThe States shall progressively use new technologies for the exchange, access and processing of the data required to apply this Protocol.\n2.\nEach State shall be responsible for managing its own part of the data-processing services.\n3.\nAn electronic document sent or issued by an institution in conformity with this Protocol and Annex SSC-7 may not be rejected by any authority or institution of another State on the grounds that it was received by electronic means, once the receiving institution has declared that it can receive electronic documents. Reproduction and recording of such documents shall be presumed to be a correct and accurate reproduction of the original document or representation of the information it relates to, unless there is proof to the contrary.\n4.\nAn electronic document shall be considered valid if the computer system on which the document is recorded contains the safeguards necessary in order to prevent any alteration, disclosure or unauthorised access to the recording. It shall at any time be possible to reproduce the recorded information in an immediately readable form.\nArticle SSC.61\nExemptions\n1.\nAny exemption from or reduction of taxes, stamp duty, notarial or registration fees provided for under the legislation of one State in respect of certificates or documents required to be produced in application of the legislation of that State shall be extended to similar certificates or documents required to be produced in application of the legislation of another State or of this Protocol.\n2.\nAll statements, documents and certificates of any kind whatsoever required to be produced in application of this Protocol shall be exempt from authentication by diplomatic or consular authorities.\nArticle SSC.62\nClaims, declarations or appeals\nAny claim, declaration or appeal which should have been submitted, in application of the legislation of one State, within a specified period to an authority, institution or tribunal of that State shall be admissible if it is submitted within the same period to a corresponding authority, institution or tribunal of another State. In such a case, the authority, institution or tribunal receiving the claim, declaration or appeal shall forward it without delay to the competent authority, institution or tribunal of the former State either directly or through the competent authorities of the States concerned. The date on which such claims, declarations or appeals were submitted to the authority, institution or tribunal of the second State shall be considered as the date of their submission to the competent authority, institution or tribunal.\nArticle SSC.63\nMedical examinations\n1.\nMedical examinations provided for by the legislation of one State may be carried out, at the request of the competent institution, in the territory of another State, by the institution of the place of stay or residence of the person entitled to benefits, under the conditions laid down in Annex SSC-7 or agreed between the competent authorities of the States concerned.\n2.\nMedical examinations carried out under the conditions laid down in paragraph 1 shall be considered as having been carried out in the territory of the competent State.\nArticle SSC.64\nCollection of contributions and recovery of benefits\n1.\nCollection of contributions due to an institution of one State and recovery of benefits provided by the institution of one State but not due, may be effected in another State in accordance with the procedures and with the guarantees and privileges applicable to the collection of contributions due to the corresponding institution of the latter and the recovery of benefits provided by it but not due.\n2.\nEnforceable decisions of the judicial and administrative authorities relating to the collection of contributions, interest and any other charges or to the recovery of benefits provided but not due under the legislation of one State shall be recognised and enforced at the request of the competent institution in another State within the limits and in accordance with the procedures laid down by the legislation and any other procedures applicable to similar decisions of the latter. Such decisions shall be declared enforceable in that State insofar as the legislation and any other procedures of that State so require.\n3.\nClaims of an institution of one State shall in enforcement, bankruptcy or settlement proceedings in another State enjoy the same privileges as the legislation that the latter accords to claims of the same kind.\n4.\nThe procedure for implementing this Article, including costs reimbursement, shall be governed by Annex SSC-7 or, where necessary and as a complementary measure, by means of agreements between the States.\nArticle SSC.65\nRights of institutions\n1.\nIf a person receives benefits under the legislation of a State in respect of an injury resulting from events occurring in another State, any rights of the institution responsible for providing benefits against a third party liable to provide compensation for the injury shall be governed by the following rules:\n(a)\nwhere the institution responsible for providing benefits is, under the legislation it applies, subrogated to the rights which the beneficiary has against the third party, such subrogation shall be recognised by each State;\n(b)\nwhere the institution responsible for providing benefits has a direct right against the third party, each State shall recognise such rights.\n2.\nIf a person receives benefits under the legislation of one State in respect of an injury resulting from events occurring in another State, the provisions of the said legislation which determine the cases in which the civil liability of employers or of their employees is to be excluded shall apply with regard to the said person or to the competent institution.\nParagraph 1 shall also apply to any rights of the institution responsible for providing benefits against employers or their employees in cases where their liability is not excluded.\n3.\nWhere, in accordance with Article SSC.30(3) or SSC.36(2), two or more States or their competent authorities have concluded an agreement to waive reimbursement between institutions under their jurisdiction, or, where reimbursement does not depend on the amount of benefits actually provided, any rights arising against a liable third party shall be governed by the following rules:\n(a)\nwhere the institution of the State of residence or stay grants benefits to a person in respect of an injury sustained in its territory, that institution, in accordance with the provisions of the legislation it applies, shall exercise the right to subrogation or direct action against the third party liable to provide compensation for the injury;\n(b)\nfor the application of point (a):\n(i)\nthe person receiving benefits shall be deemed to be insured with the institution of the place of residence or stay, and\n(ii)\nthat institution shall be deemed to be the institution responsible for providing benefits;\n(c)\nparagraphs 1 and 2 shall remain applicable in respect of any benefits not covered by the waiver agreement or a reimbursement which does not depend on the amount of benefits actually provided.\nArticle SSC.66\nImplementation of legislation\nSpecial provisions for implementing the legislation of a certain State are referred to in Annex SSC-6 to the Protocol.\nTITLE V\nFINAL PROVISIONS\nArticle SSC.67\nProtection of individual rights\n1.\nThe Parties shall ensure in accordance with their domestic legal orders that the provisions of the Protocol on Social Security Coordination have the force of law, either directly or through domestic legislation giving effect to those provisions, so that legal or natural persons can invoke those provisions before domestic courts, tribunals and administrative authorities.\n2.\nThe Parties shall ensure the means for legal and natural persons to effectively protect their rights under this Protocol, such as the possibility to address complaints to administrative bodies or to bring legal action before a competent court or tribunal in an appropriate judicial procedure, in order to seek an adequate and timely remedy.\nArticle SSC.68\nAmendments\nThe Specialised Committee on Social Security Coordination may amend the Annexes and Appendices to this Protocol.\nArticle SSC.69\nTermination of this Protocol\nWithout prejudice to Article 779 of this Agreement, each Party may at any moment terminate this Protocol, by written notification through diplomatic channels.

Application of Dutch legislation relating to incapacity for work\nIn calculating benefits under either the WAO, WIA or the WAZ, the Netherlands institutions shall take account of:\n—\nperiods of paid employment, and periods treated as such, completed in the Netherlands before 1 July 1967,\n—\nperiods of insurance completed under the WAO,\n—\nperiods of insurance completed by the person concerned, after the age of 15, under the Algemene Arbeidsongeschiktheidswet (General Act on Incapacity for Work), in so far as they do not coincide with the periods of insurance completed under the WAO,\n—\nperiods of insurance completed under the WAZ,\n—\nperiods of insurance completed under the WIA.\nSPAIN\n1.\nFor the purpose of implementing point (1)(b) of Article SSC.47(1) of this Protocol, the years which the worker lacks to reach the pensionable or compulsory retirement age as stipulated under Article 31(4) of the consolidated version of the Ley de Clases Pasivas del Estado (Law on State Pensioners) shall be taken into account as actual years of service to the State only if at the time of the event in respect of which death pensions are due, the beneficiary was covered by Spain's special scheme for civil servants or was performing an activity assimilated under the scheme, or if, at the time of the event in respect of which the pensions are due, the beneficiary was performing an activity that would have required the person concerned to be included under the State's special scheme for civil servants, the armed forces or the judiciary, had the activity been performed in Spain.\n2.\n(a)\nUnder point (c) of Article SSC.51(1), the calculation of the theoretical Spanish benefit shall be carried out on the basis of the actual contributions of the person during the years immediately preceding payment of the last contribution to Spanish social security. Where, in the calculation of the basic amount for the pension, periods of insurance and/or residence under the legislation of other States have to be taken into account, the contribution basis in Spain which is closest in time to the reference periods shall be used for those periods, taking into account the development of the retail price index.\n(b)\nThe amount of the pension obtained shall be increased by the amount of the increases and revaluations calculated for each subsequent year for pensions of the same nature.\n3.\nPeriods completed in other States which must be calculated in the special scheme for civil servants, the armed forces and the judicial administration, will be treated in the same way, for the purposes of Article SSC.51 of this Protocol, as the periods closest in time covered as a civil servant in Spain.\n4.\nThe additional amounts based on age referred to in the Second Transitional Provision of the General Law on Social Security shall be applicable to all beneficiaries under this Protocol who have contributions to their name under the Spanish legislation prior to 1 January 1967; it shall not be possible, by application of Article SSC.6 of this Protocol, to treat periods of insurance credited in another State prior to 1 January 1967 as being the same as contributions paid in Spain, solely for the purposes of this Protocol. The date corresponding to 1 January 1967 shall be 1 August 1970 for the Special Scheme for Seafarers and 1 April 1969 for the Special Social Security Scheme for Coal Mining.\nSWEDEN\n1.\nThe provisions of this Protocol on the aggregation of insurance periods and periods of residence shall not apply to the transitional provisions in the Swedish legislation on entitlement to guarantee pension for persons born in or before 1937 who have been resident in Sweden for a specified period before applying for a pension (Act 2000:798).\n2.\nFor the purpose of calculating income for notional income-related sickness compensation and income-related activity compensation in accordance with Chapter 8 of the Lag (1962:381) om allmän försäkring (the National Insurance Act), the following shall apply:\n(a)\nwhere the insured person, during the reference period, has also been subject to the legislation of one or more other States on account of activity as an employed or self-employed person, income in the State(s) concerned shall be deemed to be equivalent to the insured person's average gross income in Sweden during the part of the reference period in Sweden, calculated by dividing the earnings in Sweden by the number of years over which those earnings accrued;\n3.\n(a)\nFor the purpose of calculating notional pension assets for income-based survivor's pension (Act 2000:461), if the requirement in Swedish legislation for pension entitlement in respect of at least three out of the 5 calendar years immediately preceding the insured person's death (reference period) is not met, account shall also be taken of insurance periods completed in other States as if they had been completed in Sweden. Insurance periods in other States shall be regarded as based on the average Swedish pension base. If the person concerned has only 1 year in Sweden with a pension base, each insurance period in another State shall be regarded as constituting the same amount.\n(b)\nFor the purpose of calculating notional pension credits for widows' pensions relating to deaths on or after 1 January 2003, if the requirement in Swedish legislation for pension credits in respect of at least two out of the 4 years immediately preceding the insured person's death (reference period) is not met and insurance periods were completed in another State during the reference period, those years shall be regarded as being based on the same pension credits as the Swedish year.\nUNITED KINGDOM\n1.\nWhere, in accordance with United Kingdom legislation, a person may be entitled to a retirement pension if:\n(a)\nthe contributions of a former spouse are taken into account as if they were that person's own contributions; or\n(b)\nthe relevant contribution conditions are satisfied by that person's spouse or former spouse, then provided, in each case, that the spouse or former spouse is or had been exercising an activity as an employed or self-employed person, and had been subject to the legislation of two or more States, the provisions of Chapter 5 of Title III of this Protocol shall apply in order to determine entitlement under United Kingdom legislation. In that case, references in Articles SSC.44 to SSC.55 of this Protocol to \"periods of insurance\" shall be construed as references to periods of insurance completed by:\n(i)\na spouse or former spouse where a claim is made by:\n—\na married woman, or\n—\na person whose marriage has terminated otherwise than by the death of the spouse; or\n(ii)\na former spouse, where a claim is made by:\n—\na widower who immediately before pensionable age is not entitled to a widowed parent's allowance, or\n—\na widow who immediately before pensionable age is not entitled to a widowed mother's allowance, widowed parent's allowance or widow's pension, or who is only entitled to an age-related widow's pension calculated pursuant to point (b) of Article SSC.47(1) of this Protocol, and for this purpose ‘age related widow's pension’ means a widow's pension payable at a reduced rate in accordance with section 39(4) of the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992.\n2.\nFor the purposes of Article SSC.8 of this Protocol in the case of old-age or survivors' cash benefits, pensions for accidents at work or occupational diseases and death grants, any beneficiary under United Kingdom legislation who is staying in the territory of another State shall, during that stay, be considered as if they resided in the territory of that other State.\n3.\n(1)\nFor the purpose of calculating an earnings factor in order to determine entitlement to benefits under United Kingdom legislation, for each week of activity as an employed person under the legislation of a Member State, and which commenced during the relevant income tax year within the meaning of United Kingdom legislation, the person concerned shall be deemed to have paid contributions as an employed earner, or have earnings on which contributions have been paid, on the basis of earnings equivalent to two-thirds of that year's upper earnings limit.\n(2)\nFor the purposes of point (b) of Article SSC.47(1) of this Protocol, where:\n(a)\nin any income tax year starting on or after 6 April 1975, a person carrying out activity as an employed person has completed periods of insurance, employment or residence exclusively in a Member State, and the application of point (1) of this paragraph results in that year being counted as a qualifying year within the meaning of United Kingdom legislation for the purposes of point (b)(i) of Article SSC.47(1) of this Protocol, they shall be deemed to have been insured for 52 weeks in that year in that Member State;\n(b)\nany income tax year starting on or after 6 April 1975 does not count as a qualifying year within the meaning of United Kingdom legislation for the purposes of point (b)(i) of Article SSC.47(1) of this Protocol, any periods of insurance, employment or residence completed in that year shall be disregarded.\n(3)\nFor the purpose of converting an earnings factor into periods of insurance, the earnings factor achieved in the relevant income tax year within the meaning of United Kingdom legislation shall be divided by that year's lower earnings limit. The result shall be expressed as a whole number, any remaining fraction being ignored. The figure so calculated shall be treated as representing the number of weeks of insurance completed under United Kingdom legislation during that year, provided that such figure shall not exceed the number of weeks during which in that year the person was subject to that legislation.\nANNEX SSC-7\nIMPLEMENTING PART\nTITLE I\nGENERAL PROVISIONS\nCHAPTER 1\nArticle SSCI.1\nDefinitions\n1.\nFor the purposes of this Annex, the definitions set out in Article SSC.1 of this Protocol apply.\n2.\nIn addition to the definitions referred to in paragraph 1:\n(a)\n\"access point\" means an entity providing:\n(i)\nan electronic contact point;\n(ii)\nautomatic routing based on the address; and\n(iii)\nintelligent routing based on software that enables automatic checking and routing (for example, an artificial intelligence application) or human intervention;\n(b)\n\"liaison body\" means any body designated by the competent authority of a State for one or more of the branches of social security referred to in Article SSC.3 of this Protocol to respond to requests for information and assistance for the purposes of the application of this Protocol and of this Annex and which has to fulfil the tasks assigned to it under Title IV of this Annex;\n(c)\n\"document\" means a set of data, irrespective of the medium used, structured in such a way that it can be exchanged electronically and which must be communicated in order to enable the operation of this Protocol and this Annex;\n(d)\n\"Structured Electronic Document\" means any structured document in a format designed for the electronic exchange of information between States;\n(e)\n\"transmission by electronic means\" means the transmission of data using electronic equipment for the processing (including digital compression) of data and employing wires, radio transmission, optical technologies or any other electromagnetic means;\n(f)\n\"fraud\" means any deliberate act or deliberate omission to act, carried out with the intention to either:\n(i)\nreceive social security benefits, or enable another person to receive social security benefits, when the conditions of entitlement to such benefits under the law of the State(s) concerned or this Protocol are not met; or\n(ii)\navoid paying social security contributions, or enable another person to avoid paying social security contributions, when such contributions are required under the law of the State(s) concerned or this Protocol.\nCHAPTER 2\nPROVISIONS CONCERNING COOPERATION AND EXCHANGES OF DATA\nArticle SSCI.2\nScope and rules for exchanges between institutions\n1.\nFor the purposes of this Annex, exchanges between authorities of the States and institutions and persons covered by this Protocol shall be based on the principles of public service, efficiency, active assistance, rapid delivery and accessibility, including e-accessibility, in particular for the disabled and the elderly.\n2.\nThe institutions shall without delay provide or exchange all data necessary for establishing and determining the rights and obligations of persons to whom this Protocol applies. Such data shall be transferred between the States directly by the institutions themselves or indirectly via the liaison bodies.\n3.\nWhere a person has mistakenly submitted information, documents or claims to an institution in the territory of a State other than that in which the institution designated, in accordance with this Annex, is situated, the information, documents or claims shall be resubmitted without delay by the former institution to the institution designated in accordance with this Annex, indicating the date on which they were initially submitted. That date shall be binding on the latter institution. The institutions of the States shall not, however, be held liable, or be deemed to have taken a decision by virtue of their failure to act as a result of the late transmission of information, documents or claims by States' institutions.\n4.\nWhere data are transferred indirectly via the liaison body of the State of destination, time limits for responding to claims shall start from the date when that liaison body received the claim, as if it had been received by the institution in that State.\nArticle SSCI.3\nScope and rules for exchanges between the persons concerned and institutions\n1.\nThe States shall ensure that the necessary information is made available to the persons concerned in order to inform them of the provisions introduced by this Protocol and this Annex to enable them to assert their rights. They shall also provide for user-friendly services.\n2.\nPersons to whom this Protocol applies shall be required to forward to the relevant institution the information, documents or supporting evidence necessary to establish their situation or that of their families, to establish or maintain their rights and obligations and to determine the applicable legislation and their obligations under it.\n3.\nTo the extent necessary for the application of this Protocol and this Annex, the relevant institutions shall forward the information and issue the documents to the persons concerned without delay and in all cases within any time limits specified under the legislation of the State in question.\nThe relevant institution shall notify the claimant residing or staying in another State of its decision directly or through the liaison body of the State of residence or stay.

A copy of this decision shall be sent to other involved institutions.\nArticle SSCI.4\nForms, documents and methods of exchanging data\n1.\nSubject to Article SSCI.75 and Appendix SSCI-2, the structure, content and format of forms and documents issued on behalf of the States for the purposes of implementing this Protocol shall be agreed by the Specialised Committee on Social Security Coordination.\n2.\nThe transmission of data between the institutions or the liaison bodies may, subject to the approval of the Specialised Committee on Social Security Coordination, be carried out via the Electronic Exchange of Social Security Information. To the extent the forms and documents referred to in paragraph 1 are exchanged via the Electronic Exchange of Social Security Information, they shall respect the rules applicable to that system.\nWhere the transmission of data between institutions or the liaison bodies is not carried out via the Electronic Exchange of Social Security Information, the relevant institutions and liaison bodies shall use the arrangements appropriate to each case, and favour the use of electronic means as far as possible.\n3.\nIn their communications with the persons concerned, the relevant institutions shall use the arrangements appropriate to each case, and favour the use of electronic means as far as possible.\nArticle SSCI.5\nLegal value of documents and supporting evidence issued in another State\n1.\nDocuments issued by the institution of a State and showing the position of a person for the purposes of the application of this Protocol and this Annex, and supporting evidence on the basis of which the documents have been issued, shall be accepted by the institutions of the other States for as long as they have not been withdrawn or declared to be invalid by the State in which they were issued.\n2.\nWhere there is doubt about the validity of a document or the accuracy of the facts on which the particulars contained therein are based, the institution of the State that receives the document shall ask the issuing institution for the necessary clarification and, where appropriate, the withdrawal of that document. The issuing institution shall reconsider the grounds for issuing the document and, if necessary, withdraw it.\n3.\nPursuant to paragraph 2, where there is doubt about the information provided by the persons concerned, the validity of a document or supporting evidence or the accuracy of the facts on which the particulars contained therein are based, the institution of the place of stay or residence shall, insofar as this is possible, at the request of the competent institution, proceed to the necessary verification of this information or document.\n4.\nWhere no agreement is reached between the institutions concerned, the matter may be brought before the Specialised Committee on Social Security Coordination by the competent authorities no earlier than one month following the date on which the institution that received the document submitted its request. The Specialised Committee on Social Security Coordination shall endeavour to reconcile the points of view within six months of the date on which the matter was brought before it.\nArticle SSCI.6\nProvisional application of legislation and provisional granting of benefits\n1.\nUnless otherwise provided for in this Annex, where there is a difference of views between the institutions or authorities of two or more States concerning the determination of the applicable legislation, the person concerned shall be made provisionally subject to the legislation of one of those States, the order of priority being determined as follows:\n(a)\nthe legislation of the State where the person actually pursues their employment or self-employment, if the employment or self-employment is pursued in only one State;\n(b)\nthe legislation of the State of residence if the person concerned pursues employment or self-employment in two or more States and performs part of their activity or activities in the State of residence, or if the person concerned is neither employed nor self-employed;\n(c)\nin all other cases, the legislation of the State the application of which was first requested if the person pursues an activity, or activities, in two or more States.\n2.\nWhere there is a difference of views between the institutions or authorities of two or more States about which institution should provide the benefits in cash or in kind, the person concerned who could claim benefits if there was no dispute shall be entitled, on a provisional basis, to the benefits provided for by the legislation applied by the institution of that person's place of residence or, if that person does not reside on the territory of one of the States concerned, to the benefits provided for by the legislation applied by the institution to which the request was first submitted.\n3.\nWhere no agreement is reached between the institutions or authorities concerned, the matter may be brought before the Specialised Committee on Social Security Coordination by a Party no earlier than one month after the date on which the difference of views, as referred to in paragraph 1 or 2, arose. The Specialised Committee on Social Security Coordination shall seek to reconcile the points of view within six months of the date on which the matter was brought before it.\n4.\nWhere it is established either that the applicable legislation is not that of the State of provisional membership, or the institution which granted the benefits on a provisional basis was not the competent institution, the institution identified as being competent shall be deemed retroactively to have been so, as if that difference of views had not existed, at the latest from either the date of provisional membership or of the first provisional granting of the benefits concerned.\n5.\nIf necessary, the institution identified as being competent and the institution which provisionally paid the cash benefits or provisionally received contributions shall settle the financial situation of the person concerned as regards contributions and cash benefits paid provisionally, where appropriate, in accordance with Chapter 2 of Title IV of this Annex.\nBenefits in kind granted provisionally by an institution in accordance with paragraph 2 shall be reimbursed by the competent institution in accordance with Title IV of this Annex.\nArticle SSCI.7\nProvisional calculation of benefits and contributions\n1.\nUnless otherwise provided for in this Annex, where a person is eligible for a benefit, or is liable to pay a contribution in accordance with this Protocol, and the competent institution does not have all the information concerning the situation in another State which is necessary to calculate definitively the amount of that benefit or contribution, that institution shall, on request of the person concerned, award this benefit or calculate this contribution on a provisional basis, if such a calculation is possible on the basis of the information at the disposal of that institution.\n2.\nThe benefit or the contribution concerned shall be recalculated once all the necessary supporting evidence or documents are provided to the institution concerned.\nCHAPTER 3\nOTHER GENERAL PROVISIONS FOR THE APPLICATION OF THIS PROTOCOL\nArticle SSCI.8\nOther procedures between authorities and institutions\n1.\nTwo or more States, or their competent authorities, may agree procedures other than those provided for by this Annex, provided that such procedures do not adversely affect the rights or obligations of the persons concerned.\n2.\nAny agreements concluded to this end shall be notified to the Specialised Committee on Social Security Coordination and listed in Appendix SSCI-1.\n3.\nProvisions contained in implementing agreements concluded between two or more States with the same purpose as, or which are similar to, those referred to in paragraph 2, which are in force on the day preceding the entry into force of this Agreement, shall continue to apply, for the purposes of relations between those States, provided they are also included in Appendix SSCI-1 to this Protocol.\nArticle SSCI.9\nPrevention of overlapping of benefits\nNotwithstanding other provisions in this Protocol, when benefits due under the legislation of two or more States are mutually reduced, suspended or withdrawn, any amounts that would not be paid in the event of strict application of the rules concerning reduction, suspension or withdrawal laid down by the legislation of the State concerned shall be divided by the number of benefits subjected to reduction, suspension or withdrawal.\nArticle SSCI.10\nElements for determining residence\n1.\nWhere there is a difference of views between the institutions of two or more States about the determination of the residence of a person to whom this Protocol applies, these institutions shall establish by common agreement the centre of interests of the person concerned, based on an overall assessment of all available information relating to relevant facts, which may include, as appropriate:\n(a)\nthe duration and continuity of presence on the territory of the States concerned;\n(b)\nthat person's situation, including:\n(i)\nthe nature and the specific characteristics of any activity pursued, in particular the place where such activity is habitually pursued, the stability of the activity, and the duration of any work contract;\n(ii)\nthat person's family status and family ties;\n(iii)\nthe exercise of any non-remunerated activity;\n(iv)\nin the case of students, the source of that student's income;\n(v)\nthat person's housing situation, in particular how permanent it is;\n(vi)\nthe State in which that person is deemed to reside for taxation purposes.\n2.\nWhere the consideration of the various criteria based on relevant facts as set out in paragraph 1 does not lead to agreement between the institutions concerned, the person's intention, as it appears from such facts and circumstances, especially the reasons that led the person to move, shall be considered to be decisive for establishing that person's actual place of residence.\n3.\nThe centre of interests of a student who goes to another State to pursue a full-time course of study shall not be considered as being in the State of study for the entire duration of the course of study in that State, without prejudice to the possibility of rebutting this presumption.\n4.\nParagraph 3 applies mutatis mutandis to the family members of the student.\nArticle SSCI.11\nAggregation of periods\n1.\nFor the purposes of applying Article SSC.7, the competent institution shall contact the institutions of the States to whose legislation the person concerned has also been subject in order to determine all the periods completed under their legislation.\n2.\nThe respective periods of insurance, employment, self-employment or residence completed under the legislation of a State shall be added to those completed under the legislation of any other State, insofar as necessary for the purposes of applying Article SSC.7, provided that these periods do not overlap.\n3.\nWhere a period of insurance or residence which is completed in accordance with compulsory insurance under the legislation of a State coincides with a period of insurance completed on the basis of voluntary insurance or continued optional insurance under the legislation of another State, only the period completed on the basis of compulsory insurance shall be taken into account.\n4.\nWhere a period of insurance or residence other than an equivalent period completed under the legislation of a State coincides with an equivalent period on the basis of the legislation of another State, only the period other than an equivalent period shall be taken into account.\n5.\nAny period regarded as equivalent under the legislation of two or more States shall be taken into account only by the institution of the State to whose legislation the person concerned was last compulsorily subject before that period. In the event that the person concerned was not compulsorily subject to the legislation of a State before that period, the latter shall be taken into account by the institution of the State to whose legislation the person concerned was compulsorily subject for the first time after that period.\n6.\nIn the event that the time in which certain periods of insurance or residence were completed under the legislation of a State cannot be determined precisely, it shall be presumed that these periods do not overlap with periods of insurance or residence completed under the legislation of another State, and account shall be taken thereof, where advantageous to the person concerned, insofar as they can reasonably be taken into consideration.\nArticle SSCI.12\nRules for conversion of periods\n1.\nWhere periods completed under the legislation of a State are expressed in units different from those provided for by the legislation of another State, the conversion needed for the purpose of aggregation under Article SSC.7 shall be carried out under the following rules:\n(a)\nthe period to be used as the basis for the conversion shall be that communicated by the institution of the State under whose legislation the period was completed;\n(b)\nin the case of schemes where the periods are expressed in days the conversion from days to other units, and vice versa, as well as between different schemes based on days shall be calculated according to the following table:\nScheme based on\n1 day corresponds to\n1 week corresponds to\n1 month corresponds to\n1 quarter corresponds to\nMaximum of days in one calendar year\n5 days\n9 hours\n5 days\n22 days\n66 days\n264 days\n6 days\n8 hours\n6 days\n26 days\n78 days\n312 days\n7 days\n6 hours\n7 days\n30 days\n90 days\n360 days\n(c)\nin the case of schemes where the periods are expressed in units other than days,\n(i)\nthree months or 13 weeks shall be equivalent to one quarter, and vice versa;\n(ii)\none year shall be equivalent to four quarters, 12 months or 52 weeks, and vice versa;\n(iii)\nfor the conversion of weeks into months, and vice versa, weeks and months shall be converted into days in accordance with the conversion rules for the schemes based on six days in the table in point (b);\n(d)\nin the case of periods expressed in fractions, those figures shall be converted into the next smaller integer unit applying the rules laid down in points (b) and (c). Fractions of years shall be converted into months unless the scheme involved is based on quarters;\n(e)\nif the conversion under this paragraph results in a fraction of a unit, the next higher integer unit shall be taken as the result of the conversion under this paragraph.\n2.\nThe application of paragraph 1 shall not have the effect of producing, for the total sum of the periods completed during one calendar year, a total exceeding the number of days indicated in the last column in the table in point (b) of paragraph 1, 52 weeks, 12 months or four quarters.\nIf the periods to be converted correspond to the maximum annual amount of periods under the legislation of the State in which they have been completed, the application of paragraph 1 shall not result within one calendar year in periods that are shorter than the possible maximum annual amount of periods provided under the legislation concerned.\n3.\nThe conversion shall be carried out either in one single operation covering all those periods which were communicated as an aggregate, or for each year, if the periods were communicated on a year-by-year basis.\n4.\nWhere an institution communicates periods expressed in days, it shall at the same time indicate whether the scheme it administers is based on five days, six days or seven days.\nTITLE II\nDETERMINATION OF THE LEGISLATION APPLICABLE\nArticle SSCI.13\nDetails relating to Articles SSC.11 and SSC.12 of this Protocol\n1.\nFor the purposes of the application of point (a) of Article SSC.11(1), a \"person who pursues an activity as an employed person in a State for an employer which normally carries out its activities there and who is sent by that employer to another State\" shall include a person who is recruited with a view to being sent to another State, provided that, immediately before the start of that person's employment, the person concerned is already subject to the legislation of the State in which their employer is established.\n2.\nFor the purposes of the application of point (a) of Article SSC.11(1) of this Protocol, the words \"which normally carries out its activities there\" shall refer to an employer that ordinarily performs substantial activities, other than purely internal management activities, in the territory of the State in which it is established, taking account of all criteria characterising the activities carried out by the undertaking in question. The relevant criteria must be suited to the specific characteristics of each employer and the real nature of the activities carried out.\n3.\nFor the purposes of the application of point (b) of Article SSC.11(1) of this Protocol, the words \"who normally pursues an activity as a self-employed person\" shall refer to a person who habitually carries out substantial activities in the territory of the State in which that person is established. In particular, that person must have already pursued their activity for some time before the date when they wish to take advantage of the provisions of that Article and, during any period of temporary activity in another State, must continue to fulfil, in the State where they are established, the requirements for the pursuit of their activity in order to be able to pursue it on their return.\n4.\nFor the purposes of the application of point (b) of Article SSC.11(1) of this Protocol, the criterion for determining whether the activity that a self-employed person goes to pursue in another State is \"similar\" to the self-employed activity normally pursued shall be that of the actual nature of the activity, rather than of the designation of employed or self-employed activity that may be given to this activity by the other State.\n5.\nFor the purposes of the application of Article SSC.12(1) and (5) of this Protocol, a person who \"normally pursues an activity as an employed person\" in \"one or more Member States as well as in the United Kingdom\", or in \"two or more Member States\" respectively, shall refer to a person who simultaneously, or in alternation, for the same undertaking or employer or for various undertakings or employers, exercises one or more separate activities in such States.\n6.\nFor the purposes of Article SSC.12(1) and (5) of this Protocol, an employed flight crew or cabin crew member normally pursuing air passenger or freight services in two or more States shall be subject to the legislation of the State where the home base, as defined in Article SSC.1 of this Protocol, is located.\n7.\nMarginal activities shall be disregarded for the purposes of determining the applicable legislation under Article SSC.12 of this Protocol.

For these purposes, an overall assessment shall be made of all the relevant facts including, in particular, in the case of an employed person, the place of work as defined in the employment contract.\n10.\nFor the purposes of the application of Article SSC.12(1), (2), (5) and (6) of this Protocol, a \"substantial part of employed or self-employed activity\" pursued in a State shall mean a quantitatively substantial part of all the activities of the employed or self-employed person pursued there, without this necessarily being the major part of those activities.\n11.\nTo determine whether a substantial part of the activities is pursued in a State, the following indicative criteria shall be taken into account:\n(a)\nin the case of an employed activity, the working time or the remuneration; and\n(b)\nin the case of a self-employed activity, the turnover, working time, number of services rendered or income.\nIn the framework of an overall assessment, a share of less than 25 % in respect of the criteria mentioned above shall be an indicator that a substantial part of the activities is not being pursued in the relevant State.\n12.\nFor the purposes of the application of point (b) of Article SSC.12(2) of this Protocol, the \"centre of interest\" of the activities of a self-employed person shall be determined by taking account of all the aspects of that person's occupational activities, notably the place where the person's fixed and permanent place of business is located, the habitual nature or the duration of the activities pursued, the number of services rendered, and the intention of the person concerned as revealed by all the circumstances.\n13.\nFor the determination of the applicable legislation under paragraphs 10, 11 and 12, the institutions concerned shall take into account the situation projected for the following 12 calendar months.\n14.\nIf a person pursues his or her activity as an employed person in two or more States on behalf of an employer established outside the territory of the States, and if this person resides in a State without pursuing substantial activity there, they shall be subject to the legislation of the State of residence.\nArticle SSCI.14\nProcedures for the application of point (b) of Article SSC.10(3), Article SSC.10(4) and Article SSC.11 of this Protocol (on the provision of information to the institutions concerned)\n1.\nUnless otherwise provided for by Article SSCI.15 of this Annex, where a person pursues their activity outside the competent State, the employer or, in the case of a person who does not pursue an activity as an employed person, the person concerned shall inform the competent institution of the State whose legislation is applicable thereof, whenever possible in advance. That institution shall issue the attestation referred to in Article SSCI.16(2) of this Annex to the person concerned and shall without delay make information concerning the legislation applicable to that person, pursuant to point (b) of Article SSC.10(3) or Article SSC.11 of this Protocol, available to the institution designated by the competent authority of the State in which the activity is pursued.\n2.\nAn employer within the meaning of Article SSC.10(4) of this Protocol who has an employee on board a vessel flying the flag of another State shall inform the competent institution of the State whose legislation is applicable thereof whenever possible in advance.

That initial determination shall be provisional. The institution shall inform the designated institutions of each State in which an activity is pursued of its provisional determination.\n3.\nThe provisional determination of the applicable legislation, as provided for in paragraph 2, shall become definitive within two months of the institutions designated by the competent authorities of the State(s) concerned being informed of it, in accordance with paragraph 2, unless the legislation has already been definitively determined on the basis of paragraph 4, or at least one of the institutions concerned informs the institution designated by the competent authority of the State of residence by the end of this two-month period that it cannot yet accept the determination or that it takes a different view on this.\n4.\nWhere uncertainty about the determination of the applicable legislation requires contacts between the institutions or authorities of two or more States, at the request of one or more of the institutions designated by the competent authorities of the State(s) concerned, or of the competent authorities themselves, the legislation applicable to the person concerned shall be determined by common agreement, having regard to Article SSC.12 of this Protocol and the relevant provisions of Article SSCI.13 of this Annex.\nWhere there is a difference of views between the institutions or competent authorities concerned, those bodies shall seek agreement in accordance with the conditions set out above and Article SSCI.6 shall apply.\n5.\nThe competent institution of the State whose legislation is determined to be applicable either provisionally or definitively shall without delay inform the person concerned.\n6.\nIf the person concerned fails to provide the information referred to in paragraph 1, this Article shall be applied at the initiative of the institution designated by the competent authority of the State of residence as soon as it is appraised of that person's situation, possibly via another institution concerned.\nArticle SSCI.16\nProvision of information to persons concerned and employers\n1.\nThe competent institution of the State whose legislation becomes applicable pursuant to Title II of this Protocol shall inform the person concerned and, where appropriate, their employer(s) of the obligations laid down in that legislation.

The requesting institution shall substantiate its request and provide the relevant supporting documentation that gave rise to the request.\n2.\nWhen receiving such a request, the issuing institution shall reconsider the grounds for issuing the document and, where an error is detected, withdraw it or rectify it within 30 working days from the receipt of the request. The withdrawal or rectification shall have retroactive effect. However, in cases where there is a risk of disproportionate outcome, and in particular, of the loss of status as an insured person for the whole or part of the relevant period in the State(s) concerned, the States shall consider a more proportionate arrangement in such case. When the available evidence permits the issuing institution to find that the applicant of the document has committed fraud, it shall withdraw or rectify the document without delay and with retroactive effect.\nTITLE III\nSPECIAL PROVISIONS CONCERNING THE VARIOUS CATEGORIES OF BENEFITS\nCHAPTER 1\nSICKNESS, MATERNITY AND EQUIVALENT PATERNITY BENEFITS\nArticle SSCI.19\nGeneral implementing provisions\n1.\nThe competent authorities or institutions shall ensure that any necessary information is made available to insured persons regarding the procedures and conditions for the granting of benefits in kind where such benefits are received in the territory of a State other than that of the competent institution.\n2.\nNotwithstanding point (a) of Article SSC.6 of this Protocol, a State may become responsible for the cost of benefits in accordance with Article SSC.20 of this Protocol only if, either the insured person has made a claim for a pension under the legislation of that State, or in accordance with Articles SSC.21 to SSC.27 of this Protocol, they receive a pension under the legislation of that State.\nArticle SSCI.20\nRegime applicable in the event of the existence of more than one regime in the State of residence or stay\nIf the legislation of the State of residence or stay comprises more than one scheme of sickness, maternity and paternity insurance for more than one category of insured persons, the provisions applicable under Articles SSC.15, SSC.17(1), SSC.18, SSC.20, SSC.22 and SSC.24 of this Protocol shall be those of the legislation on the general scheme for employed persons.\nArticle SSCI.21\nResidence in a State other than the competent State\nProcedure and scope of right\n1.\nFor the purposes of the application of Article SSC.15 of this Protocol, the insured person or members of that person's family shall be obliged to register promptly with the institution of the place of residence.

The latter institution shall reimburse the advance payments made if, as a result of the appeal, it is obliged to provide those benefits. That amount will then be deducted from the benefits due to the person concerned, in accordance with the procedure provided for in Articles SSCI.56 and SSCI.57.\n3.\nThe second subparagraph of Article SSCI.6(5) applies mutatis mutandis.\nArticle SSCI.32\nAggravation of an occupational disease\nIn the cases covered by Article SSC.34 of this Protocol, the claimant must provide the institution in the State from which they are claiming entitlement to benefits with details concerning benefits previously granted for the occupational disease in question. That institution may contact any other previously competent institution in order to obtain the information it considers necessary.\nArticle SSCI.33\nAssessment of the degree of incapacity in the event of occupational accidents or diseases which occurred previously or subsequently\nWhere a previous or subsequent incapacity for work was caused by an accident which occurred when the person concerned was subject to the legislation of a State which makes no distinction according to the origin of the incapacity to work, the competent institution or the body designated by the competent authority of the State in question shall:\n(a)\nupon request by the competent institution of another State, provide information concerning the degree of the previous or subsequent incapacity for work, and where possible, information making it possible to determine whether the incapacity is the result of an accident at work within the meaning of the legislation applied by the institution in the other State;\n(b)\ntake into account the degree of incapacity caused by these previous or subsequent cases when determining the right to benefits and the amount, in accordance with the applicable legislation.\nArticle SSCI.34\nSubmission and investigation of claims for pensions or supplementary allowances\nIn order to receive a pension or supplementary allowance under the legislation of a State, the person concerned or their survivors residing in the territory of another State shall submit, where appropriate, a claim either to the competent institution or to the institution of the place of residence, which shall send it to the competent institution.\nThe claim shall contain the information required under the legislation applied by the competent institution.\nCHAPTER 3\nDEATH GRANTS\nArticle SSCI.35\nClaim for death grants\nFor the purposes of Articles SSC.37 and SSC.38 of this Protocol, the claim for death grants shall be sent either to the competent institution or to the institution of the claimant's place of residence, which shall send it to the competent institution.\nThe claim shall contain the information required under the legislation applied by the competent institution.\nCHAPTER 4\nINVALIDITY BENEFITS AND OLD-AGE AND SURVIVORS' PENSIONS\nArticle SSCI.36\nAdditional provisions for the calculation of the benefit\n1.\nFor the purposes of calculating the theoretical amount and the actual amount of the benefit in accordance with point (b) of Article SSC.47(1) of this Protocol, the rules provided for in Article SSCI.11(3), (4), (5) and (6) of this Annex apply.\n2.\nWhere periods of voluntary or optional continued insurance have not been taken into account under Article SSCI.11(3) of this Annex, the institution of the State under whose legislation those periods were completed shall calculate the amount corresponding to those periods under the legislation it applies. The actual amount of the benefit, calculated in accordance with point (b) of Article SSC.47(1) of this Protocol, shall be increased by the amount corresponding to periods of voluntary or optional continued insurance.\n3.\nThe institution of each State shall calculate, under the legislation it applies, the amount due corresponding to periods of voluntary or optional continued insurance which, under point (c) of Article SSC.48(3) of this Protocol, shall not be subject to the another State's rules relating to withdrawal, reduction or suspension.\nWhere the legislation applied by the competent institution does not allow it to determine this amount directly, on the grounds that that legislation allocates different values to insurance periods, a notional amount may be established. The Specialised Committee on Social Security Coordination shall lay down the detailed arrangements for the determination of that notional amount.\nArticle SSCI.37\nClaims for benefits\nSubmission of claims for old-age and survivors' pensions\n1.\nThe claimant shall submit a claim to the institution of his place of residence or to the institution of the last State whose legislation was applicable. If the person concerned was not, at any time, subject to the legislation applied by the institution of the place of residence, that institution shall forward the claim to the institution of the last State whose legislation was applicable.\n2.\nThe date of submission of the claim shall apply in all the institutions concerned.\n3.\nBy way of derogation from paragraph 2, if the claimant does not, despite having been asked to do so, notify the fact that he or she has been employed or has resided in other States, the date on which the claimant completes his or her initial claim or submits a new claim for his or her missing periods of employment or/and residence in a State shall be considered as the date of submission of the claim to the institution applying the legislation in question, subject to more favourable provisions of that legislation.\nArticle SSCI.38\nCertificates and information to be submitted with the claim by the claimant\n1.\nThe claim shall be submitted by the claimant in accordance with the provisions of the legislation applied by the institution referred to in Article SSCI.37(1) and be accompanied by the supporting documents required by that legislation. In particular, the claimant shall supply all available relevant information and supporting documents relating to periods of insurance (institutions, identification numbers), employment (employers) or self-employment (nature and place of activity) and residence (addresses) which may have been completed under other legislation, as well as the length of those periods.\n2.\nWhere, in accordance with Article SSC.45(1) of this Protocol, the claimant requests deferment of the award of old-age benefits under the legislation of one or more States, the claimant shall state that in their claim and specify under which legislation the deferment is requested. In order to enable the claimant to exercise that right, the institutions concerned shall, upon the request of the claimant, notify them of all the information available to them so that he or she can assess the consequences of concurrent or successive awards of benefits which they might claim.\n3.\nShould the claimant withdraw a claim for benefits provided for under the legislation of a particular State, that withdrawal shall not be considered as a concurrent withdrawal of claims for benefits under the legislation of another State.\nArticle SSCI.39\nInvestigation of claims by the institutions concerned\nContact institution\n1.\nThe institution to which the claim for benefits is submitted or forwarded in accordance with Article SSCI.37(1) shall be referred to hereinafter as the \"contact institution\". The institution of the place of residence shall not be referred to as the contact institution if the person concerned has not, at any time, been subject to the legislation which that institution applies.\nIn addition to investigating the claim for benefits under the legislation which it applies, that institution shall, in its capacity as contact institution, promote the exchange of data, the communication of decisions and the operations necessary for the investigation of the claim by the institutions concerned, and supply the claimant, upon request, with any information relevant to the aspects of the investigation which arise under this Protocol, and keep the claimant informed of its progress.\nInvestigation of claims for old-age and survivors pensions\n2.\nThe contact institution shall, without delay, send claims for benefits and all the documents which it has available and, where appropriate, the relevant documents supplied by the claimant to all the institutions in question so that they can all start the investigation of the claim concurrently. The contact institution shall notify the other institutions of periods of insurance or residence subject to its legislation. It shall also indicate which documents shall be submitted at a later date and supplement the claim as soon as possible.\n3.\nEach of the institutions in question shall notify the contact institution and the other institutions in question, as soon as possible, of the periods of insurance or residence subject to their legislation.\n4.\nEach of the institutions in question shall calculate the amount of benefits in accordance with Article SSC.47 of this Protocol and shall notify the contact institution and the other institutions concerned of its decision, of the amount of benefits due and of any information required for the purposes of Articles SSC.48 to SSC.50 of this Protocol.\n5.\nShould an institution establish, on the basis of the information referred to in paragraphs 2 and 3 of this Article, that Article SSC.52(2) or (3) of this Protocol is applicable, it shall inform the contact institution and the other institutions concerned.\nArticle SSCI.40\nNotification of decisions to the claimant\n1.\nEach institution shall notify the claimant of the decision it has taken in accordance with the applicable legislation. Each decision shall specify the remedies and periods allowed for appeals. Once the contact institution has been notified of all decisions taken by each institution, it shall send the claimant and the other institutions concerned a summary of those decisions. A model summary shall be drawn up by the Specialised Committee on Social Security Coordination. The summary shall be sent to the claimant in the language of the institution or, at the request of the claimant, in any language of their choice, including English, recognised as an official language of the Union.\n2.\nWhere it appears to the claimant following receipt of the summary that his or her rights may have been adversely affected by the interaction of decisions taken by two or more institutions, the claimant shall have the right to a review of the decisions by the institutions concerned within the time limits laid down in the respective national legislation. The time limits shall commence on the date of receipt of the summary. The claimant shall be notified of the result of the review in writing.\nArticle SSCI.41\nDetermination of the degree of invalidity\nEach institution shall, in accordance with its legislation, have the possibility of having the claimant examined by a medical doctor or other expert of its choice to determine the degree of invalidity. However, the institution of a State shall take into consideration documents, medical reports and administrative information collected by the institution of any other State as if they had been drawn up in its own territory.\nArticle SSCI.42\nProvisional instalments and advance payment of a benefit\n1.\nNotwithstanding Article SSCI.7 of this Annex, any institution which establishes, while investigating a claim for benefits, that the claimant is entitled to an independent benefit under the applicable legislation, in accordance with point (a) of Article SSC.47(1) of this Protocol, shall pay that benefit without delay. That payment shall be considered provisional if the amount might be affected by the result of the claim investigation procedure.\n2.\nWhenever it is evident from the information available that the claimant is entitled to a payment from an institution under point (b) of Article SSC.47(1) of this Protocol, that institution shall make an advance payment, the amount of which shall be as close as possible to the amount which will probably be paid under point (b) of Article SSC.47(1) of this Protocol.\n3.\nEach institution which is obliged to pay the provisional benefits or advance payment under paragraph 1 or 2 shall inform the claimant without delay, specifically drawing the claimant's attention to the provisional nature of the measure and any rights of appeal in accordance with its legislation.\nArticle SSCI.43\nNew calculation of benefits\n1.\nWhere there is a new calculation of benefits in accordance with Articles SSC.45(4) and SSC.54(1) of this Protocol, Article SSCI.42 of this Annex shall be applicable mutatis mutandis.\n2.\nWhere there is a new calculation, withdrawal or suspension of the benefit, the institution which took the decision shall inform the person concerned without delay and shall inform each of the institutions in respect of which the person concerned has an entitlement.\nArticle SSCI.44\nMeasures intended to accelerate the pension calculation process\n1.\nIn order to facilitate and accelerate the investigation of claims and the payment of benefits, the institutions to whose legislation a person has been subject shall:\n(a)\nexchange with or make available to institutions of other States the elements for identifying persons who change from one applicable national legislation to another, and together ensure that those identification elements are retained and correspond, or, failing that, provide those persons with the means to access their identification elements directly;\n(b)\nsufficiently in advance of the minimum age for commencing pension rights or before an age to be determined by national legislation, exchange with or make available to the person concerned and to institutions of other States information (periods completed or other important elements) on the pension entitlements of persons who have changed from one applicable legislation to another or, failing that, inform those persons of, or provide them with, the means of familiarising themselves with their prospective benefit entitlement.\n2.\nFor the purposes of paragraph 1, the Specialised Committee on Social Security Coordination shall determine the elements of information to be exchanged or made available and shall establish the appropriate procedures and mechanisms, taking account of the characteristics, administrative and technical organisation, and the technological means at the disposal of national pension schemes. The Specialised Committee on Social Security Coordination shall ensure the implementation of those pension schemes by organising a follow-up to the measures taken and their application.\n3.\nFor the purposes of paragraph 1, the institution in the first State where a person is allocated a Personal Identification Number (PIN) for the purposes of social security administration should be provided with the information referred to in this Article.\nArticle SSCI.45\nCoordination measures in the States\n1.\nWithout prejudice to Article SSC.46 of this Protocol, where national legislation includes rules for determining the institution responsible or the scheme applicable or for designating periods of insurance to a specific scheme, those rules shall be applied, taking into account only periods of insurance completed under the legislation of the State concerned.\n2.\nWhere national legislation includes rules for the coordination of special schemes for civil servants and the general scheme for employed persons, those rules shall not be affected by the provisions of this Protocol and of this Annex.\nCHAPTER 5\nUNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS\nArticle SSCI.46\nAggregation of periods and calculation of benefits\n1.\nArticle SSCI.11(1) of this Annex applies mutatis mutandis to Article SSC.56 of this Protocol. Without prejudice to the underlying obligations of the institutions involved, the person concerned may submit to the competent institution a document issued by the institution of the State to whose legislation they were subject in respect of that person's last activity as an employed or self-employed person specifying the periods completed under that legislation.\n2.\nFor the purpose of applying Article SSC.57 of this Protocol, the competent institution of a State whose legislation provides that the calculation of benefits varies with the number of members of the family shall also take into account the members of the family of the person concerned residing in another State as if they resided in the competent State. This provision shall not apply where, in the State of residence of members of the family, another person is entitled to unemployment benefits calculated on the basis of the number of members of the family.\nTITLE IV\nFINANCIAL PROVISIONS\nCHAPTER 1\nREIMBURSEMENT OF THE COST OF BENEFITS IN APPLICATION OF ARTICLE SSC.30 AND ARTICLE SSC.36 OF THIS PROTOCOL\nSECTION 1\nREIMBURSEMENT ON THE BASIS OF ACTUAL EXPENDITURE\nArticle SSCI.47\nPrinciples\n1.\nFor the purpose of applying Article SSC.30 and Article SSC.36 of this Protocol, the actual amount of the expenses for benefits in kind, as shown in the accounts of the institution that provided them, shall be reimbursed to that institution by the competent institution, except where Article SSCI.57 of this Annex is applicable.\n2.\nIf any or part of the actual amount of the expenses for benefits referred to in paragraph 1 is not shown in the accounts of the institution that provided them, the amount to be refunded shall be determined on the basis of a lump-sum payment calculated from all the appropriate references obtained from the data available. The Specialised Committee on Social Security Coordination shall assess the bases to be used for calculation of the lump-sum payment and shall decide the amount thereof.\n3.\nHigher rates than those applicable to the benefits in kind provided to insured persons subject to the legislation applied by the institution providing the benefits referred to in paragraph 1 may not be taken into account in the reimbursement.\nSECTION 2\nREIMBURSEMENT ON THE BASIS OF FIXED AMOUNTS\nArticle SSCI.48\nIdentification of the State(s) concerned\n1.\nThe States referred to in Article SSC.30(2) of this Protocol, whose legal or administrative structures are such that the use of reimbursement on the basis of actual expenditure is not appropriate, are listed in Appendix SSCI-3 to this Annex.\n2.\nIn the case of the States listed in Appendix SSCI-3, the amount of benefits in kind supplied to:\n(a)\nfamily members who do not reside in the same State as the insured person, as provided for in Article SSC.15 of this Protocol; and to\n(b)\npensioners and members of their family, as provided for in Article SSC.22(1), Articles SSC.23 and SSC.24 of this Protocol;\nshall be reimbursed by the competent institutions to the institutions providing those benefits, on the basis of a fixed amount established for each calendar year. This fixed amount shall be as close as possible to actual expenditure.\nArticle SSCI.49\nCalculation method of the monthly fixed amounts and the total fixed amount\n1.\nFor each creditor State, the monthly fixed amount per person (Fi) for a calendar year shall be determined by dividing the annual average cost per person (Yi), broken down by age group (i), by 12 and by applying a reduction (X) to the result in accordance with the following formula:\nFi = Yi*1/12*(1-X)\nWhere:\n—\nthe index (i = 1, 2 and 3) represents the three age groups used for calculating the fixed amounts:\n—\ni = 1: persons aged under 20,\n—\ni = 2: persons aged from 20 to 64,\n—\ni = 3: persons aged 65 and over,\n—\nYi represents the annual average cost per person in age group i, as defined in paragraph 2,\n—\nthe coefficient X (0.20 or 0.15) represents the reduction as defined in paragraph 3.\n2.\nThe annual average cost per person (Yi) in age group i shall be obtained by dividing the annual expenditure on all benefits in kind provided by the institutions of the creditor State to all persons in the age group concerned subject to its legislation and residing within its territory by the average number of persons concerned in that age group in the calendar year in question. The calculation shall be based on the expenditure under the schemes referred to in Article SSCI.20.\n3.\nThe reduction to be applied to the monthly fixed amount shall, in principle, be equal to 20 % (X = 0.20). It shall be equal to 15 % (X = 0.15) for pensioners and members of their family where the competent State is not listed in Annex SSC-3 to this Protocol.\n4.\nFor each debtor State, the total fixed amount for a calendar year shall be the sum of the products obtained by multiplying, in each age group i, the determined monthly fixed amounts per person by the number of months completed by the persons concerned in the creditor State in that age group.\nThe number of months completed by the persons concerned in the creditor State shall be the sum of the calendar months in a calendar year during which the persons concerned were, because of their residence in the territory of the creditor State, eligible to receive benefits in kind in that territory at the expense of the debtor State. Those months shall be determined from an inventory kept for that purpose by the institution of the place of residence, based on documentary evidence of the entitlement of the beneficiaries supplied by the competent institution.\n5.\nThe Specialised Committee on Social Security Coordination may present a proposal containing any amendments which may prove necessary in order to ensure that the calculation of fixed amounts comes as close as possible to the actual expenditure incurred and the reductions referred to in paragraph 3 do not result in unbalanced payments or double payments for the States.\n6.\nThe Specialised Committee on Social Security Coordination shall establish the methods for determining the elements for calculating the fixed amounts referred to in this Article.\nArticle SSCI.50\nNotification of annual average costs\nThe annual average cost per person in each age group for a specific year shall be notified to the Specialised Committee on Social Security Coordination at the latest by the end of the second year following the year in question. If the notification is not made by this deadline, the annual average cost per person which the Specialised Committee on Social Security Coordination has last determined for a previous year will be taken.\nSECTION 3\nCOMMON PROVISIONS\nArticle SSCI.51\nProcedure for reimbursement between institutions\n1.\nReimbursements between the States shall be made as promptly as possible. Every institution concerned shall be obliged to reimburse claims before the deadlines mentioned in this Section, as soon as it is in a position to do so. A dispute concerning a particular claim shall not hinder the reimbursement of another claim or other claims.\n2.\nThe reimbursements between the institutions of the Member States and the United Kingdom, provided for in Articles SSC.30 and SSC.36 of this Protocol, shall be made via the liaison body. There may be a separate liaison body for reimbursements under Article SSC.30 and Article SSC.36 of this Protocol.\nArticle SSCI.52\nDeadlines for the introduction and settlement of claims\n1.\nClaims based on actual expenditure shall be introduced to the liaison body of the debtor State within 12 months of the end of the calendar half-year during which those claims were recorded in the accounts of the creditor institution.\n2.\nClaims for fixed amounts for a calendar year shall be introduced to the liaison body of the debtor State within the 12-month period following the month during which the average costs for the year concerned were approved by the Specialised Committee on Social Security Coordination. The inventories referred to Article SSCI.49(4) shall be presented by the end of the year following the reference year.\n3.\nIn the case referred to in the second subparagraph of Article SSCI.7(5), the deadline set out in paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Article shall not start before the competent institution has been identified.\n4.\nClaims introduced after the deadlines specified in paragraphs 1 and 2 shall not be considered.\n5.\nThe claims shall be paid to the liaison body of the creditor State referred to in Article SSCI.51, by the debtor institution within 18 months of the end of the month during which they were introduced to the liaison body of the debtor State. This does not apply to the claims which the debtor institution has rejected for a relevant reason within that period.\n6.\nAny disputes concerning a claim shall be settled, at the latest, within 36 months following the month in which the claim was introduced.\n7.\nThe Specialised Committee on Social Security Coordination shall facilitate the final closing of accounts in cases where a settlement cannot be reached within the period set out in paragraph 6, and, upon a reasoned request by one of the parties in the dispute, shall give its opinion on a dispute within six months following the month in which the matter was referred to it.\nArticle SSCI.53\nInterest on late payments and down payments\n1.\nFrom the end of the 18-month period set out in Article SSCI.52(5), interest can be charged by the creditor institution on outstanding claims, unless the debtor institution has made, within six months of the end of the month during which the claim was introduced, a down payment of at least 90 % of the total claim introduced pursuant to Article SSCI.52(1) or (2). For those parts of the claim not covered by the down payment, interest may be charged only from the end of the 36-month period set out in Article SSCI.52(6).\n2.\nThe interest shall be calculated on the basis of the reference rate applied by the financial institution designated for this purpose by the Specialised Committee on Social Security Coordination to its main refinancing operations. The reference rate applicable shall be that in force on the first day of the month on which the payment is due.\n3.\nNo liaison body shall be obliged to accept a down payment as provided for in paragraph 1. If however, a liaison body declines such an offer, the creditor institution shall no longer be entitled to charge interest on late payments related to the claims in question other than under the second sentence of paragraph 1.\nArticle SSCI.54\nStatement of Annual Accounts\n1.\nThe Partnership Council shall establish the claims situation for each calendar year on the basis of the report of the Specialised Committee on Social Security Coordination. To this end, the liaison bodies shall notify the Specialised Committee on Social Security Coordination, by the deadlines and according to the procedures laid down by the latter, of the amount of the claims introduced, settled or contested (creditor position) and the amount of claims received, settled or contested (debtor position).\n2.\nThe Partnership Council may perform any appropriate checks on the statistical and accounting data used as the basis for drawing up the annual statement of claims provided for in paragraph 1 in order, in particular, to ensure that they comply with the rules laid down under this Title.\nCHAPTER 2\nRECOVERY OF BENEFITS PROVIDED BUT NOT DUE, RECOVERY OF PROVISIONAL PAYMENTS AND CONTRIBUTIONS, OFFSETTING AND ASSISTANCE WITH RECOVERY\nSECTION 1\nPRINCIPLES\nArticle SSCI.55\nCommon provisions\nFor the purposes of applying Article SSC.64 of this Protocol and within the framework defined therein, the recovery of claims shall, wherever possible, be by way of offsetting either between the institutions of the Member State concerned and of the United Kingdom, or vis-à-vis the natural or legal person concerned in accordance with Articles SSCI.56 to SSCI.58 of this Annex. If it is not possible to recover all or any of the claim via this offsetting procedure, the remainder of the amount due shall be recovered in accordance with Articles SSCI.59 to SSCI.69 of this Annex.\nSECTION 2\nOFFSETTING\nArticle SSCI.56\nBenefits received unduly\n1.\nIf the institution of a State has paid undue benefits to a person, that institution may, within the terms and limits laid down in the legislation it applies, request the institution of the State responsible for paying benefits to the person concerned to deduct the undue amount from arrears or on-going payments owed to the person concerned regardless of the social security branch under which the benefit is paid. The institution of the latter State shall deduct the amount concerned subject to the conditions and limits applying to this kind of offsetting procedure in accordance with the legislation it applies in the same way as if it had made the overpayments itself, and shall transfer the amount deducted to the institution that has paid undue benefits.\n2.\nBy way of derogation from paragraph 1, if, when awarding or reviewing benefits in respect of invalidity benefits, old-age and survivors' pensions pursuant to Chapters 3 and 4 of Title III of this Protocol, the institution of a State has paid to a person benefits of undue sum, that institution may request the institution of the State responsible for the payment of corresponding benefits to the person concerned to deduct the amount overpaid from the arrears payable to the person concerned. After the latter institution has informed the institution that has paid an undue sum of these arrears, the institution which has paid the undue sum shall within two months communicate the amount of the undue sum. If the institution which is due to pay arrears receives that communication within the deadline it shall transfer the amount deducted to the institution which has paid undue sums. If the deadline expires, that institution shall without delay pay out the arrears to the person concerned.\n3.\nIf a person has received social welfare assistance in one State during a period in which they were entitled to benefits under the legislation of another State, the body which provided the assistance may, if it is legally entitled to reclaim the benefits due to the person concerned, request the institution of any other State responsible for paying benefits in favour of the person concerned to deduct the amount of assistance paid from the amounts which that State pays to the person concerned.\nThis provision applies mutatis mutandis to any family member of a person concerned who has received assistance in the territory of a State during a period in which the insured person was entitled to benefits under the legislation of another State in respect of that family member.\nThe institution of a State which has paid an undue amount of assistance shall send a statement of the amount due to the institution of the other State, which shall then deduct the amount, subject to the conditions and limits laid down for this kind of offsetting procedure in accordance with the legislation it applies, and transfer the amount without delay to the institution that has paid the undue amount.\nArticle SSCI.57\nProvisionally paid benefits in cash or contributions\n1.\nFor the purposes of applying Article SSCI.6, at the latest three months after the applicable legislation has been determined or the institution responsible for paying the benefits has been identified, the institution which provisionally paid the cash benefits shall draw up a statement of the amount provisionally paid and shall send it to the institution identified as being competent.\nThe institution identified as being competent for paying the benefits shall deduct the amount due in respect of the provisional payment from the arrears of the corresponding benefits it owes to the person concerned and shall without delay transfer the amount deducted to the institution which provisionally paid the cash benefits.\nIf the amount of provisionally paid benefits exceeds the amount of arrears, or if arrears do not exist, the institution identified as being competent shall deduct this amount from ongoing payments subject to the conditions and limits applying to this kind of offsetting procedure under the legislation it applies, and without delay transfer the amount deducted to the institution which provisionally paid the cash benefits.\n2.\nThe institution which has provisionally received contributions from a legal or natural person shall not reimburse the amounts in question to the person who paid them until it has ascertained from the institution identified as being competent the sums due to it under Article SSCI.6(4).\nUpon request of the institution identified as being competent, which shall be made at the latest three months after the applicable legislation has been determined, the institution that has provisionally received contributions shall transfer them to the institution identified as being competent for that period for the purpose of settling the situation concerning the contributions owed by the legal or natural person to it. The contributions transferred shall be retroactively deemed as having been paid to the institution identified as being competent.\nIf the amount of provisionally paid contributions exceeds the amount the legal or natural person owes to the institution identified as being competent, the institution which provisionally received contributions shall reimburse the amount in excess to the legal or natural person concerned.\nArticle SSCI.58\nCosts related to offsetting\nNo costs are payable where the debt is recovered via the offsetting procedure provided for in Articles SSCI.56 and SSCI.57.\nSECTION 3\nRECOVERY\nArticle SSCI.59\nDefinitions and common provisions\n1.\nFor the purposes of this Section:\n(a)\n\"claim\" means all claims relating to contributions or to benefits paid or provided unduly, including interest, fines, administrative penalties and all other charges and costs connected with the claim in accordance with the legislation of the State making the claim;\n(b)\n\"applicant party\" means, in respect of each State, any institution which makes a request for information, notification or recovery concerning a claim as defined above;\n(c)\n\"requested party\" means, in respect of each State, any institution to which a request for information, notification or recovery can be made.\n2.\nRequests and any related communications between the States shall, in general, be addressed via designated institutions.\n3.\nPractical implementation measures, including, among others, those related to Article SSCI.4 and to setting a minimum threshold for the amounts for which a request for recovery can be made, shall be taken by the Specialised Committee on Social Security Coordination.\nArticle SSCI.60\nRequests for information\n1.\nAt the request of the applicant party, the requested party shall provide any information which would be useful to the applicant party in the recovery of its claim.\n2.\nIn order to obtain that information, the requested party shall make use of the powers provided for under the laws, regulations or administrative practices applying to the recovery of similar claims arising in its own State.

However, if the claim or instrument is contested, the time limit begins from the moment that the State of the applicant party establishes that the claim or the enforcement order permitting recovery may no longer be contested.\n2.\nThe requested party shall inform the applicant party of the grounds for refusing a request for assistance.\nArticle SSCI.67\nPeriods of limitation\n1.\nQuestions concerning periods of limitation shall be governed as follows:\n(a)\nby the laws in force in the State of the applicant party, insofar as they concern the claim or the instrument permitting its enforcement; and\n(b)\nby the laws in force in the State of the requested party, insofar as they concern enforcement measures in the requested State.\nPeriods of limitation according to the laws in force in the State of the requested party shall start from the date of direct recognition or from the date of acceptance, recognition, supplementing or replacement in accordance with Article SSCI.63.\n2.\nSteps taken in the recovery of claims by the requested party in pursuance of a request for assistance, which, if they had been carried out by the applicant party, would have had the effect of suspending or interrupting the period of limitation according to the laws in force in the State of the applicant party, shall be deemed to have been taken in the latter, insofar as that effect is concerned.\nArticle SSCI.68\nPrecautionary measures\nUpon reasoned request by the applicant party, the requested party shall take precautionary measures to ensure recovery of a claim insofar as the laws and regulations in force in the State of the requested party so permit.\nFor the purposes of implementing the first paragraph, the provisions and procedures laid down in Articles SSCI.62, SSCI.63, SSCI.65 and SSCI.66 apply mutatis mutandis.\nArticle SSCI.69\nCosts related to recovery\n1.\nThe requested party shall recover from the natural or legal person concerned and retain any costs linked to recovery which it incurs, in accordance with the laws and regulations of the State of the requested party that apply to similar claims.\n2.\nMutual assistance afforded under this Section shall, as a rule, be free of charge. However, where recovery poses a specific problem or concerns a very large amount in costs, the applicant and the requested parties may agree on reimbursement arrangements specific to the cases in question.\nThe State of the applicant party shall remain liable to the State of the requested party for any costs and any losses incurred as a result of actions held to be unfounded, as far as either the substance of the claim or the validity of the instrument issued by the applicant party is concerned.\nTITLE V\nMISCELLANEOUS, TRANSITIONAL AND FINAL PROVISIONS\nArticle SSCI.70\nMedical examination and administrative checks\n1.\nWithout prejudice to other provisions, where a recipient or a claimant of benefits, or a member of that person's family, is staying or residing within the territory of a State other than that in which the debtor institution is located, the medical examination shall be carried out, at the request of that institution, by the institution of the beneficiary's place of stay or residence in accordance with the procedures laid down by the legislation applied by that institution.\nThe debtor institution shall inform the institution of the place of stay or residence of any special requirements, if necessary, to be followed and points to be covered by the medical examination.\n2.\nThe institution of the place of stay or residence shall forward a report to the debtor institution that requested the medical examination.

Ireland concerning security procedures for exchanging and protecting classified information\nNotice concerning the entry into force of the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement and of the Agreement concerning security procedures for exchanging and protecting classified information\nWHAT IS THE AIM OF THE DECISIONS, THE AGREEMENTS AND THE DECLARATIONS?\nThe decisions cover the signing and application of the free trade agreement between the United Kingdom and the EU and the EU Member States.\nThe agreement is designed to go further than a traditional free trade agreement and provide a solid basis to preserve friendship and cooperation in the future. It reflects the fact that the UK is leaving the EU’s system of common rules, supervision and enforcement mechanisms, and will no longer enjoy the benefits of the EU’s single market.\nThe declarations set out political decisions agreed between the 2 parties on a number of specific issues and policy areas.\nKEY POINTS\n              \nThe agreement is divided into 7 parts followed by 3 protocols and more than 600 pages of annexes.\nPart 1: Common and institutional rules\nThis part lays out the aims of the agreement, rules for supplementary agreements between the parties and sets out the institutional structure, including the Partnership Council committees and working groups designed to ensure the proper functioning of the agreement.\nPart 2: Trade, transport, fisheries and other arrangements\nThis part is subdivided into several headings:\n1.Trade — this heading covers a number of areas including:\ntrade in goods — including an agreement for zero tariffs or quotas on goods traded, mutual recognition of trusted traders programmes, and rules of origin;\nservices and investments — includes an agreement for equal treatment for EU service suppliers and investors in the UK and vice versa;\ndigital trade — includes the removal of unjustified barriers to digital trade, including prohibition of data localisation requirements, while respecting data protection rules;\nenergy — includes guarantees on security of energy supply, offshore energy cooperation in the North Sea, enforceable commitments towards the Paris Agreement and non-regression on climate change and carbon pricing;\na level playing field for open and fair competition and sustainable development.\n2.

Fisheries — the agreement includes:\nnew arrangements ensure sustainable management of shared fish stocks in EU and UK waters, respecting both parties’ rights and obligations as independent coastal states;\na transition period of five and a half years during which reciprocal access rights to fish in each other’s waters remain unchanged, with a gradual transfer of EU quotas to the UK.\nPart 3: Law enforcement and judicial cooperation in criminal matters\nThe agreement ensures that the parties will work together in a number of ways including:\ncontinued cooperation between UK, Europol and Eurojust;\narrangements for close cooperation between national police and judicial authorities of the UK and EU Member States, including on surrender;\nmechanisms for swift exchanges of Passenger Name Record (PNR) data, of DNA, fingerprints and vehicle registration data (Prüm), and of criminal record information;\ncooperation on money-laundering and terrorist financing.\nPart 4: Thematic cooperation\nThe agreement ensures cooperation on certain other issues including:\ncross-border health security threats;\nsharing classified information and best practice in the field of cyber security, including the opportunity for the UK to take part in the EU Agency for Cyber Security (ENISA).\nPart 5: Participation in EU programmes, sound financial management and financial provisions\nThe UK will take part in 5 EU programmes open to non-EU country participation (subject to its financial contribution):\nHorizon Europe (research and innovation);\nEuratom Research and Training programme;\nITER (fusion test facility);\nCopernicus (Earth monitoring system);\nAccess to EU satellite surveillance & tracking (SST) services.\nPart 6: Dispute settlement and horizontal rules\nIf a solution to a disagreement cannot be found between the parties, an independent arbitration tribunal can be set up to settle the matter through a binding ruling. This dispute settlement mechanism covers most areas of the agreement, including the level playing field and fisheries.\nThe mechanism is accompanied by enforcement and safeguard mechanisms including the possibility to suspend market access commitments, e.g. by reintroducing tariffs and/or quotas in the affected area.\nBoth parties will also be able to cross-retaliate* if the other does not comply with a ruling of an independent arbitration tribunal.\nAny substantial breach of obligations deemed ‘essential elements’ (fighting climate change, respecting democratic values and fundamental rights, or non-proliferation) can trigger the suspension or termination of all or part of the entire agreement.\nPart 7: Final provisions\nThe agreement does not apply to Gibraltar nor to British overseas territories.\nThe agreement and any supplementary agreements will be reviewed every 5 years.\nAnnexes and protocols\nThere are numerous annexes to the agreement covering issues such as:\nrules of procedure of the Partnership Council and committees;\nrules of origin;\nmotor vehicles, equipment and parts;\nmedical products;\nrules for authorised economic operators;\nguidelines for the recognition of professional qualifications.\nThe are 3 protocols attached to the agreement:\nProtocol on administrative cooperation and combating fraud in the field of value added tax and for mutual assistance for the recovery of claims related to tax and duties — this protocol sets out the rules and procedures for cooperation in this field.\nProtocol on mutual administrative assistance in customs matters — this protocol is designed to enable the two parties to assist each other in ensuring the correct application of customs legislation, in particular by preventing, investigating and combating operations in breach of that legislation.\nProtocol on social security coordination — this protocol sets out the rules for coordination on: sickness benefits;maternity and paternity benefits;invalidity benefits;old-age benefits.\nDeclarations\nThe declarations cover a wide range of issues including:\nfinancial service regulatory cooperation;\ncountering harmful tax regimes;\nmonetary policy and subsidy control;\nroad hauliers;\nasylum and returns;\nvarious aspects of law enforcement and judicial cooperation on criminal matters;\nexchange and protection of classified information;\nUK participation in EU programmes and access to programme services;\na draft protocol on the programmes and activities in which the UK will participate.\nFROM WHEN DO THE DECISIONS AND AGREEMENT APPLY?\nDecisions (EU) 2020/2252 and (Euratom) 2020/2253 have applied since 29 December 2020.\nFollowing the consent of the European Parliament on 27 April 2021 and the Council decision on 29 April 2021, the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement and the Agreement on security of information entered into force on 1 May 2021.\nBACKGROUND\n              \nThe Trade and Cooperation Agreement follows on from the Withdrawal Agreement agreed between the UK and the EU which entered into force on 1 February 2020.
