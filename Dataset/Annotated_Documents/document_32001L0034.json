In the interests of clarity and rationality, the said Directives should therefore be codified by grouping them together in a single text.(2) The coordination of the conditions for the admission of securities to official listing on stock exchanges situated or operating in the Member States is likely to provide equivalent protection for investors at Community level, because of the more uniform guarantees offered to investors in the various Member States, it will facilitate both the admission to official stock exchange listing, in each such State, of securities from other Member States and the listing of any given security on a number of stock exchanges in the Community; it will accordingly make for greater interpenetration of national securities markets by removing those obstacles that may prudently be removed and therefore contribute to the prospect of establishing a European capital market.(3) Such coordination must therefore apply to securities, independently of the legal status of their issuers, and must therefore also apply to securities issued by non-member States or their regional or local authorities or international public bodies; this Directive therefore covers entities not covered by the second paragraph of Article 48 of the Treaty.(4) There should be the possibility of a right to apply to the courts against decisions by the competent national authorities in respect of the application of this Directive, concerning the admission of securities to official listing, although such right to apply must not be allowed to restrict the discretion of these authorities.(5) Initially, this coordination of the conditions for admission of securities to official listing should be sufficiently flexible to enable account to be taken of present differences in the structures of securities markets in the Member States and to enable the Member States to take account of any specific situations with which they may be confronted.(6) For this reason, coordination should first be limited to the establishment of minimum conditions for the admission of securities to official listing on stock exchanges situated or operating in the Member States, without however giving issuers any right to listing.(7) This partial coordination of the conditions for admission to official listing constitutes a first step towards subsequent closer alignment of the rules of Member States in this field.(8) The market in which undertakings operate has been enlarged to embrace the whole Community and this enlargement involves a corresponding increase in their financial requirements and extension of the capital markets on which they must call to satisfy them; admission to official listing on stock exchanges of Member States of securities issued by undertakings constitutes an important means of access to these capital markets; furthermore exchange restrictions on the purchase of securities traded on the stock exchanges of another Member State have been eliminated as part of the liberalisation of capital movements.(9) Safeguards for the protection of the interests of actual and potential investors are required in most Member States of undertakings offering their securities to the public, either at the time of their offer or of their admission to official stock exchange listing; such safeguards require the provision of information which is sufficient and as objective as possible concerning the financial circumstances of the issuer and particulars of the securities for which admission to official listing is requested; the form under which this information is required usually consists of the publication of listing particulars.(10) The safeguards required differ from Member State to Member State, both as regards the contents and the layout of the listing particulars and the efficacy, methods and timing of the check on the information given therein; the effect of these differences is not only to make it more difficult for undertakings to obtain admission of securities to official listing on stock exchanges of several Member States but also to hinder the acquisition by investors residing in one Member State of securities listed on stock exchanges of other Member States and thus to inhibit the financing of the undertakings and investment throughout the Community.(11) These differences should be eliminated by coordinating the rules and regulations without necessarily making them completely uniform, in order to achieve an adequate degree of equivalence in the safeguards required in each Member State to ensure the provision of information which is sufficient and as objective as possible for actual or potential security holders.(12) Such coordination must apply to securities independently of the legal status of the issuing undertaking; this Directive applies to entities to which no reference is made in the second paragraph of Article 48 of the Treaty.(13) Mutual recognition of listing particulars to be published for the admission of securities to official listing represents an important step forward in the creation of the Community's internal market.(14) In this connection, it is necessary to specify which authorities are competent to check and approve listing particulars to be published for the admission of securities to official listing in the event of simultaneous applications for admission to official listing in two or more Member States.(15) Article 21 of Council Directive 89/298/EEC of 17 April 1989 coordinating the requirements for the drawing-up, scrutiny and distribution of the prospectus to be published when transferable securities are offered to the public(7) provides that where public offers are made simultaneously or within short intervals of one another in two or more Member States, a public-offer prospectus drawn up and approved in accordance with Article 7, 8 or 12 of that Directive must be recognised as a public-offer prospectus in the other Member States concerned on the basis of mutual recognition.(16) It is also desirable to provide the recognition of a public-offer prospectus as listing particulars where admission to official stock-exchange listing is requested within a short period of the public offer.(17) The mutual recognition of a public-offer prospectus and admission to official listings does not in itself confer a right to admissions.(18) It is advisable to provide for the extension, by means of agreements to be concluded by the Community with non-member countries, of the recognition of listing particulars for admission to official listings from those countries on a reciprocal basis.(19) It seems appropriate to provide for the possibility for the Member State in which admission to official listing is sought in certain cases to grant partial or complete exemption from the obligation to publish listing particulars for admission to official listings to issuers the securities of which have already been admitted to official stock-exchange listing in another Member State.(20) Companies which have already been listed in the Community for some time and are of high quality and international standing are the most likely candidates for cross-border listing. Those companies are generally well known in most Member States: information concerning them is widely circulated and available.(21) The aim of this Directive is to ensure that sufficient information is provided for investors; therefore, when such a company seeks to have its securities admitted to listing in a host Member State, investors operating on the market in that country may be sufficiently protected by receiving only simplified information rather than full listing particulars.(22) Member States may find it useful to establish non-discriminatory minimum quantitative criteria, such as the current equity market capitalisation, which issuers must fulfil to be eligible to benefit from the possibilities for exemption provided for in this Directive; given the increasing integration of securities markets, it should equally be open to the competent authorities to give smaller companies similar treatment.(23) Furthermore, many stock exchanges have second-tier markets in order to deal in shares of companies not admitted to official listing; in some cases the second-tier markets are regulated and supervised by authorities recognised by public bodies that impose on companies disclosure requirements equivalent in substance to those imposed on officially listed companies; therefore, the principle underlying Article 23 of this Directive could also be applied when such companies seek to have their securities admitted to official listing.(24) In order to protect investors the documents intended to be made available to the public must first be sent to the competent authorities in the Member State in which admission to official listing is sought; it is for that Member State to decide whether those documents should be scrutinised by its competent authorities and to determine, if necessary, the nature and the manner in which that scrutiny should be carried out.(25) In the case of securities admitted to official stock-exchange listing, the protection of investors requires that the latter be supplied with appropriate regular information throughout the entire period during which the securities are listed; coordination of requirements for this regular information has similar objectives to those envisaged for the listing particulars, namely to improve such protection and to make it more equivalent, to facilitate the listing of these securities on more than one stock exchange in the Community, and in so doing to contribute towards the establishment of a genuine Community capital market by permitting a fuller interpenetration of securities markets.(26) Under this Directive, listed companies must as soon as possible make available to investors their annual accounts and report giving information on the company for the whole of the financial year; whereas the Fourth Council Directive 78/660/EEC(8) has coordinated the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States concerning the annual accounts of certain types of companies.(27) Companies should also, at least once during each financial year, make available to investors reports on their activities; this Directive can, consequently, be confined to coordinating the content and distribution of a single report covering the first six months of the financial year.(28) However, in the case of ordinary debentures, because of the rights they confer on their holders, the protection of investors by means of the publication of a half-yearly report is not essential; by virtue of this Directive, convertible or exchangeable debentures and debentures with warrants may be admitted to official listing only if the related shares are already listed on the same stock exchange or on another regulated, regularly operating, recognised open market or are so admitted simultaneously; the Member States may derogate from this principle only if their competent authorities are satisfied that holders have at their disposal all the information necessary to form an opinion concerning the value of the shares to which these debentures relate; consequently, regular information needs to be coordinated only for companies whose shares are admitted to official stock-exchange listing.(29) The half-yearly report must enable investors to make an informed appraisal of the general development of the company's activities during the period covered by the report; however, this report need contain only the essential details on the financial position and general progress of the business of the company in question.(30) So as to ensure the effective protection of investors and the proper operation of stock exchanges, the rules relating to regular information to be published by companies, the shares of which are admitted to official stock-exchange listing within the Community, should apply not only to companies from Member States, but also to companies from non-member countries.(31) A policy of adequate information of investors in the field of transferable securities is likely to improve investor protection, to increase investors' confidence in securities markets and thus to ensure that securities markets function correctly.(32) By making such protection more equivalent, coordination of that policy at Community level is likely to make for greater inter-penetration of the Member States' transferable securities markets and therefore help to establish a true European capital market.(33) To that end investors should be informed of major holdings and of changes in those holdings in Community companies the shares of which are officially listed on stock exchanges situated or operating within the Community.(34) Coordinated rules should be laid down concerning the detailed content and the procedure for applying that requirement.(35) Companies, the shares of which are officially listed on a Community stock exchange, can inform the public of changes in major holdings only if they have been informed of such changes by the holders of those holdings.(36) Most Member States do not subject holders to such a requirement and where such a requirement exists there are appreciable differences in the procedures for applying it; coordinated rules should therefore be adopted at Community level in this field.(37) This Directive should not affect the obligations of the Member States concerning the deadlines for transposition set out in Annex II, Part B,HAVE ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:TITLE IDEFINITIONS AND SCOPE OF APPLICATIONCHAPTER IDefinitionsArticle 1For the purposes of this Directive:(a) \"issuers\" shall mean companies and other legal persons and any undertaking whose securities are the subject of an application for admission to official listing on a stock exchange;(b) \"collective investment undertakings other than the closed-end type\" shall mean unit trusts and investment companies:(i) the object of which is the collective investment of capital provided by the public, and which operate on the principle of risk spreading, and(ii) the units of which are, at the holders' request, repurchased or redeemed, directly or indirectly, out of the assets of these undertakings.

Member States may, in accordance with the applicable national rules require issuers of securities admitted to official listing to inform the public on a regular basis of their financial position and the general course of their business.CHAPTER IIIDerogationsArticle 9Any derogations from the conditions for the admission of securities to official listing which may be authorised in accordance with Articles 42 to 63 must apply generally for all issuers where the circumstances justifying them are similar.Article 10Member States may decide not to apply the conditions set out in Articles 52 to 63 and the obligations set out in Article 81(1) and (3) in respect of applications for admission to official listing of debt securities issued by companies and other legal persons which are nationals of a Member State and which are set up by, governed by or managed pursuant to a special law where repayments and interest payments in respect of those securities are guaranteed by a Member State or one of its federal states.CHAPTER IVPowers of the national competent authoritiesSection 1Decision of admissionArticle 111. The competent authorities referred to in Article 105 shall decide on the admission of securities to official listing on a stock exchange situated or operating within their territories.2. Without prejudice to the other powers conferred upon them, the competent authorities may reject an application for the admission of a security to official listing if, in their opinion, the issuer's situation is such that admission would be detrimental to investors' interests.Article 12By way of derogation from Article 8, Member States may, solely in the interests of protecting the investors, give the competent authorities power to make the admission of a security to official listing subject to any special condition which the competent authorities consider appropriate and of which they have explicitly informed the applicant.Article 131. Where applications are to be made simultaneously or within short intervals of one another for admission of the same securities to official listing on stock exchanges situated or operating in more than one Member State, or where an application for admission is made in respect of a security already listed on a stock exchange in another Member State, the competent authorities shall communicate with each other and make such arrangements as may be necessary to expedite the procedure and simplify as far as possible the formalities and any additional conditions required for admission of the security concerned.2. In order to facilitate the work of the competent authorities, any application for the admission of a security to official listing on a stock exchange situated or operating in a Member State must state whether a similar application is being or has been made in another Member State, or will be made in the near future.Article 14The competent authorities may refuse to admit to official listing a security already officially listed in another Member State where the issuer fails to comply with the obligations resulting from admission in that Member State.Article 15Where an application for admission to official listing relates to certificates representing shares, the application shall be considered only if the competent authorities are of the opinion that the issuer of the certificates is offering adequate safeguards for the protection of investors.Section 2Information requested by the competent authoritiesArticle 161. An issuer whose securities are admitted to official listing shall provide the competent authorities with all the information which the latter consider appropriate in order to protect investors or ensure the smooth operation of the market.2. Where protection of investors or the smooth operation of the market so requires, an issuer may be required by the competent authorities to publish such information in such a form and within such time limits as they consider appropriate. Should the issuer fail to comply with such requirement, the competent authorities may themselves publish such information after having heard the issuer.Section 3Action against an issuer failing to comply with the obligations resulting from admissionArticle 17Without prejudice to any other action or penalties which they may contemplate in the event of failure on the part of the issuer to comply with the obligations resulting from admission to official listing, the competent authorities may make public the fact that an issuer is failing to comply with those obligations.Section 4Suspension and discontinuanceArticle 181. The competent authorities may decide to suspend the listing of a security where the smooth operation of the market is, or may be, temporarily jeopardised or where protection of investors so requires.2. The competent authorities may decide that the listing of the security be discontinued where they are satisfied that, owing to special circumstances, normal regular dealings in a security are no longer possible.Section 5Right to apply to the courts in case of refusal of admission or discontinuanceArticle 191. Member States shall ensure decisions of the competent authorities refusing the admission of a security to official listing or discontinuing such a listing shall be subject to the right to apply to the courts.2. An applicant shall be notified of a decision regarding his application for admission to official listing within six months of receipt of the application or, should the competent authority require any further information within that period, within six months of the applicant's supplying such information.3. Failure to give a decision within the time limit specified in paragraph 2 shall be deemed a rejection of the application. Such rejection shall give rise to the right to apply to the courts provided for in paragraph 1.TITLE IIIPARTICULAR CONDITIONS RELATING TO OFFICIAL LISTINGS OF SECURITIESCHAPTER IPublication of listing particulars for admissionSection 1General provisionsArticle 20Member States shall ensure that the admission of securities to official listing on a stock exchange situated or operating within their territories is conditional upon the publication of an information sheet, hereinafter referred to as \"listing particulars\", in accordance with Chapter I of Title V.Article 211. The listing particulars shall contain the information which, according to the particular nature of the issuer and of the securities for the admission of which application is being made, is necessary to enable investors and their investment advisers to make an informed assessment of the assets and liabilities, financial position, profits and losses, and prospects of the issuer and of the rights attaching to such securities.2. Member States shall ensure that the obligation referred to in paragraph 1 is incumbent upon the persons responsible for the listing particulars as provided for in heading 1.1 of Schedules A and B of Annex I hereto.Article 221. Without prejudice to the obligation referred to in Article 21, Member States shall ensure that, subject to the possibilities for exemptions provided for in Articles 23 and 24, listing particulars contain, in as easily analysable and comprehensible a form as possible, at least the items of information provided for in Schedules A, B or C of Annex I, depending on whether shares, debt securities or certificates representing shares are involved.2. In the specific cases covered by Articles 25 to 34 the listing particulars are to be drawn up in accordance with the specifications given in those Articles, subject to the possibilities for exemptions provided for in Articles 23 and 24.3. Where certain headings in Schedules A, B and C of Annex I appear inappropriate to the issuer's sphere of activity or legal form, listing particulars giving equivalent information shall be drawn up by adapting these headings.Section 2Partial or complete exemption from the obligation to publish listing particularsArticle 23Without prejudice to Article 39(1), Member States may allow the competent authorities responsible for checking the listing particulars within the meaning of this Directive, to provide for partial or complete exemption from the obligation to publish listing particulars in the following cases:1) where the securities for which admission to official listing is applied for are:(a) securities which have been the subject of a public issue; or(b) securities issued in connection with a takeover offer;or(c) securities issued in connection with a merger involving the acquisition of another company or the formation of a new company, the division of a company, the transfer of all or part of an undertaking's assets and liabilities or as consideration for the transfer of assets other than cash;and where, not more than 12 months before the admission of the securities to official listing, a document, regarded by the competent authorities as containing information equivalent to that of the listing particulars provided for by this Directive, has been published in the same Member State. Particulars shall also be published of any material changes which have occurred since such document was prepared. The document must be made available to the public at the registered office of the issuer and at the offices of the financial organisations retained to act as the latter's paying agents, and any particulars of material changes shall be published in accordance with Articles 98(1) and 99(1);2) where the securities for which admission to official listing is applied for are:(a) shares allotted free of charge to holders of shares already listed on the same stock exchange; or(b) shares resulting from the conversion of convertible debt securities or shares created after an exchange for exchangeable debt securities, if shares of the company whose shares are offered by way of conversion or exchange are already listed on the same stock exchange; or(c) shares resulting from the exercise of the rights conferred by warrants, if shares of the company whose shares are offered to holders of the warrants are already listed on the same stock exchange; or(d) shares issued in substitution for shares already listed on the same stock exchange if the issuing of such new shares does not involve any increase in the company's issued share capital;and, where appropriate, the information provided for in Chapter 2 of Schedule A of Annex I is published in accordance with Articles 98(1) and 99(1);3) where the securities for which admission to official listing is applied for are:(a) shares of which either the number or the estimated market value or the nominal value or, in the absence of a nominal value, the accounting par value, amounts to less than 10 % of the number or of the corresponding value of shares of the same class already listed on the same stock exchange; or(b) debt securities issued by companies and other legal persons which are nationals of a Member State and which:(i) in carrying on their business, benefit from State monopolies, and(ii) are set up or governed by a special law or pursuant to such a law or whose borrowings are unconditionally and irrevocably guaranteed by a Member State or one of a Member State's federated States; or(c) debt securities issued by legal persons, other than companies, which are nationals of a Member State, and(i) were set up by special law, and(ii) whose activities are governed by that law and consist solely in:- raising funds under state control through the issue of debt securities, and- financing production by means of the resources which they have raised and resources provided by a Member State, and(iii) the debt securities of which are, for the purposes of admission to official listing, considered by national law as debt securities issued or guaranteed by the State; or(d) shares allotted to employees, if shares of the same class have already been admitted to official listing on the same stock exchange; shares which differ from each other solely as to the date of first entitlement to dividends shall not be considered as being of different classes; or(e) securities already admitted to official listing on another stock exchange in the same Member State; or(f) shares issued in consideration for the partial or total renunciation by the management of a limited partnership with a share capital of its statutory rights over the profits, if shares of the same class have already been admitted to official listing on the same stock exchange; shares which differ from each other solely as to the date of first entitlement to dividends shall not be considered as being of different classes; or(g) supplementary certificates representing shares issued in exchange for the original securities, where the issuing of such new certificates has not brought about any increase in the company's issued capital, and provided that certificates representing such shares are already listed on the same stock exchange,and where:- in the case of (a), the issuer has complied with the stock exchange publicity requirements imposed by the national authorities and has produced annual accounts and annual and interim reports which these authorities have considered adequate;- in the case of (e), listing particulars complying with this Directive have already been published; and- in all the cases referred to in points (a) to (g), information concerning the number and type of securities to be admitted to official listing and the circumstances in which such securities have been issued has been published in accordance with Articles 98(1) and 99(1);4) where:(a) the securities or the shares of the issuer or certificates representing such shares have been officially listed in another Member State for not less than three years before the application for admission to official listing;(b) to the satisfaction of the competent authorities of the Member State in which admission to official listing is sought, the competent authorities of the Member State or Member States in which the issuer's securities are officially listed have confirmed that during the preceding three years or during the entire time the issuer's securities have been listed, if that is less than three years, the issuer has complied with all the requirements concerning information and admission to listing imposed on companies the securities of which are officially listed by virtue of this Directive;(c) all the following are published in the manner stipulated in Articles 98 and 99(1).(i) a document containing the following information:- a statement that application has been made for admission of the securities to official listing. In the case of shares, the statement shall also specify the number and class of the shares in question and give a concise description of the rights attaching thereto. In the case of certificates representing shares the statement shall also specify the rights attaching to the original securities and give information concerning the possibility of converting the certificates into original securities and the procedure for that conversion.

When published in accordance with Article 98, listing particulars as referred to in paragraph 1 shall be accompanied by the annual accounts for the latest financial year.3. Where the issuer prepares both own and consolidated annual accounts, both sets of accounts must accompany the listing particulars. However, the competent authorities may allow the issuer to attach to the listing particulars either the own or the consolidated accounts alone, provided that the accounts not attached to the listing particulars furnish no material additional information.Article 27Where the application for admission to official listing relates to debt securities nearly all of which, because of their nature, are normally bought and traded in by a limited number of investors who are particularly knowledgeable in investment matters, the competent authorities may allow the omission from the listing particulars of certain information provided for by Schedule B of Annex I or allow its inclusion in summary form, on condition that such information is not material from the point of view of the investors concerned.Article 281.

The guarantee contract must, in the cases referred to in paragraphs 1, 2 and 3, be made available for inspection by the public at the offices of the issuer and at those of the financial organisations retained to act as the latter's paying agents. Copies of the contract shall be provided to any person concerned on request.Article 311.

Where the transaction referred to in paragraph 1 took place more than two years previously, the competent authorities may dispense with the requirement imposed in that paragraph.Article 331. When the application for admission to official listing relates to certificates representing shares, the listing particulars must contain the information, as regards certificates, provided for in Schedule C of Annex I and the information, as regards the shares represented, provided for in Schedule A of Annex I.2.

Once approved in accordance with Article 37, listing particulars must, subject to any translation, be recognised by the other Member States in which admission to official listing has been applied for, without its being necessary to obtain the approval of the competent authorities of those States and without their being able to require that additional information be included in the listing particulars. The competent authorities may, however, require that listing particulars include information specific to the market of the country of admission concerning in particular the income tax system, the financial organisations retained to act as paying agents for the issuer in that country, and the way in which notices to investors are published.2. Listing particulars approved by the competent authorities within the meaning of Article 37 must be recognised in another Member State in which application for admission to official listing is made, even if partial exemption or partial derogation has been granted pursuant to this Directive, provided that:(a) the partial exemption or partial derogation in question is of a type that is recognised in the rules of the other Member State concerned, and(b) the conditions that justify the partial exemption or partial derogation also exist in the other Member State concerned and that there are no other conditions concerning such exemption or derogation which might lead the competent authority in that Member State to refuse them.Even if the conditions laid down in (a) and (b) are not fulfilled, the Member State concerned may allow its competent authorities to recognise the listing particulars approved by the competent authorities within the meaning of Article 37.3. When approving listing particulars, the competent authorities within the meaning of Article 37 shall provide the competent authorities of the other Member States in which application for official listing is made with a certificate of approval. If partial exemption or partial derogation has been granted pursuant to this Directive, the certificate shall state that fact and the reasons for it.4. When application for admission to official listing is made, the issuer shall communicate to the competent authorities in each of the other Member States in which it is applying for admission the draft listing particulars which it intends to use in that State.5. Member States may restrict the application of this Article to listing particulars of issuers having their registered office in a Member State.Article 391.

The competent authorities may, however, require that the prospectus include information specific to the market of the country of admission concerning, in particular, the income tax system, the financial organisations retained to act as paying agents for the issuer in the country of admission and the ways in which notices to investors are published.2. Article 38(2) to (5) shall apply in the eventuality referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article.3.

Where an application for admission to official listing is made for securities which have been listed in another Member State less than six months previously, the competent authorities to whom application is made shall contact the competent authorities which have already admitted the securities to official listing and shall, as far as possible, exempt the issuer of those securities from the preparation of new listing particulars, subject to any need for updating, translation or the issue of supplements in accordance with the individual requirements of the Member State concerned.Section 8Agreements with non-member countriesArticle 41The Community may, by means of agreements concluded with one or more non-member countries pursuant to the Treaty, recognise listing particulars drawn up and checked, in accordance with the rules of the non-member country or countries, as meeting the requirements of this Directive, subject to reciprocity, provided that the rules concerned give investors protection equivalent to that afforded by this Directive, even if those rules differ from the provisions of this Directive.CHAPTER IISpecific conditions for the admission of sharesSection 1Conditions relating to companies for the shares of which admission to official listing is soughtArticle 42The legal position of the company must be in conformity with the laws and Regulations to which it is subject, as regards both its formation and its operation under its statutes.Article 431. The foreseeable market capitalisation of the shares for which admission to official listing is sought or, if this cannot be assessed, the company's capital and reserves, including profit or loss, from the last financial year, must be at least one million euro.2. Member States may provide for admission to official listing, even when this condition is not fulfilled, provided that the competent authorities are satisfied that there will be an adequate market for the shares concerned.3. A higher foreseeable market capitalisation or higher capital and reserves may be required by a Member State for admission to official listing only if another regulated, regularly operating, recognised open market exists in that State and the requirements for it are equal to or less than those referred to in paragraph 1.4. The condition set out in paragraph 1 shall not be applicable for the admission to official listing of a further block of shares of the same class as those already admitted.5. The equivalent in national currency of one million euro shall initially be the equivalent in national currency of one million European units of account that were applicable on 5 March 1979.6. If, as a result of adjustment of the equivalent of the euro in national currency, the market capitalisation expressed in national currency remains for a period of one year at least 10 % more or less than the value of one million euro the Member state must, within the 12 months following the expiry of that period, adjust its laws, regulations or administrative provisions to comply with paragraph 1.Article 44A company must have published or filed its annual accounts in accordance with national law for the three financial years preceding the application for official listing. By way of exception, the competent authorities may derogate from this condition where such derogation is desirable in the interests of the company or of investors and where the competent authorities are satisfied that investors have the necessary information available to be able to arrive at an informed judgement on the company and the shares for which admission to official listing is sought.Section 2Conditions relating to the shares for which admission is soughtArticle 45The legal position of the shares must be in conformity with the laws and regulations to which they are subject.Article 461. The shares must be freely negotiable.2.

The competent authorities may, in the case of the admission to official listing of shares which may be acquired only subject to approval, derogate from paragraph 1 only if the use of the approval clause does not disturb the market.Article 47Where public issue precedes admission to official listing, the first listing may be made only after the end of the period during which subscription applications may be submitted.Article 481. A sufficient number of shares must be distributed to the public in one or more Member States not later than the time of admission.2. The condition set out in paragraph 1 shall not apply where shares are to be distributed to the public through the stock exchange.

Where admission to official listing is sought for a further block of shares of the same class, the competent authorities may assess whether a sufficient number of shares has been distributed to the public in relation to all the shares issued and not only in relation to this further block.4. By way of derogation from paragraph 1, if the shares are admitted to official listing in one or more non-member countries, the competent authorities may provide for their admission to official listing if a sufficient number of shares is distributed to the public in the non-Member State or States where they are listed.5. A sufficient number of shares shall be deemed to have been distributed either when the shares in respect of which application for admission has been made are in the hands of the public to the extent of a least 25 % of the subscribed capital represented by the class of shares concerned or when, in view of the large number of shares of the same class and the extent of their distribution to the public, the market will operate properly with a lower percentage.Article 491. The application for admission to official listing must cover all the shares of the same class already issued.2. Member States may provide that this condition shall not apply to applications for admission not covering all the shares of the same class already issued where the shares of that class for which admission is not sought belong to blocks serving to maintain control of the company or are not negotiable for a certain time under agreements, provided that the public is informed of such situations and that there is no danger of such situations prejudicing the interests of the holders of the shares for which admission to official listing is sought.Article 501. For the admission to official listing of shares issued by companies which are nationals of another Member State and which shares have a physical form it is necessary and sufficient that their physical form comply with the standards laid down in that other Member State. Where the physical form does not conform to the standards in force in the Member State in which admission to official listing is applied for, the competent authorities of that state shall make that fact known to the public.2. The physical form of shares issued by companies which are nationals of a non-member country must afford sufficient safeguard for the protection of the investors.Article 51If the shares issued by a company which is a national of a non-member country are not listed in either the country of origin or in the country in which the major proportion of the shares is held, they may not be admitted to official listing unless the competent authorities are satisfied that the absence of a listing in the country of origin or in the country in which the major proportion is held is not due to the need to protect investors.CHAPTER IIIParticular conditions relating to the admission to official listing of debt securities issued by an undertakingSection 1Conditions relating to undertakings for the debt securities of which admission to official listing is soughtArticle 52The legal position of the undertaking must be in conformity with the laws and regulations to which it is subject, as regards both its formation and its operation under its statutes.Section 2Conditions relating to the debt securities for which admission to official listing is soughtArticle 53The legal position of the debt securities must be in conformity with the laws and regulations to which they are subject.Article 541.

This provision shall not apply in the case of tap issues of debt securities when the closing date for subscription is not fixed.Article 56The application for admission to official listing must cover all debt securities ranking pari passu.Article 571. For the admission to official listing of debt securities issued by undertakings which are nationals of another Member State and which debt securities have a physical form, it is necessary and sufficient that their physical form comply with the standards laid down in that other Member State. Where the physical form does not conform to the standards in force in the Member State in which admission to official listing is applied for, the competent authorities of that State shall make that fact known to the public.2. The physical form of debt securities issued in a single Member State must conform to the standards in force in that State.3. The physical form of debt securities issued by undertakings which are nationals of a non-member country must afford sufficient safeguard for the protection of the investors.Section 3Other conditionsArticle 581. The amount of the loan may not be less than EUR 200000. This provision shall not be applicable in the case of tap issues where the amount of the loan is not fixed.2. Member States may provide for admission to official listing even when this condition is not fulfilled, where the competent authorities are satisfied that there will be a sufficient market for the debt securities concerned.3. The equivalent in national currency of EUR 200000 shall initially be the equivalent in national currency of 200000 units of account that were applicable on 5 March 1979.4.

Convertible or exchangeable debentures and debentures with warrants may be admitted to official listing only if the related shares are already listed on the same stock exchange or on another regulated, regularly operating, recognised open market or are so admitted simultaneously.2. Member States may, by way of derogation from paragraph 1, provide for the admission to official listing of convertible or exchangeable debentures or debentures with warrants, if the competent authorities are satisfied that holders have at their disposal all the information necessary to form an opinion concerning the value of the shares to which these debt securities relate.CHAPTER IVParticular conditions relating to the admission to official listing of Debt securities issued by a State, its regional or local authorities or a public international bodyArticle 60The debt securities must be freely negotiable.Article 61Where public issue precedes admission to official listing, the first listing may be made only after the end of the period during which subscription applications may be submitted.

A company whose shares are officially listed on stock exchanges situated or operating in different Member States must ensure that equivalent information is made available to the market at each of these exchanges.2. A company whose shares are officially listed on stock exchanges situated or operating in one or more Member States and in one or more non-member countries must make available to the markets of the Member State or States in which its shares are listed information which is at least equivalent to that which it makes available to the markets of the non-member country or countries in question, if such information may be of importance for the evaluation of the shares.Section 7Periodical information to be publishedArticle 70Member States shall ensure that the companies referred to in Article 4 publish half-yearly reports on their activities and profits and losses during the first six months of each financial year.Article 71With regard to the half-yearly report, the Member States may subject companies to obligations more stringent than those provided for by Articles 70, and 72 to 76, 102(2) and Article 103 or to additional obligations, provided that they apply generally to all companies or to all companies of a given class.Section 8Publication and contents of the half-yearly reportArticle 721. The half-yearly report shall be published within four months of the end of the relevant six-month period.2. In exceptional, duly substantiated cases, the competent authorities shall be permitted to extend the time limit for publication.Article 731. The half-yearly report shall consist of figures and an explanatory statement relating to the company's activities and profits and losses during the relevant six-month period.2. The figures, presented in table form, shall indicate at least:(a) the net turnover, and(b) the profit or loss before or after deduction of tax.These terms shall have the same meanings as in the Directives on company accounts.3. The Member States may allow the competent authorities to authorise companies, exceptionally and on a case-by-case basis, to supply estimated figures for profits and losses, provided that the shares of each such company are listed officially in only one Member State. The use of this procedure must be indicated by the company in its report and must not mislead investors.4. Where the company has paid or proposes to pay an interim dividend, the figures must indicate the profit or loss after tax for the six-month period and the interim dividend paid or proposed.5. Against each figure there must be shown the figure for the corresponding period in the preceding financial year.6. The explanatory statement must include any significant information enabling investors to make an informed assessment of the trend of the company's activities and profits or losses together with an indication of any special factor which has influenced those activities and those profits or losses during the period in question, and enable a comparison to be made with the corresponding period of the preceding financial year.It must also, as far as possible, refer to the company's likely future development in the current financial year.7. Where the figures provided for in paragraph 2 are unsuited to the company's activities, the competent authorities shall ensure that appropriate adjustments are made.Article 74Where a company publishes consolidated accounts it may publish its half-yearly report in either consolidated or unconsolidated form. However, the Member States may allow the competent authorities, where the latter consider that the form not adopted would have contained additional material information, to require the company to publish such information.Article 75Where the accounting information has been audited by the official auditor of the company's accounts, that auditor's report and any qualifications he may have shall be reproduced in full.Article 761. Where particular requirements of this Directive are unsuited to a company's activities or circumstances, the competent authorities shall ensure that suitable adaptations are made to such requirements.2. The competent authorities may authorise the omission from the half-yearly report of certain information provided for in this Directive if they consider that disclosure of such information would be contrary to the public interest or seriously detrimental to the company, provided that, in the latter case, such omission would not be likely to mislead the public with regard to facts and circumstances knowledge of which is essential for the assessment of the shares in question.The company or its representatives shall be responsible for the correctness and relevance of the facts on which any application for such exemption is based.3. Paragraphs 1 and 2 shall also apply to the more stringent or additional obligations imposed pursuant to Article 71.4. If a company governed by the law of a non-member country publishes a half-yearly report in a non-member country, the competent authorities may authorise it to publish that report instead of the half-yearly report provided for in this Directive, provided that the information given is equivalent to that which would result from the application of this Directive.Article 77Where a half-yearly report has to be published in more than one Member State, the competent authorities of these Member States shall, by way of derogation from Article 71, use their best endeavours to accept as a single text the text which meets the requirements of the Member State in which the company's shares were admitted to official listing for the first time or the text which most closely approximates to that text. In cases of simultaneous admission to official listing on two or more stock exchanges situated or operating in different Member States, the competent authorities of the Member States concerned shall use their best endeavours to accept as a single text the text of the report which meets the requirements of the Member State in which the company's head office is situated; if the company's head office is situated in a non-member country, the competent authorities of the Member States concerned shall use their best endeavours to accept a single version of the report.CHAPTER IIObligation of issuers whose debt securities are admitted to official listingSection 1Debt securities issued by an undertakingArticle 781. The undertaking must ensure that all holders of debt securities ranking pari passu are given equal treatment in respect of all the rights attaching to those debt securities.Provided they are made in accordance with national law, this condition shall not prevent offers of early repayment of certain debt securities being made to holders by an undertaking in derogation from the conditions of issue and in particular in accordance with social priorities.2.

States, their regional or local authorities and public international bodies must ensure that all holders of debt securities ranking pari passu are given equal treatment in respect of all the rights attaching to those debt securities.Provided they are made in accordance with national law, this condition shall not prevent offers of early repayment of certain debt securities being made to holders by an issuer in derogation from the conditions of issue and in particular in accordance with social priorities.2. States, their regional or local authorities and public international bodies must ensure that at least in each Member State in which their debt securities are officially listed all the facilities and information necessary to enable holders of debt securities to exercise their rights are available.

Member States need not apply:(a) the thresholds of 20 % and 1/3 where they apply a single threshold of 25 %,(b) the threshold of 2/3 where they apply the threshold of 75 %.The period of seven calendar days shall start from the time when the owner of the major holding learns of the acquisition or disposal, or from the time when, in view of the circumstances, he should have learnt of it.Member States may further provide that a company must also be informed in respect of the proportion of capital held by a natural person or legal entity.2. Member States shall, if necessary, establish in their national law, and determine in accordance with it, the manner in which the voting rights to be taken into account for the purposes of applying paragraph 1 are to be brought to the notice of the natural persons and legal entities referred to in Article 85(1).Article 90Member States shall provide that at the first annual general meeting of a company referred to in Article 85(1), to take place, with regard to:Belgium, as from 1 October 1993,Denmark, as from 1 October 1991,Germany, as from 1 April 1995,Greece, as from 1 October 1992,Spain, as from 15 June 1991,France, as from 1 October 1991,Ireland, as from 1 November 1991,Italy, as from 1 June 1992,Luxembourg, as from 1 June 1993,Netherlands, as from 1 May 1992,Austria, as from 1 April 1995,Portugal, as from 1 August 1991,Finland, as from 1 April 1995,Sweden, as from 1 April 1996,andUnited Kingdom, as from 18 December 1993,any natural person or legal entity as referred to in Article 85(1) must notify the company concerned and at the same time the competent authority or authorities where he holds 10 % or more of its voting rights, specifying the proportion of voting rights actually held unless that person or entity has already made a declaration in accordance with Article 89.Within one month of that general meeting, the public shall be informed of all holdings of 10 % or more in accordance with Article 91.Article 91A company which has received a declaration referred to in the first subparagraph of Article 89(1) must in turn disclose it to the public in each of the Member States in which its shares are officially listed on a stock exchange as soon as possible but not more than nine calendar days after the receipt of that declaration.A Member State may provide for the disclosure to the public, referred to in the first subparagraph, to be made not by the company concerned but by the competent authority, possibly in cooperation with that company.Section 3Determination of the voting rightsArticle 92For the purposes of determining whether a natural person or legal entity as referred to in Article 85(1) is required to make a declaration as provided for in Article 89(1) and in Article 90, the following shall be regarded as voting rights held by that person or entity:(a) voting rights held by other persons or entities in their own names but on behalf of that person or entity,(b) voting rights held by an undertaking controlled by that person or entity;(c) voting rights held by a third party with whom that person or entity has concluded a written agreement which obliges them to adopt, by concerted exercise of the voting rights they hold, a lasting common policy towards the management of the company in question.(d) voting rights held by a third party under a written agreement concluded with that person or entity or with an undertaking controlled by that person or entity providing for the temporary transfer for consideration of the voting rights in question,(e) voting rights attaching to shares owned by that person or entity which are lodged as security, except where the person or entity holding the security controls the voting rights and declares his intention of exercising them, in which case they shall be regarded as the latter's voting rights,(f) voting rights attaching to shares of which that person or entity has the life interest,(g) voting rights which that person or entity or one of the other persons or entities mentioned in points (a) to (f) is entitled to acquire, on his own initiative alone, under a formal agreement; in such cases, the notification prescribed in Article 89(1) shall be effected on the date of the agreement,(h) voting rights attaching to shares deposited with that person or entity which that person or entity can exercise at its discretion in the absence of specific instructions from the holders.By way of derogation from Article 89(1), where a person or entity may exercise voting rights referred to in point (h) of the first paragraph in a company and where the totality of these voting rights together with the other voting rights held by that person or entity in that company reaches or exceeds one of the thresholds provided for in Article 89(1), Member States may lay down that the said person or entity is only obliged to inform the company concerned 21 calendar days before the general meeting of that company.Section 4ExemptionsArticle 93If the person or entity acquiring or disposing of a major holding as defined in Article 89 is a member of a group of undertakings required under Council Directive 83/349/EEC(9) to draw up consolidated accounts, that person or entity shall be exempt from the obligation to make the declaration provided for in Article 89(1) and in Article 90 if it is made by the parent undertaking or, where the parent undertaking is itself a subsidiary undertaking, by its own parent undertaking.Article 941.

The existing measures (repealed by the Listing Directive) are:\nCouncil Directive 79/279/EEC coordinating the conditions for the admission of securities to official stock-exchange listing;\nCouncil Directive 80/390/EEC coordinating the requirements for the drawing up, scrutiny and distribution of the listing particulars to be published for the admission of securities to official stock-exchange listing;\nCouncil Directive 82/121/EEC on information to be published on a regular basis by companies the shares of which have been admitted to official stock-exchange listing;\nCouncil Directive 88/627/EEC on the information to be published when a major holding in a listed company is acquired or disposed of.\nDirectives 2003/71/EC (the Prospectus Directive) and 2004/109/EC (the Transparency Directive) further consolidated rules harmonising the conditions for the provision of information regarding requests for the admission of securities to official stock-exchange listing and the information on securities admitted to trading.\nThe Prospectus and Transparency Directives amended the Listing Directive removing overlapping requirements. As a consequence, Articles 3, 4, 20 to 41, 65 to 104 and 108 of the Listing Directive were deleted.\nIn addition, Directive 2004/39/EC (the original Markets in Financial Instruments Directive, MiFID) replaced the notion of ‘admission to the official listing’ with ‘admission to trading on a regulated market’.\nThe Listing Directive concerns securities for which admission to official listing is requested and those admitted, irrespective of the legal nature of their issuer. However, certain exemptions are possible in the case of securities issued by an EU country or its regional or local authorities, or units issued by collective investment undertakings other than the closed-end type.\nThe Listing Directive is a minimum harmonisation directive. It allows EU countries to put in place additional requirements for admission of securities to official listing, provided that:\nsuch additional conditions apply to all issuers and\nthey have been published before the application for admission of such securities.\nFROM WHEN DOES THE DIRECTIVE APPLY?\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nIt has applied since 26 July 2001.\nMAIN DOCUMENT\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nDirective 2001/34/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 28 May 2001 on the admission of securities to official stock exchange listing and on information to be published on those securities (OJ L 184, 6.7.2001, pp. 1-66)\nSuccessive amendments to Directive 2001/34/EC have been incorporated into the original document.
