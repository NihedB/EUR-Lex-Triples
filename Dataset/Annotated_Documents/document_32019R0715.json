{"celex_id": "32019R0715", "reference": "10.5.2019\nEN\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\nL 122/1\nCOMMISSION DELEGATED REGULATION (EU) 2019/715\nof 18 December 2018\non the framework financial regulation for the bodies set up under the TFEU and Euratom Treaty and referred to in Article 70 of Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2018/1046 of the European Parliament and of the Council\nTHE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, in conjunction with the Treaty establishing the European Atomic Energy Community,\nHaving regard to Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2018/1046 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 July 2018 on the financial rules applicable to the general budget of the Union, amending Regulations (EU) No 1296/2013, (EU) No 1301/2013, (EU) No 1303/2013, (EU) No 1304/2013, (EU) No 1309/2013, (EU) No 1316/2013, (EU) No 223/2014, (EU) No 283/2014, and Decision No 541/2014/EU and repealing Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 966/2012 (1), and in particular Article 70 thereof,\nWhereas:\n(1)\nCommission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 1271/2013 (2) establishes the framework financial regulation for the bodies which are set up by the Union under the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union and the Treaty establishing the European Atomic Energy Community and which have legal personality and receive contributions charged to the Union budget (‘Union bodies’). Delegated Regulation (EU) No 1271/2013 is based on Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 966/2012 (3). Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 966/2012 has been replaced by Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2018/1046.\n(2)\nIt is necessary to repeal Regulation (EU) No 1271/2013 and to replace it by this Regulation in order to align it with Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2018/1046 and to allow for additional simplification and clarification of rules to take into account the experience gained in their application and to further improve the Union bodies' governance setting up and their accountability.\n(3)\nThis Regulation should establish the broad principles and basic rules applicable to the bodies set up under TFEU and the Euratom Treaty that receive contributions charged to the Union budget and without prejudice to the constituent act. On the basis of this Regulation Union bodies should adopt their own financial rules that may not depart from this Regulation except where their specific needs so require, and with the Commission's prior consent.\n(4)\nFor the sake of consistency, Union bodies that are fully self-financed and to which this Regulation does not apply, should establish similar rules where appropriate. In accordance with the Joint statement of the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission of 19 July 2012 on decentralised agencies, those bodies should submit to the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission an annual report on the execution of their budget and take duly into account their requests and recommendations.\n(5)\nUnion bodies should establish and implement their budget in accordance with the principles of unity, accuracy, universality, specification, annuality, equilibrium, unit of account, sound financial management and performance, and transparency.\n(6)\nThe balancing nature of the Union contribution should be emphasised. The part of the Union body's positive budget result that exceeds the amount of the Union contribution paid during the year should be returned to the Union budget.\n(7)\nWhere the constituent act provides that revenue is constituted by fees and charges in addition to the Union contribution and that revenue arising from fees and charges is assigned to particular items of expenditure, Union bodies should have the possibility to carry forward the balance in the form of assigned revenue. In order to allow for flexibility, the negative result related to assigned revenue from fees and charges could be offset against the accumulated surplus from previous years.\n(8)\nIt is necessary to ensure that the fees are set at an appropriate level to cover the costs of providing the services and to avoid significant surpluses.\n(9)\nThe exceptional delegation of tasks and award of grants to the Union bodies needs to be allowed in the constituent act or in a basic act and duly justified by the characteristics of the tasks and the specific expertise of the Union body, while ensuring sound financial management and cost-efficiency. Those additional tasks should fall within the scope of the Union body's objectives and should be compatible with the Union body's mandate, as defined in the constituent act.\n(10)\nIn order to increase transparency the Commission should, in principle, conclude partnership agreements with EU bodies covering all funding given in addition to the annual Union contribution, notably when this funding has a significant impact on the Union body's operations.\n(11)\nThe provisions on carryovers and assigned revenues should be amended to take into account the provisions of Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2018/1046. With regard to internal assigned revenue, the financing of new building projects with the revenue from lettings and the sale of buildings should be allowed as provided for in Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2018/1046. To that end, such revenue should be considered as internal assigned revenue that can be carried over until it is fully used.\n(12)\nIn order to allow for additional flexibility, Union bodies should be able to carry out transactions in currencies other than euro for the needs of administrative management.\n(13)\nIn line with Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2018/1046, the breaking down of commitments extending over several years into annual instalments should be allowed only where the constituent act or basic act provides so or where the commitments relate to administrative expenditure.\n(14)\nTaking into account the specificities of Union bodies, the acceptance of donations should be made subject to enhanced scrutiny. Moreover, Union bodies should not be able to use corporate sponsoring.\n(15)\nThe concept of performance should be clarified. Performance should be linked to the principle of sound financial management. The principle of sound financial management should be clarified. A link should be established between objectives set and performance indicators, results and economy, efficiency and effectiveness in the use of appropriations.\n(16)\nPursuant to Article 53 of Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2018/1046, the Union body has to take part in a benchmarking exercise with other Union bodies and with Union institutions.\n(17)\nIt is necessary to establish rules on the action plan to follow up on the conclusions of overall periodic evaluations in order to ensure their efficient implementation.\n(18)\nFor the purpose of ensuring consistent programming, the Union body should draw up a single programming document containing annual and multiannual programming, an estimate of its revenue and expenditure, resources programming, information on its building policy, a strategy for cooperation with third countries and/or international organisations, a strategy for achieving efficiency gains and synergies. The Union body should also draw up a strategy for operational management and internal control systems, including an anti-fraud strategy. The single programming document should take into account Commission guidelines.\n(19)\nThe programming document should include the strategy for preventing recurrence of cases of conflict of interest, irregularities and fraud, in particular where weaknesses have led to critical recommendations.\n(20)\nThe timetable for the single programming document should be aligned with the budgetary procedure to ensure its efficiency and consistency of all programming documents.\n(21)\nUnion bodies should adjust their internal control systems where they run offices away from the main seat.\n(22)\nIt is appropriate to provide for the possibility for Union bodies to conclude service-level agreements in accordance with Article 59 of Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2018/1046, in particular with each other and with Union institutions, in order to facilitate the implementation of their appropriations, when this is in line with sound financial management. Appropriate reporting on those service-level agreements should be ensured.\n(23)\nIt is necessary to clarify the architecture of the internal audit and internal control functions and to streamline reporting requirements. The internal audit function within a Union body should be performed by the Commission's internal auditor who should carry out audits when justified by the risks involved. It is necessary to provide rules on the establishment and functioning of internal audit capabilities.\n(24)\nReporting obligations should be streamlined. Union bodies should provide a consolidated annual activity report that includes comprehensive information on the achievement of objectives and results, the implementation of its work programme, budget, staff policy, and its operational management and internal control systems.\n(25)\nIn order to improve the cost-efficiency of Union bodies, it is necessary to provide for the possibility of sharing services or transferring them to another Union body or to the Commission. It is therefore necessary to allow the accounting officer of the Commission to be entrusted with all or part of the tasks of the accounting officer of the Union body.\n(26)\nIn order to align the rules on assigned revenue with those of Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2018/1046, it is necessary to provide for rules on a differentiation of internal and external assigned revenue and on their carry over.\n(27)\nIn order to align the rules on treatment of interest generated by the Union contribution to the Union body with those of Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2018/1046, it is necessary to provide that interest is not due to the budget.\n(28)\nRegulation (EU, Euratom) 2018/1046 provides for the possibility to enter a legal commitment before a budgetary commitment in specific cases. Union bodies should also have that possibility.\n(29)\nIn order to ensure consistency, specific provisions on procurement and grants should not be allowed. The application of a single set of rules ensures simplification of the Union body's work and enables the use of the guidelines and models prepared by the Commission.\n(30)\nThe Union body should have the possibility to award grants and prizes in accordance with the constituent act or by delegation of the Commission pursuant to Article 62(1)(c)(iv) of Regulation (EC) No 2018/1046.\n(31)\nIn addition to the forms of Union contribution already well established (reimbursement of the eligible costs actually incurred, unit cost, lump sums and flat-rate financing), it is appropriate to allow Union bodies to provide financing not linked to costs of the relevant operations. This additional form of financing should be based on the fulfilment of certain conditions ex ante or on the achievement of results measured by reference to previously set milestones or through performance indicators.\n(32)\nIn order to protect the financial interests of the Union, the rules on a single early-detection and exclusion system set up by Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2018/1046 should apply to Union bodies.\n(33)\nPursuant to Article 8(1) of Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 883/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council (4), EU bodies shall transmit to the European Anti-Fraud Office without delay any information relating to possible cases of fraud, corruption or any other illegal activity affecting the financial interests of the Union. Pursuant to Article 24(1) of Council Regulation (EU) 2017/1939 (5), Union bodies shall without undue delay report to the European Public Prosecutor's Office any criminal conduct in respect of which it could exercise its competence in accordance with that regulation. In order to strengthen the governance of Union bodies, they should also report cases of fraud, financial irregularities, as well as investigations, to the Commission without delay. The Commission and the Union bodies should put procedures in place that duly protect personal data and ensure the respect of the need-to-know principle in any transmission of information related to presumed fraud and other irregularities and on-going or completed investigations.\n(34)\nTo identify and correctly manage the risk of actual or perceived conflict of interests, Union bodies should be required to adopt rules on the prevention and management of conflict of interests. Such rules should take into account guidance developed by the Commission.\n(35)\nComprehensive access rights for the Commission, the European Anti-Fraud Office and the Court of Auditors should be spelled out in this Regulation.\n(36)\nThe provisions regarding building policy, including the possibility and conditions for Union bodies to finance building acquisition projects through loans, should be aligned with Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2018/1046 to ensure a consistent application of the rules by all Union bodies and institutions.\n(37)\nGiven that Delegated Regulation (EU) No 1268/2012 (6) has been repealed, the requirement for the EU body to adopt its own implementing rules with Commission's prior consent should also be deleted.\n(38)\nIt is necessary to provide for transitional provisions for programming and for the consolidated annual activity reporting given that the Commission needs time to develop the appropriate guidelines in cooperation with the Union bodies and the Union bodies need time to adapt to the new programming and reporting.\n(39)\nThis Regulation should enter into force on the day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union in order to allow for the timely adoption of the revised financial regulations by the Union bodies at the latest by 1 July 2019 and so that agencies benefit from the simplification and alignment with Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2018/1046.\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nTITLE I\nGENERAL PROVISIONS\nArticle 1\nSubject matter\nThis Regulation lays down the essential financial rules for bodies which are set up by the Union under the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union and the Treaty establishing the European Atomic Energy Community and which have legal personality and receive contributions charged to the Union budget (‘Union bodies’).\nOn the basis of this Regulation each Union body is to adopt its own financial rules. The Union body's financial rules shall not depart from this Regulation except where its specific needs so require and with the Commission's prior consent.\nArticle 2\nDefinitions\nFor the purposes of this Regulation, the following definitions shall apply:\n—\n‘constituent act’ means the instrument of Union law governing the main aspects of the setting up and operation of the Union body,\n—\n‘management board’ means the main internal body of the Union body that is responsible for taking decisions on financial and budgetary matters, irrespective of the name given to it in the constituent act,\n—\n‘director’ means the person responsible for implementing the decisions of the management board and the budget of the Union body as authorising officer, irrespective of the title given to that person in the constituent act,\n—\n‘executive board’ means the internal body of the Union body that assists the management board and whose responsibilities and rules of procedures are, in principle, set out in the constituent act irrespective of the name given to this body in the constituent act.\nArticle 2 of Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2018/1046 shall apply mutatis mutandis.\nArticle 3\nPeriods, dates and time limits\nUnless otherwise provided, Council Regulation (EEC, Euratom) No 1182/71 (7) shall apply to the deadlines set out in this Regulation.\nArticle 4\nProtection of personal data\nThis Regulation is without prejudice to the requirements of Regulations (EU) 2018/1725 (8) and (EU) 2016/679 (9).\nTITLE II\nBUDGET AND BUDGETARY PRINCIPLES\nArticle 5\nRespect for budgetary principles\nThe budget of the Union body shall be established and implemented in accordance with the principles of unity, budgetary accuracy, annuality, equilibrium, unit of account, universality, specification, sound financial management and transparency as set out in this Regulation.\nCHAPTER 1\nPRINCIPLES OF UNITY AND OF BUDGETARY ACCURACY\nArticle 6\nScope of the budget of the Union body\n1.   For each financial year, the budget of the Union body shall forecast and authorise all revenue and expenditure considered necessary for the Union body. It shall comprise the revenue and expenditure of the Union body, including administrative expenditure.\n2.   The budget of the Union body shall contain the following:\n(a)\nnon-differentiated appropriations;\n(b)\nwhere justified by operational needs, differentiated appropriations, which consist of commitment appropriations and payment appropriations.\n3.   The appropriations authorised for the financial year shall consist of:\n(a)\nappropriations consisting of the annual contribution granted by the Union;\n(b)\nappropriations arising from own revenue consisting of all fees and charges which the Union body is authorised to collect by virtue of the tasks entrusted to it, and any other revenue;\n(c)\nappropriations consisting of any financial contributions from the host Member States;\n(d)\nappropriations provided following the receipt of revenue assigned during the financial year to specific items of expenditure in accordance with Article 20(1);\n(e)\nappropriations carried over from the preceding financial years.\n4.   Revenue consisting of fees and charges shall only be assigned in exceptional and duly justified cases provided for in the constituent act.\n5.   Commitment appropriations shall cover the total cost of the legal commitments entered into during the financial year, subject to Article 75(2).\n6.   Payment appropriations shall cover payments made to honour the legal commitments entered into in the financial year or preceding financial years.\n7.   Paragraphs 3 and 5 of this Article shall not prevent appropriations being committed globally or budgetary commitments being made in annual instalments as respectively provided for in point (b) of Article 74(1) and in Article 74(2).\nArticle 7\nContribution agreements, grant agreements and financial framework partnerships\n1.   Contribution agreements and grant agreements may be exceptionally concluded between the Commission and a Union body provided that the following conditions are met:\n(a)\nthe constituent act of the Union body or a basic act expressly provides for such possibility;\n(b)\nthe conclusion of such an agreement is duly justified by the special nature of the action and specific expertise of the Union body;\n(c)\nthe tasks to be implemented by the Union body under the agreement satisfy the following criteria:\n(i)\nfall within the scope of the Union body's objectives and the tasks are compatible with the Union body's mandate as set out in the constituent act;\n(ii)\nthe tasks do not form part of the tasks assigned to the Union body in the constituent act and financed by the annual contribution granted to it by the Union.\n2.   Where contribution agreements and grant agreements referred in paragraph 1 and service-level agreements are concluded for services offered by the Union body to the Commission, the Commission may establish a financial framework partnership agreement with the Union body in line with Article 130 of Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2018/1046.\n3.   The choice by the Commission of the Union body shall take due account of the cost efficiency of entrusting those tasks.\n4.   Where the Commission exceptionally signs a contribution agreement with the Union body, the rules applicable to indirect management laid down in Titles V and VI of Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2018/1046 shall apply to the Union body in respect of funds allocated to that agreement and Articles 105 and 106 of this Regulation shall not apply.\n5.   The tasks referred to under paragraph 1 should be included in the Single Programming Document of the Union body, referred to in Article 32, for information purposes only. Information on the agreements referred to under paragraph 2 shall be included in the consolidated annual activity report referred to in Article 48.\n6.   The authorising officer shall inform the management board before signing any agreement referred to in paragraph 2.\nArticle 8\nSpecific rules on the principles of unity and budgetary accuracy\n1.   All revenue and expenditure shall be booked to a budget line in the budget of the Union body.\n2.   No expenditure may be committed or authorised in excess of the appropriations authorised by the budget of the Union body.\n3.   An appropriation may be entered in the budget of the Union body only if it is for an item of expenditure considered necessary.\n4.   Interest generated by pre-financing payments made from the budget of the Union body shall not be due to the Union body except as otherwise provided in the contribution agreements referred to in Article 7.\nCHAPTER 2\nPRINCIPLE OF ANNUALITY\nArticle 9\nDefinition\nThe appropriations entered in the budget of the Union body shall be authorised for a financial year that shall run from 1 January to 31 December.\nArticle 10\nBudgetary accounting for revenue and appropriations\n1.   The Union body's revenue of a financial year, as referred to in Article 6, shall be entered in the accounts for that financial year on the basis of the amounts collected during that financial year.\n2.   The revenue of the Union body shall give rise to an equivalent amount of payment appropriations.\n3.   Commitments shall be entered in the accounts for a financial year on the basis of the legal commitments entered into up to 31 December of that year. However, the global budgetary commitments referred to in point (b) of Article 74(1) shall be entered in the accounts for a financial year on the basis of the budgetary commitments up to 31 December of that year.\n4.   Payments shall be entered in the accounts for a financial year on the basis of the payments made by the accounting officer by 31 December of that year.\n5.   Where a constituent act provides that clearly defined tasks are financed separately or where the Union body implements agreements concluded in accordance with Article 7, the Union body shall have specific budget lines on the revenue and expenditure operations. The Union body shall clearly identify each group of tasks in its resource programming included in the single programming document drawn up pursuant to Article 32.\nArticle 11\nCommitment of appropriations\n1.   The appropriations entered in the budget of the Union body may be committed with effect from 1 January, once the budget of the Union body has been definitively adopted.\n2.   As of 15 October of the financial year, routine administrative expenditure may be committed in advance against the appropriations provided for the following financial year, provided that the expenditure has been approved in the last budget of the Union body duly adopted, and only up to a maximum of one quarter of the appropriations decided upon by the management board on the corresponding budget line for the current financial year.\nArticle 12\nCancellation and carry-over of appropriations\n1.   Appropriations which have not been used by the end of the financial year for which they were entered shall be cancelled, unless they are carried over in accordance with paragraphs 2 and 4.\n2.   The following appropriations may be carried over by a decision taken pursuant to paragraph 3, but only to the following financial year:\n(a)\ncommitment appropriations and non-differentiated appropriations, for which most of the preparatory stages of the commitment procedure have been completed by 31 December of the financial year. Such appropriations may be committed up to 31 March of the following financial year, with the exception of non-differentiated appropriations related to building projects which may be committed up to 31 December of the following financial year;\n(b)\npayment appropriations which are needed to cover existing commitments or commitments linked to commitment appropriations carried over, where the payment appropriations provided for in the relevant budget lines for the following financial year are insufficient.\nWith regard to point (b) of the first subparagraph, the Union body shall first use the appropriations authorised for the current financial year and shall not use the appropriations carried over until the former are exhausted.\n3.   The management board or, where the constituent act allows it, the executive board, shall take its decision on carry-overs as referred to in paragraph 2 by 15 February of the following financial year.\n4.   Appropriations shall be automatically carried over in respect of:\n(a)\nappropriations corresponding to internal assigned revenue. Such appropriations may be carried over only to the following financial year and may be committed up to 31 December of that year, with the exception of the internal assigned revenue from lettings and the sale of buildings and land referred to in point (e) of Article 20(3) which may be carried over until it is fully used;\n(b)\nappropriations corresponding to external assigned revenue. Such appropriations shall be fully used by the time all the operations relating to the programme or action to which they are assigned have been carried out or they may be carried over and used for the succeeding programme or action.\n5.   Appropriations for staff expenditure shall not be carried over. For the purposes of this Article, staff expenditure comprises remuneration and allowances for the staff of Union bodies who are subject to the Staff Regulations.\n6.   Non-differentiated appropriations legally committed by the end of the financial year shall be paid until the end of the following financial year.\nArticle 13\nDetailed provisions on cancellation and carryover of appropriations\n1.   The commitment appropriations and the non-differentiated appropriations referred to in point (a) of the first subparagraph of Article 12(2) may be carried over only if the commitments could not be made before 31 December of the financial year for reasons not attributable to the authorising officer and if the preparatory stages are sufficiently advanced to make it reasonable to expect that the commitment will be made by no later than 31 March of the following financial year, or, in relation to building projects, by 31 December of the following financial year.\n2.   Appropriations carried over in accordance with point (a) of Article 12(2) which have not been committed by 31 March of the following financial year or up to 31 December of the following year for amounts relating to building projects shall be automatically cancelled.\n3.   Appropriations carried over which have been cancelled shall be identified in the accounts.\nArticle 14\nDecommitment of appropriations\n1.   Where budgetary commitments are decommitted in any financial year after the year in which they were made as a result of total or partial non-implementation of the actions for which they were earmarked, the appropriations corresponding to such decommitments shall be cancelled.\n2.   This Article shall not apply to external assigned revenue referred to in Article 20(2).\nArticle 15\nRules applicable in the event of late adoption of the budget of the Union body\n1.   If the budget of the Union body has not been definitively adopted at the beginning of the financial year, the rules set out in paragraphs 2 to 6 shall apply.\n2.   Commitments may be made per chapter up to a maximum of one quarter of the total appropriations authorised in the relevant chapter of the budget of the Union body for the preceding financial year plus one-twelfth for each month that has elapsed.\nThe limit of the appropriations provided for in the statement of estimates of revenue and expenditure shall not be exceeded.\nPayments may be made monthly per chapter up to a maximum of one twelfth of the appropriations authorised in the relevant chapter of the budget of the Union body for the preceding financial year. However, that sum shall not exceed one twelfth of the appropriations provided for in the same chapter of the statement of estimates of revenue and expenditure.\n3.   The appropriations authorised in the relevant chapter of the budget of the Union body for the preceding financial year, as referred to in paragraph 2, shall be understood as referring to the appropriations voted in the budget of the Union body, including by amending budgets, and after adjustment for the transfers made during that financial year.\n4.   If the continuity of Union body action and management needs so require, the management board may, at the request of the director, authorise expenditure in excess of one provisional twelfth but not exceeding a total of four provisional twelfths, except in duly justified cases, both for commitments and for payments over and above those automatically made available in accordance with paragraph 2.\nThe additional twelfths shall be authorised in full and shall not be divisible.\n5.   If, for a given chapter, the authorisation of four provisional twelfths granted in accordance with paragraph 4 is not sufficient to cover the expenditure necessary to avoid a break in continuity of action by the Union body in the area covered by the chapter in question, authorisation may exceptionally be given by the management board, at the request of the director, to exceed the amount of the appropriations entered in the corresponding chapter of the budget of the Union body for the preceding financial year. However, the overall total of the appropriations available in the budget of the Union body of the preceding financial year or in the statement of estimates of revenue and expenditure, as proposed, shall in no circumstances be exceeded.\nCHAPTER 3\nPRINCIPLE OF EQUILIBRIUM\nArticle 16\nDefinition and scope\n1.   Revenue and payment appropriations shall be in balance.\n2.   Commitment appropriations may not exceed the amount of the Union contribution, plus own revenue and any other revenue referred to in Article 6.\n3.   For bodies for which the revenue is constituted by fees and charges in addition to the Union contribution, fees should be set at a level such as to avoid a significant accumulation of surplus. Where a significant positive or negative budget result, within the meaning of Article 99, becomes recurrent, the level of the fees and charges shall be revised.\n4.   The Union body shall not raise loans within the framework of the budget of the Union body.\n5.   The Union contribution to the Union body shall constitute for the budget of the Union body a balancing contribution and may be divided into a number of payments.\n6.   The Union body shall implement rigorous cash management, taking due account of assigned revenue, in order to ensure that its cash balances are limited to duly justified requirements. With its payment requests it shall submit detailed and updated forecasts on its real cash requirements throughout the year, including information on assigned revenue.\nArticle 17\nBalance from financial year\n1.   If the budget result within the meaning of Article 99 is positive, it shall be repaid to the Commission up to the amount of the contribution paid during the year. The part of the budget result exceeding the amount of the Union contribution paid during the year shall be entered in the budget of the Union body for the following financial year as revenue.\nThe first subparagraph shall also apply when the revenue of the Union body is constituted by fees and charges in addition to the Union contribution.\nThe difference between the contribution entered in the budget and that actually paid to the Union body shall be cancelled.\n2.   In exceptional cases, where the constituent act provides that the revenues arising from fees and charges are assigned to particular items of expenditure, the Union body may carry-over the balance of fees and charges as assigned revenue for the activities related to the provision of the services for which the fees are due.\n3.   If the budget result within the meaning of Article 99 is negative, it shall be entered in the budget of the Union body for the following financial year as payment appropriations or, where appropriate, offset against positive budget result of the Union body in the following financial years.\nWhere the fees and charges are assigned revenue the negative result related to this assigned revenue can be offset against the accumulated surplus from previous years, if available.\n4.   The revenue or payment appropriations shall be entered in the budget of the Union body during the budgetary procedure using the letter of amendment procedure set out in Article 42 of Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2018/1046 or, while implementation of the budget of the Union body is under way, by means of an amending budget.\nAn estimate of the budget result from year N – 1 will be provided by the Union body no later than 31 January of the year N. This information shall be duly taken into account by the Commission when assessing the financial needs of the Union body for the year N + 1.\nCHAPTER 4\nPRINCIPLE OF UNIT OF ACCOUNT\nArticle 18\nUse of euro\n1.   The budget shall be drawn up and implemented in euro and the accounts shall be presented in euro. However, for the cash-flow purposes referred to in Article 49, the accounting officer and, in the case of imprest accounts, the imprest administrators, and, for the needs of the administrative management of the Union body, the authorising officer responsible, shall be authorised to carry out operations in other currencies.\n2.   Without prejudice to specific provisions laid down in sector-specific rules, or in specific contracts, grant agreements, contribution agreements and financing agreements, conversion by the authorising officer responsible shall be made using the daily euro exchange rate published in the C series of the Official Journal of the European Union of the day on which the payment order or recovery order is drawn up by the authorising department.\nIf no such daily rate is published, the authorising officer responsible shall use the one referred to in paragraph 3.\n3.   For the purposes of the accounts provided for in Articles 82, 83 and 84 of Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2018/1046 conversion between the euro and another currency shall be made using the monthly accounting exchange rate of the euro. That accounting exchange rate shall be established by the accounting officer of the Commission by means of any source of information regarded as reliable, based on the exchange rate on the penultimate working day of the month preceding that for which the rate is established.\n4.   Currency conversion operations shall be carried out in such a way as to avoid having a significant impact on the level of the Union co-financing or a detrimental impact on the budget. Where appropriate, the rate of conversion between the euro and other currencies may be calculated using the average of the daily exchange rate in a given period.\nCHAPTER 5\nPRINCIPLE OF UNIVERSALITY\nArticle 19\nScope\nWithout prejudice to Article 20, total revenue shall cover total payment appropriations. Without prejudice to Article 24, all revenue and expenditure shall be entered in full without any adjustment against each other.\nArticle 20\nAssigned revenue\n1.   External assigned revenue and internal assigned revenue shall be used to finance specific items of expenditure.\n2.

They shall also take appropriate measures to prevent a conflict of interest from arising in the functions under their responsibility and to address situations which may objectively be perceived as a conflict of interest.\nWhere there is a risk of a conflict of interest, the person in question shall refer the matter to the competent authority. The competent authority shall confirm in writing, whether a conflict of interest is found to exist. In that case, the competent authority shall ensure that the person concerned ceases all activities in the matter. The competent authority shall take any further appropriate action.\n2.

The authorising officer shall put in place the organisational structure and the internal control systems suited to the performance of the duties of authorising officer, in accordance with the minimum standards or principles adopted by the management board or, where the constituent act allows it, by the executive board, on the basis of the Internal Control Framework laid down by the Commission for its own departments and having due regard to the risks associated with the management environment, including where applicable specific risks associated to decentralized offices, and the nature of the actions financed.\nThe establishment of such structure and systems shall be supported by a comprehensive risk analysis, which takes into account their cost-effectiveness and performance considerations.\nThe authorising officer may establish within his or her departments an expertise and advice function to help him or her control the risks involved in his or her activities.\n3.   To implement expenditure, the authorising officer shall make budgetary and legal commitments, shall validate expenditure and authorise payments and shall undertake the preliminary steps for the implementation of appropriations.\n4.   To implement revenue, the authorising officer shall draw up estimates of amounts receivable, establish entitlements to be recovered and issue recovery orders.

In order to prevent errors and irregularities before the authorization of operations and to mitigate risks of non-achievement of objectives, each operation shall be subject at least to an ex ante control relating to the operational and financial aspects of the operation, on the basis of a control strategy which takes risk and cost-effectiveness into account.\nThe extent in terms of frequency and intensity of the ex ante controls shall be determined by the authorising officer taking into account the results of prior controls as well as risk-based and cost-effectiveness considerations, on the basis of his or her own risk analysis. In case of doubt, the authorising officer responsible for validating the relevant operations shall, as part of the ex ante control, request complementary information or perform an on-the-spot control in order to obtain reasonable assurance.\n6.   For the purpose of controls, a series of similar individual transactions relating to routine expenditure on salaries, pensions, reimbursement of mission expenses and medical expenses may be considered by the authorising officer to constitute a single operation.\n7.   For a given operation, the verification shall be carried out by staff other than those who initiated the operation. The staff who carry out the verification shall not be subordinate to the members of staff who initiated the operation.\n8.   The authorising officer may put in place ex post controls to detect and correct errors and irregularities of operations after they have been authorized. Such controls may be organised on a sample basis according to risk and shall take account of the results of prior controls as well as cost-effectiveness and performance considerations.\n9.   The ex post controls shall be carried out by staff other than those responsible for the ex ante controls. The staff responsible for the ex post controls shall not be subordinate to the members of staff responsible for the ex ante controls.\nThe ex post controls may take the form of financial audits at the premises of the beneficiaries.\nThe rules and modalities, including timeframes, for carrying out audits of the beneficiaries shall be clear, consistent and transparent, and shall be made available when signing the grant agreement.\n10.   Authorising officers and staff responsible for budget implementation shall have the necessary professional skills. They shall respect a specific code of professional standards adopted by the Union body and based on standards laid down by the Commission for its own departments.\n11.   If a member of staff, involved in the financial management and control of transactions, considers that a decision he or she is required by his or her superior to apply or to agree to is irregular or contrary to the principles of sound financial management or the professional rules which that member of staff is required to observe, he or she shall inform the director who shall, if the information is given in writing, reply in writing. If the director fails to take action within a reasonable time given the circumstances of the case and in any event within a month or confirms the initial decision or instruction and the member of staff believes that such confirmation does not constitute a reasonable response to his or her concern, the member of staff shall inform the relevant panel referred to in Article 143 of Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2018/1046 and the management board in writing.\n12.

These bodies are mostly decentralised agencies* (also referred as regulatory agencies) set up under the EU treaties, and have legal personality and receive EU funds. In order to fall under this European Commission delegated regulation, the regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council of the European Union setting up the EU body in question must refer to Article 70 of the financial regulation.\nEach such EU body must adopt its own financial rules in line with the Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2019/715. It may only depart from the rules of the delegated regulation because of its specific needs and if it has received prior consent from the Commission.\nKEY POINTS\n              \nEach EU body falling under this Commission delegated regulation must respect the following budgetary principles.\nUnity and budgetary accuracy:\neach financial year, the body’s budget must forecast and authorise all revenue and expenditure necessary for its work;\nall revenue and expenditure must be booked to a budget line;\nno expenditure can be greater than the amount authorised in the budget.\nAnnuality:\nthe budget’s financial year runs from 1 January to 31 December;\nspecific rules cover the treatment of commitment* and payment* appropriations;\nif the budget has not been adopted by the beginning of the financial year, monthly payments are capped at one twelfth of the corresponding sums in the previous year’s budget.\nEquilibrium:\nrevenue and payment appropriations must be in balance;\nthe body may not raise loans within its budget;\nunspent finance received from the EU budget should be repaid to the Commission.\nUnit of account:\nthe budget is drawn up and implemented in euro, as is the presentation of the accounts;\nrules state how other currencies are to be converted into euro.\nUniversality:\ntotal revenue must cover total payments;\nall revenue and expenditure must be entered in full without any adjustment against each other;\nspecific rules apply to revenue, depending on whether it is generated externally or internally.\nSpecification:\nappropriations are earmarked for specific purposes by budgetary title, chapter, article and line;\nthe director may transfer appropriations from one budget title or chapter to another, subject to certain conditions.\nSound financial management and performance:\npayments must respect the principles of economy, efficiency and effectiveness;\npayments focus on performance, based on objectives for programmes and activities, and indicators to measure progress made;\nbenchmarking includes a review of the efficiency of the body’s horizontal services and a cost–benefit analysis of sharing or transferring services to another body or the Commission;\nprogrammes and activities involving significant spending are subject to ex ante (based on forecast) and ex post (based on final outcome) evaluations.\nInternal control of budget implementation:\napplies at all management levels;\naims to achieve reasonable assurance of: effectiveness, efficiency and economy of operations,reliability of reporting,safeguard of assets and information,prevention, detection, correction and follow-up of fraud and irregularities,adequate management of risks of underlying transactions.\nTransparency:\na summary of the body’s budget, and any amending budget, is published in the Official Journal of the European Union within 3 months of adoption;\nthe body publishes on its website the budget, establishment plan and details of staff numbers and seconded national experts, and transmits the information to the European Parliament, Council, European Court of Auditors and Commission within 4 weeks of adoption;\nthe body provides details on its website of the recipients of EU funding;\nin the context of conflicts of interest, the body publishes annually on its website the management board members’ declarations of interest.\nRules on establishing and structuring the budget state.\nThe body sends the Commission, the European Parliament and the Council a draft single programming document by 31 January every year. This contains information ranging from work programmes and budgetary estimates to building policy details.\nThe Commission, after input from the European Parliament and the Council, adopts the draft budget. This becomes definitive once the overall EU budget is adopted.\nThe body’s budget must contain separate revenue and expenditure statements and details on staff numbers.\nThe regulation states that:\nthe duties of the authorising and accounting officers are segregated and mutually exclusive, with each having the necessary resources to carry out their duties;\nthe director performs the authorising officer’s duties, which include: implementing revenue and expenditure according to the principle of sound financial management,putting in place the organisational structure and internal controls,applying ex ante and possibly ex post controls,using paper-based or electronic systems to keep original budgetary supporting documents for at least 5 years,reporting to the management board by submitting a detailed consolidated annual activity report;\nthe management board appoints an independent accounting officer, responsible for: properly implementing payments, collecting revenue and recovering amounts due,preparing, presenting and keeping the accounts,laying down and validating the accounting systems, including those of the authorising officer, when appropriate.\nThe following expenditure rules apply:\nevery item must be committed, validated, authorised and paid;\nbudgetary commitments fall into one of three categories: individual, when the recipient and amount are known,global, if either the recipient or amount is not known,provisional, to cover routine administrative expenditure when either the amount or final payee is unknown;\ncommitments are subject to time limits;\npayments require proof that the relevant action complies with the contract.\nThe EU body must have an internal audit function.

These can range from the reimbursement of eligible costs to flat-rate financing.\nThe EU body must inform the Commission without delay of cases of presumed fraud or other financial irregularities, any completed or ongoing investigations by the European Public Prosecutor’s Office or European Anti-Fraud Office and any audits or controls by the Court of Auditors and the Internal Audit Service, without endangering the investigations’ confidentiality.\nAnnual accounting rules require the EU body to provide its financial statements, budget implementation reports and supporting documents.\nThe Court of Auditors, an independent external auditor, the Commission, Council and European Parliament all examine how the budget was implemented before Members of the European Parliament approve, or reject, the annual accounts (known as ‘the discharge procedure’).\nCommission staff and the Court of Auditors have access to the EU body’s sites, premises and data to carry out audits. The European Anti-Fraud Office may conduct investigations, on-the-spot checks and inspections.\nThe regulation repeals Delegated Regulation (EU) No 1271/2013, which provided the former financial regulation framework.\nFROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?\n              \nIt entered into force on 11 May 2019 but it has applied retroactively since 1 January 2019, apart from Article 32 (single programming document) and Article 48 (consolidated annual activity report), which have applied since 1 January 2020.\nBACKGROUND\nRegulation (EU, Euratom) 2018/1046 is the EU’s financial regulation.
