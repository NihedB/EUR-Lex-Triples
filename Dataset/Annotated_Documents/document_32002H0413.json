These activities therefore contribute to integrated coastal zone management.(11) The Commission notes in its Communications(4) to the Council and the European Parliament that integrated management of the coastal zone requires strategic, coordinated and concerted action at the local and regional level, guided and supported by an appropriate framework at the national level.(12) The Commission's demonstration programme on integrated coastal zone management identifies principles of good coastal zone management.(13) There is a need to ensure coherent action a at European level, including cooperative action and consultation with regional seas organisations or international organisations, such as the International Maritime Organisation, to address cross-border coastal zone problems.(14) Council Resolution of 6 May 1994 on a Community strategy for integrated coastal zone management(5) and Council Resolution of 25 February 1992 on the future Community policy concerning the European coastal zone(6) both identify the need for concerted European action to implement integrated coastal zone management.(15) Since the Resolution of 6 May 1994 the European Union has experienced an increase in pressure on coastal resources, an increase in coastal population and an increase in near-shore and on-shore infrastructure.(16) An integrated coastal zone management involves multiple factors among which town and country planning and land use are only accessorily concerned.(17) In accordance with the subsidiarity and proportionality principles as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty, and with Protocol 7 to the Treaty of Amsterdam on the implementation of subsidiarity and proportionality, and given the diversity of conditions in the coastal zones and the legal and institutional frameworks in the Member States, the objectives of the proposed action can best be achieved by guidance at the Community level,HEREBY RECOMMEND THE FOLLOWING:CHAPTER IA strategic approachMember States take into account the sustainable development strategy and the Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council laying down the sixth Community environment action programme(7), and take a strategic approach to the management of their coastal zones, based on:(a) protection of the coastal environment, based on an ecosystem approach preserving its integrity and functioning, and sustainable management of the natural resources of both the marine and terrestrial components of the coastal zone;(b) recognition of the threat to coastal zones posed by climate change and of the dangers entailed by the rise in sea level and the increasing frequency and violence of storms;(c) appropriate and ecologically responsible coastal protection measures, including protection of coastal settlements and their cultural heritage;(d) sustainable economic opportunities and employment options;(e) a functioning social and cultural system in local communities;(f) adequate accessible land for the public, both for recreational purposes and aesthetic reasons;(g) in the case of remote coastal communities, maintenance or promotion of their cohesion;(h) improved coordination of the actions taken by all the authorities concerned both at sea and on land, in managing the sea-land interaction.CHAPTER IIPrinciplesIn formulating national strategies and measures based on these strategies, Member States should follow the principles of integrated coastal zone management to ensure good coastal zone management, taking into account the good practices identified, inter alia, in the Commission's demonstration programme on integrated coastal zone management. In particular, coastal zone management should be based on:(a) a broad overall perspective (thematic and geographic) which will take into account the interdependence and disparity of natural systems and human activities with an impact on coastal areas;(b) a long-term perspective which will take into account the precautionary principle and the needs of present and future generations;(c) adaptive management during a gradual process which will facilitate adjustment as problems and knowledge develop. This implies the need for a sound scientific basis concerning the evolution of the coastal zone;(d) local specificity and the great diversity of European coastal zones, which will make it possible to respond to their practical needs with specific solutions and flexible measures;(e) working with natural processes and respecting the carrying capacity of ecosystems, which will make human activities more environmentally friendly, socially responsible and economically sound in the long run;(f) involving all the parties concerned (economic and social partners, the organisations representing coastal zone residents, non-governmental organisations and the business sector) in the management process, for example by means of agreements and based on shared responsibility;(g) support and involvement of relevant administrative bodies at national, regional and local level between which appropriate links should be established or maintained with the aim of improved coordination of the various existing policies. Partnership with and between regional and local authorities should apply when appropriate;(h) use of a combination of instruments designed to facilitate coherence between sectoral policy objectives and coherence between planning and management.CHAPTER IIINational stocktakingMember States conduct or update an overall stocktaking to analyse which major actors, laws and institutions influence the management of their coastal zone. This stocktaking should:(a) consider (but not be limited to) the following sectors and areas: fisheries and aquaculture, transport, energy, resource management, species and habitat protection, cultural heritage, employment, regional development in both rural and urban areas, tourism and recreation, industry and mining, waste management, agriculture and education;(b) cover all administrative levels;(c) analyse the interests, role and concerns of citizens, non-governmental organisations, and the business sector;(d) identify relevant inter-regional organisations and cooperation structures, and(e) take stock of the applicable policy and legislative measures.CHAPTER IVNational strategies1. Based on the result of the stocktaking, each Member State concerned, in partnership with the regional authorities and inter-regional organisations, as appropriate, should develop a national strategy or, where appropriate, several strategies, to implement the principles for integrated management of the coastal zone.2. These strategies might be specific to the coastal zone, or might be part of a geographically broader strategy or programme for promoting integrated management of a larger area.3. These strategies should:(a) identify the roles of the different administrative actors within the country or region whose competence includes activities or resources related to the coastal zone, as well as mechanisms for their coordination. This identification of roles should allow an adequate control, and an appropriate strategy and consistency of actions;(b) identify the appropriate mix of instruments for implementation of the principles outlined in Chapter II, within the national, regional or local legal and administrative context. In developing these strategies, the Member States should consider the appropriateness of:(i) developing national strategic plans for the coast to promote integrated management ensuring, inter alia, the control of additional urbanisation and of the exploitation of non-urban areas while respecting natural features of the coastal environment;(ii) land purchase mechanisms and declarations of public domain to ensure public access for recreational purposes without prejudice to the protection of sensitive areas;(iii) developing contractual or voluntary agreements with coastal zone users, including environmental agreements with industry;(iv) harnessing economic and fiscal incentives, and(v) working through regional development mechanisms;(c) develop or maintain national and, where appropriate, regional or local legislation or policies and programmes which address both the marine and terrestrial areas of coastal zones together;(d) particularly, identify measures to promote bottom-up initiatives and public participation in integrated management of the coastal zone and its resources;(e) identify sources of durable financing for integrated coastal zone management initiatives where needed, and examine how to make the best use of existing financing mechanisms both at Community and at national level;(f) identify mechanisms to ensure full and coordinated implementation and application of Community legislation and policies that have an impact on coastal areas, including when reviewing Community policies;(g) include adequate systems for monitoring and disseminating information to the public about their coastal zone. These systems should collect and provide information in appropriate and compatible formats to decision makers at national, regional and local levels to facilitate integrated management. The work of the European Environment Agency can serve inter alia as a basis for this purpose. These data should be publicly available in accordance with relevant Community legislation, in particular with the Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on public access to environmental information and repealing Council Directive 90/313/EEC(8);(h) determine how appropriate national training and education programmes can support implementation of integrated management principles in the coastal zone.CHAPTER VCooperation1. Member States should encourage, enter into or maintain dialogue and implement existing conventions with neighbouring countries, including non-Member States in the same regional sea, to establish mechanisms for better coordination of responses to cross-border issues.2. Member States also work actively with the Community institutions and other coastal stakeholders to facilitate progress towards a common approach to integrated coastal zone management, examining the need for a European coastal stakeholders forum. In this process, ways of using existing institutions and conventions should be explored.3. In this context, cooperation with the accession countries is maintained and enhanced.CHAPTER VIReporting and review1. Member States report to the Commission on the experience in implementation of this Recommendation 45 months after its adoption.2. These reports are available to the public and include, in particular, information concerning:(a) the results of the national stocktaking exercise;(b) the strategy or strategies proposed at the national level for implementation of integrated coastal zone management;(c) a summary of actions taken, or to be taken, to implement the national strategy or strategies;(d) an evaluation of the expected impact of the strategy or strategies on the status of the coastal zone;(e) an evaluation of the implementation and application of Community legislation and policies that have an impact on coastal areas.3. The Commission should review this Recommendation within 55 months following the date of its adoption and submit to the European Parliament and the Council an evaluation report accompanied if appropriate by a proposal for further Community action.Done at Brussels, 30 May 2002.For the European ParliamentThe PresidentP.

To that end, it lays the foundations for such an approach based on the protection of the coastal area, its economic and socio-cultural development and on coordination. It also recommends a series of principles, a national stocktaking exercise and a national strategy.\nACT\nRecommendation 2002/413/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 30 May 2002 concerning the implementation of Integrated Coastal Zone Management in Europe [Official Journal L 148 of 06.06.2002].\nSUMMARY\nOn account of the importance of coastal zones to Europe, the European Union (EU) recommends that the Member States take a strategic approach to their management. This must be based on:\nprotection of the coastal environment;\nrecognition of the threat posed by climate change;\nthe implementation of coastal protection measures including protection of coastal settlements and their cultural heritage;\nsustainable economic opportunities and employment options;\na functioning social and cultural system;\naccessible land for recreational purposes and aesthetic reasons;\nthe cohesion of remote coastal communities;\nimproved coordination of measures.\nA deeper analysis of the problems associated with the management of coastal zones can be found in a Commission Communication of 2000 - COM(2000) 547 final. As in the Communication, the recommendation underlines the importance of following a number of principles in managing coastal zones. This entails taking a broad overall perspective (thematic and geographic) in the long term which takes into account distinctive local features and is based on adaptive management making adjustment easier. Turning to actors, all the parties concerned must be involved and supported by relevant administrative bodies at the different levels. Lastly, in terms of instruments, use of a combination of several should facilitate coherence.\nAt the same time, the EU recommends that Member States undertake a national stocktaking to identify the main actors, laws and institutions involved in the management of coastal zones across all sectors and levels. A national strategy should then be proposed.\nThe Union considers that these strategies could be specific to the coastal zones or be part of a geographically broader plan. In any case, the national strategy (ies) should identify and determine all aspects concerning the actors, the instruments, the resources and the dissemination of information. To be more exact, they should determine the role of the administrative actors and their coordination to allow adequate control and consistency of the actions, and to strengthen the laws governing both the marine and on-shore areas of coastal zones. In addition, measures to promote public participation in management and sources of sustainable financing must be identified.\nOn the matter of instruments, in developing their strategies the Member States should consider the advantages of:\nnational strategic plans for ensuring the control of any additional land-use planning and the exploitation of non-urban areas which should respect the natural characteristics of the coastal environment;\nland purchase mechanisms and declarations of public domain to ensure public access to recreational areas without prejudice to the protection of sensitive areas;\ncontractual or voluntary agreements with coastal zone users;\nharnessing economic and fiscal incentives;\napplying regional development mechanisms.\nLastly, the strategies should also identify mechanisms to ensure full and coordinated implementation and application of legislation in the field and adequate systems for monitoring and disseminating information to the public. It would be advisable also to study how national training and education programmes could support the implementation of the above principles.\nWith the aim of resolving cross-border problems, the recommendation advises cooperation with neighbouring countries, including non-member countries in the same regional sea. Cooperation between the Member States and the Community institutions and other interest groups is also necessary to assess the need to set up a European coastal interest groups forum.\nFor 2006, the recommendation provides that the Member States must present to the Commission a report with, among other things, the results of the national stocktaking exercise, the national strategy, a summary of the actions taken and an evaluation.\nRELATED ACTS\nCommission Report of 7 June 2007 on the evaluation of Integrated Coastal Zone Management (ICZM) in Europe [COM(2007) 308 final - Official Journal C 191 of 17.8.2007].\nThe Commission stresses the recommendation's positive effects. Most coastal Member States have adopted management strategies for coastal zones, but they will have to make a constant effort - particularly regarding financing and indicators - to implement the strategies. The priorities for the promotion of coastal zone management lie in adapting to climate change and risks and the management of various interests related to coastal and marine zones. The Commission also acts as coordinator to ensure coherence and synergy between coastal zone instruments and policies.\nLast updated: 01.10.2007", "tags": ["environmental protection", "coastal region", "integrated development programme", "town and country planning", "sustainable development"], "subjects": ["Environment"], "split": "train", "reference_annotations": {}, "summary_annotations": {}}
