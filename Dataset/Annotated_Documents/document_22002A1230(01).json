For the purpose of this Article, systematic failure to provide administrative cooperation shall mean:(a) the absence of administrative cooperation, such as a failure to provide names and addresses of customs or government authorities responsible for issuing and checking certificates of origin, or specimens of stamps used to authenticate the certificates, or a failure to update that information where appropriate;(b) a systematic lack or inadequacy of action in verifying the originating status of products and the fulfilment of the other requirements of Annex III and identifying or preventing contravention of the rules of origin;(c) a systematic refusal or undue delay to carry out subsequent verification of the proof of origin at the request of the other Party, and to communicate its results in time;(d) the absence or systematic lack of administrative cooperation in verifying conduct where there is a presumption of origin-related fraud.

Where such authorisation is required, a decision shall be taken within a reasonable period of time and the authorisation may only be refused for prudential reasons.Article 122Data processing in the financial services sector1. Each Party shall permit a financial service supplier of the other Party to transfer information in electronic or other form, into and out of its territory, for data processing where such processing is required in the ordinary course of business of such financial service supplier.2.

Each Party shall make its best endeavours to implement and apply in its territory internationally agreed standards for regulation and supervision in the financial services sector and for the fight against money laundering. For this purpose, the Parties shall cooperate and exchange information and experience within the Special Committee on Financial Services referred to in Article 127.Article 124Confidential informationNothing in this Chapter:(a) shall require any of the Parties to provide confidential information, the disclosure of which would impede law enforcement, or otherwise be contrary to the public interest, or which would prejudice legitimate commercial interests of particular enterprises, public or private;(b) shall be construed to require a Party to disclose information relating to the financial affairs and accounts of individual customers of financial service suppliers, or any confidential or proprietary information in the possession of public entities.Article 125Prudential carve-out1. Nothing in this Chapter shall be construed to prevent a Party from adopting or maintaining reasonable measures for prudential reasons, such as:(a) the protection of investors, depositors, financial market participants, policy-holders, or persons to whom a fiduciary duty is owed by a financial services supplier;(b) the maintenance of the safety, soundness, integrity or financial responsibility of financial services suppliers; and(c) ensuring the integrity and stability of a Party's financial system.2. Where such measures do not conform with the provisions of this Chapter, they shall not be used as a means of avoiding the Party's commitments or obligations under the Chapter.Article 126Recognition1. A Party may recognise prudential measures of the other Party in determining how the Party's measures relating to financial services shall be applied. Such recognition, which may be achieved through harmonisation or otherwise, may be based upon an agreement or arrangement or may be accorded autonomously.2. A Party that is a party to an agreement or arrangement with a third party such as those referred to in paragraph 1, whether future or existing, shall afford adequate opportunity for the other Party to negotiate its accession to such agreements or arrangements, or to negotiate comparable ones with it, under circumstances in which there would be equivalent regulation, oversight, implementation of such regulation, and, if appropriate, procedures concerning the sharing of information between the Parties to the agreement or arrangement. Where a Party accords recognition autonomously, it shall afford adequate opportunity for the other Party to demonstrate that such circumstances exist.Article 127Special Committee on Financial Services1.

The provision of such information may be subject to the terms, conditions and limitations contained in the other Party's relevant law or to the requirement of a prior agreement or arrangement between the respective financial authorities.Article 129Specific provisions on dispute settlement1.

With respect to any laws, regulations, procedures and practices regarding government procurement covered by this Title, each Party shall grant the goods, services and suppliers of the other Party a treatment no less favourable than that accorded by it to domestic goods, services and suppliers.3.

Entities shall award their public contracts by open or selective tendering procedures according to their national procedures, in compliance with this Title and in a non-discriminatory manner.2. For the purposes of this Title:(a) open tendering procedures are those procedures whereby any interested supplier may submit a tender.(b) selective tendering procedures are those procedures whereby, consistent with Article 144 and other relevant provisions of this Title, only suppliers satisfying qualification requirements established by the entities are invited to submit a tender.3. However, in the specific cases and only under the conditions laid down in Article 145, entities may use a procedure other than the open or selective tendering procedures referred to in paragraph 1 of that Article, in which case the entities may choose not to publish a notice of intended procurement, and may consult the suppliers of their choice and negotiate the terms of contract with one or more of these.4. Entities shall treat tenders in confidence. In particular, they shall not provide information intended to assist particular participants to bring their tenders up to the level of other participants.Article 144Selective tendering1. In selective tendering, entities may limit the number of qualified suppliers they will invite to tender, consistent with the efficient operation of the procurement process, provided that they select the maximum number of domestic suppliers and suppliers of the other Party, and that they make the selection in a fair and non-discriminatory manner and on the basis of the criteria indicated in the notice of intended procurement or in tender documents.2. Entities maintaining permanent lists of qualified suppliers may select suppliers to be invited to tender from among those listed, under the conditions of Article 146(7). Any selection shall allow for equitable opportunities for suppliers on the lists.Article 145Other procedures1. Provided that the tendering procedure is not used to avoid maximum possible competition or to protect domestic suppliers, entities shall be allowed to award contracts by means other than an open or selective tendering procedure in the following circumstances and subject to the following conditions, where applicable:(a) when no suitable tenders or request to participate have been submitted in response to a prior procurement, on condition that the requirements of the initial procurement are not substantially modified;(b) when, for technical or artistic reasons, or for reasons connected with protection of exclusive rights, the contract may be performed only by a particular supplier and no reasonable alternative or substitute exists;(c) for reasons of extreme urgency brought about by events unforeseeable by the entity, the goods or services could not be obtained in time by means of open or selective tendering procedures;(d) for additional deliveries of goods or services by the original supplier where a change of supplier would compel the entity to procure equipment or services not meeting requirements of interchangeability with already existing equipment, software or services;(e) when an entity procures prototypes or a first product or service which are developed at its request in the course of, and for, a particular contract for research, experiment, study or original development;(f) when additional services which were not included in the initial contract but which were within the objectives of the original tender documentation have, through unforeseeable circumstances, become necessary to complete the services described therein. However, the total value of contracts awarded for the additional construction services may not exceed 50 % of the amount of the main contract;(g) for new services consisting of the repetition of similar services and for which the entity has indicated, in the notice concerning the initial service, that tendering procedures other than open or selective might be used in awarding contracts for such new services;(h) in the case of contracts awarded to the winner of a design contest, provided that the contest has been organised in a manner which is consistent with the principles of this Title; in case of several successful candidates, all successful candidates shall be invited to participate in the negotiations; and(i) for quoted goods purchased on a commodity market and for purchases of goods made under exceptionally advantageous conditions which only arise in the very short term in the case of unusual disposals and not for routine purchases from regular suppliers.2. The Parties shall ensure that, whenever it is necessary for entities to resort to a procedure other than the open or selective tendering procedures based on the circumstances set forth in paragraph 1, the entities shall maintain a record or prepare a written report providing specific justification for the contract awarded under that paragraph.Article 146Qualification of suppliers1. Any conditions for participation in procurement shall be limited to those that are essential to ensure that the potential supplier has the capability to fulfil the requirements of the procurement and the ability to execute the contract in question.2. In the process of qualifying suppliers, entities shall not discriminate between domestic suppliers and suppliers of the other Party.3. A Party shall not impose the condition that, in order for a supplier to participate in a procurement, the supplier has previously been awarded one or more contracts by an entity of that Party or that the supplier has prior work experience in the territory of that Party.4. Entities shall recognise as qualified suppliers all suppliers who meet the conditions for participation in a particular intended procurement. Entities shall base their qualification decisions solely on the conditions for participation that have been specified in advance in notices or tender documentation.5. Nothing in this Title shall preclude the exclusion of any supplier on grounds such as bankruptcy or false declarations or conviction for serious crime such as participation in criminal organisations.6. Entities shall promptly communicate to suppliers that have applied for qualification their decision on whether or not they qualify.Permanent lists of qualified suppliers7. Entities may establish permanent lists of qualified suppliers provided that the following rules are respected:(a) entities establishing permanent lists shall ensure that suppliers may apply for qualification at any time.(b) any supplier having requested to become a qualified supplier shall be notified by the entities concerned of the decision in this regard.(c) suppliers requesting to participate in a given intended procurement who are not on the permanent list of qualified suppliers shall be given the possibility to participate in the procurement by presenting the equivalent certifications and other means of proof requested from suppliers who are on the list.(d) when an entity operating in the utilities sector uses a notice on the existence of a permanent list as a notice of intended procurement, as provided in Article 147(7), suppliers requesting to participate who are not on the permanent list of qualified suppliers shall also be considered for the procurement, provided there is sufficient time to complete the qualification procedure; in this event, the procuring entity shall promptly start procedures for qualification and the process of, and the time required for, qualifying suppliers shall not be used in order to keep suppliers of other Parties off the suppliers' list.Article 147Publication of noticesGeneral provisions1. Each Party shall ensure that its entities provide for effective dissemination of the tendering opportunities generated by the relevant government procurement processes, providing suppliers of the other Party with all the information required to take part in such procurement.2. For each contract covered by this Title, except as set out in Articles 143(3) and 145, entities shall publish in advance a notice inviting interested suppliers to submit tenders, or where appropriate, requests for participation for that contract.3. The information in each notice of intended procurement shall include at least the following:(a) name, address, telefax number, electronic address of the entity and, if different, the address where all documents relating to the procurement may be obtained;(b) the tendering procedure chosen and the form of the contract;(c) a description of the intended procurement, as well as essential contract requirements to be fulfilled;(d) any conditions that suppliers must fulfil to participate in the procurement;(e) time-limits for submission of tenders and, where appropriate, other time limits;(f) main criteria to be used for award of the contract; and(g) if possible, terms of payment and any other terms.Notice of planned procurement4. Each Party shall encourage its entities to publish as early as possible in each fiscal year, a notice of planned procurement containing information regarding entities' future procurement plans. Such notice should include the subject matter of the procurement and the planned date of the publication of the notice of intended procurement.5. Entities operating in the utilities sector may use a notice of planned procurement as a notice of intended procurement, under the condition that such notice contains as much of the information referred to in paragraph 3 as is available, and that it explicitly invites interested suppliers to express their interest in the procurement to the entity.6. Entities having used a notice of planned procurement as a notice of intended procurement shall subsequently communicate to all suppliers who have expressed an initial interest further information that shall include, at least, the information referred to in paragraph 3 and ask them to confirm their interest on that basis.Notice regarding permanent lists of qualified suppliers7. Entities which intend to maintain permanent lists shall, consistently with paragraph 2, publish a notice which shall identify the entity, and indicate the purpose of the permanent list and the availability of the rules concerning its operation, including criteria for qualification and disqualification, as well as its duration.8. Where the permanent list is of a duration greater than three years, the notice shall be published annually.9. Entities operating in the utilities sector may use a notice on the existence of permanent lists of qualified suppliers as a notice of intended procurement. In that case, they shall provide, in a timely manner, information which allows all those who have expressed an interest to assess their interest in participating in the procurement. This information shall include the information contained in the notice referred to in paragraph 3, to the extent that such information is available. Information provided to one interested supplier shall be provided in a non-discriminatory manner to the other interested suppliers.Common provisions10. Each notice referred to in this Article shall be accessible during the entire time period established for tendering for the relevant procurement.11. Entities shall publish the notices in a timely manner through means which offer the widest possible and non-discriminatory access to the interested suppliers of the Parties. These means shall be accessible free of charge through a single point of access specified in Annex XIII, Appendix 2.Article 148Tender documentation1. Tender documentation provided to suppliers shall contain all information necessary to permit them to submit responsive tenders.2. Where contracting entities do not offer free direct access to the entire tender documents and any supporting documents by electronic means, entities shall make promptly available the tender documentation at the request of any supplier of the Parties.3. Entities shall promptly reply to any reasonable request for relevant information relating to the intended procurement, on condition that such information does not give that supplier an advantage over its competitors.Article 149Technical specifications1. Technical specifications shall be set out in the notices, tender documents or additional documents.2. Each Party shall ensure that its entities do not prepare, adopt or apply any technical specifications with a view to, or with the effect of, creating unnecessary barriers to trade between the Parties.3. Technical specifications prescribed by entities shall(a) be in terms of performance and functional requirements rather than design or descriptive characteristics; and(b) be based on international standards, where these exist or, in their absence, on national technical regulations(12), recognised national standards(13), or building codes.4. The provisions of paragraph 3 do not apply when the entity can objectively demonstrate that the use of technical specifications referred to in that paragraph would be ineffective or inappropriate for the fulfilment of the legitimate objectives pursued.5. In all cases, entities shall consider bids which do not comply with the technical specifications but meet the essential requirements thereof and are fit for the purpose intended. The reference to technical specifications in the tender documents must include words such as \"or equivalent\".6. There shall be no requirement for or reference to a particular trademark or trade name, patent, design or type, specific origin, producer or supplier, unless there is no other sufficiently precise or intelligible way of describing the procurement requirements and provided that words, such as \"or equivalent\", are included in the tender documentation.7. The tenderer shall have the burden of proving that his bid meets the essential requirements.Article 150Time-limits1. All time-limits established by the entities for the receipt of tenders and requests to participate shall be adequate to allow suppliers of the other Party, as well as domestic suppliers, to prepare and to submit tenders, and where appropriate, requests for participation or applications for qualifying. In determining any such time-limit, entities shall, consistent with their own reasonable needs, take into account such factors as the complexity of the intended procurement and the normal time for transmitting tenders from foreign as well as domestic points.2. Each Party shall ensure that its entities shall take due account of publication delays when setting the final date for receipt of tenders or of request for participation or for qualifying for the supplier's list.3. The minimum time-limits for the receipt of tenders are specified in Annex XIII, Appendix 3.Article 151Negotiations1. A Party may provide for its entities to conduct negotiations:(a) in the context of procurements in which they have indicated such intent in the notice of intended procurement; or(b) when it appears from evaluation that no one tender is obviously the most advantageous in terms of the specific evaluation criteria set forth in the notices or tender documentation.2. Negotiations shall primarily be used to identify the strengths and weaknesses in tenders.3. Entities shall not, in the course of negotiations, discriminate between tenderers. In particular, they shall ensure that:(a) any elimination of participants is carried out in accordance with the criteria set forth in the notices and tender documentation;(b) all modifications to the criteria and to the technical requirements are transmitted in writing to all remaining participants in the negotiations; and(c) on the basis of the revised requirements and/or when negotiations are concluded, all remaining participants are afforded an opportunity to submit new or amended tenders in accordance with a common deadline.Article 152Submission, receipt and opening of tenders1. Tenders and requests to participate in procedures shall be submitted in writing.2. Entities shall receive and open bids from tenderers under procedures and conditions guaranteeing the respect of the principles of transparency and non-discrimination.Article 153Awarding of contracts1. To be considered for award, a tender must, at the time of opening, conform to the essential requirements of the notices or tender documentation and be submitted by a supplier which complies with the conditions for participation.2. Entities shall make the award to the tenderer whose tender is either the lowest tender or the tender which, in terms of the specific objective evaluation criteria previously set forth in the notices or tender documentation, is determined to be the most advantageous.Article 154Information on contract award1. Each Party shall ensure that its entities provide for effective dissemination of the results of government procurement processes.2. Entities shall promptly inform tenderers of decisions regarding the award of the contract and of the characteristics and relative advantages of the selected tender. Upon request, entities shall inform any eliminated tenderer of the reasons for the rejection of its tender.3. Entities may decide to withhold certain information on the contract award where release of such information would prevent law enforcement or otherwise be contrary to the public interest, would prejudice the legitimate commercial interests of suppliers, or might prejudice fair competition between them.Article 155Bid challenges1. Entities shall accord impartial and timely consideration to any complaints from suppliers regarding an alleged breach of this Title in the context of a procurement procedure.2. Each Party shall provide non-discriminatory, timely, transparent and effective procedures enabling suppliers to challenge alleged breaches of this Title arising in the context of procurements in which they have, or have had, an interest.3. Challenges shall be heard by an impartial and independent reviewing authority. A reviewing authority which is not a court shall either be subject to judicial review or shall have procedural guarantees similar to those of a court.4. Challenge procedures shall provide for:(a) rapid interim measures to correct breaches of this Title and to preserve commercial opportunities. Such action may result in suspension of the procurement process. However, procedures may provide that overriding adverse consequences for the interests concerned, including the public interest, may be taken into account in deciding whether such measures should be applied; and(b) if appropriate, correction of the breach of this Title or, in the absence of such correction, compensation for the loss or damages suffered, which may be limited to costs for tender preparation and protest.Article 156Information technology1.

The Parties undertake to apply their respective competition laws in a manner consistent with this Part of the Agreement so as to avoid the benefits of the liberalisation process in goods and services being diminished or cancelled out by anti-competitive business conduct. To this end, the Parties agree to cooperate and coordinate among their competition authorities under the provisions of this Title.2. With a view to preventing distortions or restrictions of competition which may affect trade in goods or services between them, the Parties shall give particular attention to anti-competitive agreements, concerted practices and abusive behaviour resulting from single or joint dominant positions.3. The Parties agree to cooperate and coordinate among themselves for the implementation of competition laws. This cooperation includes notification, consultation, exchange of non-confidential information and technical assistance. The Parties acknowledge the importance of embracing principles on competition that would be accepted by both Parties in multilateral fora, including the WTO.Article 173DefinitionsFor the purpose of this Title:1. \"competition laws\" includes:(a) for the Community, Articles 81, 82 and 86 of the Treaty establishing the European Community, Regulation (EEC) No 4064/89 and their implementing regulations or amendments;(b) for Chile, Decreto Ley No 211 of 1973 and Ley No 19.610 of 1999 and their implementing regulations or amendments; and(c) any changes that the abovementioned legislation may undergo after the entry into force of this Agreement.2. \"competition authority\" means:(a) for the Community, the Commission of the European Communities; and(b) for Chile, the Fiscalía Nacional Económica and the Comisión Resolutiva.3. \"enforcement activity\" means any application of competition laws by way of investigation or proceeding conducted by the competition authority of a Party, which may result in the imposition of penalties or remedies.Article 174Notifications1.

Provided that this is not contrary to the Parties' competition laws and does not affect any investigation being carried out, notification shall take place at an early stage of the procedure. The opinions received may be taken into consideration by the other competition authority when taking decisions.3. The notifications provided for in paragraph 1 should be detailed enough to permit an evaluation in the light of the interests of the other Party.4. The Parties undertake to use their best efforts to ensure that notifications are made in the circumstances set out above, taking into account the administrative resources available to them.Article 175Coordination of enforcement activitiesThe competition authority of one Party may notify the other Party's competition authority of its willingness to coordinate enforcement activities with respect to a specific case. This coordination shall not prevent the Parties from taking autonomous decisions.Article 176Consultations when the important interests of one Party are adversely affected in the territory of the other Party1. Each Party shall, in accordance with its laws, take into consideration, as necessary, the important interests of the other Party in the course of its enforcement activities. If the competition authority of a Party considers that an investigation or proceeding being conducted by the competition authority of the other Party may adversely affect such Party's important interests it may transmit its views on the matter to, or request consultation with, the other competition authority. Without prejudice to the continuation of any action under its competition laws and to its full freedom of ultimate decision, the competition authority so addressed should give full and sympathetic consideration to the views expressed by the requesting competition authority.2. The competition authority of a Party which considers that the interests of that Party are being substantially and adversely affected by anti-competitive practices of whatever origin that are or have been engaged in by one or more enterprises situated in the other Party may request consultations with the competition authority of that Party. Such consultations shall be without prejudice to the full freedom of ultimate decision of the competition authority concerned. A competition authority so consulted may take whatever corrective measures under its competition laws it deems appropriate, consistent with its own domestic law, and without prejudice to its full enforcement discretion.Article 177Exchange of information and confidentiality1. With a view to facilitating the effective application of their respective competition laws, the competition authorities may exchange non-confidential information.2. For the purpose of improving transparency, and without prejudice to the rules and standards of confidentiality applicable in each Party, the Parties hereby undertake to exchange information regarding sanctions and remedies applied in the cases that, according to the competition authority concerned, are significantly affecting important interests of the other Party and to provide the grounds on which those actions were taken, when requested by the competition authority of the other Party.3. Each Party shall provide the other Party with information on state aid on an annual basis, including the overall amount of aid and, if possible, the segregation by sector. Each Party may request information on individual cases affecting trade between the Parties. The requested Party will use its best efforts to provide non-confidential information.4. All exchange of information shall be subject to the standards of confidentiality applicable in each Party. Confidential information whose dissemination is expressly prohibited or which, if disseminated, could adversely affect the interest of the Parties, shall not be provided without the express consent of the source of the information.5. Each competition authority shall maintain the confidentiality of any information provided to it in confidence by the other competition authority, and oppose any application for disclosure of such information by a third party that is not authorised by the competition authority that supplied the information.6.

The complaining Party shall state in the request the existing measure it considers to be in breach of this Part of the Agreement and indicate the provisions of this Agreement that it considers relevant, and shall deliver the request to the other Party and to the Association Committee.Article 185Appointment of arbitrators1. Arbitration panels shall consist of three arbitrators.2. The Association Committee shall, no later than six months after the entry into force of this Agreement, establish a list of at least 15 individuals who are willing and able to serve as arbitrators, a third of whom must not be national of either Party and are identified as chairperson of arbitration panels. The Association Committee shall ensure that the list always contains 15 individuals at any point in time. Those individuals shall have specialised knowledge or experience in law, international trade or other matters relating to this Part of the Agreement or in the resolution of disputes deriving from international trade agreements, be independent, serve in their individual capacities and not be affiliated with, nor take instructions from, any Party or organisation and shall comply with the Code of Conduct set out in Annex XVI. Such list may be amended every three years.3. Within three days of the request for the establishment of the arbitration panel, the three arbitrators shall be selected by lot by the chairperson of the Association Committee from the list referred to in paragraph 2, one among the individuals proposed to the Association Committee by the complaining Party, one among the individuals proposed to the Association Committee by the Party complained against and the chairperson among the individuals identified for that purpose under paragraph 2.4. The date of establishment of the arbitration panel shall be the date on which the three arbitrators are selected by lot.5. Where a Party considers that an arbitrator does not comply with the requirements of the Code of Conduct, the Parties shall consult and, if so agreed, they shall replace that arbitrator and select a new one pursuant to paragraph 6.6. If an arbitrator is unable to participate in the proceeding, withdraws or is replaced, a replacement shall be selected within three days in accordance with the selection procedure followed to select that arbitrator. In such a case, any timeframe applicable to the arbitration panel proceeding shall be suspended for a period beginning on the date the arbitrator is unable to participate in the proceeding, withdraws or is replaced and ending on the date the replacement is selected.Article 186Information and technical adviceAt the request of a Party or on its own initiative, the panel may obtain the information and technical advice of persons and bodies that it deems appropriate. Any information so obtained shall be submitted to the Parties for comments.Article 187Arbitration panel ruling1. The arbitration panel shall transmit its ruling containing its findings and conclusions to the Parties and the Association Committee, as a general rule not later than three months from the date of establishment of the arbitration panel. In no case should it do so later than five months from this date. The arbitration panel shall base its ruling on the submissions and communications of the Parties and on any information it has received pursuant to Article 186. The ruling is final and shall be publicly available.2. The ruling shall set out the findings of fact, the applicability of the relevant provisions of this Agreement and the basic rationale behind any findings and conclusions that it makes.3. Arbitration panels shall interpret the provisions of this Agreement in accordance with customary rules of interpretation of public international law, due account being taken of the fact that the Parties must perform this Agreement in good faith and avoid circumvention of their obligations.4. A Party asserting that a measure of the other Party is inconsistent with the provisions of this Part of the Agreement shall have the burden of establishing such inconsistency. A Party asserting that a measure is subject to an exception under this Part of the Agreement shall have the burden of establishing that the exception applies.5. In cases of urgency, including those involving perishable goods, the arbitration panel shall make every effort to issue its ruling to the Parties within 75 days from the date of establishment of the arbitration panel. In no case should it do so later than four months from that date. The arbitration panel may give a preliminary ruling on whether a case is urgent.6. All decisions of the arbitration panel, including the adoption of the ruling and of any preliminary ruling, shall be taken by majority vote.7. The complaining Party may, with the agreement of the Party complained against, withdraw its complaint at any time before the ruling is transmitted to the Parties and the Association Committee. Such withdrawal is without prejudice to its right to introduce a new complaint regarding the same matter at a later point in time.8. The arbitration panel may, with the agreement of the Party complained against, suspend its work at any time at the request of the complaining Party for a period not to exceed 12 months. In the event of such a suspension, the time-frames set out in paragraphs 1 and 5 shall be extended by the amount of time that the work was suspended. If the work of the panel has been suspended for more than 12 months, the authority for establishment of the panel shall lapse, without prejudice to the right of the complaining Party to request at a later stage the establishment of an arbitration panel on the same subject matter.Article 188Compliance1. Each Party shall be bound to take the measures necessary to comply with the ruling of the arbitration panel.2. The Parties shall endeavour to agree on the specific measures that are required for complying with the ruling.3. Within 30 days after the ruling has been transmitted to the Parties and the Association Committee, the Party complained against shall notify the other Party:(a) of the specific measures required for complying with the ruling;(b) of the reasonable timeframe for doing so; and(c) of a concrete proposal for a temporary compensation until the full implementation of the specific measures required for compliance with the ruling.4. In the event of disagreement between the Parties on the content of such notification, the complaining Party shall request the original arbitration panel to rule on whether the proposed measures referred to under paragraph 3(a) would be consistent with this Part of the Agreement, on the duration of the timeframe and on whether the compensation proposal is manifestly disproportionate. The ruling shall be given within 45 days after that request.5. The Party concerned shall notify to the other Party and to the Association Committee the implementing measures adopted in order to put an end to the violation of its obligations under this Part of the Agreement, before the expiry of the reasonable timeframe agreed by the Parties or determined in accordance with paragraph 4. Upon that notification, that other Party may request the original arbitration panel to rule on the conformity of those measures with this Part of the Agreement if they are not similar to the measures which the arbitration panel, acting under paragraph 4, has ruled that they would be consistent with this Part of the Agreement. The ruling of the arbitration panel shall be given within 45 days from that request.6. If the Party concerned fails to notify the implementing measures before the expiry of the reasonable timeframe or if the arbitration panel rules that the implementing measures notified by the Party concerned are inconsistent with its obligations under this Part of the Agreement, the complaining Party shall, if no agreement on compensation has been found, be entitled to suspend the application of benefits granted under this Part of the Agreement equivalent to the level of nullification and impairment caused by the measure found to violate this Part of the Agreement.7. In considering what benefits to suspend, a complaining Party should first seek to suspend benefits in the same Title or Titles of this Part of the Agreement as that affected by the measure that the arbitration panel has found to violate this Part of the Agreement. A complaining Party that considers that it is not practicable or effective to suspend benefits in the same Title or Titles may suspend benefits in other Titles, provided it submits written justification. In the selection of the benefits to suspend, priority must be given to those which least disturb the functioning of this Agreement.8. The complaining Party shall notify the other Party and the Association Committee of the benefits which it intends to suspend. Within five days from that notification, the other Party may request the original arbitration panel to rule on whether the benefits which the complaining Party intends to suspend are equivalent to the level of nullification and impairment caused by the measure found to violate this Part of the Agreement, and whether the proposed suspension is in accordance with paragraph 7. The ruling of the arbitration panel shall be given within 45 days from that request. Benefits shall not be suspended until the arbitration panel has issued its ruling.9. The suspension of benefits shall be temporary and shall only be applied by the complaining Party until the measure found to violate this Part of the Agreement has been withdrawn or amended so as to bring it into conformity with this Part of the Agreement, or the Parties have reached agreement on a resolution of the dispute.10. At the request of any of the Parties, the original arbitration panel shall rule on the conformity with this Part of the Agreement of any implementing measures adopted after the suspension of benefits and, in the light of such ruling, whether the suspension of benefits should be terminated or modified. The ruling of the arbitration panel shall be given within 45 days from the date of that request.11. The rulings provided for in this Article shall be final and binding. They shall be transmitted to the Association Committee and be publicly available.CHAPTER IVGENERAL PROVISIONSArticle 189General provisions1. Any time-period mentioned in this Title may be modified by mutual agreement of the Parties.2.

Without prejudice to paragraph 2, the following operations shall be considered as insufficient working or processing to confer the status of originating products, whether or not the requirements of Article 5 are satisfied:(a) preserving operations to ensure that the products remain in good condition during transport and storage;(b) breaking-up and assembly of packages;(c) washing, cleaning; removal of dust, oxide, oil, paint or other coverings;(d) ironing or pressing of textiles;(e) simple painting and polishing operations;(f) husking, partial or total bleaching, polishing, and glazing of cereals and rice;(g) operations to colour sugar or form sugar lumps;(h) peeling, stoning and shelling, of fruits, nuts and vegetables;(i) sharpening, simple grinding or simple cutting;(j) sifting, screening, sorting, classifying, grading, matching; (including the making-up of sets of articles);(k) simple placing in bottles, cans, flasks, bags, cases, boxes, fixing on cards or boards and all other simple packaging operations;(l) affixing or printing marks, labels, logos and other like distinguishing signs on products or their packaging;(m) simple mixing of products, whether or not of different kinds;(n) simple assembly of parts of articles to constitute a complete article or disassembly of products into parts;(o) operations whose sole purpose is to ease loading;(p) a combination of two or more operations specified in subparagraphs (a) to (o);(q) slaughter of animals.2. All operations carried out either in the Community or in Chile on a given product shall be considered when determining whether the working or processing undergone by that product is to be regarded as insufficient within the meaning of paragraph 1.Article 7Unit of qualification1. The unit of qualification for the application of the provisions of this Annex shall be the particular product which is considered as the basic unit when determining classification using the nomenclature of the Harmonised System.Accordingly, it follows that:(a) when a product composed of a group or assembly of articles is classified under the terms of the Harmonised System in a single heading, the whole constitutes the unit of qualification;(b) when a consignment consists of a number of identical products classified under the same heading of the Harmonised System, each product must be taken individually when applying the provisions of this Annex.2. Where, under General Rule 5 of the Harmonised System, packaging is included with the product for classification purposes, it shall be included for the purposes of determining origin. Any other packaging shall not be included for the purposes of determining origin.Article 8Accessories, spare parts and toolsAccessories, spare parts and tools dispatched with a piece of equipment, machine, apparatus or vehicle:- which are part of the normal equipment and included in the price thereof, or- which are not separately invoiced,shall be regarded as one with the piece of equipment, machine, apparatus or vehicle in question.Article 9SetsSets, as defined in General Rule 3 of the Harmonised System, shall be regarded as originating when all component products are originating. Nevertheless, when a set is composed of originating and non-originating products, the set as a whole shall be regarded as originating, provided that the value of the non-originating products does not exceed 15 per cent of the ex-works price of the set.Article 10Neutral elementsIn order to determine whether a product originates, it shall not be necessary to determine the origin of the following which might be used in its manufacture:(a) energy and fuel;(b) plant and equipment;(c) machines and tools;(d) goods which do not enter and which are not intended to enter into the final composition of the product.TITLE IIITERRITORIAL REQUIREMENTSArticle 11Principle of territoriality1. The conditions set out in Title II relating to the acquisition of originating status must be fulfilled without interruption in the Community or in Chile.2.

The preferential treatment provided for under this Agreement applies only to products, satisfying the requirements of this Annex, which are transported directly between the Community and Chile. However, products constituting one consignment may be transported through other territories with, should the occasion arise, trans-shipment or temporary warehousing in such territories, provided that they remain under the surveillance of the customs authorities in the country of transit or warehousing and do not undergo operations other than unloading, reloading or any operation designed to preserve them in good condition.2. Evidence that the conditions set out in paragraph 1 have been fulfilled shall be supplied to the customs authorities of the importing country by the production of:(a) a single transport document covering the passage from the exporting country through the country of transit; or(b) a certificate issued by the customs authorities of the country of transit:(i) giving an exact description of the products;(ii) stating the dates of unloading and reloading of the products and, where applicable, the names of the ships, or the other means of transport used; and(iii) certifying the conditions under which the products remained in the transit country; or(c) failing these, any substantiating documents.Article 13Exhibitions1. Originating products, sent for exhibition in a country other than the Community or Chile and sold after the exhibition for importation in the Community or Chile shall benefit on importation from the provisions of this Agreement provided it is shown to the satisfaction of the customs authorities of the importing country that:(a) an exporter has consigned these products from the Community or Chile to the country in which the exhibition is held and has exhibited them there;(b) the products have been sold or otherwise disposed of by that exporter to a person in the Community or Chile;(c) the products have been consigned during the exhibition or immediately thereafter in the state in which they were sent for exhibition;(d) the products have not, since they were consigned for exhibition, been used for any purpose other than demonstration at the exhibition; and(e) the products have remained during the exhibition under customs control.2. A proof of origin must be issued or made out in accordance with the provisions of Title V and submitted to the customs authorities of the importing country in the normal manner. The name and address of the exhibition must be indicated thereon. Where necessary, additional documentary evidence of the conditions under which they have been exhibited may be required.3. Paragraph 1 shall apply to any trade, industrial, agricultural or crafts exhibition, fair or similar public show or display which is not organised for private purposes in shops or business premises with a view to the sale of foreign products.TITLE IVDRAWBACK OR EXEMPTIONArticle 14Prohibition of drawback of, or exemption from, customs duties1. Non-originating materials used in the manufacture of products originating in the Community or in Chile for which a proof of origin is issued or made out in accordance with the provisions of Title V shall not be subject in the Community or Chile to drawback of, or exemption from, customs duties of whatever kind.2. The prohibition in paragraph 1 shall apply to any arrangement for refund, remission or non-payment, partial or complete, of customs duties, as defined in Article 59 of this Agreement, applicable in the Community or Chile to materials used in the manufacture, where such refund, remission or non-payment applies, expressly or in effect, when products obtained from the said materials are exported and not when they are retained for home use there.3. The exporter of products covered by a proof of origin shall be prepared to submit at any time, upon request from the customs authorities, all appropriate documents proving that no drawback has been obtained in respect of the non-originating materials used in the manufacture of the products concerned and that all customs duties applicable to such materials have actually been paid.4.

The provisions of paragraphs 1 to 4 shall apply only in respect of materials which are of the kind to which this Agreement applies. Furthermore, they shall not preclude the application of an export refund system for agricultural products, applicable upon export in accordance with the provisions of the Agreement.6. The provisions of this Article shall be applied from 1 January 2007.TITLE VPROOF OF ORIGINArticle 15General requirements1.

The issuing customs authorities or competent governmental authorities shall take any steps necessary to verify the originating status of the products and the fulfilment of the other requirements of this Annex. For this purpose, they shall have the right to call for any evidence and to carry out any inspection of the exporter's accounts or any other check considered appropriate. The issuing customs authorities or competent governmental authorities shall also ensure that the forms referred to in paragraph 2 are duly completed. In particular, they shall check whether the space reserved for the description of the products has been completed in such a manner as to exclude all possibility of fraudulent additions.6. The date of issue of the movement certificate EUR.1 shall be indicated in Box 11 of the certificate.7. A movement certificate EUR.1 shall be issued by the customs authorities or competent governmental authorities and made available to the exporter as soon as actual exportation has been effected or ensured.Article 17Movement certificate EUR.1 issued retrospectively1. Notwithstanding Article 16(7), a movement certificate EUR.1 may exceptionally be issued after exportation of the products to which it relates if:(a) it was not issued at the time of exportation because of errors or involuntary omissions or special circumstances,or(b) it is demonstrated to the satisfaction of the customs authorities or competent governmental authorities that a movement certificate EUR.1 was issued but was not accepted at importation for technical reasons.2. For the implementation of paragraph 1, the exporter must indicate in his application the place and date of exportation of the products to which the movement certificate EUR.1 relates and state the reasons for his request.3.

In the event of theft, loss or destruction of a movement certificate EUR.1, the exporter by stating the reasons for his request may apply to the customs authorities or competent governmental authorities which issued it for a duplicate made out on the basis of the export documents in their possession.2. The duplicate issued in this way must be endorsed with one of the following words:\"DUPLIKAT\", \"DUPLICATA\", \"DUPLICATO\", \"DUPLICAAT\", \"DUPLICATE\", \"ΑΝΤΙΓΡΑΦΟ\", \"DUPLICADO\", \"SEGUNDA VIA\", \"KAKSOISKAPPALE\".3. The endorsement referred to in paragraph 2 shall be inserted in the \"Remarks\" box of the duplicate movement certificate EUR.1.4.

The replacement movement certificate(s) EUR.1 shall be issued by the customs office of first entry in the Community or in Chile under whose control the products are placed.Article 20Conditions for making out an invoice declaration1. An invoice declaration as referred to in Article 15(1)(b) may be made out:(a) by an approved exporter within the meaning of Article 21;or(b) by any exporter for any consignment consisting of one or more packages containing originating products whose total value does not exceed EUR 6000.2. An invoice declaration may be made out if the products concerned can be considered as products originating in the Community or in Chile and fulfil the other requirements of this Annex.3. The exporter making out an invoice declaration shall be prepared to submit at any time, at the request of the customs authorities or competent governmental authorities of the exporting country, all appropriate documents proving the originating status of the products concerned as well as the fulfilment of the other requirements of this Annex.4. An invoice declaration shall be made out by the exporter by typing, stamping or printing on the invoice, the delivery note or another commercial document, the declaration, the text of which appears in Appendix IV. Specific requirements as for the making out of an invoice declaration are set out in Appendix IV.5. Invoice declarations shall bear the original signature of the exporter in manuscript. However, an approved exporter within the meaning of Article 21 shall not be required to sign such declarations provided that he gives the customs authorities or competent governmental authorities of the exporting country a written undertaking that he accepts full responsibility for any invoice declaration which identifies him as if it had been signed in manuscript by him.6. An invoice declaration may be made out by the exporter when the products to which it relates are exported, or after exportation on condition that it is presented to the customs authorities of the importing country no longer than two years after the importation of the products to which it relates.Article 21Approved exporter1. The customs authorities or competent governmental authorities of the exporting country may authorise any exporter, hereinafter referred to as 'approved exporter', who makes frequent shipments of originating products under this Agreement to make out invoice declarations irrespective of the value of the products concerned. An exporter seeking such authorisation must offer to the satisfaction of the customs authorities or competent governmental authorities all guarantees necessary to verify the originating status of the products as well as the fulfilment of the other requirements of this Annex.2. The customs authorities or competent governmental authorities may grant the status of approved exporter subject to any conditions which they consider appropriate.3. The customs authorities or competent governmental authorities shall grant to the approved exporter a customs authorisation number, which shall appear on the invoice declaration.4. The customs authorities or competent governmental authorities shall monitor the use of the authorisation by the approved exporter.5. The customs authorities or competent governmental authorities may withdraw the authorisation at any time. They shall do so where the approved exporter no longer offers the guarantees referred to in paragraph 1, no longer fulfils the conditions referred to in paragraph 2 or otherwise makes an incorrect use of the authorisation.Article 22Validity of proof of origin1. A proof of origin as referred to in Article 15(1) shall be valid for ten months from the date of issue in the exporting country and must be submitted within the said period to the customs authorities of the importing country.2. Proofs of origin which are submitted to the customs authorities of the importing country after the final date for presentation specified in paragraph 1 may be accepted for the purpose of applying preferential treatment, where the failure to submit these documents by the final date set is due to exceptional circumstances.3. In other cases of belated presentation, the customs authorities of the importing country may accept the proofs of origin where the products have been submitted to them before the said final date.4. In accordance with the internal legislation of the importing country, preferential treatment may also be granted, where applicable by repayment of duties, within a period of at least two years from the date of acceptance of the import declaration, where a proof of origin is produced indicating that the imported goods were at that date eligible for preferential tariff treatment.Article 23Submission of proof of origin1. Proofs of origin shall be submitted to the customs authorities of the importing country in accordance with the procedures applicable in that country. The said authorities may require a translation of a proof of origin, which can be drawn up by the importer. They may also require the import declaration to be accompanied by a statement from the importer to the effect that the products meet the conditions required for the implementation of the Agreement.2. The requirements mentioned in paragraph 1 relating to translation and the statement by the importer shall not be systematic and should only be imposed with a view to clarifying the submitted information or to ensuring that the importer endorses the full responsibility for the declared origin.Article 24Importation by instalmentsWhere, at the request of the importer and on the conditions laid down by the customs authorities of the importing country, dismantled or non-assembled products within the meaning of General Rule 2(a) of the Harmonised System classified within Sections XVI and XVII or headings 7308 and 9406 of the Harmonised System are imported by instalments, a single proof of origin for such products shall be submitted to the customs authorities upon importation of the first instalment.Article 25Exemptions from proof of origin1. Products sent from private persons to private persons or forming part of travellers' personal luggage shall be admitted as originating products without requiring the submission of a proof of origin, provided that such products are not imported by way of trade and have been declared as meeting the requirements of this Annex and where there is no doubt as to the veracity of such a declaration. In the case of products sent by post, this declaration can be made on the customs declaration CN22/CN23 or other certificates established by the Universal Postal Union, or on a sheet of paper annexed to that document.2. Imports which are occasional and consist solely of products for the personal use of the recipients or travellers or their families shall not be considered as imports by way of trade if it is evident from the nature and quantity of the products that no commercial purpose is in view.3. Furthermore, the total value of these products shall not exceed EUR 500, in the case of products sent from private persons to private persons or EUR 1200, in the case of products forming part of travellers' personal luggage.Article 26Supporting documentsThe documents referred to in Articles 16(3) and 20(3) used for the purpose of proving that products covered by a movement certificate EUR.1 or an invoice declaration can be considered as products originating in the Community or in Chile and fulfil the other requirements of this Annex may consist inter alia of the following:(a) direct evidence of the processes carried out by the exporter or supplier to obtain the goods concerned, contained for example in his accounts or internal book-keeping;(b) documents proving the originating status of materials used, issued or made out in the Community or Chile where these documents are used in accordance with the internal legislation;(c) documents proving the working or processing of materials in the Community or Chile, issued or made out in the Community or Chile, where these documents are used in accordance with the internal legislation;(d) movement certificates EUR.1 or invoice declarations proving the originating status of materials used, issued or made out in the Community or Chile in accordance with this Annex.Article 27Preservation of proof of origin and supporting documents1.

The exporter making out an invoice declaration shall keep for at least three years a copy of this invoice declaration as well as the documents referred to in Article 20(3).3. The customs authorities or competent governmental authorities of the exporting country issuing a movement certificate EUR.1 shall keep for at least three years the application form referred to in Article 16(2).4. The customs authorities in the Community shall keep for at least three years the movement certificates EUR.1 and the invoice declarations submitted to them on importation. The customs authorities of Chile must have at their disposal for five years the movement certificates EUR.1 and the invoice declarations submitted to them on importation.Article 28Discrepancies and formal errors1. The discovery of slight discrepancies between the statements made in the proof of origin and those made in the documents submitted to the customs office for the purpose of carrying out the formalities for importing the products shall not ipso facto render the proof of origin null and void if it is duly established that this document does correspond to the products submitted.2. Obvious formal errors such as typing errors on a proof of origin should not cause this document to be rejected if these errors are not such as to create doubts concerning the correctness of the statements made in this document.Article 29Amounts expressed in euro1. For the application of the provisions of Article 20(1)(b) and Article 25(3) in cases where products are invoiced in a currency other than euro, amounts in the national currencies of the Member States of the Community or Chile equivalent to the amounts expressed in euro shall be fixed annually by each of the countries concerned.2. A consignment shall benefit from the provisions of Article 20(1)(b) or Article 25(3) by reference to the currency in which the invoice is drawn up, according to the amount fixed by the country concerned.3. The amounts to be used in any given national currency shall be the equivalent in that currency of the amounts expressed in euro as at the first working day of October. The amounts shall be communicated to the Commission of the European Communities by 15 October and shall apply from 1 January the following year. The Commission of the European Communities shall notify all countries concerned of the relevant amounts.4. A country may round up or down the amount resulting from the conversion into its national currency of an amount expressed in euro. The rounded-off amount may not differ from the amount resulting from the conversion by more than 5 per cent. A country may retain unchanged its national currency equivalent of an amount expressed in euro if, at the time of the annual adjustment provided for in paragraph 3, the conversion of that amount, prior to any rounding-off, results in an increase of less than 15 per cent in the national currency equivalent. The national currency equivalent may be retained unchanged if the conversion would result in a decrease in that equivalent value.5. The amounts expressed in euro shall be reviewed by the Association Committee at the request of the Community or Chile. When carrying out this review, the Association Committee shall consider the desirability of preserving the effects of the limits concerned in real terms. For this purpose, it may decide to modify the amounts expressed in euro.TITLE VIARRANGEMENTS FOR ADMINISTRATIVE COOPERATIONArticle 30Mutual assistance1. The customs authorities or competent governmental authorities of the Member States of the Community and of Chile shall provide each other, through the Commission of the European Communities, with specimen impressions of stamps used in their customs offices or competent governmental authorities for the issue of movement certificates EUR.1 and with the addresses of the customs authorities or competent governmental authorities responsible for verifying those certificates and invoice declarations.2. In order to ensure the proper application of this Annex, the Community and Chile shall assist each other, through their respective administrations, in checking the authenticity of the movement certificates EUR.1 or the invoice declarations and the correctness of the information given in these documents.Article 31Verification of proofs of origin1. Subsequent verifications of proofs of origin shall be carried out at random or whenever the customs authorities of the importing country have reasonable doubts as to the authenticity of such documents, the originating status of the products concerned or the fulfilment of the other requirements of this Annex.2. For the purposes of implementing the provisions of paragraph 1, the customs authorities of the importing country shall return the movement certificate EUR.1 and the invoice, if it has been submitted, the invoice declaration, or a copy of these documents, to the customs authorities or competent governmental authorities of the exporting country giving, where appropriate, the reasons for the enquiry. Any documents and information obtained suggesting that the information given on the proof of origin is incorrect shall be forwarded in support of the request for verification.3. The verification shall be carried out by the customs authorities or competent governmental authorities of the exporting country. For this purpose, they shall have the right to call for any evidence and to carry out any inspection of the exporter's accounts or any other check considered appropriate.4. If the customs authorities of the importing country decide to suspend the granting of preferential treatment to the products concerned while awaiting the results of the verification, release of the products shall be offered to the importer subject to any precautionary measures judged necessary.5. The customs authorities requesting the verification shall be informed of the results of this verification as soon as possible. These results must indicate clearly whether the documents are authentic and whether the products concerned can be considered as products originating in the Community or in Chile and fulfil the other requirements of this Annex.6. If in cases of reasonable doubt there is no reply within ten months of the date of the verification request or if the reply does not contain sufficient information to determine the authenticity of the document in question or the real origin of the products, the requesting customs authorities shall, except in exceptional circumstances, refuse entitlement to the preferences.Article 32Resolution of disputesWhere disputes arise in relation to the verification procedures of Article 31, which cannot be settled between the customs authorities requesting a verification and the customs authorities or competent governmental authorities responsible for carrying out this verification, or where they raise a question as to the interpretation of this Annex, they shall be submitted to the Special Committee on Customs Cooperation and Rules of Origin.In all cases the settlement of disputes between the importer and the customs authorities of the importing country shall be under the legislation of the said country.Article 33PenaltiesPenalties may be imposed in accordance with internal legislation for infringement to provisions of this Annex. In particular, penalties shall be imposed on any person who draws up, or causes to be drawn up, a document which contains incorrect information for the purpose of obtaining a preferential treatment for products.Article 34ConfidentialityIn accordance with the applicable internal legislation, each Party shall treat as confidential the information submitted under the provisions of this Annex by a person or authority of the other Party when such information is designated by that Party as confidential. Accordingly, access to the said information may be refused where disclosure would undermine the protection of the commercial interest of the person that submitted the information.Article 35Free zones1. The Community and Chile shall take all necessary steps to ensure that products traded under cover of a proof of origin which in the course of transport use a free zone situated in their territory, are not substituted by other goods and do not undergo handling other than normal operations designed to prevent their deterioration.2. By means of an exemption from paragraph 1, when products originating in the Community or in Chile are entered into a free zone of the exporting country under cover of a proof of origin and undergo treatment or processing, the authorities concerned shall issue a new movement certificate EUR.1 at the exporter's request, if the treatment or processing undergone is in conformity with the provisions of this Annex.TITLE VIICEUTA AND MELILLAArticle 36Application of this Annex1. The term \"Community\" used in Article 2 does not cover Ceuta and Melilla.2. Products originating in Chile, when imported into Ceuta or Melilla, shall enjoy in all respects the same customs regime as that which is applied to products originating in the customs territory of the Community under Protocol 2 of the \"Act of Accession of the Kingdom of Spain and the Portuguese Republic to the European Communities\". Chile shall grant to imports of products covered by this Agreement and originating in Ceuta and Melilla the same customs regime as that which is granted to products imported from and originating in the Community.3. For the purpose of the application of paragraph 2 concerning products originating in Ceuta and Melilla, this Annex shall apply mutatis mutandis subject to the special conditions set out in Article 37.Article 37Special conditions1. Provided that they have been transported directly in accordance with the provisions of Article 12, the following shall be considered as:(1) products originating in Ceuta and Melilla:(a) products wholly obtained in Ceuta and Melilla;(b) products obtained in Ceuta and Melilla in the manufacture of which products other than those referred to in (a) are used, provided that:(i) the said products have undergone sufficient working or processing within the meaning of Article 5; or that(ii) those products are originating in Chile or the Community within the meaning of this Annex, provided that they have been submitted to working or processing which goes beyond the insufficient working or processing referred to in Article 6.(2) products originating in Chile:(a) products wholly obtained in Chile;(b) products obtained in Chile, in the manufacture of which products other than those referred to in (a) are used, provided that:(i) the said products have undergone sufficient working or processing within the meaning of Article 5; or that(ii) those products are originating in Ceuta and Melilla or the Community within the meaning of this Annex, provided that they have been submitted to working or processing which goes beyond the insufficient working or processing referred to in Article 6.2. Ceuta and Melilla shall be considered as a single territory.3. The exporter or his authorised representative shall enter \"Chile\" and \"Ceuta and Melilla\" in Box 2 of movement certificates EUR.1 or on invoice declarations. In addition, in the case of products originating in Ceuta and Melilla, this shall be indicated in Box 4 of movement certificates EUR.1 or on invoice declarations.4. The Spanish customs authorities shall be responsible for the application of this Annex in Ceuta and Melilla.TITLE VIIIFINAL PROVISIONSArticle 38Amendments to this AnnexThe Association Committee may decide to amend the provisions of this Annex.Article 39Explanatory NotesThe Parties shall agree on the \"Explanatory Notes\" regarding the interpretation, application and administration of this Annex within the Special Committee on Customs Cooperation and Rules of Origin.Article 40Transitional provision for goods in transit or storageThe provisions of this Agreement may be applied to goods which comply with the provisions of this Annex and which on the date of entry into force of this Agreement are either in transit or are in the Community or in Chile in temporary storage in customs warehouses or in free zones, subject to the submission to the customs authorities of the importing country, within four months of the said date, of a movement certificate EUR.1 issued retrospectively by the customs authorities or competent governmental authorities of the exporting country together with the documents showing that the goods have been transported directly in accordance with the provisions of Article 12.(1) As long as any transfer of sovereign rights between the Parties, as defined by international rules, is subject to negotiations, this provision will not apply to products of sea fishing and other products taken from the sea by Community vessels in the Exclusive Economic Zone of Chile or to products of sea fishing and other products taken from the sea by Chilean vessels in the Exclusive Economic Zone of the Member States of the Community.Appendix IINTRODUCTORY NOTES TO THE LIST IN APPENDIX II AND APPENDIX II(a)Note 1:The list sets out the conditions required for all products to be considered as sufficiently worked or processed within the meaning of Article 5 of this Annex.Note 2:2.1. The first two columns in the list describe the product obtained. The first column gives the heading number or chapter number used in the Harmonised System and the second column gives the description of goods used in that system for that heading or chapter. For each entry in the first two columns, a rule is specified in column 3 or 4. Where, in some cases, the entry in the first column is preceded by an \"ex\", this signifies that the rules in column 3 or 4 apply only to the part of that heading as described in column 2.2.2. Where several heading numbers are grouped together in column 1 or a chapter number is given and the description of products in column 2 is therefore given in general terms, the adjacent rules in column 3 or 4 apply to all products which, under the Harmonised System, are classified in headings of the chapter or in any of the headings grouped together in column 1.2.3. Where there are different rules in the list applying to different products within a heading, each indent contains the description of that part of the heading covered by the adjacent rules in column 3 or 4.2.4. Where, for an entry in the first two columns, a rule is specified in both columns 3 and 4, the exporter may opt, as an alternative, to apply either the rule set out in column 3 or that set out in column 4. If no origin rule is given in column 4, the rule set out in column 3 is to be applied.Note 3:3.1. The provisions of Article 5 of this Annex, concerning products having acquired originating status which are used in the manufacture of other products, shall apply, regardless of whether this status has been acquired inside the factory where these products are used or in another factory in the Community or in Chile.Example:An engine of heading 8407, for which the rule states that the value of the non-originating materials which may be incorporated may not exceed 40 % of the ex-works price, is made from \"other alloy steel roughly shaped by forging\" of heading ex 7224.If this forging has been forged in the Community from a non-originating ingot, it has already acquired originating status by virtue of the rule for heading ex 7224 in the list. The forging can then count as originating in the value-calculation for the engine, regardless of whether it was produced in the same factory or in another factory in the Community. The value of the non-originating ingot is thus not taken into account when adding up the value of the non-originating materials used.3.2. The rule in the list represents the minimum amount of working or processing required, and the carrying-out of more working or processing also confers originating status; conversely, the carrying-out of less working or processing cannot confer originating status. Thus, if a rule provides that non-originating material, at a certain level of manufacture, may be used, the use of such material at an earlier stage of manufacture is allowed, and the use of such material at a later stage is not.3.3. Without prejudice to Note 3.2, where a rule uses the expression \"Manufacture from materials of any heading\", then materials of any heading(s) (even materials of the same description and heading as the product) may be used, subject, however, to any specific limitations which may also be contained in the rule.However, the expression \"Manufacture from materials of any heading, including other materials of heading...\" or \"Manufacture from materials of any heading, including other materials of the same heading as the product\" means that materials of any heading(s) may be used, except those of the same description as the product as given in column 2 of the list.3.4. When a rule in the list specifies that a product may be manufactured from more than one material, this means that one or more materials may be used. It does not require that all be used.Example:The rule for fabrics of headings 5208 to 5212 provides that natural fibres may be used and that chemical materials, among other materials, may also be used. This does not mean that both have to be used; it is possible to use one or the other, or both.3.5. Where a rule in the list specifies that a product must be manufactured from a particular material, the condition obviously does not prevent the use of other materials which, because of their inherent nature, cannot satisfy the rule. (See also Note 6.2 below in relation to textiles).Example:The rule for prepared foods of heading 1904, which specifically excludes the use of cereals and their derivatives, does not prevent the use of mineral salts, chemicals and other additives which are not products from cereals.However, this does not apply to products which, although they cannot be manufactured from the particular materials specified in the list, can be produced from a material of the same nature at an earlier stage of manufacture.Example:In the case of an article of apparel of ex Chapter 62 made from non-woven materials, if the use of only non-originating yarn is allowed for this class of article, it is not possible to start from non-woven cloth - even if non-woven cloths cannot normally be made from yarn. In such cases, the starting material would normally be at the stage before yarn - that is, the fibre stage.3.6. Where, in a rule in the list, two percentages are given for the maximum value of non-originating materials that can be used, then these percentages may not be added together. In other words, the maximum value of all the non-originating materials used may never exceed the higher of the percentages given. Furthermore, the individual percentages must not be exceeded, in relation to the particular materials to which they apply.Note 4:4.1. The term \"natural fibres\" is used in the list to refer to fibres other than artificial or synthetic fibres. It is restricted to the stages before spinning takes place, including waste, and, unless otherwise specified, includes fibres which have been carded, combed or otherwise processed, but not spun.4.2. The term \"natural fibres\" includes horsehair of heading 0503, silk of headings 5002 and 5003, as well as wool-fibres and fine or coarse animal hair of headings 5101 to 5105, cotton fibres of headings 5201 to 5203, and other vegetable fibres of headings 5301 to 5305.4.3. The terms \"textile pulp\", \"chemical materials\" and \"paper-making materials\" are used in the list to describe the materials, not classified in Chapters 50 to 63, which can be used to manufacture artificial, synthetic or paper fibres or yarns.4.4. The term \"man-made staple fibres\" is used in the list to refer to synthetic or artificial filament tow, staple fibres or waste, of headings 5501 to 5507.Note 5:5.1. Where, for a given product in the list, reference is made to this Note, the conditions set out in column 3 shall not be applied to any basic textile materials used in the manufacture of this product and which, taken together, represent 10 % or less of the total weight of all the basic textile materials used. (See also Notes 5.3 and 5.4)5.2. However, the tolerance mentioned in Note 5.1 may be applied only to mixed products which have been made from two or more basic textile materials.The following are the basic textile materials:- silk,- wool,- coarse animal hair,- fine animal hair,- horsehair,- cotton,- paper-making materials and paper,- flax,- true hemp,- jute and other textile bast fibres,- sisal and other textile fibres of the genus Agave,- coconut, abaca, ramie and other vegetable textile fibres,- synthetic man-made filaments,- artificial man-made filaments,- current-conducting filaments,- synthetic man-made staple fibres of polypropylene,- synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyester,- synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyamide,- synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyacrylonitrile,- synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyimide,- synthetic man-made staple fibres of polytetrafluoroethylene,- synthetic man-made staple fibres of poly(phenylene sulphide),- synthetic man-made staple fibres of poly(vinyl chloride),- other synthetic man-made staple fibres,- artificial man-made staple fibres of viscose,- other artificial man-made staple fibres,- yarn made of polyurethane segmented with flexible segments of polyether, whether or not gimped,- yarn made of polyurethane segmented with flexible segments of polyester, whether or not gimped,- products of heading 5605 (metallised yarn) incorporating strip consisting of a core of aluminium foil or of a core of plastic film whether or not coated with aluminium powder, of a width not exceeding 5 mm, sandwiched by means of a transparent or coloured adhesive between two layers of plastic film,- other products of heading 5605.Example:A yarn, of heading 5205, made from cotton fibres of heading 5203 and synthetic staple fibres of heading 5506, is a mixed yarn. Therefore, non-originating synthetic staple fibres which do not satisfy the origin-rules (which require manufacture from chemical materials or textile pulp) may be used, provided that their total weight does not exceed 10 % of the weight of the yarn.Example:A woollen fabric, of heading 5112, made from woollen yarn of heading 5107 and synthetic yarn of staple fibres of heading 5509, is a mixed fabric. Therefore, synthetic yarn which does not satisfy the origin-rules (which require manufacture from chemical materials or textile pulp), or woollen yarn which does not satisfy the origin-rules (which require manufacture from natural fibres, not carded or combed or otherwise prepared for spinning), or a combination of the two, may be used, provided that their total weight does not exceed 10 % of the weight of the fabric.Example:Tufted textile fabric, of heading 5802, made from cotton yarn of heading 5205 and cotton fabric of heading 5210, is a only mixed product if the cotton fabric is itself a mixed fabric made from yarns classified in two separate headings, or if the cotton yarns used are themselves mixtures.Example:If the tufted textile fabric concerned had been made from cotton yarn of heading 5205 and synthetic fabric of heading 5407, then, obviously, the yarns used are two separate basic textile materials and the tufted textile fabric is, accordingly, a mixed product.5.3. In the case of products incorporating \"yarn made of polyurethane segmented with flexible segments of polyether, whether or not gimped\", this tolerance is 20 % in respect of this yarn.5.4. In the case of products incorporating \"strip consisting of a core of aluminium foil or of a core of plastic film whether or not coated with aluminium powder, of a width not exceeding 5 mm, sandwiched by means of a transparent or coloured adhesive between two layers of plastic film\", this tolerance is 30 % in respect of this strip.Note 6:6.1. Where, in the list, reference is made to this Note, textile materials (with the exception of linings and interlinings), which do not satisfy the rule set out in the list in column 3 for the made-up product concerned, may be used, provided that they are classified in a heading other than that of the product and that their value does not exceed 8 % of the ex-works price of the product.6.2. Without prejudice to Note 6.3, materials, which are not classified within Chapters 50 to 63, may be used freely in the manufacture of textile products, whether or not they contain textiles.Example:If a rule in the list provides that, for a particular textile item (such as trousers), yarn must be used, this does not prevent the use of metal items, such as buttons, because buttons are not classified within Chapters 50 to 63. For the same reason, it does not prevent the use of slide-fasteners, even though slide-fasteners normally contain textiles.6.3. Where a percentage-rule applies, the value of materials which are not classified within Chapters 50 to 63 must be taken into account when calculating the value of the non-originating materials incorporated.Note 7:7.1. For the purposes of headings ex 2707, 2713 to 2715, ex 2901, ex 2902 and ex 3403, the \"specific processes\" are the following:(a) vacuum-distillation;(b) redistillation by a very thorough fractionation-process(1),(c) cracking;(d) reforming;(e) extraction by means of selective solvents;(f) the process comprising all of the following operations: processing with concentrated sulphuric acid, oleum or sulphuric anhydride; neutralisation with alkaline agents; decolourisation and purification with naturally-active earth, activated earth, activated charcoal or bauxite;(g) polymerisation;(h) alkylation;(i) isomerisation.7.2. For the purposes of headings 2710, 2711 and 2712, the \"specific processes\" are the following:(a) vacuum-distillation;(b) redistillation by a very thorough fractionation-process(2),(c) cracking;(d) reforming;(e) extraction by means of selective solvents;(f) the process comprising all of the following operations: processing with concentrated sulphuric acid, oleum or sulphuric anhydride; neutralisation with alkaline agents; decolourisation and purification with naturally-active earth, activated earth, activated charcoal or bauxite;(g) polymerisation;(h) alkylation;(ij) isomerisation;(k) in respect of heavy oils of heading ex 2710 only, desulphurisation with hydrogen, resulting in a reduction of at least 85 % of the sulphur-content of the products processed (ASTM D 1266-59 T method);(l) in respect of products of heading 2710 only, deparaffining by a process other than filtering;(m) in respect of heavy oils of heading ex 2710 only, treatment with hydrogen, at a pressure of more than 20 bar and a temperature of more than 250 °C, with the use of a catalyst, other than to effect desulphurisation, when the hydrogen constitutes an active element in a chemical reaction. The further treatment, with hydrogen, of lubricating oils of heading ex 2710 (e.g. hydrofinishing or decolourisation), in order, more especially, to improve colour or stability shall not, however, be deemed to be a specific process;(n) in respect of fuel oils of heading ex 2710 only, atmospheric distillation, on condition that less than 30 % of these products distils, by volume, including losses, at 300 °C, by the ASTM D 86 method;(o) in respect of heavy oils other than gas oils and fuel oils of heading ex 2710 only, treatment by means of a high-frequency electrical brush-discharge;(p) in respect of crude products (other than petroleum jelly, ozokerite, lignite wax or peat wax, paraffin wax containing by weight less than 0,75 % of oil) of heading ex 2712 only, de-oiling by fractional crystallisation.7.3. For the purposes of headings ex 2707, 2713 to 2715, ex 2901, ex 2902 and ex 3403, simple operations, such as cleaning, decanting, desalting, water-separation, filtering, colouring, marking, obtaining a sulphur-content as a result of mixing products with different sulphur-contents, or any combination of these operations or like operations, do not confer origin.7.4. Redistillation by a very thorough fractionation process means distillation (other than topping) by a continuous or batch process employed in industrial installations using distillates of subheading Nos 2710 11 to 2710 99, 2711 11, 2711 12 to 2711 19, 2711 21 and 2711 29 (other than propane of a purity of 99 % or more) to obtain:1. isolated high-purity hydrocarbons (90 % or more in the case of olefins and 95 % or more in the case of other hydrocarbons), mixtures of isomers having the same organic composition being regarded as isolated hydrocarbons;only those process by means of which at least three different products are obtained are admissible, but this restriction does not apply in any instance where the process consists in the separation of isomers. In so far this concerns xylenes, ethylbenzene is included with xylene isomers;2.

Recognition of status for animal diseases, infections in animals or pests1. As regards animal diseases and infections in animals (including zoonoses), the following shall apply:(a) The importing Party shall recognise for trade the animal health status of the exporting Party or its regions as determined by the exporting Party in accordance with Appendix IV.A., with respect to animal diseases specified in Appendix III.A.(b) Where a Party considers that it has, for its territory or a region, a special status with respect to a specific animal disease other than those in Appendix III.A., it may request recognition of this status in accordance with the criteria set out in Appendix IV.C. The importing Party may request guarantees in respect of imports of live animals and animal products, which are appropriate to the agreed status of the Parties.(c) The status of the territories or regions, or the status in a sector or sub-sector of the Parties related to the prevalence or incidence of an animal disease other than those in Appendix III.A. or infections in animals, and/or the associated risk, as appropriate, as defined by the international standard setting organisations recognised by the WTO SPS Agreement, is recognised by the Parties as the basis for trade between them. The importing Party may request guarantees in respect of imports of live animals and animal products, which are appropriate to the defined status in accordance with the recommendations of the standard setting organisations, as appropriate.(d) Without prejudice to Articles 8 and 14, and unless the importing Party raises an explicit objection and requests supportive or additional information or consultations and/or verification, each Party shall take without undue delay the necessary legislative and administrative measures to allow trade on the basis of the provisions of subparagraphs (a), (b) and (c).2. As regards pests, the following shall apply:(a) The Parties recognise for trade their pest status in respect to pests specified in Appendix III.B.(b) Without prejudice to Articles 8 and 14, and unless the importing Party raises an explicit objection and requests supportive or additional information or consultations and/or verification, each Party shall take without undue delay the necessary legislative and administrative measures to allow trade on the basis of the provision of subparagraph (a).B. Recognition of regionalisation3. The Parties recognise the concept of regionalisation, which they agree to apply to trade between them.4. The Parties agree that regionalisation decisions for animal and fish diseases listed in Appendix III.A. and for pests listed in Appendix III.B. must be taken in accordance with the provisions of Appendix IV.A. and Appendix IV.B., respectively.5. (a) As regards animal diseases and in accordance with the provisions of Article 13, the exporting Party seeking recognition of its regionalisation decision by the importing Party shall notify its measures with full explanation and supporting data for its determinations and decisions. Without prejudice to Article 14, and unless the importing Party raises an explicit objection and requests additional information or consultations and/or verification within 15 working days following receipt of the notification, the regionalisation decision so notified shall be construed as accepted.(b) Consultations referred to in subparagraph (a) shall take place in accordance with Article 13(3). The importing Party shall assess the additional information within 15 working days following receipt of the additional information. The verification referred to in subparagraph (a) shall be carried out in accordance with Article 10 and within 25 working days following receipt of the request for verification.6. (a) As regards pests, each Party shall ensure that trade in plants, plant products and other goods takes account of the pest status in a region recognised by the other Party. A Party seeking recognition of its regionalisation decision by the other Party shall notify its measures with full explanation and supporting data for its determinations and decisions, as guided by the relevant FAO International Standards for Phytosanitary Measures, including No 4 \"Requirements for the establishment of Pest Free Areas\", No 8 \"Determination of Pest Status in an area\", and other International Standards for Phytosanitary Measures as the Parties deem appropriate. Without prejudice to Article 14, and unless a Party raises an explicit objection and requests additional information or consultations and/or verification within three months following the notification, the regionalisation decision so notified shall be construed as accepted.(b) Consultations referred to in subparagraph (a) shall take place in accordance with Article 13(3). The importing Party shall assess the additional information within three months following receipt of the additional information. The verification referred to in subparagraph (a) shall be carried out in accordance with Article 10 and within 12 months following receipt of the request for verification, taking into account the biology of the pest and the crop concerned.7. After finalisation of the procedures of paragraph 4, 5 and 6, and without prejudice to Article 14, each Party shall take, without undue delay, the necessary legislative and administrative measures to allow trade on that basis.Article 7Determination of equivalence1. Equivalence may be recognised in relation to an individual measure and/or groups of measures and/or systems applicable to a sector or sub-sector.2. In the determination of equivalence, the Parties shall follow the consultation process of paragraph 3. This process shall include the objective demonstration of equivalence by the exporting Party and the objective assessment of this demonstration by the importing Party with a view to possibly recognising equivalence by the latter.3. Upon request of the exporting Party concerning a measure or measures affecting one or more sector(s) or sub-sector(s), the Parties shall, within three months after receipt by the importing Party of such request, initiate the consultation process which includes the steps set out in Appendix VI. However, in case of multiple requests from the exporting Party, the Parties, on request of the importing Party, shall agree within the Committee referred to in Article 16 on a time schedule in which they shall initiate the process referred to in this paragraph.4. Unless otherwise mutually agreed, the importing Party shall finalise the assessment of equivalence within 180 days after having received from the exporting Party its demonstration of equivalence, except for seasonal crops when it is justifiable to delay the assessment to permit verification of phytosanitary measures during a suitable period of growth of a crop.The sectors or sub-sectors of priority of each Party for which this process may be initiated, are to be set out, where appropriate, in order of priority in Appendix V.A. The Committee referred to in Article 16 may amend, by means of decision, this list, including its order of priority.5. The importing Party may withdraw or suspend equivalence on the basis of any amendment by one of the Parties of measures affecting equivalence, provided that the following procedures are followed:(a) In accordance with the provisions of Article 12, the exporting Party shall inform the importing Party of any proposal for amendment of its measures for which equivalence of measures is recognised and the likely effect of the proposed measures on the equivalence which has been recognised. Within 30 working days of receipt of this information, the importing Party shall inform the exporting Party whether or not equivalence would continue to be recognised on basis of the proposed measures.(b) In accordance with the provisions of Article 12, the importing Party shall inform the exporting Party of any proposal for amendment of its measures on which recognition of equivalence has been based and the likely effect of the proposed measures on the equivalence which has been recognised. Should the importing Party not continue to recognise equivalence, the Parties may agree on the conditions to re-initiate the process referred to in paragraph 3 on the basis of the proposed measures.6. Without prejudice to Article 14, the importing Party may not withdraw or suspend equivalence before the proposed new measures of either Party enter into force.7. The recognition or withdrawal or suspension of equivalence rests solely with the importing Party acting in accordance with its administrative and legislative framework including, as regards plants, plant products and other goods, appropriate communications in accordance with FAO International Standard for Phytosanitary Measures No 13 \"Guidelines for the notification of non-compliances and emergency action\" and other International Standards for Phytosanitary Measures, as appropriate. That Party shall provide to the exporting Party in writing full explanation and supporting data used for the determinations and decisions covered by this Article. In case of non-recognition, withdrawal or suspension of equivalence, the importing Party shall indicate to the exporting Party the required conditions on which the process referred to in paragraph 3 may be reinitiated. When necessary, the importing Party may provide technical assistance to the exporting Party in accordance with the provisions of Article 24 of the Association Agreement.Article 8Transparency and trade conditions1. For commodities referred to in Appendices I.A. and I.B., the Parties agree to apply general import conditions. Without prejudice to the decisions taken in accordance with Article 6, the import conditions of the importing Party shall be applicable to the total territory of the exporting Party. Upon entry into force of this Agreement and in accordance with the provisions of Article 12, the importing Party shall inform the exporting Party of its sanitary and phytosanitary import requirements for commodities referred to in Appendices I.A and I.B. This information shall include, as appropriate, the models for the official certificates or attestations, as prescribed by the importing Party.2. (a) For the notification by the Parties of amendments or proposed amendments of the conditions referred to in paragraph 1, they shall comply with the provisions of the SPS Agreement and subsequent decisions, as regards notification of measures. Without prejudice of the provisions of Article 14, the importing Party shall take into account the transport time between the Parties to establish the date of entering into force of the amended conditions referred to in paragraph 1.(b) If the importing Party fails to comply with these notification requirements, it shall continue to accept the certificate or attestation guaranteeing the previously applicable conditions until 30 days after entering into force of the amended import conditions.3. (a) Within 90 days after recognition of equivalence, the Parties shall take the necessary legislative and administrative measures to implement the recognition of equivalence in order to allow on that basis trade between them of commodities referred to in Appendices I.A. and I.B. in sectors and sub-sectors, for which all respective sanitary and phytosanitary measures of the exporting Party are recognised as equivalent by the importing Party. For these commodities, the model for the official certificate or official document required by the importing Party may, then, be replaced by a certificate drawn up as provided for in Appendix IX.B.(b) For commodities in sectors or sub-sectors for which one or some but not all measures are recognised as equivalent, trade shall continue on the basis of compliance with the conditions referred to in paragraph 1.

The importing Party shall draw up lists of provisionally approved establishments and shall make these lists publicly available.4. Conditions and procedures for provisional approval:(a) If import of the animal product concerned from the exporting Party has been authorised by the importing Party and the relevant import conditions and certification requirements for the products concerned have been established.(b) If the competent authority of the exporting Party has provided the importing Party with satisfactory guarantees that the establishments appearing on its list or lists meet the relevant health requirements of the importing Party and has officially approved the establishment appearing on the lists for exportation to the importing Party.(c) The competent authority of the exporting Party must have a real power to suspend the activities for exportation to the importing Party from an establishment for which that authority has provided guarantees, in the event of non-compliance with the said guarantees.(d) Verification in accordance with the provisions of Article 10 of the Agreement by the importing Party may be part of the provisional approval procedure. This verification concerns the structure and organisation of the competent authority responsible for the approval of the establishment as well as the powers available to that competent authority and the guarantees that it can provide in regard to the implementation of importing Party's rules. These checks may include on the spot inspection of a certain representative number of establishments appearing on the list or lists provided by the exporting Party.Taking into account the specific structure and division of competence within the Community, such verification in the Community may concern individual Member States.(e) Based on the results of the verification provided for in (d), the importing Party may amend the existing list of establishments.Appendix VIPROCESS OF DETERMINATION OF EQUIVALENCE1. Principles(a) Equivalence can be determined for an individual measure and/or groups of measures and/or systems related to a certain commodity or categories of commodities.(b) The consideration of equivalence by the importing Party of a request by the exporting Party for recognition of its measures with regards to a specific commodity shall not be a reason to disrupt trade or suspend on-going imports from the exporting party of the commodity in question.(c) Determination of equivalence of measures is an interactive process between the exporting Party and the importing Party. The process consists of an objective demonstration of equivalence of individual measures by the exporting Party and the objective assessment of this demonstration with a view to the possible recognition of equivalence by the importing Party.(d) The final recognition of equivalence of the relevant measures of the exporting Party rests solely with the importing Party.2. Preconditions(a) The exporting Party can only initiate the process of determination of equivalence when the importing Party has recognised the exporting Party for import of the commodity for which equivalence is sought in its agreed country list. The listing depends on the health or pest status, the legislation and the effectiveness of the inspection and control system related to the commodity in the exporting Party. To this end the legislation in the sector concerned shall be taken into account, as well as the structure of the competent authority of the exporting Party, its command chain, its authority, its operational procedures and resources, and the performance of the competent authorities as regards inspection and control systems, including its level of enforcement related to the commodity and the regularity and rapidity of information to the importing Party in case of identified hazards. This recognition may be supported by documentation, verification and earlier documented experience.(b) The Parties shall initiate the process of determination of equivalence based upon the priorities established in Appendix V.A.(c) The exporting Party shall only initiate the process when no safeguard measures imposed by the importing Party apply to the exporting Party as regards the commodity.3. The process(a) The exporting Party initiates the process by submitting to the importing Party a request for recognition of equivalence of an individual measure and/or groups of measures and/or systems for a commodity or a category of commodities in a sector or sub-sector.(b) When appropriate, this request includes also the request and required documentation for approval by the importing Party on the basis of equivalence of any programme or plan of the exporting Party required by the importing Party as a condition for allowing import of that commodity (e.g. residue plan).(c) With this request, the exporting Party:(i) explains the importance for trade of that commodity;(ii) identifies the individual measure(s) with which it can comply with out of the total of the measures expressed in the import conditions of the importing Party applicable to that commodity;(iii) identifies the individual measure(s) for which it seeks equivalence out of the total of the measures expressed in the import conditions of the importing Party, applicable to that commodity.(d) In reply to this request the importing Party explains the overall and individual objective and the rationale behind its measure(s), including the identification of the risk.(e) With this explanation, the importing Party informs the exporting Party on the relationship of its domestic measures and the import conditions for that commodity.(f) The exporting Party objectively demonstrates to the importing Party that the measures that it has identified are equivalent to the import conditions for that commodity.(g) The importing Party objectively assesses the demonstration of equivalence by the exporting party.(h) The importing Party concludes whether equivalence is achieved or not.(i) The importing Party provides to the exporting Party full explanation and supporting data for its determination and decision if so required by the exporting Party.4. Demonstration of equivalence of measures by the exporting party and assessment of this demonstration by the importing Party(a) The exporting Party shall objectively demonstrate equivalence for each of the identified measures of the importing Party expressed in its import conditions. When appropriate, equivalence shall objectively be demonstrated for any plan or programme required by the importing Party as a condition to allow import (e.g. residue plan, etc).(b) Objective demonstration and assessment in this context should be based, as far as possible, on:- internationally recognised standards; and/or- standards based on proper scientific evidence; and/or- risk assessment; and/or- objective earlier documented experience; and- legal status or level of administrative status of the measures; and- level of implementation and enforcement on the basis of in particular:- corresponding results of surveillance and monitoring programmes;- inspection results by the exporting Party;- results of analysis with recognised analysis methods;- verification and import check results by the importing Party;- the performance of the competent authorities of the exporting Party; and- earlier experiences.5. Judgement by the importing PartyIn case the importing Party arrives at a negative conclusion, it shall provide the exporting Party with an explanation.Appendix VIIGUIDELINES FOR CONDUCTING VERIFICATIONSVerifications may be carried out on the basis of or audits and/or on the spot checks.For the purposes of this Appendix:(a) the \"auditee\" is the Party subject to the verification;(b) the \"auditor\" is the Party that carries out the verification1. General principles of verification1.1. Verifications should be made in Cooperation between the \"auditor\" and the \"auditee\" in accordance with the provisions set out in this Appendix.1.2. Verifications should be designed to check the effectiveness of the controls of the auditee rather than to reject individual animals, groups of animals, consignments of food establishments or individual lots of plants or plant products. Where a verification reveals a serious risk to animal, plant or human health, the auditee shall take immediate corrective action. The process may include study of the relevant regulations, method of implementation, assessment of the end result, level of compliance and subsequent corrective actions.1.3. The frequency of verifications should be based on performance. A low level of performance should result in an increased frequency of verifications; unsatisfactory performance must be corrected by the auditee to the auditor's satisfaction.1.4. Verifications, and the decisions based on them, shall be made in a transparent and consistent manner.2. Principles relating to the auditorThe auditors should prepare a plan, preferably in accordance with recognised international standards, that covers the following points:2.1. the subject, depth and scope of the verification;2.2. the date and place of the verification, along with a timetable up to and including the issue of the final report;2.3. the language or languages in which the verification will be conducted and the report written;2.4. the identity of the auditors including, if a team approach is used, the leader. Specialised professional skills may be required to carry out verification of specialised systems and programmes;2.5. a schedule of meetings with officials and visits to establishments or facilities, as appropriate. The identity of establishments or facilities to be visited need not be stated in advance;2.6. subject to provisions on freedom of information, respect of commercial confidentiality shall be observed by the auditor. Conflicts of interest must be avoided;2.7. respect of the rules governing occupational health and safety, and the rights of the operator. This plan should be reviewed in advance with representatives of the auditee.3. Principles relating to the auditeeThe following principles apply to actions taken by the auditee, in order to facilitate verification:3.1. The auditee must Cooperate fully with the auditor and should nominate personnel responsible for this task. Cooperation may include, for example:- access to all relevant regulations and standards,- access to compliance programmes and appropriate records and documents,- access to audit and inspection reports,- documentation concerning corrective actions and sanctions,- facilitating entry to establishments.3.2. The auditee must operate a documented programme to demonstrate to the auditor that standards are being met on a consistent and uniform basis.4. Procedures4.1. Opening meetingAn opening meeting should be held between representatives of the Parties. At this meeting the auditor will be responsible for reviewing the verification plan and confirming that adequate resources, documentation, and any other necessary facilities are available for conducting the verification.4.2. Document reviewThe document review may consist of a review of the documents and records referred to in paragraph 3.1, the structures and powers of the auditee, and any relevant changes to inspection and certification systems since the entry into force of this Agreement or since the previous verification, with emphasis on the implementation of elements of the system of inspection and certification for animals, animal products plants or plant products of interest. This may include an examination of relevant inspection and certification records and documents.4.3. On the spot checks4.3.1. The decision to include this step should be based on a risk assessment, taking into account factors such as the animals, animal products, plants or plant products concerned, the history of conformity with requirements by the industry sector or exporting country, the volume of product produced and imported or exported, changes in infrastructure and the national inspection and certification systems.4.3.2. On the spot checks may involve visits to production and manufacturing facilities, food-handling or storage areas and control laboratories to check on compliance with the information contained in the documentary material referred to in 4.2.4.4. Follow-up verificationWhere a follow-up verification is being conducted in order to verify the correction of deficiencies, it may be sufficient to examine only those points which have been found to require correction.5. Working documentsForms for reporting audit findings and conclusions should be standardised as much as possible in order to make the approach to verification more uniform, transparent and efficient. The working documents may include any checklists of elements to evaluate. Such checklists may cover:- legislation;- structure and operations of inspection and certification services;- establishment details and working procedures, - health statistics, sampling plans and results;- compliance action and procedures;- reporting and complaint procedures; and- training programmes.6. Closing meetingA closing meeting shall be held between representatives of the Parties, including, where appropriate, officials responsible for the national inspection and certification programs. At this meeting the auditor shall present the findings of the verification. The information shall be presented in a clear, concise manner so that the conclusions of the audit are clearly understood. An action plan for correction of any deficiencies noted shall be drawn up by the auditee, preferably with target dates for completion.7. ReportThe draft report of verification shall be forwarded to the auditee within 20 working days. The auditee shall have 25 working days to comment on the draft report. Comments made by the auditee shall be attached to and, where appropriate included in the final report. However, where a significant public, animal or plant health risk has been identified during the verification, the auditee shall be informed as quickly as possible and in any case within 10 working days following the end of the verification.Appendix VIIIIMPORT CHECKS AND INSPECTION FEESA. Principles of import checksImport checks consist of documentary checks, identity checks and physical checksAs regards animals and animal products, the physical checks and its frequency applied shall be based on the risk associated with such imports.In carrying out the checks for plant health purposes, the importing Party shall ensure that the plants, plant products and other goods and their packaging shall be meticulously inspected on an official basis, either in their entirety or by representative sample, and that if necessary the vehicles transporting them shall be inspected meticulously on an official basis in order to make sure, as far as can be determined, that they are not contaminated by pests.In the event that the checks reveal non-conformity with the relevant standards and/or requirements, the importing Party shall take official measures proportionate to the risk involved.

Principles of certificationPlants and plant products and other goods:In respect of certification of plants and plant products and other goods, the competent authorities shall apply the principles laid down in the FAO International Standards for Phytosanitary Measures No 7 \"Export Certification System\" and No 12 \"Guidelines for Phytosanitary Certificates\".Animals and animal products:1. The competent authorities of the Parties shall ensure that certifying officers have a satisfactory knowledge of the veterinary legislation as regards the animals or animal products to be certified and, in general, are informed as to the rules to be followed for drawing up and issuing the certificates and - if necessary - as to the nature and extent of the enquiries, tests or examinations which should be carried out before certification.2. Certifying officers must not certify data of which they have no personal knowledge or which cannot be ascertained by them.3. Certifying officers must not sign blank or incomplete certificates, or certificates relating to animals or animal products, which they have not inspected or which have passed out of their control. Where a certificate is signed on the basis of another certificate or attestation, the certifying officer shall be in possession of that document before signing.4. A certifying officer may certify data which have been:(a) ascertained on the basis of paragraphs 1 to 3 by another person so authorised by the competent authority and acting under the control of that authority, provided that certifying authority can verify the accuracy of the data; or(b) obtained, within the context of monitoring programmes, by reference to officially recognised quality assurance schemes or by means of an epidemiological surveillance system where this is authorised under veterinary legislation.5. The competent authorities of the Parties shall take all necessary steps to ensure the integrity of certification. In particular they shall ensure that certifying officers designated by them:(a) have a status which ensures their impartiality and have no direct commercial interest in the animals or products being certified or in the holdings or establishments in which they originate; and(b) are fully aware of the significance of the contents of each certificate which they sign.6. Certificates shall be drawn up as to ensure a link between the certificate and the consignment, at least in a language understood by the certifying officer and at least in one of the official languages of the importing Party as set out in C.7. Each competent authority shall be in a position to link certificates with the relevant certifying officer and ensure that a copy of all certificates issued is available for a period to be determined by it.8. Each Party shall introduce such checks and have such control measures taken as are necessary to prevent the issuing of false or misleading certification and the fraudulent production or use of certificates purported to be issued for the purposes of veterinary legislation.9. Without prejudice to any legal proceedings or penalties, the competent authorities shall carry out investigations or checks and take appropriate measures to penalise any instances of false or misleading certification, which are brought to their attention. Such measures may include the temporary suspension of the certifying officers from their duties until the investigation is over. In particular:(a) if it is found in the course of the checks that a certifying officer has knowingly issued a fraudulent certificate, the competent authority shall take all necessary steps to ensure, as far as is possible, that the person concerned cannot repeat the offence;(b) if it is found in the course of the checks that an individual or an undertaking has made fraudulent use of or has altered an official certificate, the competent authority shall take all necessary measures to ensure, as far as possible, that the individual or undertaking cannot repeat the offence. Such measures may include a refusal subsequently to issue an official certificate to the person or undertaking concerned.B. Certificate referred to in Article 8(3)The health attestation in the certificate reflects the status of equivalence of the commodity concerned. The health attestation states compliance with the production standards of the exporting Party recognised equivalent by the importing Party.C. Official languages for certificationImport into CommunityPlants, plant products and other goods:The certificate must be drawn up in at least one of the official languages of the Community and preferably in one of the official languages of the Member State of destination.Animals and animal products:The health certificate must be drawn up in at least one of the official languages of the Member State of destination and in one of those of the Member State in which the import checks provided for in Article 11 are carried out.Import into ChileThe health certificate must be drawn up in Spanish or another language, in which case a translation into Spanish must be provided.Appendix XOUTSTANDING ISSUESTo be considered by the Committee referred to in Article 16 for completion.Appendix XICONTACT POINTS AND WEB-SITESA.

It was agreed that this approach could be applied subject to the following understanding:(i) it does not conflict with the provisions of this Agreement;(ii) no presumption has been created as to the degree of liberalisation to which a Party is committing itself under this Agreement.The Community, on the basis of negotiations, and subject to conditions and qualifications where specified, has inscribed in its schedule specific commitments conforming to the approach set out below.A. Market AccessCross-border Trade1. The Community shall permit non-resident suppliers of financial services to supply, as a principal, through an intermediary or as an intermediary, and under terms and conditions that accord national treatment, the following services:(a) insurance of risks relating to:(i) maritime shipping and commercial aviation and space launching and freight (including satellites), with such insurance to cover any or all of the following: the goods being transported, the vehicle transporting the goods and any liability arising therefrom; and(ii) goods in international transit;(b) reinsurance and retrocession and the services auxiliary to insurance as referred to in subparagraph (iv) of Article 117(9);(c) provision and transfer of financial information and financial data processing as referred to in subparagraph (xv) of Article 117(9) and advisory and other auxiliary services, excluding intermediation, relating to banking and other financial services as referred to in subparagraph (xvi) of Article 117(9).2. The Community shall permit its residents to purchase in the territory of Chile the financial services indicated in:(a) subparagraph 1(a);(b) subparagraph 1(b); and(c) subparagraphs (v) to (xvi) of Article 117(9).Commercial Presence3. The Community shall grant financial service suppliers of Chile the right to establish or expand within its territory, including through the acquisition of existing enterprises, a commercial presence.4. The Community may impose terms, conditions and procedures for authorisation of the establishment and expansion of a commercial presence in so far as they do not circumvent its obligation under paragraph 3 and they are consistent with the other obligations of this Agreement.Temporary Entry of Personnel5. (a) The Community shall permit temporary entry into its territory of the following personnel of a financial service supplier of Chile that is establishing or has established a commercial presence in the territory of the Community:(i) senior managerial personnel possessing proprietary information essential to the establishment, control and operation of the services of the financial service supplier; and(ii) specialists in the operation of the financial service supplier.(b) The Community shall permit, subject to the availability of qualified personnel in its territory, temporary entry into its territory of the following personnel associated with a commercial presence of a financial service supplier of Chile:(i) specialists in computer services, telecommunication services and accounts of the financial service supplier; and(ii) actuarial and legal specialists.Non-discriminatory Measures6. The Community shall endeavour to remove or to limit any significant adverse effects on financial service suppliers of Chile of:(a) non-discriminatory measures that prevent financial service suppliers from offering in the Community's territory, in the form determined by the Community, all the financial services permitted by the Community;(b) non-discriminatory measures that limit the expansion of the activities of financial service suppliers into the entire territory of the Community;(c) measures of the Community, when it applies the same measures to the supply of both banking and securities services, and a financial service supplier of Chile concentrates its activities in the provision of securities services; and(d) other measures that, although respecting the provisions of this Agreement, affect adversely the ability of financial service suppliers of Chile to operate, compete or enter the Community's market;provided that any action taken under this paragraph would not unfairly discriminate against financial service suppliers of the Party taking such action.7. With respect to the non-discriminatory measures referred to in subparagraphs 6(a) and (b), the Community shall endeavour not to limit or restrict the present degree of market opportunities nor the benefits already enjoyed by financial service suppliers of Chile as a class in the territory of the Community, provided that this commitment does not result in unfair discrimination against financial service suppliers of the Community.B. National Treatment1. Under terms and conditions that accord national treatment, the Community shall grant to financial service suppliers of Chile established in its territory access to payment and clearing systems operated by public entities, and to official funding and refinancing facilities available in the normal course of ordinary business. This paragraph is not intended to confer access to the Community 's lender of last resort facilities.2. When membership or participation in, or access to, any self-regulatory body, securities or futures exchange or market, clearing agency, or any other organisation or association, is required by the Community in order for financial service suppliers of Chile to supply financial services on an equal basis with financial service suppliers of the the Community, or when the Community provides directly or indirectly such entities, privileges or advantages in supplying financial services, the Community shall ensure that such entities accord national treatment to Chilean financial service suppliers resident in its territory.C. DefinitionsFor the purposes of this approach:1. A non-resident supplier of financial services is a financial service supplier of Chile which supplies a financial service into the territory of the Community from an establishment located in the territory of Chile, regardless of whether such a financial service supplier has or has not a commercial presence in the territory of the Community.2. \"Commercial presence\" means an enterprise within the Community's territory for the supply of financial services and includes wholly- or partly-owned subsidiaries, joint ventures, partnerships, sole proprietorships, franchising operations, branches, agencies, representative offices or other organisations.SCHEDULE OF SPECIFIC COMMITMENTS ON FINANCIAL SERVICES(Referred to in Article 120)PART BCHILE'S SCHEDULE(This is authentic in the Spanish language only)Introductory note: Chile may complete the classification of financial services contained in this schedule on the basis of the Central Product Classification (CPC) or other classification deemed appropriate for the Chilean financial sector and reclassify services already classified on the basis of a new version of the CPC or other appropriate classification.>TABLE>ANNEX IX(Referred to in Article 127 of the Association Agreement)AUTHORITIES RESPONSIBLE FOR FINANCIAL SERVICESFor the Community:The Community will present and up-date its list of the authorities responsible for financial services.For Chile:Ministry of FinanceANNEX X(Referred to in Article 132 of the Association Agreement)SCHEDULES OF SPECIFIC COMMITMENTS ON ESTABLISHMENTPART ACOMMUNITY'S SCHEDULEIntroductory Note1.

Except in so far as provided in paragraphs 3 and 4, entities shall provide no less than 40 days between the date on which the notice of intended procurement is published and the final date for the submission of tenders.Time-limits when using the selective tendering procedure2. Where an entity requires suppliers to satisfy qualification requirements in order to participate in a procurement, the entity shall provide no less than 25 days between the date on which the notice of intended procurement is published and the final date to submit the requests for participation and no less than 40 days between the date of issuance of the invitation to tender and the final date for submission of tenders.Possibilities for reducing the general time-limits3. Under the following circumstances, entities may establish a time period for tendering that is shorter than the periods referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2, provided that such time period is sufficiently long to enable suppliers to prepare and submit responsive tenders and is in no case less than 10 days prior to the final date for the submission of tenders:(a) where a notice of planned procurement has been published 40 days and not more than 12 months in advance;(b) in the case of the second or subsequent publications dealing with contracts of a recurring nature;(c) in the case where the entity procures off-the-shelf goods or services (goods or services with the same technical specifications as those of goods or services that are sold or offered for sale to, and customarily purchased by non-governmental buyers for non governmental purposes); the entity shall not reduce time-limits for this reason if the entity requires that potential suppliers be qualified for participation in the procurement before submitting tenders;(d) where a state of urgency duly substantiated by the procuring entity renders impracticable the periods specified in paragraphs 1 and 2;(e) when the period for the submission of tenders referred to in paragraph 2, for procurements by entities set out in Annexes XI and XII, Appendix 3, be fixed by mutual agreement between the entity and the selected suppliers.
