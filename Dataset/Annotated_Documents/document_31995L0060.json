Without prejudice to national provisions on fiscal marking, Member States shall apply a fiscal marker in accordance with the provisions of this Directive to:\n—\nall gas oil falling within CN code 2710 00 69 which has been released for consumption within the meaning of Article 6 of Directive 92/12/EEC and has been exempt from, or subject to, excise duty at a rate other than that laid down in Article 5 (1) of Directive 92/82/EEC;\n—\nkerosene falling within CN code 2710 00 55 which has been released for consumption within the meaning of Article 6 of Directive 92/12/EEC and has been exempt from, or subject to, excise duty at a rate other than that laid down in Article 8 (1) of Directive 92/82/EEC.\n2.   Member States may allow exceptions to the application of the fiscal marker provided for in paragraph 1 on grounds of public health or safety or for other technical reasons, provided they take appropriate fiscal supervision measures.\nMoreover, Ireland may decide not to use or allow use of this marker in accordance with Article 21 (4) of Directive 92/12/EEC. In such a situation Ireland shall inform the Commission, which shall inform the other Member States.\nArticle 2\n1.   The marker shall consist of a well-defined combination of chemical additives to be added under fiscal supervision before the mineral oils concerned are released for consumption.\nHowever,\n—\nin the case of direct deliveries from another Member State under a tax suspension arrangements outside a tax warehouse, Member States may require the marker to be added before the product leaves the tax warehouse of despatch;\n—\nMember States which adopted this measure before 1 January 1996 may, in certain exceptional cases or situations, allow markers to be added after the mineral oils in question are released for consumption under fiscal supervision. Any Member State which applies such a measure shall so inform the Commission. The Commission shall inform the other Member States of the measure. In the latter case, Member States may reimburse the excise duty paid when the product was released for consumption;\n—\nDenmark may, provided that the goods remain subject to fiscal control, delay the addition of the marker until the moment of final retail sale, at the latest.\n2.

The marker is to be added under fiscal supervision before the products are released for consumption, save in exceptional cases.\nEU countries may add a national marker or colour in addition to the marker provided for by the Directive.\nExceptions\nThere are exceptions, in certain circumstances, from the application of the fiscal marker on grounds of public health or safety or for technical reasons.\nIreland may decide not to use or allow use of this marker. If so, it must inform the Commission, which must then inform the other EU countries.\nDenmark may, provided that the goods remain subject to fiscal control, delay the addition of the marker until the moment of final retail sale.\nPenalties\nTo ensure that improper use of the marked products is avoided and, in particular, that the mineral oils in question cannot be used for combustion in the engine of a road-going motor vehicle, EU countries must determine the penalties to be imposed in the event of failure to comply with the directive.\nCommon marker\nCommission Implementing Decision 2011/544/EC  established Solvent Yellow 124 as the common fiscal marker. It was prolonged three times. The latest Implementing Decision (EU) 2017/74, which is currently in force, fixed the marking level of at least 6 mg and not more than 9 mg of marker per litre of mineral oil. This decision is to be reviewed by 31 December 2021 at the latest, in the light of technical developments in the field of marking systems (and taking into account the need to counteract the fraudulent use of mineral oils exempted from excise duty, or subject to a reduced excise duty rate).\nIn the meantime, the European Commission has launched a study to identify alternative products suitable for use as a fiscal marker in gas oils and kerosene. The Joint Research Centre of the Commission produced a report containing its findings on some of the available fiscal markers based on applications made by companies from the chemical industry following a call for expression of interest, issued by the Commission services. Work on the assessment of the candidate fiscal markers is ongoing.\nIf the Commission, after consulting the EU countries, decides that a better performing substance than Solvent Yellow 124 is available, Decision (EU) 2017/74 may be repealed prior to 2021.\nFROM WHEN DOES THE DIRECTIVE APPLY?\n              \nThe directive has applied since 26 December 1995.\nBACKGROUND\n              \nFor more information, see:\nExcise Duties: Other Energy Tax Legislation (European Commission).\nMAIN DOCUMENT\n            \nCouncil Directive 95/60/EC of 27 November 1995 on fiscal marking of gas oils and kerosene (OJ L 291, 6.12.1995, pp. 46–47)\nRELATED DOCUMENTS\n            \nCommission Implementing Decision (EU) 2017/74 of 25 November 2016 establishing a common fiscal marker for gas oils and kerosene (OJ L 10, 14.1.2017, pp. 7–9)\nCouncil Directive 2008/118/EC of 16 December 2008 concerning the general arrangements for excise duty and repealing Directive 92/12/EEC (OJ L 9, 14.1.2009, pp. 12–30)\nSuccessive amendments to Directive 2008/118/EC have been incorporated into the basic text.
