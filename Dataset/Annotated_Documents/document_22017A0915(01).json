The Parties hereby establish a Joint Committee consisting of representatives of the Parties.\n2.

The Parties agree to consult as quickly as possible, upon request by either Party, concerning matters of difference which may arise in the implementation of this Agreement. If there is a divergence of view in the application or interpretation of this Agreement, either Party may refer the matter to the Joint Committee. The Parties shall present all information required for a thorough examination of the issue to the Joint Committee, with a view to resolving differences in a timely and amicable manner.\n3.   In a case of special urgency, either Party shall immediately refer the matter to the Joint Committee and present all the information required for a thorough examination of the situation, with a view to seeking a timely and mutually acceptable resolution. Should the Joint Committee at the level of senior officials be unable to resolve the situation within a period of up to 15 days from the commencement of consultations and no later than 30 days from the date of the referral of the matter to the Joint Committee, the matter shall be submitted to ministers for urgent consideration for a further period of 15 days.\n4.

The Parties recognise that a case of special urgency may also serve as grounds for taking appropriate measures outside this Agreement, in accordance with the rights and obligations of the Parties under other agreements between the Parties or under general international law. In the Union, the decision to suspend would entail unanimity. In Australia, the decision to suspend would be taken by the Government of Australia in accordance with its laws and regulations.\n5.   The Parties agree that any decision to take appropriate measures in accordance with paragraph 4 must be duly substantiated. The decision shall be notified immediately to the other Party in writing.

The Parties consider that a particularly serious and substantial violation of Article 2(2) or Article 6(2) would have to be of an exceptional sort that threatens international peace and security.\n8.   In cases where a situation occurring in a third country could be considered equivalent in gravity and nature to a case of special urgency, the Parties shall endeavour to hold urgent consultations, at the request of either Party, to exchange views on the situation and consider possible responses.\nTITLE Х\nFINAL PROVISIONS\nArticle 58\nDefinitions\nFor the purposes of this Agreement, the term ‘the Parties’ means the Union or its Member States, or the Union and its Member States, in accordance with their respective competences, on the one hand, and Australia, on the other.\nArticle 59\nFinancial cooperation\n1.
