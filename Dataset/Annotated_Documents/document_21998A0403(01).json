ENVIRONMENT OF THE NORTH-EAST ATLANTIC\nTHE CONTRACTING PARTIES,\nRECOGNISING that the marine environment and the fauna and flora which it supports are of vital importance to all nations;\nRECOGNISING the inherent worth of the- marine environment of the North-East Atlantic and the necessity for providing coordinated protection for it;\nRECOGNISING that concerted action at national, regional and global levels is essential to prevent and eliminate marine pollution and to achieve sustainable management of the maritime area, that is, the management of human activities in such a manner that the marine ecosystem will continue to sustain the legitimate uses of the sea and will continue to meet the needs of present and future generations;\nMINDFUL that the ecological equilibrium and the legitimate uses of the sea are threatened by pollution;\nCONSIDERING the recommendations of the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment, held in Stockholm in June 1972;\nCONSIDERING also the results of the United Nations Conference on the Environment and Development held in Rio de Janeiro in June 1992;\nRECALLING the relevant provisions of customary international law reflected in Part XII of the United Nations Law of the Sea Convention and, in particular, Article 197 on global and regional cooperation for the protection and preservation of the marine environment;\nCONSIDERING that the common interests of States concerned with the same marine area should induce them to cooperate at regional or subregional levels;\nRECALLING the positive results obtained with the context of the Convention for the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping from Ships and Aircraft signed in Oslo on 15 February 1972, as amended by the Protocols of 2 March 1983 and 5 December 1989, and the Convention for the Prevention of Marine Pollution from Land-based Sources signed in Paris on 4 June 1974, as amended by the Protocol of 26 March 1986;\nCONVINCED that further international action to prevent and eliminate pollution of the sea should be taken without delay, as part of progressive and coherent measures to protect the marine environment;\nRECOGNISING that it may be desirable to adopt, on the regional level, more stringent measures with respect to the prevention and elimination of pollution of the marine environment or with respect to the protection of the marine environment against the adverse effects of human activities than are provided for in international conventions or agreements with a global scope;\nRECOGNISING that questions relating to the management of fisheries are appropriately regulated under international and regional agreements dealing specifically with such questions;\nCONSIDERING that the present Oslo and Paris Conventions do not adequately control some of the many sources of pollution, and that it is therefore justifiable to replace them with the present Convention, which addresses all sources of pollution of the marine environment and the adverse effects of human activities upon it, takes into account the precautionary principle and strengthens regional cooperation,\nHAVE AGREED as follows:\nArticle 1\nDefinitions\nFor the purposes

After such period, he shall inform the President of the International Court of Justice who shall make this appointment within a further two months' period.\n6.\n(a)\nThe arbitral tribunal shall decide according to the rules of international law and, in particular, those of the Convention.\n(b)\nAny arbitral tribunal constituted under the provisions of this Article shall draw up its own rules of procedure.\n(c)\nIn the event of a dispute as to whether the arbitral tribunal has jurisdiction, the matter shall be decided by the decision of the arbitral tribunal.\n7.\n(a)\nThe decisions of the arbitral tribunal, both on procedure and on substance, shall be taken by majority voting of its members.\n(b)\nThe arbitral tribunal may take all appropriate measures in order to establish the facts. It may, at the request of one of the parties, recommend essential interim measures of protection.\n(c)\nIf two or more arbitral tribunals constituted under the provisions of this Article are seized of requests with identical or similar subjects, they may inform themselves of the procedures for establishing the facts and take them into account as far as possible.\n(d)\nThe parties to the dispute shall provide all facilities necessary for the effective conduct of the proceedings.\n(e)\nThe absence or default of a party to the dispute shall not constitute an impediment to the proceedings.\n8.   Unless the arbitral tribunal determines otherwise because of the particular circumstances of the case, the expenses of the tribunal, including the remuneration of its members, shall be borne by the parties to the dispute in equal shares. The tribunal shall keep a record of all its expenses, and shall furnish a final statement thereof to the parties.\n9.   Any Contracting Party that has an interest of a legal nature in the subject matter of the dispute which may be affected by the decision in the case, may intervene in the proceedings with the consent of the tribunal.\n10.\n(a)\nThe award of the arbitral tribunal shall be accompanied by a statement of reasons. It shall be final and binding upon the parties to the dispute.\n(b)\nAny dispute which may arise between the parties concerning the interpretation or execution of the award may be submitted by either party to the arbitral tribunal which made the award or, if the latter cannot be seized thereof, to another arbitral tribunal constituted for this purpose in the same manner as the first.\nArticle 33\nDuties of the Depositary Government\nThe Depositary Government shall inform the Contracting Parties and the signatories to the Convention:\n(a)\nof the deposit of instruments of ratification, acceptance, approval or accession, of declarations of non-acceptance and of notifications of withdrawal in accordance with Articles 26, 27 and 30;\n(b)\nof the date on which the Convention comes into force in accordance with Article 29;\n(c)\nof the receipt of notifications of acceptance, of the deposit of instruments of ratification, acceptance, approval or accession and of the entry into force of amendments to the Convention and of the adoption and amendment of Annexes or Appendices, in accordance with Articles 15, 16, 17, 18 and 19.\nArticle 34\nOriginal text\nThe original of the Convention, of which the French and English texts shall be equally authentic, shall be deposited with the Government of the French Republic which shall send certified copies thereof to the Contracting Parties and the signatories to the Convention and shall deposit a certified copy with the Secretary-General of the United Nations for registration and publication in accordance with Article 102 of the United Nations Charter.\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF, the undersigned, being duly authorised by their respective Governments, have signed this Convention.\nDone at Paris, on the twenty-second day of September 1992.\nANNEX I\nTHE PREVENTION AND ELIMINATION OF POLLUTION FROM LAND-BASED SOURCES\nArticle 1\n1.

When setting priorities and in assessing the nature and extent of the programmes and measures and their time scales, the Contracting Parties shall use the criteria given in Appendix 2.\nArticle 3\n1.   Any dumping of wastes or other matter from offshore installations is prohibited.\n2.   This prohibition does not relate to discharges or emissions from offshore sources.\nArticle 4\n1.   The use on, or the discharge or emission from, offshore sources of substances which may reach and affect the maritime area shall be strictly subject to authorisation or regulation by the competent authorities of the Contracting Parties. Such authorisation or regulation shall, in particular, implement the relevant applicable decisions, recommendations and all other agreements adopted under the Convention.\n2.   The competent authorities of the Contracting Parties shall provide for a system of monitoring and inspection to assess compliance with authorisation or regulation as provided for in paragraph 1 of Article 4 of this Annex.\nArticle 5\n1.   No disused offshore installation or disused offshore pipeline shall be dumped and no disused offshore installation shall be left wholly or partly in place in the maritime area without a permit issued by the competent authority of the relevant Contracting Party on a case-by-case basis. The Contracting Parties shall ensure that their authorities, when granting such permits, shall implement the relevant applicable decisions, recommendations and all other agreements adopted under the Convention.\n2.   No such permit shall be issued if the disused offshore installation or disused offshore pipeline contains substances which result or are likely to result in hazards to human health, harm to living resources and marine ecosystems, damage to amenities or interference with other legitimate uses of the sea.\n3.   Any Contracting Party which intends to take the decision to issue a permit for the dumping of a disused offshore installation or a disused offshore pipeline placed in the maritime area after 1 January 1998 shall, through the medium of the Commission, inform the other Contracting Parties of its reasons for accepting such dumping, in order to make consultation possible.\n4.   Each Contracting Party shall keep, and report to the Commission, records of the disused offshore installations and disused offshore pipelines dumped and of the disused offshore installations left in place in accordance with the provisions of this Article, and of the dates, places and methods of dumping.\nArticle 6\nArticles 3 and 5 of this Annex shall not apply in case of force majeure, due to stress of weather or any other cause, when the safety of human life or of an offshore installation is threatened.

Such authorisation or regulation shall be in accordance with the relevant applicable criteria, guidelines and procedures adopted by the Commission in accordance with subparagraph (d) of Article 10 of this Annex. This provision shall not be taken to permit the dumping of disused offshore installations or disused offshore pipelines in contravention of the provisions of this Annex.\nArticle 9\n1.   Each Contracting Party shall issue instructions to its maritime inspection vessels and aircraft and to other appropriate services to report to its authorities any incidents or conditions in the maritime area which give rise to suspicions that a contravention of the provisions of the present Annex has occurred or is about to occur. Any Contracting Party whose authorities receive such a report shall, if it considers it appropriate, accordingly inform any other Contracting Party concerned.\n2.   Nothing in this Annex shall abridge the sovereign immunity to which certain vessels are entitled under international law.\nArticle 10\nFor the purposes of this Annex, it shall, inter alia, be the duty of the Commission:\n(a)\nto collect information about substances which are used in offshore activities and, on the basis of that information, to agree lists of substances for the purposes of paragraph 1 of Article 4 of this Annex;\n(b)\nto list substances which are toxic, persistent and liable to bioaccumulate and to draw up plans for the reduction and phasing out of their use on, or discharge from, offshore sources;\n(c)\nto draw up criteria, guidelines and procedures for the prevention of pollution from dumping of disused offshore installations and of disused offshore pipelines, and the leaving in place of offshore installations, in the maritime area;\n(d)\nto draw up criteria, guidelines and procedures relating to the placement of disused offshore installations and disused offshore pipelines referred to in Article 8 of this Annex, with a view to preventing and eliminating pollution.\nANNEX IV\nTHE ASSESSMENT OF THE QUALITY OF THE MARINE ENVIRONMENT\nArticle 1\n1.   For the purposes of this Annex ‘monitoring’ means the repeated measurement of:\n(a)\nthe quality of the marine environment and each of its compartments, that is, water, sediments and biota;\n(b)\nactivities or natural and anthropogenic inputs which may affect the quality of the marine environment;\n(c)\nthe effects of such activities and inputs.\n2.   Monitoring may be undertaken either for the purposes of ensuring compliance with the Convention, with the objective of identifying patterns and trends or for research purposes.\nArticle 2\nFor the purposes of this Annex, the Contracting Parties shall:\n(a)\ncooperate in carrying out monitoring programmes and submit the resulting data to the Commission;\n(b)\ncomply with quality assurance prescriptions and participate in intercalibration exercises;\n(c)\nuse and develop, individually or preferably jointly, other duly validated scientific assessment tools, such as modelling, remote sensing and progressive risk assessment strategies;\n(d)\ncarry out, individually or preferably jointly, research which is considered necessary to assess the quality of the marine environment, and to increase knowledge and scientific understanding of the marine environment and, in particular, of the relationship between inputs, concentration and effects;\n(e)\ntake into account scientific progress which is considered to be useful for such assessment purposes and which has been made elsewhere either on the initiative of individual researchers and research institutions, or through other national and international research programmes or under the auspices of the European Economic Community or other regional economic integration organisations.\nArticle 3\nFor the purposes of this Annex, it shall, inter alia, be the duty of the Commission:\n(a)\nto define and implement programmes of collaborative monitoring and assessment-related research, to draw up codes of practice for the guidance of participants in carrying out these monitoring programmes and to approve the presentation and interpretation of their results;\n(b)\nto carry out assessments taking into account the results of relevant monitoring and research and the data relating to inputs of substances or energy into the maritime area which are provided by virtue of other Annexes to the Convention, as well as other relevant information;\n(c)\nto seek, where appropriate, the advice or services of competent regional organisations and other competent international organisations and competent bodies with a view to incorporating the latest results of scientific research;\n(d)\nto cooperate with competent regional organisations and other competent international organisations in carrying out quality status assessments.\nAppendix 1\nCriteria for the definition of practices and techniques mentioned in paragraph 3(b)(i) of Article 2 of the Convention\nBest available techniques\n1.\nThe use of the best available techniques shall emphasise the use of non-waste technology, if available.\n2.\nThe term ‘best available techniques’ means the latest stage of development (state of the art) of processes, of facilities or of methods of operation which indicate the practical suitability of a particular measure for limiting discharges, emissions and waste. In determining whether a set of processes, facilities and methods of operation constitute the best available techniques in general or individual cases, special consideration shall be given to:\n(a)\ncomparable processes, facilities or methods of operation which have recently been successfully tried out;\n(b)\ntechnological advances and changes in scientific knowledge and understanding;\n(c)\nthe economic feasibility of such techniques;\n(d)\ntime limits for installation in both new and existing plants;\n(e)\nthe nature and volume of the discharges and emissions concerned.\n3.\nIt therefore follows that what is ‘best available techniques’ for a particular process will change with time in the light of technological advances, economic and social factors, as well as changes in scientific knowledge and understanding.\n4.\nIf the reduction of discharges and emissions resulting from the use of best available techniques does not lead to environmentally acceptable results, additional measures have to be applied.\n5.\n‘Techniques’ include both the technology used and the way in which the installation is designed, built, maintained, operated and dismantled.\nBest environmental practice\n6.\nThe term ‘best environmental practice’ means the application of the most appropriate combination of environmental control measures and strategies. In making a selection for individual cases, at least the following graduated range of measures should be considered:\n(a)\nthe provision of information and education to the public and to uses about the environmental consequences of choice of particular activities and choice of products, their use and ultimate disposal;\n(b)\nthe development and application of codes of good environmental practice which covers all aspects of the activity in the product's life;\n(c)\nthe mandatory application of labels informing users of environmental risks related to a product, its use and ultimate disposal;\n(d)\nsaving resources, including energy;\n(e)\nmaking collection and disposal systems available to the public;\n(f)\navoiding the use of hazardous substances or products and the generation of hazardous waste;\n(g)\nrecycling, recovery and reuse;\n(h)\nthe application of economic instruments to activities, products or groups of products;\n(i)\nestablishing a system of licensing, involving a range of restrictions or a ban.\n7.\nIn determining what combination of measures constitute best environmental practice, in general or individual cases, particular consideration should be given to:\n(a)\nthe environmental hazard of the product and its production, use and ultimate disposal;\n(b)\nthe substitution by less polluting activities or substances;\n(c)\nthe scale of use;\n(d)\nthe potential environmental benefit or penalty of substitute materials or activities;\n(e)\nadvances and changes in scientific knowledge and understanding;\n(f)\ntime limits for implementation;\n(g)\nsocial and economic implications.\n8.\nIt therefore follows the best environmental practice for a particular source will change with time in the light of technological advances, economic and social factors, as well as changes in scientific knowledge and understanding.\n9.\nIf the reduction of inputs resulting from the use of best environmental practice does not lead to environmentally acceptable results, additional measures have to be applied and best environmental practice redefined.\nAppendix 2\nCriteria mentioned in paragraph 2 of Article 1 of Annex I and in paragraph 2 of Article 2 of Annex III\n1.\nWhen setting priorities and in assessing the nature and extent of the programmes and measures and their time scales, the Contracting Parties shall use the criteria given below:\n(a)\npersistency;\n(b)\ntoxicity or other noxious properties;\n(c)\ntendency to bioaccumulation;\n(d)\nradioactivity;\n(e)\nthe ratio between observed or (where the results of observations are not yet available) predicted concentrations and no observed effect concentrations;\n(f)\nanthropogenically caused risk of eutrophication;\n(g)\ntransboundary significance;\n(h)\nrisk of undesirable changes in the marine ecosystem and irreversibility or durability of effects;\n(i)\ninterference with harvesting of sea-foods or with other legitimate uses of the sea;\n(j)\neffects on the taste and/or smell of products for human consumption from the sea, or effects on smell, colour, transparency or other characteristics of the water in the marine environment;\n(k)\ndistribution pattern (i.e., quantities involved, use pattern and liability to reach the marine environment);\n(l)\nnon-fulfilment of environmental quality objectives.\n2.\nThese criteria are not necessarily of equal importance for the consideration of a particular substance or group of substances.\n3.\nThe above criteria indicate that substances which shall be subject to programmes and measures include:\n(a)\nheavy metals and their compounds;\n(b)\norganohalogen compounds (and substances which may form such compounds in the marine environment);\n(c)\norganic compounds of phosphorus and silicon;\n(d)\nbiocides such as pesticides, fungicides, herbicides, insecticides, slimicides and chemicals used, inter alia, for the preservation of wood, timber, wood pulp, cellulose, paper, hides and textiles;\n(e)\noils and hydrocarbons of petroleum origin;\n(f)\nnitrogen and phosphorus compounds;\n(g)\nradioactive substances, including wastes;\n(h)\npersistent synthetic materials which may float, remain in suspension or sink.", "summary": "OSPAR Convention\nOSPAR Convention\nSUMMARY OF:\nDecision 98/249/EC — concluding a convention protecting the marine environment of the North-East Atlantic\nConvention for the protection of the marine environment of the North-East Atlantic\nWHAT IS THE AIM OF THE DECISION AND OF THE CONVENTION?\nThe decision concluded the OSPAR Convention, on behalf of the European Union (EU) — at the time known as the European Community.\nThe OSPAR Convention aims to prevent and eliminate marine pollution and thus to protect the north-east Atlantic area against the adverse effects of human activities.\nKEY POINTS\nThe European Community is a Contracting Party to the Convention for the protection of the marine environment of the north-east Atlantic, which was signed in Paris on 22 September 1992.\nThe convention lays down various definitions such as:\nmaritime area*,\ninternal waters*,\npollution*.\nThe parties to the convention undertook to take all possible steps to:\nprevent and eliminate pollution,\nimplement the necessary measures to protect the north-east Atlantic against the adverse effects of human activities.\nThese measures seek to safeguard human health, to conserve maritime ecosystems and, when practicable, to restore marine areas which have been harmed. To this end, the parties will (individually and jointly):\nadopt programmes and measures,\nharmonise their policies and strategies.\nTo meet their obligations, the parties must observe 2 principles.\nThe precautionary principle: preventive measures are to be taken when there are reasonable grounds for concern that substances or energy introduced, directly or indirectly, into the marine environment may do any of the following, even when there is no conclusive evidence of a causal relationship between the inputs and the effects;\nBring about hazards to human health.\nHarm living resources and marine ecosystems.\nDamage amenities.\nInterfere with other legitimate uses of the sea.\nThe polluter pays principle:the costs of pollution prevention, control and reduction measures are to be borne by the polluter.\nThe programmes the parties set up must take account of the latest technological developments and best environmental practice.\nThe measures taken must not increase pollution of the sea outside the maritime area or in other parts of the environment.\nThe parties, individually or jointly, agree to take all possible steps to prevent and eliminate:\npollution of the maritime area from land-based sources and activities;\npollution by dumping or incineration of wastes or other matter in the ocean;\npollution from offshore sources (offshore installations and pipelines from which substances or energy reach the maritime area).\nA cooperation agreement may be negotiated between the parties to tackle transboundary pollution.\nOspar Commission\nThe convention sets up a Commission which is the decision-making body of the convention and consists of representatives of the parties. The commission discusses and adopts various decisions and recommendations. Decisions become binding on the contracting parties after a period of 200 days, while recommendations are not binding.\nIts duties are to:\nsupervise the implementation of the convention;\nreview the condition of the maritime area;\ncheck the effectiveness of the measures being adopted;\ndraw up programmes and measures for the prevention and elimination of maritime pollution;\nestablish its programme of work;\ncreate the instruments necessary to execute that programme.\nOSPAR’s work\nAn evaluation of progress in regard to the OSPAR Radioactive Substance Strategy shows that the parties have achieved substantial reductions in discharges from the nuclear sector.\nThe parties have also adopted measures to protect and conserve a further species (the Atlantic salmon) and habitat (intertidal mudflats) both identified by OSPAR as being particularly vulnerable within the north-east Atlantic.\nOSPAR announced in 2016 that 10 new Marine Protected Areas had been added to its network bringing the total to 423.\nOSPAR has furthered the international effort to reduce marine litter with the creation of a fishing for litter network across the north-east Atlantic which will allow vessels to land waste in any of over 40 harbours involved. OSPAR parties have also agreed to tackle sources of marine environment micro plastic pollution .\nOSPAR also serves as a forum for the coordinated implementation of the EU’s Maritime Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD) by EU countries and for interregional cooperation based on MSFD concepts and methods.\nResearch\nThe convention requires the establishment of complementary or joint programmes of scientific or technical research, to be transmitted to the commission.\nArbitration procedure\nAn arbitration procedure is laid down for the settlement of disputes between contracting parties.\nAnnexes\nThe OSPAR Convention contains Annexes which deal with the following specific areas\nAnnex I: Prevention and elimination of pollution from land-based sources\nAnnex II: Prevention and elimination of pollution by dumping or incineration\nAnnex III: Prevention and elimination of pollution from offshore sources\nAnnex IV: Assessment of the quality of the marine environment\nAnnex V: On the protection and conservation of the ecosystems and biological diversity of the maritime area.\nEU Arctic strategy\nA 2016 joint communication recommends the EU’s\ncontinued engagement in multilateral environmental agreements that also have particular relevance to the Arctic, such as OSPAR;\nestablishing marine protected areas in the Arctic in order to preserve biodiversity;\nworking with Arctic states and other international partners to develop an instrument under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea for the conservation and sustainable use of marine biodiversity in areas beyond national jurisdiction.\nFROM WHEN DO THE DECISION AND THE CONVENTION APPLY?\nThe decision applies from 7 October 1997.\nThe convention entered into force on 25 March 1998. It replaces the Oslo (1972) and Paris (1974) Conventions.\nThe convention has been signed and ratified by Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Iceland, Ireland, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom (\n1\n) which, with the EU, cooperate to protect the north-east Atlantic 's marine environment.\nBACKGROUND\n              \nFor more information, see:\nThe OSPAR Convention (European Commission).\nKEY TERMS\nMaritime area:\nall of the following:\nThe internal waters and the territorial seas of the contracting parties.\nThe sea beyond and adjacent to the territorial sea under the jurisdiction of the coastal state to the extent recognised by international law.\nThe high seas, including the bed of all those waters and its subsoil, situated within the following limits:\nThose parts of the Atlantic and Arctic Oceans and their dependent seas which lie north of 36° north latitude and between 42° west longitude and 51° east longitude but excluding\nthe Baltic Sea and the Belts lying to the south and east of lines drawn from Hasenore Head to Gniben Point, from Korshage to Spodsbjerg and from Gilbjerg Head to Kullen, and\nthe Mediterranean Sea and its dependent seas as far as the point of intersection of the parallel of 36° north latitude and the meridian of 5° 36' west longitude.\nThat part of the Atlantic Ocean north of 59° north latitude and between 44° west longitude and 42° west longitude.\nInternal waters: the waters of the landward side of the baselines from which the breadth of the territorial sea is measured (extending in the case of watercourses up to the freshwater limit (the place in a watercourse where, at low tide and in a period of low freshwater flow, there is an appreciable increase in salinity due to the presence of seawater)).\nPollution:\nthe introduction by man, directly or indirectly, of substances or energy into the maritime area which results, or is likely to result, in any of the following:\nhazards to human health,\nharm to living resources and marine ecosystems,\ndamage to amenities,\ninterference with other legitimate uses of the sea.\nMAIN DOCUMENTS\n            \nCouncil Decision 98/249/EC of 7 October 1997 on the conclusion of the Convention for the protection of the marine environment of the north-east Atlantic (OJ L 104, 3.4.1998, p. 1)\nConvention for the protection of the marine environment of the north-east Atlantic (OJ L 104, 3.4.1998, pp. 2–21)\nRELATED DOCUMENTS\n            \nDirective 2008/56/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 June 2008 establishing a framework for community action in the field of marine environmental policy (Marine Strategy Framework Directive) (OJ L 164, 25.6.2008, pp. 19–40)\nSuccessive amendments to Directive 2008/56/EC have been incorporated into the original document.
