Both the European Parliament and the Council have endorsed that strategy.\n(2)\nRegulation (EU) No 1291/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council (3) established Horizon 2020 - The Framework Programme for Research and Innovation (2014-2020) (\"Horizon 2020\"). Horizon 2020 aims at achieving a greater impact on research and innovation by contributing to the strengthening of public-public partnerships, including through Union participation in programmes undertaken by several Member States in accordance with Article 185 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.\n(3)\nPublic-public partnerships should aim to develop closer synergies, increase coordination and avoid unnecessary duplication with Union, international, national and regional research programmes, and should fully respect the Horizon 2020 general principles, in particular those relating to openness and transparency. Moreover, open access to scientific publications should be ensured.\n(4)\nDecision No 742/2008/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (4) provides for a Community financial contribution to the Ambient Assisted Living Joint Research and Development Programme (\"AAL JP\") matching that of the Member States but not exceeding EUR 150 000 000 for the duration of the Seventh Framework Programme of the European Community for research, technological development and demonstration activities (2007-2013) established by Decision No 1982/2006/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (5).\n(5)\nIn December 2012, the Commission communicated to the European Parliament and the Council a report on the interim evaluation of the AAL JP. That evaluation was carried out by an expert panel. The overall opinion of that expert panel was that the AAL JP had achieved good progress towards its objectives and remarkable results and that it should be continued beyond the current funding period. The expert panel noted however a few shortcomings, in particular the need for stronger user involvement in projects from the earliest possible stage and further improvements of the operational performance in terms of time-to-contract and time to payment.\n(6)\nThe interim evaluation of 2010 and the consultation process of 2012 highlighted the diversity of financial instruments, eligibility rules and reimbursement systems. Participating States, through the Ambient Assisted Living General Assembly, could reflect on this and promote the exchange of good practices.\n(7)\nIn its communication of 12 October 2006 entitled 'The demographic future of Europe â€” from challenge to opportunity', the Commission underlined the fact that demographic ageing is one of the main challenges facing all the Member States and that increased use of new technologies could help to control costs, improve well-being and promote the active participation in society of elderly people, as well as improving the competitiveness of Union economy.\n(8)\nUnder the flagship initiative 'Innovation Union' of the Europe 2020 strategy, the Commission indicated the ageing of the population as one of the societal challenges where innovation breakthroughs can play an important role and boost competitiveness, enable European companies to lead in the development of new technologies, to grow and assume global leadership in new growth markets, improve the quality and efficiency of public services and so contribute to creating large numbers of new quality jobs.\n(9)\nAbout 20 million people across the Union are employed in \"white-coat\" jobs in the health sector and social services sector, a figure which is expected to increase in the coming years due to the aging population. Training and life-long learning in this sensitive sector should be a key priority. Therefore, the need for white coat jobs and for investments in modern skills, such as using information technologies, should be assessed more precisely.\n(10)\nIn its communication of 19 May 2010 entitled 'A Digital Agenda for Europe', the Commission proposed to reinforce the AAL JP in order to help address the challenges of the ageing population.\n(11)\nIn its communication of 29 February 2012 entitled 'Taking forward the Strategic Implementation Plan of the European Innovation Partnership on Active and Healthy Ageing', the Commission proposed to take account of relevant priorities of the Strategic Implementation Plan for future research and innovation work programmes and instruments which are part of Horizon 2020. The Commission also proposed to take into account the contributions that can be made by the AAL JP to the European Innovation Partnership on Active and Healthy Ageing.\n(12)\nUnder the European Innovation Partnership on Active and Healthy Ageing established under the Innovation Union, innovative information and communication technologies (ICT) based solutions are expected to play an important role in meeting its goals of two additional healthy life years by 2020 as well as improving quality of life for citizens and improving efficiency of care systems in the Union. Its Strategic Implementation Plan sets out priorities for accelerating and scaling up innovation in active and healthy ageing across the Union, in three domains: prevention and health promotion, care and cure, and independent living and social inclusion.\n(13)\nSince ICT systems handle a large amount of personal data and profiles, and operate in real-time communication, thus bringing with them a high risk of data security breaches, data protection aspects should be taken into account. Moreover, the right to privacy should be respected.\n(14)\nThe Active and Assisted Living Research and Development Programme ('the AAL Programme') should build on the achievements of the previous programme and address its shortcomings by encouraging sufficient user participation in projects from the initial stage, in order to ensure that solutions developed are acceptable and respond to specific user needs, and by ensuring better AAL Programme implementation.\n(15)\nThe implementation of the AAL Programme should take into account a broad definition of innovation including organisational, business, technological, societal and environmental aspects. It should ensure a multidisciplinary approach and the integration of social sciences and humanities within the AAL Programme.\n(16)\nActivities of the AAL Programme should be in line with the objectives and research and innovation priorities of Horizon 2020 and with the general principles and conditions laid down in Article 26 of Regulation (EU) No 1291/2013.\n(17)\nA ceiling should be established for the Union's financial participation in the AAL Programme for the duration of Horizon 2020. The Union's financial participation in the AAL Programme should not exceed the financial contribution of the Participating States for the duration of Horizon 2020 in order to achieve a high leverage effect and ensure an active involvement of the Participating States in achieving the AAL Programme objectives.\n(18)\nIn order to take into account the duration of Horizon 2020, calls for proposals under the AAL Programme should be launched at the latest by 31 December 2020. In duly justified cases, calls for proposals may be launched by 31 December 2021.\n(19)\nIn line with the objectives of Regulation (EU) No 1291/2013, any Member State and any country associated to Horizon 2020 should be entitled to participate in the AAL Programme at any appropriate time.\n(20)\nIn order to ensure that a financial commitment by the Union will be matched by the Participating States, the financial contribution by the Union should be subject to formal commitments from the Participating States before the launch of the AAL Programme and their fulfilment. The Participating States' contribution to the AAL Programme should include the administrative costs incurred at national level for the effective operation of the AAL Programme.\n(21)\nThe joint implementation of the AAL Programme requires an implementation structure. The Participating States have agreed on the implementation structure for the AAL Programme and set up in 2007 the \"Ambient Assisted Living\" aisbl, an international non-profit association with legal personality established under Belgian law ('AALA'). Given that, according to the report on the interim evaluation, the existing governance structure of AAL JP has proven to be efficient and of good quality, the AALA should be used as the implementation structure and should take the role as allocation and monitoring body of the AAL Programme. The AALA should manage the Union's financial contribution and should ensure an efficient implementation of the AAL Programme.\n(22)\nIn order to achieve the objectives of the AAL Programme, the AALA should provide financial support mainly through grants to participants in actions selected by the AALA. Those actions should be selected following calls for proposals under the responsibility of the AALA, which should be assisted by independent external experts. The ranking list should be binding as regards the selection of proposals and the allocation of funding from the Union's financial contribution and from the national budgets for AAL Programme projects.\n(23)\nThe Union's financial contribution should be managed in accordance with the principle of sound financial management and with the rules on indirect management laid down in Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 966/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council (6) and Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 1268/2012 (7).\n(24)\nIn order to protect the financial interests of the Union, the Commission should, through proportionate measures, have the right to reduce, withhold or terminate the Union's financial contribution where the AAL Programme is implemented inadequately, partially or late, or the Participating States do not contribute, or contribute partially or late, to the financing of the AAL Programme. Those rights should be provided for in the delegation agreement to be concluded between the Union and the AALA.\n(25)\nFor the purpose of simplification, administrative burdens should be reduced for all parties. Double audits and disproportionate documentation and reporting should be avoided. When audits are conducted, the specificities of the national programmes should be taken into account, as appropriate.\n(26)\nParticipation in indirect actions funded by the AAL Programme is subject to Regulation (EU) No 1290/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council (8). However, due to specific operating needs of the AAL Programme it is necessary to provide for derogations from that Regulation in accordance with Article 1(3) of that Regulation.\n(27)\nCalls for proposals by AALA should also be published on the single portal for participants as well as through other Horizon 2020 electronic means of dissemination managed by the Commission.\n(28)\nSpecific derogations from Regulation (EU) No 1290/2013 are necessary, as the AAL Programme is intended as a market-oriented research and innovation programme in which many different national funding streams are joined up (such as research innovation, health and industry funding programmes). By their nature, those national programmes have different participation rules and cannot be expected to fully align with Regulation (EU) No 1290/2013. In addition, the AAL Programme is targeting in particular small and medium-sized enterprises and user organisations not usually participating in Union research and innovation activities. In order to facilitate the participation of those enterprises and organisations, the Union's financial contribution is provided in accordance with the well-known rules of their national funding programmes and implemented through a single grant combining Union funding with the corresponding national funding.\n(29)\nThe financial interests of the Union should be protected through proportionate measures throughout the expenditure cycle, including the prevention, detection and investigation of irregularities, the recovery of funds lost, wrongly paid or incorrectly used and, where appropriate, administrative and financial penalties in accordance with Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 966/2012.\n(30)\nThe Commission should conduct, with the assistance of independent experts, an interim evaluation assessing in particular the quality and efficiency of the AAL Programme and progress towards the objectives set, as well as a final evaluation, and prepare a report on those evaluations.\n(31)\nThe evaluation should be based on precise and up-to-date information. Upon request from the Commission, the AALA and the Participating States should therefore submit any information which the Commission needs to include in the reports on the evaluation of the AAL Programme.\n(32)\nThe actions envisaged in the AAL Programme should help underpin European public health and care systems, since they are an essential means of sustaining social welfare and reducing the welfare gap between regions and population sectors that is widening alarmingly owing to the current economic and social crisis.\n(33)\nThe AAL Programme should ensure the effective promotion of gender equality as set out in Horizon 2020. The AAL Programme should promote gender equality and the gender dimension in research and innovation content. Particular attention should be paid to gender balance, subject to the situation in the field, in evaluation panels and in bodies such as advisory groups and expert groups. The gender dimension should be adequately integrated in research and innovation content in strategies, programmes and projects and followed through at all stages of the research cycle.\n(34)\nThe AAL Programme should comply with ethical principles as set out in Horizon 2020. Particular attention should be paid to the principle of proportionality, the right to privacy, the right to the protection of personal data, the right to the physical and mental integrity, the right to non-discrimination and the need to ensure high levels of human health protection.\n(35)\nSince Participating States have decided to continue the AAL Programme and since the objectives of this Decision, namely to directly support and complement the Union policies in the field of active and healthy ageing, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States but can rather, by reason of the scale of the action, be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Decision does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives,\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\nArticle 1\nParticipation in the AAL Programme\n1.   The Union shall participate in the Active and Assisted Living Research and Development Programme (\"AAL Programme\") jointly undertaken by Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, Denmark, France, Hungary, Ireland, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom (the \"Participating States\"), in accordance with the conditions laid down in this Decision.\n2.

ICT-based solutions supported under the AAL Programme should integrate non-ICT aspects by design;\n1.3.\nmaintain and further develop a critical mass of applied research, development and innovation at Union level in the areas of ICT-based products and services for active and healthy ageing;\n1.4.\ndevelop cost-effective, accessible and, where relevant, energy-efficient solutions, including establishing relevant interoperability standards and facilitating the localisation and adaptation of common solutions which are compatible with varying social preferences, socio-economic factors (including energy poverty, social inclusion), gender aspects, and regulatory aspects at national or regional level, respect the privacy and dignity of older adults, including the protection and security of personal data by applying state-of-the-art privacy-by-design and, where applicable, support access to services in rural and outlying areas or benefit other groups of people, such as people with disabilities. To improve accessibility, the concept of Design for All will be promoted in the development and deployment of solutions.\n2.\nThe AAL Programme shall establish a favourable environment for the participation of small and medium-sized enterprises.\n3.\nThe AAL Programme shall focus on market-oriented applied research and innovation and shall complement related longer-term research and large scale innovation activities envisaged under Horizon 2020, and other European and national initiatives such as joint programming initiatives and activities undertaken within the European Institute of Innovation and Technology and its relevant Knowledge and Innovation Communities. It shall also contribute to the implementation of the European Innovation Partnership on Active and Healthy Ageing.\nANNEX II\nACTIVITIES OF THE AAL PROGRAMME\nI.   Indirect actions\n1.\nThe implementation of the AAL Programme shall mainly support market-oriented research and innovation projects for active and healthy ageing, which shall demonstrate the capability to exploit the project results within a realistic time frame; the financing of those indirect actions under the AAL Programme shall mainly take the form of grants. It may also take other forms such as prizes, pre-commercial procurement, and public procurement of innovative solutions.\n2.\nIn addition, actions for the purposes of brokerage, programme promotion, in particular outreach activities to countries not currently participating in the AAL Programme, actions to raise awareness of the current capabilities, foster deployment of innovative solutions and connect supply and demand side organisations and facilitating access to finance and investors may be supported.\n3.\nActions aimed at improving the quality of proposals, feasibility studies and workshops may also be supported. Collaboration with the regions of the Union may be envisaged to enlarge the group of stakeholders involved in the AAL Programme.\n4.\nActions shall aim to consolidate and analyse different methods of end-user involvement in order to develop evidence-based best practice guidelines.\nII.   Implementation\n1.\nThe AAL Programme shall be implemented on the basis of annual work plans identifying forms of funding and topics for calls for proposals. The work plans shall be derived from a published strategy, highlighting challenges and priorities, adopted by the AALA.\n2.\nThe annual work plans shall be agreed with the Commission as a basis for the annual financial contribution from the Union.\n3.\nThe implementation of the AAL Programme shall entail consultations, including on strategy, with relevant stakeholders (including decision-makers from public authorities, user representatives, private-sector service providers and insurance providers as well as industry, including small and medium-sized enterprises) concerning the applied research and innovation priorities to be addressed.\n4.\nThe implementation of the AAL Programme shall take into account demographic trends and demographic research in order to provide solutions that reflect the social and economic situation across the Union.\n5.\nThe implementation of the AAL Programme shall take into account the Union's industrial, climate and energy policies. The AAL Programme shall also promote energy efficiency and reflect the need to tackle energy poverty.\n6.\nDue account shall be taken of gender, ethical, social sciences and humanities and privacy issues, in line with the Horizon 2020 principles and rules. Account shall also be taken of relevant Union and national legislation and international guidelines, in particular regarding the rights to privacy and data protection.\n7.\nIn line with the close-to-market nature of the AAL Programme and in compliance with the rules set out in Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 966/2012, the AALA shall ensure time-to-grant and time-to-payment in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 1290/2013 and ensure compliance with them by Participating States during the implementation of the AAL Programme.\n8.\nEach Participating State shall strongly promote, from the earliest stage of all research and innovation projects, the participation of organisations representing demand side actors, including end users.\n9.\nEach Participating State shall co-finance its national participants whose proposals are successful through national agencies that shall, in addition, channel the Union co-funding from the dedicated implementation structure, on the basis of a common project description, which forms part of an agreement to be concluded between the respective national programme management agencies and their national participants for each project.\n10.\nAfter the closure of a call for project proposals, a central eligibility check shall be carried out by the AALA in cooperation with the designated national programme management agencies. That check shall be performed on the basis of the common eligibility criteria for the AAL Programme which shall be published with the call for project proposals.\n11.\nThe AALA shall, with the assistance of the national programme management agencies, check the fulfilment of additional national eligibility criteria set out in the calls for project proposals.\n12.\nThe national eligibility criteria shall relate only to the legal and financial status of the individual applicants and not to the content of the proposal and shall concern the following aspects:\n12.1.\napplicant type, including legal status and purpose;\n12.2.\nliability and viability, including financial soundness, fulfilment of tax and social obligations.\n13.\nEligible project proposals shall be evaluated by the AALA with the assistance of independent experts, on the basis of transparent and common evaluation criteria, as set out in the published call for proposals, and a list of projects in order of score shall be produced. Projects shall be selected in accordance with that ranking and taking account of available funding. That selection, once adopted by the General Assembly of the AALA, shall be binding on the Participating States.\n14.\nIf a project participant fails to meet one or more of the national eligibility criteria or if the corresponding national budget for commitment for funding is exhausted, the Executive Board of the AALA may decide that an additional central independent evaluation of the proposal concerned should be carried out with the assistance of independent experts, in order to evaluate the proposal either without the participation of the participant in question or with a replacement participant, as suggested by project participants.\n15.\nLegal and financial issues concerning participants in projects selected for funding shall be handled by the designated national programme management agency. National administrative rules and principles shall be applied.\nANNEX III\nGOVERNANCE OF THE AAL PROGRAMME\nThe organisational structure for the AAL Programme shall be as follows:\n1.\nThe AALA shall constitute the dedicated implementation structure created by the Participating States.\n2.\nThe AALA shall be responsible for all the activities of the AAL Programme.

The programme is funded by the European Commissionâ€™s budget for Horizon 2020 and the financial contributions from the 17 Participating States.\nAny EU country or any other country associated to Horizon 2020 may apply to join the partnership, provided they make the necessary financial contributions.\nThe main aim of the programme is to find innovative Information and Communications Technology (ICT)-based solutions for active and healthy ageing at home, therefore improving the quality of life and autonomy and contributing to increasing the efficiency and effectiveness of health and social care systems. These ICT-based solutions are also expected to play an important role in meeting the EUâ€™s goal of two additional healthy life years by 2020.\nKEY POINTS\nObjectives\nTo accelerate the development and use of affordable, innovative ICT-based solutions enabling active and healthy ageing at home, at work and in the community, including applications for health and social care.\nTo support the development of solutions with an ICT component that complements rather than replaces human contact to ensure that older people do not feel isolated and remain autonomous and independent.\nTo develop cost-effective, accessible and energy-efficient solutions that take into account aspects such as socioeconomic factors and gender.\nImplementation\nThe programme is implemented by the Ambient Assisted Living (AAL), an international non-profit association, established under Belgian law. AAL manages the Unionâ€™s financial contribution and ensures an efficient implementation of the Programme.\nAnnual work plans\nEach year a work plan is agreed with and approved by the European Commission. This plan identifies the topics for calls for proposals and the forms of funding available.\nCalls for proposals\nThese are published on the single portal for participants, the so-called Funding and Tender Opportunities Portal. Taking the duration of Horizon 2020 into account, calls for proposals under the AAL programme should be launched at the latest by 31 December 2020, although in duly justified cases calls may be launched by 31 December 2021.\nBudget\nThe Union financial contribution to the AAL Programme covering administrative and operational costs will be up to â‚¬ 175 million.\nFROM WHEN DOES THE DECISION APPLY?\n              \nIt has applied since 27 June 2014.\nMAIN DOCUMENT\n            \nDecision No 554/2014/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 May 2014 on the participation of the Union in the active and assisted living research and development programme jointly undertaken by several Member States (OJ L 169, 7.6.2014, pp. 14-26)\nlast update 06.03.2020", "tags": ["innovation", "quality of life", "population ageing", "EU research policy", "information technology", "research and development", "EU programme", "financing level", "co-financing"], "subjects": ["Research and technological development"], "split": "train", "reference_annotations": {"32014D0554_p3": {"text": "(3)  regulation 1291/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 December 2013 establishing Horizon 2020 - the Framework Programme for Research and Innovation (2014-2020) and repealing decision 1982/2006/ec (OJ L 347, 20.12.2013, p. 104).", "triples": [" regulation 1291/2013,  repealing,  decision 1982/2006/ec"]}, "32014D0554_p4": {"text": "(6)  regulation 966/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 October 2012 on the financial rules applicable to the general budget of the Union and repealing Council regulation 1605/2002 (OJ L 298, 26.10.2012, p. 1).", "triples": [" regulation 966/2012,  repealing,  regulation 1605/2002"]}, "32014D0554_p5": {"text": "(8)  regulation 1290/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 December 2013 laying down the rules for participation and dissemination in \"Horizon 2020 - the Framework Programme for Research and Innovation (2014-2020)\" and repealing regulation 1906/2006 (OJ L 347, 20.12.2013, p. 81).", "triples": [" regulation 1290/2013,  repealing,  regulation 1906/2006"]}, "32014D0554_p6": {"text": "(9)  Council decision 2013/743/eu of 3 December 2013 establishing the specific programme implementing Horizon 2020 - the Framework Programme for Research and Innovation (2014-2020) and repealing decision 2006/971/ec decision 2006/972/ec decision 2006/973/ec decision 2006/974/ec decision 2006/975/ec (OJ L 347, 20.12.2013, p. 965).", "triples": [" decision 2013/743/eu,  repealing,  decision 2006/971/ec", " decision 2013/743/eu,  repealing,  decision 2006/972/ec", " decision 2013/743/eu,  repealing,  decision 2006/973/ec", " decision 2013/743/eu,  repealing,  decision 2006/974/ec", " decision 2013/743/eu,  repealing,  decision 2006/975/ec"]}, "32014D0554_p7": {"text": "(11)  regulation 883/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 September 2013 concerning investigations conducted by the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) and repealing regulation 1073/1999 of the European Parliament and of the Council and Council regulation 1074/1999 (OJ L 248, 18.9.2013, p. 1).", "triples": [" regulation 883/2013,  repealing,  regulation 1073/1999", " regulation 883/2013,  repealing,  regulation 1074/1999"]}}, "summary_annotations": {}}
