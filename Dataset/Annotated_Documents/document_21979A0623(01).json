For the purpose of this Convention:\n(a)\n‘migratory species’ means the entire population or any geographically separate part of the population of any species or lower taxon of wild animals, a significant proportion of whose menbers cyclically and predictably cross one or more national jurisdictional boundaries;\n(b)\n‘conservation status of a migratory species’ means the sum of the influences acting on the migratory species that may affect its long-term distribution and abundance;\n(c)\n‘conservation status’ will be taken as ‘favourable’ when:\n1.\npopulation dynamics data indicate that the migratory species is maintaining itself on a long-term basis as a viable component of its ecosystems;\n2.\nthe range of the migratory species is neither currently being reduced, nor is likely to be reduced, on a long-term basis;\n3.\nthere is, and will be in the foreseeable future, sufficient habitat to maintain the population of the migratory species on a long-term basis; and\n4.\nthe distribution and abundance of the migratory species approach historic coverage and levels to the extent that potentially suitable ecosystems exist and to the extent consistent with wise wildlife management;\n(d)\n‘conservation status’ will be taken as ‘unfavourable’ if any of the conditions set out in subparagraph (c) of this paragraph is not met;\n(e)\n‘endangered’ in relation to a particular migratory species means that the migratory species is in danger of extinction throughout all or a significant portion of its range;\n(f)\n‘range’ means all the areas of land or water that a migratory species inhabits, stays in temporarily, crosses or overflies at any time on its normal migration route;\n(g)\n‘habitat’ means any area in the range of a migratory species which contains suitable living conditions for that species;\n(h)\n‘Range State’ in relation to a particular migratory species means any State (and where appropriate any other party referred to under subparagraph (k) of this paragraph) that exercises jurisdiction over any part of the range of that migratory species, or a State, flag vessels of which are engaged outside national jurisdictional limits in taking that migratory species;\n(i)\n‘taking’ means taking, hunting, fishing, capturing, harassing, deliberate killing, or attempting to engage in any such conduct;\n(l)\n‘Agreement’ means an international agreement relating to the conservation of one or more migratory species as provided for in Articles IV and V of this Convention; and\n(k)\n‘Party’ means a State or any regional economic integration organization constituted by sovereign States which has competence in respect of the negotiation, conclusion and application of international agreements in matters covered by this Convention for which this Convention is in force.\n2.   In matters within their competence, the regional economic integration organizations which are Parties to this Convention shall in their own name exercise the rights and fulfil the responsibilities which this Convention attributes to their member States. In such cases the member States of these organizations shall not be entitled to exercise such rights individually.\n3.   Where this Convention provides for a decision to be taken by either a two-thirds majority or a unanimous decision of ‘the Parties present and voting’ this shall mean ‘the Parties present and casting an affirmative or negative vote’. Those abstaining from voting shall not be counted amongst ‘the Parries present and voting’ in determining the majority.\nArticle II\nFundamental principles\n1.   The Parties acknowledge the importance of migratory species being conserved and of Range States agreeing to take action to this end whenever possible and appropriate, paying special attention to migratory species the conservation status of which is unfavourable, and taking individually or in cooperation appropriate and necessary steps to conserve such species and their habitat.\n2.   The Parties acknowledge the need to take action to avoid any migratory species becoming endangered.\n3.   In particular, the Parties:\n(a)\nshould promote, cooperate in our support research relating to migratory species;\n(b)\nshall endeavour to provide immediate protection for migratory species included in Appendix I; and\n(c)\nshall endeavour to conclude Agreements covering the conservation and management of migratory species included in Appendix II.\nArticle III\nEndangered migratory species: Appendix I\n1.   Appendix I shall list migratory species which are endangered.\n2.   A migratory species may be listed in Appendix I provided that reliable evidence, including the best scientific evidence available, indicates that the species is endangered.\n3.   A migratory species may be removed from Appendix I when the Conference of the Parties determines that:\n(a)\nreliable evidence, including the best scientific evidence available, indicates that the species is no longer endangered, and\n(b)\nthe species is not likely to become endangered again because of loss of protection due to its removal from Appendix I.\n4.   Parties that are Range States of a migratory species listed in Appendix I shall endeavour:\n(a)\nto conserve and, where feasible and appropriate, restore those habitats of the species which are of importance in removing the species from danger of extinction;\n(b)\nto prevent, remove, compensate for or minimize, as appropriate, the adverse effects of activities or obstacles that seriously impede or prevent the migration of the species; and\n(c)\nto the extent feasible and appropriate, to prevent, reduce or control factors that are endangering or are likely to further endanger the species, including strictly controlling the introduction of, or controlling or eliminating already introduced, exotic species.\n5.   Parties that are Range States of a migratory species listed in Appendix I shall prohibit the taking of animals belonging to such species. Exceptions may be made to this prohibition only if:\n(a)\nthe taking is for scientific purposes;\n(b)\nthe taking is for the purpose of enhancing the propagation or survival of the affected species;\n(c)\nthe taking is to accommodate the needs of traditional subsistence users of such species; or\n(d)\nextraordinary circumstances so require:\nprovided that such exceptions are precise as to content and limited in space and time. Such taking should not operate to the disadvantage of the species.\n6.   The Conference of the Parties may recommend to the Parties that are Range States of a migratory species listed in Appendix I that they take further measures considered appropriate to benefit the species.\n7.   The Parties shall as soon as possible inform the Secretariat of any exceptions made pursuant to paragraph 5 of this Article.\nArticle IV\nMigratory species to be the subject of Agreements: Appendix II\n1.   Appendix II shall list migratory species which have an unfavourable conservation status and which require international agreements for their conservation and management, as well as those which have a conservation status which would significantly benefit from the international cooperation that could be achieved by an international agreement.\n2.   If the circumstances so warrant, a migratory species may be listed both in Appendix I and Appendix II.\n3.   Parties that are Range States of migratory species listed in Appendix II shall endeavour to conclude Agreements where these would benefit the species and should give priority to those species in an unfavourable conservation status.\n4.   Parties are encouraged to take action with a view to concluding agreements for any population or any geographically separate part of the population of any species or lower taxon of wild animals, members of which periodically cross one or more national jurisdictional boundaries.\n5.   The Secretariat shall be provided with a copy of each Agreement concluded pursuant to the provision of this Article.\nArticle V\nGuidelines for Agreements\n1.   The object of each Agreement shall be to restore the migratory species concerned to a favourable conservation status or to maintain it in such a status. Each Agreement should deal with those aspects of the conservation and management of the migratory species concerned which serve to achieve that object.\n2.   Each Agreement should cover the whole of the range of the migratory species concerned and should be open to accession by all Range States of that species, whether or not they are Parties to this Convention.\n3.   An Agreement should, wherever possible, deal with more than one migratory species.\n4.

Wild animals require special attention because of their importance from the environmental, ecological, genetic, scientific, recreational, cultural, educational, social and economic points of view. Conservation of migratory species particularly requires international cooperation to ensure protection across their full range*.\nThe decision concludes the convention on behalf of the EEC (now the EU).\nKEY POINTS\nThe parties to the convention acknowledge the importance of conserving migratory species, and the need to pay special attention to species whose conservation status* is unfavourable.\nTo avoid any migratory species becoming endangered*, the parties must aim to: promote, cooperate in or support research relating to migratory species; andconclude agreements covering the conservation and management of migratory species listed in Appendix II.\nTo protect endangered migratory species, the parties to the convention will aim to: provide immediate protection for migratory species included in Appendix I;conserve or restore the habitats of endangered species;prevent, remove, compensate for or minimise the adverse effects of activities or obstacles that impede the migration of the species; andprevent, reduce or control factors that are endangering or are likely to further endanger the species, as far as feasible and appropriate.\nRange countries of migratory species must prohibit the taking of animals belonging to species listed in Appendix I, with certain exceptions, such as taking for scientific purposes, or to enhance the breeding or survival of the species. These exceptions must be precise as to content and limited in place and time, and should not operate to the disadvantage of the species.\nThe conservation and management of the species listed in Appendix II may require international agreements.\nGuidelines for agreements: restore or maintain the migratory species concerned;cover the whole of the range of the migratory species concerned;be open to accession by all range countries, whether or not they are parties to the Convention;where feasible, concern several species.\nEach agreement must contain the following information: the name of the migratory species concerned;its range and migration route;measures for implementing the agreement;procedures for the settlement of disputes;designation of the authority concerned with the implementation of the agreement.\nAgreements may also provide for: research into the species;the exchange of information on the migratory species;the restoration or maintenance of a network of suitable habitats for the conservation of the species;periodic review of the conservation status of the species;emergency procedures whereby conservation action would be rapidly strengthened.\nA different type of agreements are those under Article IV (4) of the Convention. These are not restricted to species listed in Appendix II of the Convention, and may be concluded for any population or any geographically separate part of the population of any species or lower taxon of wild animals, whose members periodically cross one or more national jurisdictional boundaries.\nThe Conference of the Parties is the decision-making body of the convention. It reviews the implementation of the convention and can adopt recommendations.\nThe convention, and its Appendices I and II, can be amended.\nAny dispute between parties to the convention must be settled by negotiation between the parties involved. If the dispute cannot be resolved by negotiation, it may be submitted to arbitration, in particular that of the Permanent Court of Arbitration at The Hague, whose decision will be binding on the parties.\nDATE OF ENTRY INTO FORCE\n              \nThe Bonn Convention was signed in 1979 and entered into force on 1 November 1983.\nBACKGROUND\n              \nFor more information, see:\nGlobal biodiversity (European Commission)\nCMS (Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals).\nKEY TERMS\n              \nMigratory species: the entire population or any geographically separate part of the population of any species or lower taxon of wild animals a significant proportion of whose members cyclically and predictably cross one or more national jurisdictional boundaries.\nRange: areas of land or water that a migratory species inhabits, crosses or overflies on its migration route.\nConservation status of a migratory species: the sum of the influences acting on the migratory species that may affect its long-term distribution and abundance.\nEndangered: the migratory species is in danger of extinction throughout all or part of the territory of a country.\nMAIN DOCUMENTS\n            \nConvention on the conservation of migratory species of wild animals (OJ L 210, 19.7.1982, pp. 11-22)\nCouncil Decision 82/461/EEC of 24 June 1982 on the conclusion of the Convention on the conservation of migratory species of wild animals (OJ L 210, 19.7.1982, p. 10)\nRELATED DOCUMENTS\n            \nCouncil Decision 2006/871/EC of 18 July 2005 on the conclusion on behalf of the European Community of the Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds (OJ L 345, 8.12.2006, pp. 24-25)\nCouncil Decision 98/145/EC of 12 February 1998 on the approval, on behalf of the European Community, of the amendments to Appendices I and II to the Bonn Convention on the conservation of migratory species of wild animals as decided by the fifth meeting of the Conference of the parties to the Convention (OJ L 46, 17.2.1998, pp. 6-7)\nlast update 12.05.2020", "tags": ["protection of animal life", "international convention", "zoology", "environmental cooperation", "protected species", "animal life"], "subjects": ["Environment", "Provisions under Article 235 EEC", "External relations"], "split": "train", "reference_annotations": {}, "summary_annotations": {}}
