{"celex_id": "32007R1445", "reference": "20.12.2007\nEN\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\nL 336/1\nREGULATION (EC) No 1445/2007 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL\nof 11 December 2007\nestablishing common rules for the provision of basic information on Purchasing Power Parities and for their calculation and dissemination\n(Text with EEA relevance)\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 285(1) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the Commission,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee (1),\nActing in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty (2),\nWhereas:\n(1)\nIn order to obtain a direct comparison of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in volume terms between Member States, it is essential for the Community to have Purchasing Power Parities (hereinafter referred to as ‘PPPs’) which eliminate the differences in the level of prices between Member States.\n(2)\nThe Community PPPs need to be produced in accordance with a harmonised methodology, consistent with Council Regulation (EC) No 2223/96 of 25 June 1996 on the European system of national and regional accounts in the Community (3) which lays down a framework for the construction of national accounts in the Member States.\n(3)\nMember States are encouraged to produce data for regional PPPs.\n(4)\nCouncil Regulation (EC) No 1083/2006 of 11 July 2006 laying down general provisions on the European Regional Development Fund, the European Social Fund and the Cohesion Fund (4) provides that the regions eligible for funding from the Structural Funds under the convergence objective are to be regions corresponding to level 2 of the common classification of territorial units for statistics within the meaning of Regulation (EC) No 1059/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 May 2003 on the establishment of a common classification of territorial units for statistics (NUTS) (5). The GDP per capita of such regions, measured in PPPs and calculated on the basis of Community figures for the period 2000 to 2002, is less than 75 % of the average GDP of the EU-25 for the same reference period. In the absence of regional PPPs, national PPPs should serve to establish the list of regions which could benefit from the Structural Funds. National PPPs can also be used to determine the amount of funds to be allocated to each region.\n(5)\nRegulation (EC) No 1083/2006 provides that the Member States eligible for funding from the Cohesion Fund are to be those whose gross national income (GNI) per capita, measured in PPPs and calculated on the basis of Community figures for the period 2001 to 2003, is less than 90 % of the average GNI of the EU-25 and which have a programme for meeting the economic convergence conditions referred to in Article 104 of the Treaty.\n(6)\nArticle 1 of Annex XI to the Staff Regulations of officials of the European Communities, laid down in Regulation (EEC, Euratom, ECSC) No 259/68 of the Council (6) (hereinafter referred to as ‘Staff Regulations’) provides that, for the purposes of the review provided for in Article 65(1) of the Staff Regulations, the Commission (Eurostat) are to draw up every year before the end of October a report on changes in the cost of living in Brussels, the economic parities between Brussels and certain places in the Member States, and changes in the purchasing power of salaries in national civil services in central government.\n(7)\nEvery year the Commission (Eurostat) already collects basic information on PPPs from the Member States on a voluntary basis. This operation has become an established practice in the Member States. However, a legal framework is necessary to ensure the sustainable development, production and dissemination of PPPs.\n(8)\nProvision of preliminary results on a regular basis, as is currently the practice, should be maintained in order to keep the most recent possible figures available.\n(9)\nThe measures necessary for the implementation of this Regulation should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission (7).\n(10)\nIn particular, power should be conferred on the Commission to adapt the definitions, to adjust the basic headings in Annex II and to define quality criteria. Since those measures are of general scope and designed to amend non-essential elements of this Regulation, inter alia by supplementing it with new non-essential elements, they must be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny laid down in Article 5a of Decision 1999/468/EC.\n(11)\nSince the objective of this Regulation, namely the establishment of common rules for the provision of basic information on purchasing power parities and for their calculation and dissemination, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve that objective.\n(12)\nThe Statistical Programme Committee, established by Council Decision 89/382/EEC, Euratom (8), has been consulted in accordance with Article 3 of that Decision,\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nArticle 1\nObjective\nThe objective of this Regulation is to establish common rules for the provision of basic information on PPPs, and for their calculation and dissemination.\nArticle 2\nScope\n1.   The basic information to be provided shall be those data necessary to calculate and ensure the quality of PPPs.\nThat basic information shall include prices, GDP expenditure weights and other data listed in Annex I.\nData shall be collected with the minimum frequency provided for in Annex I.

Regulation as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1882/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council (OJ L 284, 31.10.2003, p. 1).\nANNEX I\nMETHODOLOGY\n1.   METHODOLOGICAL MANUAL AND WORK PROGRAMME\n1.1.   A methodological manual will be provided by the Commission (Eurostat), following consultation with the Member States, describing the methods used at the various stages of compiling PPPs, including the methods for estimating missing basic information and for estimating missing parities. The methodological manual will be revised whenever a significant change to the methodology is made. It may introduce new methods to improve data quality, reduce costs or lessen the burden on data suppliers.\n1.2.   The Commission (Eurostat) will establish, by 30 November each year and in consultation with the Member States, an annual Work Programme for the following calendar year setting out the timetable for the specification and the provision of the basic information required for that year.\n1.3.   The annual Work Programme will determine the format for provision of data to be used by the Member States, and any other actions necessary in order to accomplish the calculation and publication of PPPs.\n1.4.   The basic information supplied according to point 1.2 may be revised, but the results for the reference year will be calculated from information available according to the timetable specified in Article 9. Where information is not complete or not available at that date, the Commission (Eurostat) will estimate the missing basic information.\n1.5.   Should a Member State fail to submit complete basic information, it will specify why the information is incomplete, when it will submit complete information or, if appropriate, why complete information cannot be provided.\n2.   BASIC INFORMATION\n2.1.   Basic information items\nFor the purpose of this Regulation, basic information pursuant to Articles 2 and 4 and the minimum frequency of new data supply will comprise and be provided as follows:\nBasic information\nMinimum frequency\nGDP expenditure weights (1)\nAnnual\nActual and imputed rentals (2)\nAnnual\nCompensation of employees\nAnnual\nTemporal adjustment factors\nAnnual\nPrices of consumer goods and services and related representativity indicators\n3 years (3)\nPrices of equipment goods\n3 years\nPrices of construction projects\n3 years\nSpatial adjustment factors\n6 years\n2.2.   Procedure for obtaining basic information\nThe Commission (Eurostat), after taking account of the views of the Member States, will determine the sources and data suppliers to be used for each of the above items of basic information. If the Commission (Eurostat) obtains basic information from a data supplier other than a Member State, the latter will be relieved of the obligations set out in points 5.1.4 to 5.1.13.\n3.   NATIONAL AVERAGE PRICES\n3.1.   Notwithstanding the provisions of Article 2(2), data collection may be limited to one or more locations within the economic territory. Such data may be used for PPP calculations provided that they are accompanied by appropriate spatial adjustment factors. Such spatial adjustment factors will be used to adjust survey data in the relevant locations to those representative of the national average.\n3.2.   Spatial adjustment factors will be supplied at basic heading level. They will be no more than six years old at the reference period of the survey.\n4.   ANNUAL AVERAGE PRICES\nNotwithstanding the provisions of Article 2(2), data collection may be limited to a specific period of time. Such data may be used for PPP calculations provided that they are accompanied by appropriate temporal adjustment factors. Such temporal adjustment factors will be used to adjust survey data in this period to those representative of the annual average.\n5.   QUALITY\n5.1.   Minimum standards for basic information\n5.1.1.   The list of items to be priced will be designed to comprise items whose specifications ensure comparability between countries.\n5.1.2.   The list of items to be priced will be designed so that each Member State can indicate at least one representative item which can be priced in at least one other Member State for each basic heading.\n5.1.3.   The item list will be designed in order to achieve the highest practicable level of equi-representativity so that, as a minimum, each country has to price one representative item for each basic heading and this representative item has to be priced by at least one other country.\n5.1.4.   Each Member State will price items according to the specifications in the item list.\n5.1.5.   Each Member State will price a sufficient number of items within each basic heading that are available in its market, even though they may not be considered as representative of that basic heading.\n5.1.6.   Each Member State will supply prices of at least one representative item within each basic heading. The representative items will be indicated by a representativity indicator.\n5.1.7.   Each Member State will collect a sufficient number of price quotations for each item priced to ensure a reliable average price per item taking account of its market structure.\n5.1.8.   The selection of outlet types will be designed to adequately reflect the domestic pattern of consumption within the Member State according to the item.\n5.1.9.   The outlet selection in a location will be designed to adequately reflect the pattern of consumption of the residents of the location and the availability of items.\n5.1.10.   Each Member State will supply the Commission (Eurostat) with data on compensation of employees for selected occupations with reference to the sector General Government (S 13) as defined in ESA 95.\n5.1.11.   Each Member State will supply the Commission (Eurostat) with temporal adjustment factors which allow calculation of PPPs from prices collected at a specific time which adequately reflect the annual average price level.\n5.1.12.   Each Member State will supply the Commission (Eurostat) with spatial adjustment factors which allow calculation of PPPs with prices collected in specific locations which adequately reflect the national average price level.\n5.1.13.   Each Member State will supply the Commission (Eurostat) with weights relating to each basic heading as specified in Annex II which reflect the expenditure pattern in the Member State for the reference year.\n5.2.   Minimum standards for the validation of price survey results\n5.2.1.   Each Member State will, before transmitting the data to the Commission (Eurostat), carry out a review of data validity based on:\n—\nmaximum and minimum prices,\n—\nthe average price and coefficient of variation,\n—\nthe number of priced items per basic heading,\n—\nthe number of priced representative items per basic heading, and\n—\nthe number of prices observed per item.\n5.2.2.   An electronic tool containing the algorithms required for the purposes of point 5.2.1 will be supplied by the Commission (Eurostat) to the Member States.\n5.2.3.   The Commission (Eurostat) will, before finalising the survey results, carry out validity checks, in conjunction with the Member States, based on indicators including:\nFor each basic heading:\n—\nthe number of items priced by each country,\n—\nthe number of items attributed a representativity indicator by each country,\n—\nthe price level index,\n—\nthe results of the previous survey covering the same basic heading, and\n—\nprice level indices in PPP terms for each country.\nFor each item:\n—\nthe number of prices observed by each country, and\n—\nthe variation coefficients of:\n(i)\naverage prices in national currencies,\n(ii)\nprice level indices in PPP terms, and\n(iii)\nprice level indices in PPP terms for each country.\n5.2.4.   The Commission (Eurostat) will, before finalising the PPP results at aggregate level, carry out validity checks based on indicators including:\nAt the level of total GDP and its main aggregates:\n—\nthe consistency of GDP expenditure weights and population estimates with published data,\n—\na comparison of per capita volume indices for current and previous calculations, and\n—\na comparison of price level indices for current and previous calculations.\nAt the level of each basic heading:\n—\na comparison of the GDP weighting structure for current and previous calculations, and\n—\nestimates of missing data, where relevant.\n5.3.   Reporting and assessment\n5.3.1.   Each Member State will maintain documentation which gives a full description of the manner in which this Regulation has been implemented. This documentation will be available to the Commission (Eurostat) and the other Member States.\n5.3.2.   Each Member State will have its PPP process assessed at least once every six years by the Commission (Eurostat). The assessments, planned annually and included in the annual Work Programme, will review compliance with this Regulation. A report, based on the assessments, will be made by the Commission (Eurostat) and be made publicly available, including on its website.\n5.3.3.   In accordance with Article 7(3), shortly after each consumer price survey, a report by the Member State responsible will be given to the Commission (Eurostat) providing information on the way in which the survey was conducted. The Commission (Eurostat) will provide each Member State with a summary of these reports.\n6.   CONSUMER PRICE SURVEY PROCEDURE\n6.1.   Member States will carry out the price surveys according to the Work Programme.\n6.2.   For each survey, the Commission (Eurostat) will prepare the survey item list, based on proposals which will be made by each Member State for each basic heading.\n6.3.   The Commission (Eurostat) will provide, together with the item list, in all official languages of the European Union, a translation of all specifications in each survey list.\n7.   CALCULATION PROCEDURE\n7.1.   Calculation of bilateral parities at basic heading level\n(a)\nThe calculation of multilateral Èltetò-Köves-Szulc (hereinafter referred to as ‘EKS’) parities at basic heading level will be based on a matrix of bilateral parities for each pair of participant countries.\n(b)\nThe calculation of bilateral parities will be carried out by reference to the prices observed for, and the representativity indicators attributed to, the underlying items.\n(c)\nThe average survey price for each item will be established as the simple arithmetic mean of the price observations recorded for that item.\n(d)\nThe national annual average price will be estimated, where necessary, on the basis of the average survey price by using appropriate spatial and temporal adjustment factors.\n(e)\nThe ratios of the adjusted average prices will then be calculated, where possible, for items and pairs of participant countries, together with their inverse.\n(f)\nPPPs will then be calculated, where possible, for all pairs of participant countries for the basic heading. For each pair of participant countries, PPPs will be calculated as the weighted geometric mean of:\n—\nthe geometric mean of the price ratios of items which are indicated as representative of both countries,\n—\nthe geometric mean of the price ratios of items which are indicated as representative of the first country but not of the second country,\n—\nthe geometric mean of the price ratios of items which are indicated as representative of the second country but not of the first country,\nusing weights reflecting the relative representativity of all items priced by both countries.\n7.2.   Estimation of missing bilateral parities\nIf for any basic heading the bilateral PPPs cannot be calculated, the missing bilateral PPPs will be estimated, where possible, by using the standard procedure of geometric averaging of indirect parities via third countries. Should the matrix of bilateral PPPs for a basic heading still contain any missing values after this estimation procedure, the calculation of multilateral EKS parities will then not be possible for the countries for which bilateral PPPs are missing. Such missing EKS parities will then be estimated by the Commission (Eurostat), using reference PPPs from similar basic headings or any other appropriate estimation method.\n7.3.   The calculation of bilateral parities at aggregate level\n(a)\nThe calculation of bilateral parities at a particular level of national accounts aggregation will be carried out using the EKS parities (see point 7.4), and the GDP expenditure weights, for the underlying basic headings.\n(b)\nA Laspeyres-type parity will then be calculated for the selected level of aggregation as the arithmetic mean of the parities for the underlying basic headings, weighted by the relative percentages (or nominal values) for the second country of each pair of participant countries.\n(c)\nA Paasche-type parity will then be calculated for the selected level of aggregation as the harmonic mean of the parities for the underlying basic headings, weighted by the relative percentages (or nominal values) for the first country of each pair of participant countries.\n(d)\nA Fisher-type parity will then be calculated for the selected level of aggregation as the geometric mean of the Laspeyres-type and Paasche-type parities established for each pair of participant countries.\n7.4.   Calculation of transitive multilateral PPPS\nThe calculation of transitive multilateral parities will be carried out either at basic heading level or any aggregated level by using the EKS procedure based on a complete matrix of Fisher-type parities between each pair of participant countries as follows:\nwhere tEKSs denotes the EKS parity between country s and country t;\ntFs denotes the Fisher-type parity between country s and country t;\nz denotes the number of participant countries.\n8.   TRANSMISSION\n8.1.   The Commission (Eurostat) will supply to the Member States the templates for electronic transmission of the basic information necessary to calculate PPPs.\n8.2.   Member States will provide basic information to the Commission (Eurostat) in accordance with the templates.\n9.   PUBLICATION\nIn addition to the provisions contained in Article 9(2), the Commission (Eurostat) may publish results at a more detailed level after consultation with the Member States.\n10.   CORRECTIONS\n10.1.   When a mistake is discovered by a Member State, it will immediately and on its own initiative provide the Commission (Eurostat) with correct basic information. In addition, a Member State will inform the Commission (Eurostat) of any suspected inappropriate application of the calculation procedure.\n10.2.   After becoming aware of a mistake, made either by a Member State or the Commission (Eurostat), the Commission (Eurostat) will inform the Member States and recalculate the PPPs within one month.\n10.3.   If the mistakes discovered result in a change of at least 0,5 percentage points at the level of per capita GDP in PPS of any Member State, the Commission (Eurostat) will publish a correction as soon as possible, unless such mistakes are discovered later than three months after the results have been published.\n10.4.   Where a mistake has occurred, the responsible body will take steps to prevent similar future occurrences.\n10.5.   Revisions carried out after 33 months following the end of the reference year to GDP expenditure weights or to population estimates will not require a correction to be made to PPP results.\n(1)  These weights shall be consistent with the lowest level of available aggregates from national accounts. If the required detail is not available, the Member State may provide best estimates for the missing positions.\n(2)  The dwellings stock quantity approach, as described in the methodological manual, may be used instead of the price approach in cases where actual rentals are missing or are statistically unreliable in line with Regulation (EC) No 1722/2005.\n(3)  The minimum frequency refers to the provision of data for a particular product group, related to the rolling cycle of surveys.\nANNEX II\nBasic headings as defined in Article 3(e)\nBH No\nDescription\nINDIVIDUAL CONSUMPTION EXPENDITURE BY HOUSEHOLDS\nFOOD AND NON-ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES\nFood\nBread and cereals [COICOP 01.1.1]\n1\nRice\n2\nOther cereals, flour and other cereal products\n3\nBread\n4\nOther bakery products\n5\nPasta products\nMeat [COICOP 01.1.2]\n6\nBeef and veal\n7\nPork\n8\nLamb, mutton and goat\n9\nPoultry\n10\nOther meats and edible offal\n11\nDelicatessen and other meat preparations\nFish and seafood [COICOP 01.1.3]\n12\nFresh, chilled or frozen fish and seafood\n13\nPreserved or processed fish and seafood\nMilk, cheese and eggs [COICOP 01.1.4]\n14\nFresh milk\n15\nPreserved milk and other milk products\n16\nCheese\n17\nEggs and egg-based products\nOils and fats [COICOP 01.1.5]\n18\nButter\n19\nMargarine\n20\nOther edible oils and fats\nFruit [COICOP 01.1.6]\n21\nFresh or chilled fruit\n22\nFrozen, preserved or processed fruit and fruit-based products\nVegetables [COICOP 01.1.7]\n23\nFresh or chilled vegetables other than potatoes\n24\nFresh or chilled potatoes\n25\nFrozen, preserved or processed vegetables and vegetable-based products\nSugar, jam, honey, chocolate and confectionery [COICOP 01.1.8]\n26\nSugar\n27\nJams, marmalades and honey\n28\nConfectionery, chocolate and other cocoa preparations\n29\nEdible ice, ice-cream and sorbet\nFood products n.e.c.

These rules aim to improve the quality and comparability of the data collected and calculated.\nACT\n                  \nRegulation (EC) No 1445/2007 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 December 2007 establishing common rules for the provision of basic information on purchasing power parities and for their calculation and dissemination\nSUMMARY\n                  \nPurchasing power parities (PPPs)* are a way of measuring price differences between countries. The European Union (EU) has agreed on rules for their calculation within the national statistical institutes and Eurostat, the EU’s statistical office. These rules aim to improve the quality and comparability of the data collected and calculated.\nWHAT DOES THE REGULATION DO?\n                     \nIt sets out the rules for the development, production and calculation of PPPs and the responsibilities of the various parties involved.\nKEY POINTS\nRoles and responsibilities\nEurostat calculates PPPs each calendar year. Its tasks include:\ncoordinating the supply of basic information;\ncollecting information from EU countries for the calculation of PPPs;\ncalculating and publishing PPPs; and\ndeveloping and communicating methodology, in consultation with EU countries.\nEU countries must:\nfollow the procedure for basic data collection laid down in the regulation;\ncertify the survey results for which they are responsible once data validation has been completed;\napprove the data collection methodology and check the plausibility of data provided by Eurostat.\nQuality control\nEach country has to keep records of how they have implemented this regulation. Their PPP process must be assessed at least once every 6 years.\nPublished results\nThe results are published by Eurostat no later than 3 years after the end of the reference year. They include at least the following:\nPPPs at the level of gross domestic product (GDP);\nPPPs for private household consumption expenditure* and actual individual consumption*;\nprice level indices* relative to the EU average;\nGDP, private household consumption expenditure and actual individual consumption and respective per capita figures in purchasing power standard*.\nUse of PPPs\nPPPs are used to calculate:\nthe sums allocated by the EU’s Structural and Investment Funds; national per capita GDPs deflated by PPPs are used to draw up the list of regions eligible for Structural Funds assistance and to determine the amount of funding allocated to each region;\nthe correction coefficients to be applied to the pay and pensions of EU officials and other EU employees in accordance with the Staff Regulations of Officials and the Conditions of Employment of Other Servants of the European Economic Community and the European Atomic Energy Community.\nGrant available\nAs PPPs are fundamentally international statistics and have only a limited national purpose, Eurostat provides a financial contribution that covers up to 70 % of the costs incurred by those EU countries which are eligible under the rules on grants (Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002 - the EU’s Financial Regulation).\nWHEN DOES THIS REGULATION APPLY?\n                     \nFrom 9 January 2008.\nFor more information, see:\npurchasing power parities: overview on Eurostat’s website;\npurchasing power parities: statistics illustrated on Eurostat’s website.\nKEY TERMS\n* Purchasing power parities (PPP): indicators of price level differences across countries. They provide a direct comparison of how many units of currency are needed to purchase a given quantity of goods or services in different countries.\n* Household final consumption expenditure: expenditure incurred by resident households on consumption of goods or services.\n* Actual individual consumption: the total value of the individual consumption expenditures of households, NPISHs (Non-profit institutions serving households) and general government. A measure of the individual goods and services that households actually consume as opposed to what they actually purchase.\n* Price level indices: the ratios of PPPs to exchange rates. They provide a measure of the differences in price levels between countries by indicating the number of units of the common currency needed to buy the same volume of the aggregation level or analytical category in each country.\n* Purchasing power standard: an artificial common currency in which national accounts aggregates (e.g. aggregated consumption, aggregated investment) are expressed when adjusted for price level differences using PPPs. This allows comparability of results.\nREFERENCES\nAct\nEntry into force\nDeadline for transposition in the Member States\nOfficial Journal\nRegulation (EC) No 1445/2007\n9.1.2008\n-\nOJ L 336, 20.12.2007, pp. 1-24\nAmending act(s)\nEntry into force\nDeadline for transposition in the Member States\nOfficial Journal\nRegulation (EU) No 193/2011\n21.3.2011\n-\nOJ L 56, 1.3.2011, pp. 1-2\nRegulation (EU) 2015/1163\n5.8.2015\n-\nOJ L 188, 16.7.2015, pp. 6-27\nlast update 13.08.2015", "tags": ["statistical method", "Eurostat", "purchasing power parity", "EU statistics", "data transmission", "Structural Funds", "eligible region", "data collection"], "subjects": ["Coordination of structural instruments", "Economic and Monetary Union", "Information and verification"], "split": "train", "reference_annotations": {"32007R1445_p1": {"text": "(10)  Council regulation 696/93 of 15 March 1993 on the statistical units for the observation and analysis of the production system in the Community (OJ L 76, 30.3.1993, p. 1).
