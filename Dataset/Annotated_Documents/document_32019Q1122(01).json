1\nEuropean Parliament\n1.\nThe European Parliament is the assembly elected pursuant to the Treaties, the Act of 20 September 1976 concerning the election of the members of the European Parliament by direct universal suffrage and national legislation deriving from the Treaties.\n2.\nPersons elected to the European Parliament shall be referred to as:\n‘Членове на Европейския парламент’ in Bulgarian,\n‘Diputados al Parlamento Europeo’ in Spanish,\n‘Poslanci Evropského parlamentu’ in Czech,\n‘Medlemmer af Europa-Parlamentet’ in Danish,\n‘Mitglieder des Europäischen Parlaments’ in

of 20 September 1976 and with Article 2(1) and Article 3(1) of the Statute for Members of the European Parliament, Members shall exercise their mandate freely and independently, shall not be bound by any instructions and shall not receive a binding mandate.\nRule 3\nVerification of credentials\n1.\nFollowing general elections to the European Parliament, the President shall invite the competent authorities of the Member States to notify Parliament without delay of the names of the elected Members so that all Members may take their seats in Parliament with effect from the opening of the first sitting following the elections.\nAt the same time, the President shall draw the attention of those authorities to the relevant provisions of the Act of 20 September 1976 and invite them to take the necessary measures to avoid any incompatibility with the office of Member of the European Parliament.\n2.\nMembers whose election has been notified to Parliament shall declare in writing, before taking their seat in Parliament, that they do not hold any office incompatible with that of Member of the European Parliament within the meaning of Article 7(1) or (2) of the Act of 20 September 1976. Following general elections, the declaration shall be made, where possible, no later than six days prior to Parliament's first sitting following the elections. Until such time as Members' credentials have been verified or a ruling has been given on any dispute, and provided that they have previously signed the above-mentioned written declaration, they shall take their seat in Parliament and on its bodies and shall enjoy all the rights attaching thereto.\nWhere it is established from facts verifiable from sources available to the public that a Member holds an office incompatible with that of Member of the European Parliament, within the meaning of Article 7(1) or (2) of the Act of 20 September 1976, Parliament, on the basis of the information provided by its President, shall establish that there is a vacancy.\n3.\nOn the basis of a report by the committee responsible, Parliament shall verify credentials without delay and rule on the validity of the mandate of each of its newly elected Members and also on any disputes referred to it pursuant to the provisions of the Act of 20 September 1976, other than those which, under that Act, fall exclusively under the national provisions to which that Act refers.\nThe committee's report shall be based on the official notification by each Member State of the full results of the election, specifying the names of the candidates elected and those of any substitutes, together with their ranking in accordance with the results of the vote.\nThe validity of the mandate of a Member may not be confirmed unless the written declarations required under this Rule and Annex I to these Rules of Procedure have been made.\n4.\nOn the basis of a proposal by the committee responsible, Parliament shall, without delay, verify the credentials of individual Members who are replacing outgoing Members and may at any time rule on any dispute as to the validity of the mandate of any of its Members.\n5.\nWhere the appointment of a Member is due to the withdrawal of candidates from the same list, the committee responsible shall ensure that the withdrawal in question has taken place in accordance with the spirit and the letter of the Act of 20 September 1976 and Rule 4(2).\n6.\nThe committee responsible shall ensure that any information which may affect the eligibility of the Member or the eligibility or the ranking of the substitutes is forwarded to Parliament without delay by the authorities of the Member States or of the Union, with, in the case of an appointment, an indication of the date on which it will take effect.\nShould the competent authorities of the Member States initiate a procedure which might lead to the disqualification of a Member from holding office, the President shall ask them to keep him or her regularly informed of the stage reached in the procedure and shall refer the matter to the committee responsible. On a proposal from that committee, Parliament may adopt a position on the matter.\nRule 4\nTerm of office of Members\n1.\nA Member's term of office begins and ends as laid down in Articles 5 and 13 of the Act of 20 September 1976.\n2.\nMembers who resign shall notify the President of their resignation and of the date on which that resignation is to take effect, which may not be more than three months after notification. This notification shall take the form of an official record drawn up in the presence of the Secretary-General or his or her representative, signed by the latter and by the Member concerned and immediately submitted to the committee responsible, which shall enter it on the agenda of its first meeting following receipt of the document.\nIf the committee responsible considers that the resignation is in compliance with the Act of 20 September 1976, a vacancy shall be declared with effect from the date indicated by the resigning Member in the official record, and the President shall inform Parliament thereof.\nIf the committee responsible considers that the resignation is not in compliance with the Act of 20 September 1976, it shall propose to Parliament that it not declare a vacancy.\n3.\nWhere no meeting of the committee responsible is scheduled before the next part-session, the rapporteur of the committee responsible shall immediately examine any resignation that has been duly notified. Where delay in considering the notification would be prejudicial, the rapporteur shall refer the matter to the committee Chair, requesting, pursuant to paragraph 2, that:\n—\nthe President be informed on behalf of the committee that a vacancy may be declared, or\n—\nan extraordinary meeting of the committee be convened to examine specific difficulties noted by the rapporteur.\n4.\nWhere either the competent authorities of the Member States or of the Union or the Member concerned notifies the President of an appointment or election to an office that is incompatible with the office of Member of the European Parliament within the meaning of Article 7(1) or (2) of the Act of 20 September 1976, the President shall inform Parliament thereof, and Parliament shall declare that a vacancy exists from the date of the incompatibility.\nWhere the competent authorities of the Member States notify the President of the end of the term of office of a Member of the European Parliament as a result either of an additional incompatibility established by the law of that Member State in accordance with Article 7(3) of the Act of 20 September 1976 or of the withdrawal of the Member's mandate pursuant to Article 13(3) of that Act, the President shall inform Parliament that the term of office of that Member ended on the date communicated by competent authorities of the Member State. Where no such date is communicated, the date of the end of the term of office shall be the date of the notification by that Member State.\n5.\nWhere the authorities of the Member States or of the Union inform the President of an assignment they intend to entrust to a Member, the President shall refer to the committee responsible the question of the compatibility of the proposed assignment with the Act of 20 September 1976 and shall inform Parliament, the Member and the authorities concerned of the conclusions reached by that committee.\n6.\nWhen Parliament has established a vacancy, the President shall inform the Member State concerned thereof, and invite it to fill the seat without delay.\n7.\nWhere acceptance or termination of office appears to be based on material inaccuracy or vitiated consent, Parliament may declare the appointment under consideration to be invalid or may refuse to establish the vacancy.\nRule 5\nPrivileges and immunities\n1.\nMembers enjoy the privileges and immunities laid down in the Protocol No 7 on the Privileges and Immunities of the European Union.\n2.\nIn exercising its powers on privileges and immunities, Parliament shall act to uphold its integrity as a democratic legislative assembly and to ensure the independence of its Members in the performance of their duties. Parliamentary immunity is not a Member's personal privilege but a guarantee of the independence of Parliament as a whole, and of its Members.\n3.\nA laissez-passer of the European Union allowing a Member to circulate freely in the Member States and in other countries which recognise it as a valid travel document shall be issued by the European Union to a Member at his or her request, on condition that the President of the Parliament gives his or her authorisation.\n4.\nFor the purpose of performing their parliamentary duties, all Members shall have the right to participate actively in the work of Parliament's committees and delegations in accordance with the provisions of these Rules of Procedure.\n5.\nMembers shall be entitled to inspect any files held by Parliament or a committee, other than personal files and accounts, which only the Members concerned shall be allowed to inspect. Exceptions to this rule, concerning the handling of documents to which public access may be denied, pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council (1), are laid down in Rule 221.\nWith the approval of the Bureau, a Member may, on the basis of a reasoned decision, be denied the right to inspect a Parliament document if, after hearing the Member concerned, the Bureau comes to the conclusion that such an inspection would cause unacceptable damage to Parliament's institutional interests or to the public interest, and that the Member concerned is seeking to inspect the document for private and personal reasons. The Member may lodge a written appeal against such a decision within one month of the notification thereof. In order to be admissible, written appeals must include reasons. Parliament shall reach a decision on the appeal without debate during the part-session that follows its lodging.\nAccess to confidential information is subject to the rules laid down in interinstitutional agreements concluded by Parliament relating to the treatment of confidential information (2)\nand to the internal rules for their implementation adopted by Parliament's competent bodies (3).\nRule 6\nWaiver of immunity\n1.\nAny request for waiver of immunity shall be evaluated in accordance with Articles 7, 8 and 9 of the Protocol No 7 on the Privileges and Immunities of the European Union and with the principles referred to in Rule 5(2).\n2.\nWhere Members are required to appear as witnesses or expert witnesses, there is no need to request a waiver of immunity, provided:\n—\nthat they will not be obliged to appear on a date or at a time which prevents them from performing their parliamentary duties, or makes it difficult for them to perform those duties, or that they will be able to provide a statement in writing or in any other form which does not make it difficult for them to perform their parliamentary duties, and\n—\nthat they are not obliged to testify concerning information obtained confidentially in the performance of their parliamentary duties which they do not see fit to disclose.\nRule 7\nDefence of privileges and immunity\n1.\nIn cases where it is alleged that an infringement of the privileges and immunities of a Member or former Member by the authorities of a Member State has occurred or is about to occur, a request for a Parliament decision as to whether those privileges and immunities have been or are likely to be breached may be made in accordance with Rule 9(1).\n2.\nIn particular, such a request for the defence of privileges and immunities may be made if it is considered that the circumstances would constitute an administrative or other restriction on the free movement of Members travelling to or from the place of meeting of Parliament or an administrative or other restriction on an opinion expressed or a vote cast in the performance of their duties, or that the circumstances would fall within the scope of Article 9 of the Protocol No 7 on the Privileges and Immunities of the European Union.\n3.\nA request for the defence of the privileges and immunities of a Member shall not be admissible if a request for the waiver or defence of that Member's immunity has already been received in respect of the same facts, whether or not that earlier request led to a decision.\n4.\nNo further consideration shall be given to a request for the defence of the privileges and immunities of a Member if a request for the waiver of that Member's immunity is received in respect of the same facts.\n5.\nIn cases where a decision has been taken not to defend the privileges and immunities of a Member, the Member may exceptionally make a request for reconsideration of the decision, by submitting new evidence in accordance with Rule 9(1). The request for reconsideration shall be inadmissible if proceedings have been instituted against the decision under Article 263 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, or if the President considers that the new evidence submitted is insufficiently substantiated to warrant reconsideration.\nRule 8\nUrgent action by the President to assert immunity\n1.\nAs a matter of urgency, in circumstances where a Member is arrested or has his or her freedom of movement curtailed in apparent breach of his or her privileges and immunities, the President may, after consulting the Chair and rapporteur of the committee responsible, take an initiative to assert the privileges and immunities of the Member concerned. The President shall notify the committee of that initiative and inform Parliament.\n2.\nWhen the President makes use of the powers conferred on him or her by paragraph 1, the committee shall take cognisance of the President's initiative at its next meeting. Where the committee deems it necessary, it may prepare a report for submission to Parliament.\nRule 9\nProcedures on immunity\n1.\nAny request addressed to the President by a competent authority of a Member State for the immunity of a Member to be waived, or by a Member or a former Member for privileges and immunities to be defended, shall be announced in Parliament and referred to the committee responsible.\n2.\nWith the agreement of the Member or the former Member concerned, the request may be made by another Member, who shall be permitted to represent the Member or former Member concerned at all stages of the procedure.\nThe Member representing the Member or the former Member concerned shall not be involved in the decisions taken by the committee.\n3.\nThe committee shall consider, without delay but having regard to their relative complexity, requests for the waiver of immunity or requests for the defence of privileges and immunities.\n4.\nThe committee shall make a proposal for a reasoned decision which recommends the adoption or rejection of the request for the waiver of immunity or for the defence of privileges and immunities. Amendments shall not be admissible. If a proposal is rejected, the contrary decision shall be deemed to have been adopted.\n5.\nThe committee may ask the authority concerned to provide any information or explanation which the committee deems necessary in order for it to form an opinion on whether immunity should be waived or defended.\n6.\nThe Member concerned shall be given an opportunity to be heard and may present any documents or other written evidence deemed by that Member to be relevant.\nThe Member concerned shall not be present during debates on the request for waiver or defence of his or her immunity, except for the hearing itself.\nThe Chair of the committee shall invite the Member to be heard, indicating a date and time. The Member concerned may renounce the right to be heard.\nIf the Member concerned fails to attend the hearing pursuant to that invitation, he or she shall be deemed to have renounced the right to be heard, unless he or she has asked to be excused from being heard on the date and at the time proposed, and has given his or her reasons. The Chair of the committee shall rule on whether such a request to be excused is to be accepted in view of the reasons given. The Member concerned shall not be permitted to appeal that ruling.\nIf the Chair of the committee grants the request to be excused, he or she shall invite the Member concerned to be heard at a new date and time. If the Member concerned fails to comply with the second invitation to be heard, the procedure shall continue without the Member being heard. No further requests to be excused, or to be heard, may then be accepted.\n7.\nWhere the request seeks the waiver or the defence of immunity on several counts, each of these may be the subject of a separate decision. The committee's report may, exceptionally, propose that the waiver or the defence of immunity should apply solely to prosecution proceedings and that, until a final sentence is passed, the Member should be immune from any form of detention or remand or any other measure which prevents that Member from performing the duties proper to the mandate.\n8.\nThe committee may offer a reasoned opinion as to the competence of the authority in question and the admissibility of the request, but shall not, under any circumstances, pronounce on the guilt, or otherwise, of the Member, nor shall it pronounce on whether or not the opinions or acts attributed to the Member justify prosecution, even if the committee, in considering the request, acquires detailed knowledge of the facts of the case.\n9.\nThe committee's proposal for a decision shall be placed on the agenda of the first sitting following the day on which it was tabled. No amendments may be tabled to such a proposal.\nDiscussion shall be confined to the reasons for and against each proposal to waive or uphold immunity, or to defend a privilege or immunity.\nWithout prejudice to Rule 173, the Member whose privileges or immunities are under consideration shall not speak in the debate.\nThe proposal or proposals for a decision contained in the report shall be put to the vote at the first voting time following the debate.\nAfter Parliament has considered the matter, a separate vote shall be taken on each of the proposals contained in the report. If a proposal is rejected, the contrary decision shall be deemed to have been adopted.\n10.\nThe President shall immediately communicate Parliament's decision to the Member concerned and to the competent authority of the Member State concerned, with a request that the President be informed of any developments and judicial rulings in the relevant proceedings. When the President receives this information, he or she shall transmit it to Parliament in the way he or she considers most appropriate, if necessary after consulting the committee responsible.\n11.\nThe committee shall treat these matters, and handle any documents received with the utmost confidentiality. The committee shall always consider requests relating to procedures on immunity in camera.\n12.\nParliament shall only examine requests for the waiver of a Member's immunity that have been transmitted to it by the judicial authorities or by the Permanent Representations of the Member States.\n13.\nThe committee shall lay down principles for the application of this Rule.\n14.\nAny inquiry as to the scope of Members' privileges or immunities made by a competent authority shall be dealt with in accordance with the above rules.\nRule 10\nStandards of conduct\n1.\nThe conduct of Members shall be characterised by mutual respect and shall be based on the values and principles laid down in the Treaties, and particularly in the Charter of Fundamental Rights. Members shall respect Parliament's dignity and shall not harm its reputation.\n2.\nMembers shall not compromise the smooth conduct of parliamentary business and shall not compromise the maintenance of security and order on Parliament's premises or the functioning of its equipment.\n3.\nMembers shall not disrupt the good order of the Chamber and shall refrain from improper behaviour. They shall not display banners.\n4.\nIn parliamentary debates in the Chamber, Members shall not resort to offensive language.\nThe assessment of whether the language used by a Member in a parliamentary debate is offensive or not should take into consideration, inter alia, the identifiable intentions of the speaker, the perception of the statement by the public, the extent to which it harms the dignity and reputation of Parliament, and the freedom of speech of the Member concerned. By way of example, defamatory language, ‘hate speech’ and incitement to discrimination based, in particular, on any ground referred to in Article 21 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, would ordinarily constitute cases of ‘offensive language’ within the meaning of this Rule.\n5.\nMembers shall comply with Parliament's rules on the treatment of confidential information.\n6.\nMembers shall refrain from any type of psychological or sexual harassment and shall respect the Code of appropriate behaviour for Members of the European Parliament in exercising their duties which is attached to these Rules of Procedure as an annex (4).\nMembers may not be elected as office-holders of Parliament or one of its bodies, be appointed as rapporteur or participate in an official delegation or interinstitutional negotiations, if they have not signed the declaration relating to that Code.\n7.\nWhere a person working for a Member, or another person for whom the Member has arranged access to Parliament's premises or equipment, fails to comply with the standards of conduct set out in this Rule, this behaviour may, where appropriate, be imputable to the Member concerned.\n8.\nThe application of this Rule shall not otherwise detract from the liveliness of parliamentary debates, nor shall it undermine Members' freedom of speech.\n9.\nThis Rule shall apply, mutatis mutandis, in Parliament's bodies, committees and delegations.\nRule 11\nMembers' financial interests and Transparency register\n1.\nParliament shall lay down rules governing the transparency of its Members' financial interests in the form of a Code of Conduct which shall be adopted by a majority of its component Members and attached to these Rules of Procedure as an annex (5).\nThose rules shall not otherwise prejudice or restrict Members in the exercise of their office or of any related political or other activity.\n2.\nMembers should adopt the systematic practice of only meeting interest representatives that have registered in the Transparency Register established by means of the Agreement between the European Parliament and the European Commission (6).\n3.\nMembers should publish online all scheduled meetings with interest representatives falling under the scope of the Transparency register. Without prejudice to Article 4(6) of Annex I, rapporteurs, shadow rapporteurs and committee chairs shall, for each report, publish online all scheduled meetings with interest representatives falling under the scope of the Transparency register. The Bureau shall provide for necessary infrastructure on Parliament's website.\n4.\nThe Bureau shall provide the necessary infrastructure on Members' online page on Parliament's website for those Members who wish to publish a voluntary audit or confirmation, as provided for under the applicable rules of the Statute for Members and its implementing rules, that their use of the General Expenditure Allowance complies with the applicable rules of the Statute for Members and its implementing measures.\n5.\nThese rules shall not otherwise prejudice or restrict Members in the exercise of their office or of any related political or other activity.\n6.\nThe code of conduct and the rights and privileges of former Members shall be laid down by a decision of the Bureau. No distinction shall be made in the treatment of former Members.\nRule 12\nInternal investigations conducted by the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF)\nThe common rules laid down in the Interinstitutional Agreement concerning internal investigations by the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) (7) comprising the measures that are needed to facilitate the smooth running of investigations conducted by the Office shall be applicable within Parliament, pursuant to Parliament Decision of 18 November 1999 (8).\nRule 13\nObservers\n1.\nWhere a Treaty on the accession of a State to the European Union has been signed, the President may, after obtaining the agreement of the Conference of Presidents, invite the parliament of the acceding State to appoint, from among its own members, a number of observers equal to the number of seats in the European Parliament to be allocated to that State upon accession.\n2.\nThose observers shall take part in the proceedings of Parliament pending the entry into force of the Treaty of Accession, and shall have a right to speak in committees and political groups. They shall not have the right to vote or to stand for election to positions in Parliament, nor shall they represent the Parliament externally. Their participation shall not have any legal effect on Parliament's proceedings.\n3.\nTheir treatment shall be assimilated to that of a Member as regards the use of Parliament's facilities and the reimbursement of travel and subsistence expenses incurred in their activities as observers.\nCHAPTER 2\nOfficers of Parliament\nRule 14\nProvisional Chair (9)\n1.\nAt the sitting provided for under Rule 154(2), and at any other sitting held for the purpose of electing the President and the Bureau, the outgoing President or, failing him or her, one of the outgoing Vice-Presidents, determined in accordance with their order of precedence, or, in the absence of any of them, the Member having held office for the longest period shall take the chair until the President has been elected.\n2.\nNo business shall be transacted while a Member is provisionally in the chair by virtue of paragraph 1 unless it concerns the election of the President or the verification of credentials under the second subparagraph of Rule 3(2).

If after three ballots no candidate has obtained an absolute majority of the votes cast, the fourth ballot shall, by way of derogation from Rule 15(1), be confined to the two Members who have obtained the highest number of votes in the third ballot. In the event of a tie, the older candidate shall be declared to have been elected.\n2.\nAs soon as the President has been elected, the Member who is provisionally in the chair by virtue of Rule 14 shall vacate the chair.

Parliament shall take a decision on that proposal by a majority of two-thirds of the votes cast, constituting a majority of its component Members.\nWhere a rapporteur breaches the provisions of the Code of Conduct for Members of the European Parliament with respect to financial interests and conflicts of interest (14), the committee which appointed him or her may, at the initiative of the President and on a proposal by the Conference of Presidents, terminate the holding of that office.

They may not organise events in third countries that coincide with a mission of an official Parliament body, including an official election observation delegation.\n3.\nProvided that the conditions laid down in Parliament's internal rules governing the establishment of such groupings are complied with, a political group may facilitate their activities by providing them with logistical support.\n4.\nIntergroups shall be required to make an annual declaration of any support, whether in cash or in kind (e.g. secretarial assistance), which, if offered to Members as individuals, would have had to be declared under Annex I.\nOther unofficial groupings shall also be required to declare, by the end of the following month, any support, whether in cash or in kind, which Members have not declared individually in accordance with their obligations under Annex I.\n5.\nOnly interest representatives who are registered in the Transparency register may participate in intergroup or other unofficial grouping activities organised on Parliament's premises, for instance by attending meetings or events of the intergroup or other unofficial grouping, by offering support to it, or by co-hosting its events.\n6.\nThe Quaestors shall keep a register of the declarations referred to in paragraph 4. The Quaestors shall adopt detailed rules on those declarations and their publication on Parliament's website.\n7.\nThe Quaestors shall ensure the effective enforcement of this Rule.\nRule 36\nNon-attached Members\n1.\nMembers who do not belong to a political group shall be provided with a secretariat.

In such cases it shall duly inform the committee responsible for the subject-matter.\n4.\nIf, where appropriate after the exchange of views with the Council and the Commission in accordance with the arrangements agreed at interinstitutional level (17), the committee responsible for legal affairs decides to dispute the validity or the appropriateness of the legal basis, it shall report its conclusions to Parliament. Without prejudice to Rule 61, Parliament shall vote on this before voting on the substance of the proposal.\n5.\nIf the committee responsible for the subject-matter or the committee responsible for legal affairs have not disputed the validity or appropriateness of the legal basis, amendments tabled in Parliament to change the legal basis shall be inadmissible.\nRule 41\nDelegation of legislative powers and conferral of implementing powers\n1.\nWhen scrutinising a proposal for a legislative act which delegates powers to the Commission as provided for in Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, Parliament shall pay particular attention to the objectives, content, scope and duration of the delegation, and to the conditions to which it is subject.\n2.\nWhen scrutinising a proposal for a legislative act which confers implementing powers pursuant to Article 291 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, Parliament shall pay particular attention to the fact that, in exercising an implementing power, the Commission may neither amend nor supplement the legislative act, even in respect of its non-essential elements.\n3.\nThe committee responsible for the subject-matter may at any time request the opinion of the committee that is responsible for the interpretation and application of Union law.\n4.\nIn addition, the committee responsible for the interpretation and application of Union law may, on its own initiative, take up questions concerning the delegation of legislative powers and the conferral of implementing powers.

In such cases, it shall duly inform the committee responsible for the subject-matter.\n5.\nIf the committee responsible for budgetary issues decides to dispute the financial compatibility of the proposal, it shall report its conclusions to Parliament before Parliament votes on the proposal.\nRule 43\nExamination of respect for the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality\n1.\nDuring the examination of a proposal for a legislative act, Parliament shall pay particular attention to whether that proposal respects the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality.\n2.\nOnly the committee responsible for respect for the principle of subsidiarity may make recommendations, for the attention of the committee responsible for the subject-matter, in respect of a proposal for a legislative act.\n3.\nExcept in the cases of urgency referred to in Article 4 of Protocol No 1 on the role of national parliaments in the European Union, the committee responsible for the subject-matter shall not proceed to its final vote before the expiry of the deadline of eight weeks laid down in Article 6 of Protocol No 2 on the application of the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality.\n4.\nIf a national parliament sends the President a reasoned opinion in accordance with Article 3 of Protocol No 1, that document shall be referred to the committee responsible for the subject-matter and forwarded, for information, to the committee responsible for respect for the principle of subsidiarity.\n5.\nWhere reasoned opinions on the non-compliance of a proposal for a legislative act with the principle of subsidiarity represent at least one third of all the votes allocated to the national parliaments in accordance with the second subparagraph of Article 7(1) of Protocol No 2, or a quarter in the case of a proposal for a legislative act submitted on the basis of Article 76 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, Parliament shall not take a decision until the author of the proposal has stated how it intends to proceed.\n6.\nWhere, under the ordinary legislative procedure, reasoned opinions on the non-compliance of a proposal for a legislative act with the principle of subsidiarity represent at least a simple majority of the votes allocated to the national parliaments in accordance with the second subparagraph of Article 7(1) of Protocol No 2, the committee responsible for the subject-matter, having considered the reasoned opinions submitted by the national parliaments and the Commission, and having heard the views of the committee responsible for respect for the principle of subsidiarity, may recommend to Parliament that it reject the proposal on the grounds of infringement of the principle of subsidiarity or submit to Parliament any other recommendation, which may include suggestions for amendments related to respect of the principle of subsidiarity. The opinion given by the committee responsible for respect for the principle of subsidiarity shall be annexed to any such recommendation.\nThe recommendation shall be submitted to Parliament for debate and a vote. If a recommendation to reject the proposal is adopted by a majority of the votes cast, the President shall declare the procedure to be closed.

Parliament shall do so by adopting a resolution on the basis of an own-initiative report drawn up by the committee responsible in accordance with Rule 54. The resolution shall be adopted by a majority of the component Members of Parliament in the final vote. Parliament may, at the same time, set a deadline for the submission of such a proposal.\n2.\nAny Member may table a proposal for a Union act on the basis of the right of initiative granted to Parliament pursuant to Article 225 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.\nSuch a proposal may be tabled jointly by up to 10 Members.

The Conference of Committee Chairs shall regularly report on the results of such monitoring to the Conference of Presidents.\nRule 48\nConsideration of legally binding acts\n1.\nThe President shall refer proposals for legally binding acts received from other institutions or Member States to the committee responsible, for consideration.\n2.\nIn cases of doubt, the President may, before the announcement in Parliament of a referral to the committee responsible, submit a question concerning competence to the Conference of Presidents. The Conference of Presidents shall adopt its decision on the basis of a recommendation from the Conference of Committee Chairs, or the chair of the Conference of Committee Chairs, in accordance with Rule 211(2).\n3.\nThe committee responsible may, at any time, decide to appoint a rapporteur to follow the preparatory phase of a proposal. It shall give particular consideration to doing so where the proposal is listed in the Commission Work Programme.\n4.\nIn the event of a conflict between a provision of the Rules of Procedure relating to the second and third readings and any other provision of the Rules, the provision relating to the second and third readings shall take precedence.\nRule 49\nAcceleration of legislative procedures\nThe acceleration of legislative procedures in coordination with the Council and Commission regarding specific proposals, selected in particular from among those identified as priorities in the joint declaration on annual interinstitutional programming pursuant to Rule 38(2), may be agreed by the committee or committees responsible.\nRule 50\nLegislative procedures on initiatives originating from institutions other than the Commission or from Member States\n1.\nWhen dealing with initiatives originating from institutions other than the Commission or originating from Member States, the committee responsible may invite representatives of the institutions or those originating Member States to present their initiative to the committee. The representatives of the originating Member States may be accompanied by the Presidency of the Council.\n2.\nBefore the committee responsible proceeds to the vote, it shall ask the Commission whether it is preparing an opinion on the initiative, or if it intends to submit an alternative proposal within a short period of time. If the answer that it receives is in the affirmative, the committee shall not adopt its report before receiving that opinion or alternative proposal.\n3.\nWhen two or more proposals originating from the Commission and/or another institution and/or the Member States with the same legislative objective have been submitted to Parliament simultaneously or within a short period of time, Parliament shall deal with them in a single report.

Unless members or a political group or groups reaching at least the medium threshold in the committee object, the proposed procedure shall be deemed to have been approved. The Chair, or, if one has been appointed, the rapporteur, shall present to Parliament a report approving the proposal. The second subparagraph of Rule 159(1) and Rule 159(2) and (4) shall apply.\n2.\nAlternatively, the Chair may propose that a set of amendments be drafted by the Chair or by the rapporteur reflecting the committee's discussion. Unless members or a political group or groups reaching at least the medium threshold in the committee object, the proposed procedure shall be deemed to have been approved and the amendments shall be sent to the members of the committee.\nUnless members or a political group or groups reaching at least the medium threshold in the committee object to the amendments within a set time limit, which shall not be less than 10 working days from the date of dispatch, the report shall be deemed to have been adopted by the committee. In this case, the draft legislative resolution and the amendments shall be submitted to Parliament without debate pursuant to the second subparagraph of Rule 159(1) and Rule 159(2) and (4).\nIf members or a political group or groups reaching at least the medium threshold in the committee object to the amendments, they shall be put to the vote at the next meeting of the committee.\n3.\nWith the exception of the provisions concerning the submission to Parliament, this Rule shall apply mutatis mutandis to committee opinions within the meaning of Rule 56.\nRule 53\nNon-legislative reports\n1.\nWhere a committee draws up a non-legislative report, it shall appoint a rapporteur from among its members or permanent substitutes.\n2.\nThe committee's report shall include:\n(a)\na motion for a resolution;\n(b)\nan explanatory statement including, where necessary, a financial statement which establishes the magnitude of the financial impact of the report, if any, and its compatibility with the multiannual financial framework;\n(c)\nthe texts of any motions for resolutions to be included under Rule 143(7).\nRule 54\nOwn-initiative reports\n1.\nA committee intending to draw up a non-legislative report or a report under Rule 46 or 47 on a subject within its competence on which no referral has taken place, may do so only with the authorisation of the Conference of Presidents.\nThe Conference of Presidents shall take a decision on requests for authorisation to draw up reports submitted pursuant to the first subparagraph on the basis of implementing provisions, which it shall lay down.\n2.\nWhere the Conference of Presidents decides to withhold such authorisation, it shall state its reasons for doing so.\nWhere the subject matter of the report falls within Parliament's right of initiative referred to in Rule 46, the Conference of Presidents may only decide to withhold such authorisation if the conditions set out in the Treaties are not met.\n3.\nIn the cases referred to in Rules 46 and 47, the Conference of Presidents shall take a decision within two months.\n4.\nMotions for resolutions submitted to Parliament shall be examined under the short presentation procedure set out in Rule 160. Amendments to such motions for resolutions and requests for split votes or separate votes shall only be admissible for consideration in plenary if they are tabled either by the rapporteur, in order to take account of new information, or by at least one-tenth of the Members. Political groups may table alternative motions for resolutions in accordance with Rule 181(3). Rule 190 shall apply to the committee's motion for a resolution and amendments thereto. Rule 190 shall also apply to the single vote on alternative motions for resolutions.\n5.\nParagraph 4 shall not apply where the subject of the report qualifies for a key debate in plenary, where the report is drawn up pursuant to the right of initiative referred to in Rule 46 or 47, or where the report has been authorised as a strategic report (18).\nRule 55\nDrafting of reports\n1.\nThe rapporteur shall be responsible for preparing the committee's report and for presenting it to Parliament on behalf of that committee.\n2.\nThe explanatory statement shall be the responsibility of the rapporteur and shall not be put to the vote. It must, however, accord with the text of the motion for a resolution as adopted and any amendments proposed by the committee. If it fails to do so, the Chair of the committee may delete the explanatory statement.\n3.\nThe report shall state the result of the vote taken on the report as a whole and shall indicate, in line with Rule 218(3), how each member voted.\n4.\nMinority positions may be expressed when the vote on the text as a whole is taken and may, at the request of their authors, be the subject of a written declaration not exceeding 200 words in length, which shall be annexed to the explanatory statement.\nThe Chair shall settle any disputes which may arise as a result of the application of this paragraph.\n5.\nOn a proposal from its Chair, the committee may set a deadline within which the rapporteur must submit the draft report. This deadline may be extended or a new rapporteur appointed.\n6.\nOnce the deadline has expired, the committee may instruct its Chair to ask for the matter that has been referred to it to be placed on the agenda of one of the next sittings of Parliament. The debates and votes may then be conducted on the basis of an oral report by the committee concerned.\nRule 56\nOpinions of committees\n1.\nIf the committee to which a matter was first referred wishes to hear the views of another committee, or if another committee wishes to make known its views to the committee to which a matter was first referred, such committees may ask the President in accordance with Rule 210(2) for one committee to be named as the committee responsible and the other as the opinion-giving committee.\nThe opinion giving committee may appoint a rapporteur for opinion from among its members or permanent substitutes or send its views in the form of a letter from the Chair.\n2.\nWhere the opinion concerns a proposal for a legally binding act, it shall consist of amendments to the text referred to the committee, accompanied, where appropriate, by short justifications. Such justifications shall be the responsibility of their author and shall not be put to the vote. If necessary, the opinion-giving committee may submit a short written justification for the opinion as a whole. That short written justification shall be the responsibility of the rapporteur for the opinion.\nWhere the opinion does not concern a proposal for a legally binding act, it shall consist of suggestions for parts of the motion for a resolution submitted by the committee responsible.\nThe committee responsible shall put these amendments or suggestions to the vote.\nThe opinions shall deal solely with those matters that fall within the areas of responsibility of the opinion-giving committee.\n3.\nThe committee responsible shall set a deadline within which the opinion-giving committee must deliver its opinion if it is to be taken into account by the committee responsible. Any changes to the announced timetable shall be immediately communicated by the committee responsible to the opinion-giving committee or opinion giving committees. The committee responsible shall not reach its final conclusions before that time-limit has expired.\n4.\nAlternatively, the opinion-giving committee may decide to present its position in the form of amendments to be tabled directly in the committee responsible following their adoption. These amendments shall be tabled by the Chair or the rapporteur on behalf of the opinion-giving committee.\n5.\nThe opinion-giving committee shall table the amendments referred to in paragraph 4 within the deadline for amendments set by the committee responsible.\n6.\nAll opinions and amendments adopted by the opinion-giving committee shall be annexed to the report of the committee responsible.\n7.\nOpinion-giving committees within the meaning of this Rule cannot table amendments for consideration by Parliament.\n8.\nThe Chair and rapporteur of the opinion-giving committee shall be invited to take part in an advisory capacity in meetings of the committee responsible, insofar as these relate to the matter of common concern.\nRule 57\nAssociated committee procedure\n1.\nWhere a question of competence is referred to the Conference of Presidents pursuant to Rule 211, and the Conference of Presidents, on the basis of Annex VI, considers that the matter falls almost equally within the competence of two or more committees, or that different parts of the matter fall within the competence of two or more committees, Rule 56 shall apply with the following additional provisions:\n—\nthe timetable shall be jointly agreed by the committees concerned,\n—\nthe rapporteurs concerned shall keep each other informed and shall endeavour to agree on the texts they propose to their committees and on their position regarding amendments,\n—\nthe Chairs and rapporteurs concerned are bound by the principle of good and sincere cooperation; they shall jointly identify areas of the text falling within their exclusive or shared competence and agree on the precise arrangements for their cooperation; in the event of disagreement about the delimitation of competences the matter shall be submitted, at the request of one of the committees involved, to the Conference of Presidents; the Conference of Presidents may decide on the question of the respective competences or decide that the joint committee procedure under Rule 58 is to apply; it shall take its decision in accordance with the procedure and within the deadline set out in Rule 211,\n—\nthe committee responsible shall accept without a vote amendments from an associated committee where they concern matters which fall within the exclusive competence of that associated committee; if the committee responsible fails to respect the exclusive competence of the associated committee, that associated committee may table amendments directly in plenary; if amendments on matters which fall within the shared competence of the committee responsible and an associated committee are not adopted by the committee responsible, the associated committee may table those amendments directly in plenary,\n—\nin the event of a conciliation procedure in respect of the proposal, Parliament's delegation shall include the rapporteur of any associated committee.\nA decision by the Conference of Presidents to apply the associated committee procedure applies at all stages of the procedure in question.\nThe rights attaching to the status of ‘committee responsible’ are exercised by the lead committee. In exercising those rights, the lead committee must take due account of the prerogatives of the associated committee. In particular, the lead committee must comply with the obligation to observe the principle of sincere cooperation as regards the timetable and respect the right of the associated committee to determine the amendments submitted in plenary which fall within its exclusive competence.\n2.\nThe procedure laid down in this Rule shall not apply to the recommendations to be adopted by the committee responsible under Rule 105.\nRule 58\nJoint committee procedure\n1.\nWhen a question of competence is referred to it pursuant to Rule 211, the Conference of Presidents may decide that the procedure with joint meetings of committees and a joint vote is to be applied, provided that:\n—\nby virtue of Annex VI, the matter falls indissociably within the competences of several committees, and\n—\nit is satisfied that the question is of major importance.\n2.\nIn that event, the respective rapporteurs shall draw up a single draft report, which shall be examined and voted on by the committees involved, under the joint chairmanship of the committee Chairs.\nAt all stages of the procedure, the rights attaching to the status of committee responsible may be exercised by the committees involved only when they are acting jointly. The committees involved may set up working groups to prepare the meetings and votes.\n3.\nAt the second-reading stage of the ordinary legislative procedure, the Council position shall be considered at a joint meeting of the committees involved, which, should no agreement be reached between their Chairs, shall be held on the Wednesday of the first week set aside for meetings of parliamentary bodies following the communication of the Council's position to Parliament. If no agreement is reached on the convening of a further meeting, any such meeting shall be convened by the Chair of the Conference of Committee Chairs. The vote on the recommendation for second reading shall be taken at a joint meeting on the basis of a joint text drafted by the respective rapporteurs of the committees involved or, in the absence of a joint text, on the basis of the amendments tabled in the committees involved.\nAt the third-reading stage of the ordinary legislative procedure, the Chairs and rapporteurs of the committees involved shall be members ex officio of the delegation to the Conciliation Committee.\nCHAPTER 3\nOrdinary legislative procedure\nSECTION 1 — \nFIRST READING\nRule 59\nVote in Parliament — first reading\n1.\nParliament may approve, amend or reject the draft legislative act.\n2.\nParliament shall first vote on any proposal for the immediate rejection of the draft legislative act that has been tabled in writing by the committee responsible, a political group or Members reaching at least the low threshold.\nIf that proposal for rejection is adopted, the President shall ask the originating institution to withdraw the draft legislative act.\nIf the originating institution does so, the President shall declare the procedure closed.\nIf the originating institution does not withdraw the draft legislative act, the President shall announce that the first reading of Parliament is concluded, unless, on a proposal of the Chair or rapporteur of the committee responsible or of a political group or Members reaching at least the low threshold, Parliament decides to refer the matter back to the committee responsible for reconsideration.\nIf that proposal for rejection is not adopted, Parliament shall then proceed in accordance with paragraphs 3, 4 and 5.\n3.\nAny provisional agreement tabled by the committee responsible under Rule 74(4) shall be given priority in voting and shall be put to a single vote, unless, at the request of a political group or Members reaching at least the low threshold, Parliament decides instead to proceed with the vote on amendments in accordance with paragraph 4. In that case, Parliament shall also decide whether to hold the vote on the amendments immediately. If not, Parliament shall set a new deadline for amendments and the vote shall take place at a subsequent sitting.\nIf, in that single vote, the provisional agreement is adopted, the President shall announce that the first reading of Parliament has been concluded.\nIf, in that single vote, the provisional agreement fails to secure the majority of the votes cast, the President shall set a new deadline for amendments to the draft legislative act.

The President's announcement shall be made during the part-session following the receipt of those documents.\nBefore making the announcement, the President establishes, after consulting the Chair of the committee responsible, or the rapporteur, or both of them, that the text received is indeed Council's first reading position and that the circumstances described in Rule 61 do not apply. Failing this, the President, together with the committee responsible and, where possible, in agreement with the Council, seeks an appropriate solution.\n2.\nOn the day of its announcement in Parliament, the Council's position shall be deemed to have been referred automatically to the committee responsible at first reading.\n3.\nA list of such communications shall be published in the minutes of the sitting together with the names of the committees responsible.\nRule 64\nExtension of time limits\n1.\nThe President shall, at the request of the Chair of the committee responsible, extend the time-limits for second reading in accordance with Article 294(14) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.\n2.\nThe President shall notify Parliament of any extension of time limits under Article 294(14) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, whether such extensions occur at the initiative of Parliament or of the Council.\nRule 65\nProcedure in the committee responsible\n1.\nThe Council's position shall be entered as a priority item on the agenda of the first meeting of the committee responsible to take place after its communication.

Any amendment to the Council's position shall be adopted only if it secures the votes of a majority of the component Members of Parliament.\nBefore voting on the amendments, the President may ask the Commission to state its position and the Council to comment.\n4.\nNotwithstanding a vote by Parliament against the initial proposal to reject the Council's position under paragraph 1, Parliament may, on the proposal of the Chair or the rapporteur of the committee responsible or of a political group or Members reaching at least the low threshold, consider a further proposal for rejection after voting on the amendments under paragraphs 2 or 3.

Such reasons must be stated in a written justification to the amendments.\n4.\nIf the committee responsible for legal affairs considers that the proposal entails substantive changes other than those which have been identified as such in the proposal, it shall propose that Parliament reject the proposal and shall inform the committee responsible for the subject-matter that it has done so.\nIn such a case the President shall ask the Commission to withdraw it. If the Commission does so, the President shall declare that the procedure in Parliament is superfluous and shall inform the Council accordingly.

In such cases, the procedures provided for in paragraphs 3 or 4 shall, as applicable, be implemented at the earliest opportunity.\n6.\nThe committee responsible for legal affairs shall lay down the principles that it will use in its application of this Rule.\nTITLE VI\nRELATIONS WITH NATIONAL PARLIAMENTS\nRule 150\nExchange of information, contacts and reciprocal facilities\n1.\nParliament shall keep the national parliaments of the Member States regularly informed of its activities.\n2.\nThe organisation and promotion of effective and regular interparliamentary cooperation within the Union, pursuant to Article 9 of the Protocol No 1 on the role of national parliaments in the European Union, shall be negotiated on the basis of a mandate given by the Conference of Presidents, after consulting the Conference of Committee Chairs.\nParliament shall approve any agreements on such matters in accordance with the procedure set out in Rule 148.\n3.\nA committee may directly engage in dialogue with national parliaments at committee level within the limits of the budgetary appropriations set aside for that purpose.

The vote on the request shall be taken at the beginning of the sitting following that during which the announcement was made, provided that the proposal to which the request relates has been distributed to Members in the official languages. Where there are several requests for urgent debate on the same subject, the approval or rejection of the request for urgent debate shall apply to all such requests that are on the same subject.\n3.\nBefore the vote, only the mover, and one speaker against may be heard, along with the Chair or rapporteur of the committee responsible, or both.

These arrangements may exceptionally be made more flexible. The Bureau shall adopt the necessary provisions.\n5.\nAfter the result of a vote has been announced, the President shall rule on any requests concerning alleged discrepancies between the different language versions.\nRule 168\nTransitional arrangement\n1.\nDuring a transitional period expiring at the end of the ninth parliamentary term (30), derogations from Rule 167 shall be permissible if and to the extent that, despite adequate precautions having been taken, interpreters or translators for an official language are not available in sufficient numbers.\n2.\nThe Bureau, on a proposal from the Secretary-General and having due regard to the arrangements referred to in paragraph 3, shall ascertain with respect to each of the official languages concerned whether the conditions set out in paragraph 1 are fulfilled. The Bureau shall, on the basis of a progress report from the Secretary-General, review its decision to permit a derogation at six-monthly intervals. The Bureau shall adopt the necessary implementing rules.\n3.\nThe temporary special arrangements adopted by the Council on the basis of the Treaties concerning the drafting of legal acts shall apply.\n4.\nParliament may, on the basis of a reasoned recommendation from the Bureau, decide at any time to repeal this Rule early or, at the end of the period indicated in paragraph 1, to extend it.\nRule 169\nDistribution of documents\nThe documents that form the basis for Parliament's debates and decisions shall be made available to Members.\nWithout prejudice to the first paragraph, Members and political groups shall have direct access to the European Parliament's internal computer system for the purpose of consulting any non-confidential preparatory document (draft report, draft recommendation, draft opinion, working document, amendments tabled in committee).\nRule 170\nElectronic handling of documents\nParliament documents may be prepared, signed and distributed in electronic form. The Bureau shall decide on the technical specifications, and on the presentation, of the electronic form.\nRule 171\nAllocation of speaking time and list of speakers (31)\n1.\nThe Conference of Presidents may propose to Parliament that speaking time be allocated for a particular debate.

The President shall ensure that these speaking times are respected.\n6.\nThe remaining part of the time for a debate shall not be specifically allocated in advance. Instead, the President may call on Members to speak, as a general rule for no more than one minute. The President shall, as far as possible, ensure that speakers who hold different political views and who come from different Member States are heard in turn.\n7.\nOn request, the President may give priority to the Chair and to the rapporteur of the committee responsible, as well as to those Chairs of political groups who wish to speak on their groups' behalf, or to speakers who are deputising for them.\n8.\nThe President may give the floor to Members who indicate, by raising a blue card, their wish to put to another Member, during that Member's speech, a question of no longer than half a minute's duration related to what that Member has said. The President shall only do so if the speaker agrees to the question and if the President is satisfied that this will lead neither to disruption of the debate nor, through the putting of successive questions by raising a blue card, to a gross imbalance in the political group affinities of Members speaking in that debate.\n9.\nNo Member may speak for more than one minute on any of the following subject matters: the minutes of the sitting, procedural motions, or amendments to the final draft agenda or the agenda.\n10.\nIn the debate on a report, the Commission and the Council shall, as a rule, be heard immediately after the presentation, by the rapporteur, of his or her report.

Speaking time for each Member shall not exceed one minute. The President may allow a further such period later during the same part-session.\nRule 173\nPersonal statements\n1.\nMembers who ask to make a personal statement shall be heard at the end of the discussion of the agenda item which is being dealt with, or when the minutes of the sitting to which the request for leave to speak refers are considered for approval.\nThe Members concerned may not speak on substantive matters but shall confine their observations to rebutting any remarks that have been made concerning their person in the course of the debate or opinions that have been attributed to them, or correcting observations that they themselves have made.\n2.\nUnless Parliament decides otherwise, no personal statement shall last for more than three minutes.\nRule 174\nPrevention of obstruction (32)\nThe President shall have the power to put an end to the excessive use of motions such as points of order, procedural motions or explanations of vote, or of requests for separate, split or roll-call votes, where he or she is convinced that those motions or requests are manifestly intended to cause, and would result in, a prolonged and serious obstruction of the procedures of Parliament or the rights of the Members.\nCHAPTER 4\nMeasures to be taken in the event of non-compliance with the standards of conduct of members\nRule 175\nImmediate measures\n1.\nThe President shall call to order any Member who breaches the standards of conduct defined in Rule 10 (3) or (4).\n2.\nIf the breach is repeated, the President shall call the Member to order a second time, and the fact shall be recorded in the minutes.\n3.\nIf the breach continues, or if a further breach is committed, the Member may be denied the right to speak and may be excluded from the Chamber by the President for the remainder of the sitting. In cases of exceptional seriousness, the President may also resort to exclusion of the Member concerned from the Chamber for the remainder of the sitting immediately and without a second call to order. The Secretary-General shall, without delay, see to it that such disciplinary measures are carried out, with the assistance of the ushers and, if necessary, of Parliament's Security Service.\n4.\nShould disturbances threaten to obstruct the business of the House, the President shall close or suspend the sitting for a specific period in order to restore order. If the President cannot make himself or herself heard, he or she shall leave the chair; this shall have the effect of suspending the sitting. The President shall reconvene the sitting.\n5.\nThe President may decide to interrupt the live broadcasting of the sitting in the case of a breach of Rule 10 (3) or (4) by a Member.\n6.\nThe President may order the deletion from the audiovisual record of the proceedings of those parts of a speech by a Member that breach Rule 10 (3) or (4).\nThat order shall take immediate effect. It shall, however, be subject to confirmation by the Bureau not later than four weeks thereafter, or, if the Bureau does not meet during that period, at its next meeting.\n7.\nThe powers provided for in paragraphs 1 to 6 shall be vested, mutatis mutandis, in the presiding officers of bodies, committees and delegations as provided for in the Rules of Procedure.\n8.\nWhere appropriate, and bearing in mind the seriousness of the breach of the standards of conduct of Members, the Member in the chair of a part-session, body, committee or delegation may, no later than the following part-session or the following meeting of the body, committee or delegation concerned, ask the President to apply Rule 176.\nRule 176\nPenalties\n1.\nIn serious cases of breach of Rule 10 (2) to (9), the President shall adopt a reasoned decision imposing upon the Member concerned the appropriate penalty in accordance with this Rule.\nIn relation to Rule 10 (3) or (4), the President may adopt a reasoned decision under this Rule regardless of whether or not an immediate measure within the meaning of Rule 175 had previously been imposed upon the Member concerned.\nIn relation to Rule 10 (6), the President may only adopt a reasoned decision under this Rule following the establishment of the occurrence of a harassment in accordance with the applicable internal administrative procedure on harassment and its prevention.\nThe President may impose a penalty upon a Member in cases in which provision is made, by these Rules of Procedure or by a decision adopted by the Bureau under Rule 25, for the application of this Rule.\n2.\nThe Member concerned shall be invited by the President to submit written observations before the decision is adopted. The President may decide to convene an oral hearing instead whenever it is more appropriate.\nThe decision imposing the penalty shall be notified to the Member concerned by registered letter or, in urgent cases, via the ushers.\nAfter that decision has been notified to the Member concerned, any penalty imposed on a Member shall be announced by the President in Parliament. The presiding officers of the bodies, committees and delegations on which the Member serves shall be informed.\nOnce the penalty becomes final, it shall be published prominently on Parliament's website, and shall remain there for the rest of the parliamentary term.\n3.\nWhen assessing the conduct observed, account shall be taken of its exceptional, recurrent or permanent nature and of its seriousness. Account shall also be taken, if applicable, of possible damage inflicted on the dignity and reputation of Parliament.\n4.\nThe penalty may consist of one or more of the following measures:\n(a)\na reprimand;\n(b)\nforfeiture of entitlement to the daily subsistence allowance for a period of between two and thirty days;\n(c)\nwithout prejudice to the right to vote in plenary, and subject, in this instance, to strict compliance with the Members' standards of conduct, temporary suspension from participation in all or some of the activities of Parliament for a period of between two and thirty days on which Parliament or any of its bodies, committees or delegations meet;\n(d)\nprohibition of the Member from representing the Parliament on an inter-parliamentary delegation, inter-parliamentary conference or any interinstitutional forum, for up to one year;\n(e)\nin the case of a breach of confidentiality, a limitation in the rights to access confidential or classified information for up to one year.\n5.\nThe measures laid down in points (b) to (e) of paragraph 4 may be doubled in the case of repeated breaches, or if the Member refuses to comply with a measure taken under Rule 175(3).\n6.\nIn addition, the President may submit a proposal to the Conference of Presidents for the suspension or removal of the Member from one or more of the offices held by that Member in Parliament, in accordance with the procedure laid down in Rule 21.\nRule 177\nInternal appeal procedures\nThe Member concerned may lodge an internal appeal with the Bureau within two weeks of notification of the penalty imposed by the President by virtue of Rule 176(1) to (5). Such an appeal shall have the effect of suspending the application of that penalty. The Bureau may, not later than four weeks after the lodging of the appeal or, if it does not meet in that period, at its next meeting, annul, confirm or modify the penalty imposed, without prejudice to the external rights of appeal open to the Member concerned. If the Bureau fails to take a decision within the time limit laid down, the penalty shall be deemed to be null and void.\nCHAPTER 5\nQuorum, amendments and voting\nRule 178\nQuorum\n1.\nParliament may deliberate, settle its agenda and approve its minutes, irrespective of the number of Members present.\n2.\nA quorum shall exist when one third of the component Members of Parliament are present in the Chamber.\n3.\nAll votes shall be valid whatever the number of Members voting unless the President, on a request made by at least 40 Members before voting began, establishes that a quorum is not present. If the number of Members required to make up a quorum is not present, the President shall declare that a quorum is not present, and the vote shall be placed on the agenda for the next sitting.\nThe electronic voting system may be used in order to check the threshold of 40 Members, but it may not be used for checking the quorum. The doors of the Chamber may not be closed.\n4.\nMembers who ask for the quorum to be established must be present in the Chamber when the request is made, and shall be counted as being present within the meaning of paragraphs 2 and 3, even if they then leave the Chamber.\n5.\nIf fewer than 40 Members are present, the President may rule that there is no quorum.\nRule 179\nThresholds (33)\n1.\nFor the purposes of these Rules, and unless specified otherwise, the following definitions shall apply:\n(a)\n‘low threshold’ means one-twentieth of Parliament's component Members or a political group;\n(b)\n‘medium threshold’ means one-tenth of Parliament's component Members, made up of one or more political groups or individual Members, or a combination of the two;\n(c)\n‘high threshold’ means one-fifth of Parliament's component Members made up of one or more political groups or individual Members, or a combination of the two.\n2.\nWhere, for the purpose of determining whether an applicable threshold has been reached, a Member's signature is required, that signature may be either handwritten or in electronic form, in which case it shall be produced by the electronic signature system of Parliament. Within the relevant time-limits, a Member may withdraw, but may not subsequently renew, his or her signature.\n3.\nWhere the support of a political group is necessary in order for a threshold to be reached, the group shall act through its Chair or through a person duly designated by him or her for that purpose.\n4.\nFor the application of the medium and high thresholds, the support of a political group shall be counted as follows:\n—\nwhere a Rule laying down such a threshold is invoked in the course of a sitting or meeting: all Members who belong to the supporting group and are physically present,\n—\nin all other cases: all Members who belong to the supporting group.\nRule 180\nTabling and presenting amendments (34)\n1.\nAmendments for consideration in Parliament may be tabled by the committee responsible, a political group or Members reaching at least the low threshold. The names of all co-signatories shall be published.\nAmendments shall be tabled in writing and signed by their authors.\nAmendments to proposals for legally binding acts may be accompanied by a short justification. Such justifications shall be the responsibility of the author and shall not be put to the vote.\n2.\nSubject to the limitations laid down in Rule 181, an amendment may seek to change any part of a text. It may be directed to deleting, adding or replacing words or figures.\nIn this Rule and Rule 181, the term ‘text’ means the whole of a motion for a resolution/draft legislative resolution, of a proposal for a decision or of a proposal for a legally binding act.\n3.\nThe President shall set a deadline for the tabling of amendments.\n4.\nAn amendment may be presented during the debate by its author or by any other Member appointed by the author to replace him or her.\n5.\nWhere an amendment is withdrawn by its author, it shall fall unless it is immediately taken over by another Member.\n6.\nAmendments shall be put to the vote only after they have been made available in all the official languages, unless Parliament decides otherwise. Parliament may not decide otherwise if at least 40 Members object. Parliament shall avoid taking decisions which would place Members who use a particular language at an unacceptable disadvantage.\nWhere fewer than 100 Members are present, Parliament may not decide otherwise if at least one tenth of the Members present object.\nOn a proposal from the President, an oral amendment, or any other oral modification, shall be treated in the same way as an amendment not made available in all the official languages. If the President considers that it is admissible under Rule 181(2), and save in the case of objection under Rule 180(6), it shall be put to the vote in accordance with the order of voting established.\nIn committee, the number of votes needed to object to such an amendment or such a modification is established on the basis of Rule 219 proportionally to that applicable in plenary, rounded up, where necessary, to the nearest complete number.\nRule 181\nAdmissibility of amendments (35)\n1.\nWithout prejudice to the additional conditions laid down in Rule 54(4) concerning own initiative reports and Rule 68(2) concerning amendments to the Council's position, no amendment shall be admissible if:\n(a)\nit does not directly relate to the text which it seeks to amend;\n(b)\nit seeks to delete or replace the whole of a text;\n(c)\nit seeks to amend more than one of the individual articles or paragraphs of the text to which it relates with the exception of compromise amendments and amendments which seek to make identical changes to a particular form of words throughout the text;\n(d)\nit seeks to amend a proposal for codification of Union legislation; however, the second subparagraph of Rule 109(3) shall apply mutatis mutandis;\n(e)\nit seeks to amend those parts of a proposal recasting Union legislation which remain unchanged in such proposal; however, the second subparagraph of Rule 110(2) and the third subparagraph of Rule 110(3) shall apply mutatis mutandis;\n(f)\nit only seeks to ensure the linguistic correctness, or address the terminological consistency, of the text in the language in which the amendment is tabled; in this case, the President shall seek a suitable linguistic remedy together with those concerned.\n2.\nThe President shall decide whether amendments are admissible.\nThe President's decision under paragraph 2 concerning the admissibility of amendments is not based exclusively on the provisions of paragraph 1 of this Rule but on the provisions of the Rules in general.\n3.\nA political group or Members reaching at least the low threshold may table an alternative motion for a resolution seeking to replace a motion for a non-legislative resolution contained in a committee report.\nIn such a case, the group or the Members concerned may not table amendments to the motion for a resolution by the committee responsible. The alternative motion for a resolution may not be longer than the committee's motion for a resolution. It shall be put to a single vote in Parliament without amendment.\nRule 132(4) and (5) concerning joint motions for resolutions shall apply mutatis mutandis.\n4.\nWith the agreement of the President, amendments may, exceptionally, be tabled after the close of the deadline for amendments if they are compromise amendments, or if there are technical problems. The President shall decide on the admissibility of such amendments. The President shall obtain the agreement of Parliament to do so before putting such amendments to the vote.\nThe following general criteria for admissibility of compromise amendments may be applied:\n—\nas a general rule, the compromise amendments relate to parts of the text which have been the subject of amendments prior to the deadline for tabling amendments,\n—\nas a general rule, the compromise amendments are tabled by political groups representing a majority in Parliament, the Chairs or rapporteurs of the committees concerned or the authors of other amendments,\n—\nas a general rule, the compromise amendments entail the withdrawal of other amendments to the same passage.\nOnly the President may propose that a compromise amendment be considered. In order for a compromise amendment to be put to the vote, the President must obtain the agreement of Parliament by asking whether there are any objections to such a vote being held. If an objection is raised, Parliament shall decide on the matter by a majority of the votes cast.\nRule 182\nVoting procedure (36)\n1.\nSave where these Rules specifically provide otherwise, the following voting procedure shall apply to texts submitted to Parliament:\n(a)\nfirst, where applicable, voting any amendment to the proposal for a legally binding act;\n(b)\nsecond, where applicable, voting on that proposal as a whole, amended or otherwise;\nIf the proposal for a legally binding act, as amended or otherwise, does not secure a majority of the votes cast in committee, then the committee shall propose to Parliament that the proposal be rejected.\n(c)\nthird, voting on any amendment to the motion for a resolution/draft legislative resolution;\n(d)\nfinally, voting on the motion for a resolution as a whole (final vote).\nParliament shall not vote on any explanatory statement contained in a report.\n2.\nIn voting on proposals for legally binding acts and on motions for non-legislative resolutions, votes relating to substantive parts shall be taken first, followed by votes relating to citations and recitals.\n3.\nAn amendment shall fall if it is inconsistent with decisions previously taken on the text during the same vote.\n4.\nThe only Member permitted to speak during the vote shall be the rapporteur, or, in his or her place, the Chair of the committee. He or she shall have the opportunity of expressing briefly the views of the committee responsible on the amendments put to the vote.\nRule 183\nOrder of voting on amendments (37)\n1.\nAmendments shall have priority over the text to which they relate and shall be put to the vote before that text.\n2.\nIf two or more mutually exclusive amendments have been tabled to the same part of a text, the amendment that departs furthest from the original text shall have priority and shall be put to the vote first. If it is adopted, the other amendments shall be deemed to have been rejected; if it is rejected, the amendment next in priority shall be put to the vote, and this procedure shall be repeated for each of the remaining amendments. Where there is a doubt as to priority, the President shall decide. If all amendments are rejected, the original text shall be deemed to have been adopted unless a separate vote has been requested within the deadline specified.\n3.\nHowever, where the President considers that this will facilitate the vote, he or she may put the original text to the vote first, or put an amendment that is closer to the original text to the vote before the amendment that departs furthest from the original text.\nIf either of these secures a majority, all other amendments tabled to the same part of the text shall fall.\n4.\nWhere compromise amendments are put to the vote, they shall be given priority in voting.\n5.\nA split vote shall not be admissible in the case of a vote on a compromise amendment.\n6.\nWhere the committee responsible has tabled a set of amendments to the text with which the report is concerned, the President shall put them to the vote collectively, unless on particular points a political group or Members reaching at least the low threshold have requested separate or split votes or unless other competing amendments have been tabled.\n7.\nThe President may put other amendments to the vote collectively where they are complementary, unless a political group or Members reaching at least the low threshold have requested separate or split votes. Authors of amendments may also propose collective votes on their amendments.\n8.\nThe President may decide, following the adoption or rejection of a particular amendment, that several other amendments of similar content or with similar objectives shall be put to the vote collectively. The President may seek the agreement of Parliament before doing so.\nSuch a set of amendments may relate to different parts of the original text.\n9.\nWhere two or more identical amendments are tabled by different authors, they shall be put to the vote as one.\n10.\nAmendments in respect of which a roll-call vote has been requested shall be put to the vote separately from other amendments.\nRule 184\nCommittee filter of plenary amendments\nWhen more than 50 amendments or requests for a split or separate vote have been tabled concerning a text tabled by a committee for consideration in Parliament, the President may, after consulting its Chair, ask that committee to meet to vote on each of those amendments or requests. Any amendment or request for a split or separate vote that does not receive votes in favour at this stage from at least one-third of the members of the committee shall not be put to the vote in Parliament.\nRule 185\nSplit voting (38)\n1.\nWhere the text to be put to the vote contains two or more provisions or references to two or more points, or lends itself to division into two or more parts that have a distinct meaning and/or normative value, a split vote may be requested by a political group or Members reaching at least the low threshold.\n2.\nThe request shall be made at the latest on the evening before the vote, unless the President sets a different deadline. The President shall decide on the request.\nRule 186\nRight to vote (39)\nThe right to vote is a personal right.\nMembers shall cast their votes individually and in person.\nAny infringement of this Rule is considered a serious breach of Rule 10(3).\nRule 187\nVoting (40)\n1.\nAs a general rule, Parliament shall vote by show of hands.\nHowever, the President may, at any time, decide that the voting operations will be carried out by means of the electronic voting system.\n2.\nThe President shall declare votes open and closed.\nOnce the President has declared a vote open, no-one except the President shall be allowed to speak until the vote is declared to be closed.\n3.\nIn calculating whether a text has been adopted or rejected, account shall be taken only of votes cast for and against, except in those cases for which the Treaties lay down a specific majority.\n4.\nIf the President decides that the result of a vote by show of hands is doubtful, a fresh vote shall be taken using the electronic voting system and, if the latter is not working, by sitting and standing.\n5.\nThe President shall establish the result of the vote and announce it.\n6.\nThe result of the vote shall be recorded.\nRule 188\nFinal vote\nWhen deciding on the basis of a report, Parliament shall take any single and/or final vote by roll call in accordance with Rule 190(3).\nThe provisions of Rule 188 on voting by roll call do not apply to the reports provided for in Rule 8(2) and Rule 9(4), (7) and (9) in the context of procedures relating to the immunity of a Member.\nRule 189\nTied votes (41)\n1.\nIn the event of a tied vote under Rule 182(1)(b) or (d), the text as a whole shall be referred back to committee. This shall also apply to votes under Rules 3 and 9.\n2.\nIn the event of a tied vote on a text put to a split vote under Rule 185, the text shall be deemed to have been adopted.\n3.\nIn all other cases where there is a tied vote, without prejudice to those Rules which require qualified majorities, the text or proposal shall be deemed to have been rejected.\nRule 189(3) is to be interpreted as meaning that, where there is a tied vote on a draft recommendation under Rule 149(4) not to intervene in proceedings before the Court of Justice of the European Union, such a tie does not signify the adoption of a recommendation according to which Parliament should intervene in those proceedings. In such a case, the committee responsible is to be deemed not to have expressed any recommendation.\nThe President may vote, but shall not have a casting vote.\nRule 190\nVoting by roll call (42)\n1.\nIn addition to the cases provided for in these Rules, the vote shall be taken by roll call if this is requested in writing by a political group or Members reaching at least the low threshold at the latest the evening before the vote unless the President sets a different deadline.\nThe provisions of Rule 190 on voting by roll call do not apply to the reports provided for in Rule 8(2) and Rule 9(4), (7) and (9) in the context of procedures relating to the immunity of a Member.\n2.\nEach political group may table no more than one hundred requests for roll call votes per part-session.\n3.\nThe roll call vote shall be taken using the electronic voting system.\nWhere the latter cannot be used for technical reasons, the roll may be called in alphabetical order, beginning with the name of a Member drawn by lot. The President shall be the last to be called to vote. Voting shall be oral and shall be expressed by saying the words ‘Yes’, ‘No’, or ‘I abstain’.\n4.\nVotes shall be recorded in the minutes of the sitting by political group in the alphabetical order of Members' names, with an indication of how they voted.\nRule 191\nVoting by secret ballot (43)\n1.\nIn the case of appointments, voting shall be by secret ballot without prejudice to Rules 15(1) and 213(2), first subparagraph.\nOnly ballot papers bearing the names of candidates who have been nominated shall be taken into account in calculating the number of votes cast.\n2.\nVoting shall also be by secret ballot if this is requested by Members or a political group or groups reaching at least the high threshold. Such requests must be made before voting begins.\n3.\nA request for a secret ballot shall take priority over a request for a vote by roll call.\n4.\nBetween two and eight Members chosen by lot shall count the votes cast in a secret ballot, unless an electronic vote is taken.\nIn the case of votes under paragraph 1, candidates shall not act as tellers.\nThe names of Members who have taken part in a secret ballot shall be recorded in the minutes of the sitting at which the ballot was held.\nRule 192\nUse of electronic voting system (44)\n1.\nThe technical arrangements for using the electronic voting system shall be governed by instructions from the Bureau.\n2.\nWhere an electronic vote is taken, unless it concerns a roll call vote, only the numerical result of the vote shall be recorded.\n3.\nThe President may at any time decide to use the electronic voting system in order to check a threshold.\nRule 193\nDisputes on voting (45)\n1.\nPoints of order concerning the validity of a vote may be raised after the President has declared that vote to be closed.\n2.\nAfter the result of a vote by show of hands has been announced, a Member may request that that result be checked using the electronic voting system.\n3.\nThe President shall decide whether the result announced is valid. His or her decision shall be final.\nRule 194\nExplanations of votes\n1.\nOnce the voting session has been concluded, any Member may give an oral explanation on the single and/or final vote on an item submitted to Parliament for not longer than one minute. Each Member may give a maximum of three oral explanations of vote per part-session.\nAny Member may, on such vote, hand in a written explanation of vote of no more than 200 words which shall be included on the Member's page on Parliament's website.\nAny political group may give an explanation of vote lasting not more than two minutes.\nNo further requests to give explanations of votes shall be accepted once the first explanation of vote on the first item has begun.\nExplanations of votes are admissible on the single and/or final vote on any item submitted to Parliament. For the purposes of this Rule, the term ‘final vote’ does not refer to the type of vote, but means the last vote on any item.\n2.\nExplanations of votes shall not be admissible in the case of secret ballot or votes on procedural matters.\n3.\nWhere an item has been included on the agenda of Parliament without amendments or without debate, Members may only submit written explanations of votes in accordance with paragraph 1.\nExplanations of votes given either orally or in writing must have a direct bearing on the item submitted to Parliament.\nCHAPTER 6\nPoints of order and procedural motions\nRule 195\nPoints of order (46)\n1.\nMembers may be allowed to speak in order to draw the attention of the President to any failure to comply with Parliament's Rules of Procedure. They shall first specify to which Rule they are referring.\n2.\nA request to raise a point of order shall take precedence over all other requests to speak or procedural motions.\n3.\nSpeaking time shall not exceed one minute.\n4.\nThe President shall take an immediate decision on points of order in accordance with the Rules of Procedure and shall announce it immediately after the point of order has been raised. No vote shall be taken concerning the President's decision.\n5.\nExceptionally, the President may state that he or she will announce the decision later, but the President shall not do so more than 24 hours after the point of order was raised. Postponement of the ruling shall not entail the adjournment of the debate. The President may refer the matter to the committee responsible.\nA request to raise a point of order must relate to the agenda item under discussion. The President may take a point of order concerning a different matter at an appropriate time, e.g. after the discussion of the agenda item in question is closed or before the sitting is suspended.\nRule 196\nProcedural motions\n1.\nRequests to move a procedural motion, namely:\n(a)\nthe inadmissibility of a matter (Rule 197);\n(b)\nreferral back to committee (Rule 198);\n(c)\nthe closure of a debate (Rule 199);\n(d)\nthe adjournment of a debate or vote (Rule 200); or\n(e)\nthe suspension or closure of the sitting (Rule 201);\nshall take precedence over other requests to speak.\nIn addition to the mover, only the following Members shall be heard on these motions: one speaker against and the Chair or rapporteur of the committee responsible.\n2.\nThe speaking time shall not exceed one minute.\nRule 197\nMotions calling for a matter to be declared inadmissible\n1.\nAt the beginning of the debate on a specific item on the agenda, a political group or Members reaching at least the low threshold may present a motion calling for it to be declared inadmissible.

Such a proposal or request shall be put to the vote immediately.\n2.\nIf the proposal or request is carried, one Member only may speak from each political group which has not yet provided a speaker in that debate.\n3.\nAfter the speeches referred to in paragraph 2, the debate shall be closed and Parliament shall vote on the matter under debate, except where the time for the vote has been set in advance.\n4.\nIf the proposal or request is rejected, it may not be tabled again during the same debate, except by the President.\nRule 200\nAdjournment of a debate or vote (47)\n1.\nAt the start of a debate on an item on the agenda, a political group or Members reaching at least the low threshold may move that the debate be adjourned to a specific date and time. Such a motion shall be put to the vote immediately.\nThe intention to move adjournment shall be notified to the President at least 24 hours in advance.

The usual means of announcing plenary votes should be used and, in accordance with existing practice, sufficient time should be given for Members to reach the Chamber.\nBy analogy with the second subparagraph of Rule 158(2), if such a request has been rejected, a similar request cannot be tabled again during the same day. In accordance with Rule 174, the President has the right to put an end to excessive use of requests presented under this Rule.\nCHAPTER 7\nPublic record of proceedings\nRule 202\nMinutes\n1.\nThe minutes of each sitting, detailing the proceedings, the names of speakers and the decisions of Parliament, including the result of any vote on any amendment, shall be made available at least half an hour before the beginning of the afternoon period of the next sitting.\n2.\nA list of documents forming the basis for Parliament's debates and decisions shall be published in the minutes.\n3.\nAt the beginning of the afternoon period of each sitting, the President shall place before Parliament, for its approval, the minutes of the previous sitting.\n4.\nIf any objections to the minutes are raised, Parliament shall, if necessary, decide whether the changes requested should be taken into account.

Where the vote in Parliament is not based on an agreement with the Council, the consolidated text shall identify any amendments that were adopted.\n5.\nAfter finalisation, the texts adopted shall be signed by the President and the Secretary-General and published in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nRule 204\nVerbatim reports (49)\n1.\nA verbatim report of the proceedings of each sitting shall be drawn up as a multilingual document in which all oral contributions appear in the original official language.\n2.\nWithout prejudice to his or her other disciplinary powers, the President may cause to be deleted from the verbatim reports the speeches of Members who have not been called upon to speak or who continue to speak beyond the time allotted to them.\n3.\nSpeakers may make corrections to typescripts of their oral contributions within five working days.

Their responsibilities shall be defined in an annex to these Rules of Procedure (50). That annex shall be adopted by a majority of the votes cast. Their members shall be appointed during the first part-session following the re-election of Parliament.\nThe responsibilities of standing committees can also be redefined at a time other than that at which the committee is set up.\nRule 207\nSpecial committees\n1.\nOn a proposal from the Conference of Presidents, Parliament may, at any time, set up special committees, the responsibilities, numerical strength and term of office of which shall be defined at the same time as the decision to set them up is taken.\n2.\nThe term of office of special committees may not exceed 12 months except where Parliament extends that period before its expiry. Unless otherwise decided in Parliament's decision setting up the special committee, its term of office shall start running from the date of its constitutive meeting.\n3.\nSpecial committees shall not have the right to deliver opinions to other committees.\nRule 208\nCommittees of inquiry\n1.\nIn accordance with Article 226 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union and Article 2 of Decision 95/167/EC, Euratom, ECSC of the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission (51), Parliament may, at the request of one quarter of its component Members, set up a committee of inquiry to investigate alleged contraventions or maladministration in implementation of Union law which would appear to be the act of an institution or body of the European Union, of a public administrative body of a Member State, or of persons empowered by Union law to implement that law.\nThe subject of the inquiry, as defined by one quarter of Parliament's component Members, and the period laid down in paragraph 11 shall not be open to amendments.\n2.\nThe decision to set up a committee of inquiry shall be published in the Official Journal of the European Union within one month of being taken.\n3.\nThe modus operandi of a committee of inquiry shall be governed by the provisions of the Rules relating to committees, save as otherwise specifically provided for in this Rule and in Decision 95/167/EC, Euratom, ECSC.\n4.\nThe request to set up a committee of inquiry must precisely specify the subject of the inquiry and include a detailed statement of the grounds for it. Parliament, on a proposal from the Conference of Presidents, shall decide whether to set up a committee and, if so, its numerical strength.\n5.\nCommittees of inquiry shall not have the right to deliver opinions to other committees.\n6.\nAt any stage of its proceedings, only full members or, in their absence, substitutes may vote in a committee of inquiry.\n7.\nA committee of inquiry shall elect its Chair and Vice-Chairs and appoint one or more rapporteurs. The committee may also assign responsibilities, duties or specific tasks to its members who must subsequently report to the committee in detail thereon.\n8.\nIn the interval between one meeting and another, the coordinators of the committee shall, in cases of urgency or need, exercise the committee's powers, subject to ratification by that committee at its next meeting.\n9.\nWith regard to the languages used, a committee of inquiry shall apply the provisions of Rule 167. However, the bureau of the committee:\n—\nmay restrict interpretation to the official languages of those members of the committee taking part in the deliberations, if it deems this to be necessary for reasons of confidentiality,\n—\nshall decide about the translation of the documents received in such a way as to ensure that the committee can carry out its deliberations efficiently and rapidly, as well as to ensure that the necessary secrecy and confidentiality are respected.\n10.\nWhere alleged contraventions or maladministration in the implementation of Union law suggest that a body or authority of a Member State could be responsible, the committee of inquiry may ask the parliament of the Member State concerned to cooperate in the investigation.\n11.\nA committee of inquiry shall conclude its work by presenting to Parliament a report on the results of its work within no more than 12 months from its constitutive meeting. Parliament may twice decide to extend this period by three months. The report may, if appropriate, contain minority positions in accordance with the conditions laid down in Rule 55. The report shall be published.\nAt the request of the committee of inquiry, Parliament shall hold a debate on the report at the part- session following its submission.\n12.\nThe committee may also submit to Parliament a draft recommendation addressed to institutions or bodies of the European Union or to the Member States.\n13.\nThe President shall instruct the committee responsible under Annex VI to monitor the action taken on the results of the work of the committee of inquiry and, if appropriate, to report thereon. The President shall take any further steps which are deemed to be appropriate in order to ensure that the conclusions of the inquiry are acted upon in practice.\nRule 209\nComposition of committees\n1.\nMembers of committees, special committees and committees of inquiry shall be appointed by the political groups and the non-attached Members.\nThe Conference of Presidents shall set a deadline by which political groups and the non-attached Members are to communicate their appointments to the President, who shall then announce them to Parliament.\n2.\nThe composition of the committees shall, as far as possible, reflect the composition of Parliament. The distribution of committee seats among political groups must be either the nearest whole number above or the nearest whole number below the proportional calculation.\nWhere there is no agreement among the political groups on their proportional weight within one or more specific committees, the Conference of Presidents shall decide.\n3.\nIf a political group decides not to take seats on a committee, or fails to appoint its members within the deadline set by the Conference of Presidents, the seats in question shall remain vacant. Exchange of seats between political groups is not allowed.\n4.\nWhere a Member's change of political group has the effect of disturbing the proportional distribution of committee seats as defined in paragraph 2, and there is no agreement among political groups to ensure compliance with the principles set out therein, the Conference of Presidents shall take the necessary decisions.\n5.\nAny modifications decided to the appointments by political groups and non-attached Members shall be communicated to the President, who shall announce them to Parliament at the latest at the beginning of the next sitting. These decisions shall take effect from the day of the announcement.\n6.\nThe political groups and the non-attached Members may appoint a number of substitutes for each committee which shall not exceed the number of full members that the political group or the non-attached Members are entitled to appoint in the committee. The President shall be informed accordingly. These substitutes shall be entitled to attend and to speak at committee meetings and, if the full member is absent, to take part in the vote.\n7.\nIn the absence of the full member and where substitutes either have not been appointed or are absent, the full member may arrange to be represented at meetings by another member of the same political group, or, where the member is a non-attached Member, by another non-attached Member, who shall be entitled to vote. The Chair of the committee shall be notified at the latest by the beginning of the voting session.\nThe advance notification provided for in the last sentence of paragraph 7 must be given before the end of the debate or before the opening of the vote on the item or items for which the full member is to be replaced.\nIn accordance with this Rule:\n—\nthe status of a full or substitute member of a committee shall depend exclusively on membership of a given political group,\n—\nif the number of a political group's full members in a committee changes, the maximum number of permanent substitutes which it can appoint to that committee shall change accordingly,\n—\nMembers who change their political group may not keep the status of full or substitute member of a committee which they had as members of their original group,\n—\na committee member may not under any circumstances be a substitute for a colleague who belongs to another political group.\nRule 210\nDuties of committees\n1.\nStanding committees shall examine questions referred to them by Parliament or, during an adjournment of the session, the President on behalf of the Conference of Presidents.\n2.\nShould two or more standing committees be competent to deal with a question, one committee shall be named as the committee responsible and the others as committees asked for opinions.\nA question shall not, however, be referred simultaneously to more than three committees, unless it is decided to depart from this rule under the conditions laid down in paragraph 1.\n3.\nAny two or more committees or subcommittees may jointly consider matters falling within their competence, but they may not take a decision jointly, except where Rule 58 applies.\n4.\nAny committee may, with the agreement of Parliament's relevant bodies, instruct one or more of its members to undertake a study or fact-finding mission.\nRule 211\nQuestions of competence\n1.\nIf a standing committee declares itself not to be competent to consider an item, or if a conflict arises over the competence of two or more standing committees, the question of competence shall be submitted to the Conference of Committee Chairs within four weeks of the announcement in Parliament of the referral to committee.\n2.\nThe Conference of Presidents shall take a decision within six weeks after the submission of the question on the basis of a recommendation from the Conference of Committee Chairs, or, if no such recommendation is forthcoming, from the latter's Chair.

This request may be placed on the agenda of the next committee meeting. By a majority of its members, the committee may decide to submit the matter to the President for further consideration under Rules 10 and 176.\nThis Rule applies to the extent that the applicable legal framework relating to the treatment of confidential information provides for the possibility of consulting the confidential information at a meeting in camera outside the secure facilities.\nRule 222\nPublic hearings and debates on citizens' initiatives\n1.\nWhen the Commission has published a citizens' initiative in the relevant register pursuant to point (a) of Article 10(1) of Regulation (EU) No 211/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council (52), the President of the European Parliament, on a proposal from the Chair of the Conference of Committee Chairs:\n(a)\nshall task the committee responsible for the subject-matter according to Annex VI with organising the public hearing provided for in Article 11 of Regulation (EU) No 211/2011; the committee responsible for petitions shall be automatically associated under Rule 57;\n(b)\nmay, where two or more citizens' initiatives published in the relevant register pursuant to point (a) of Article 10(1) of Regulation (EU) No 211/2011 have a similar subject-matter, decide, after consulting the organisers, that a joint public hearing is to be organised at which all of the citizens' initiatives involved shall be dealt with on an equal footing.\n2.\nThe committee responsible for the subject-matter:\n(a)\nshall ascertain whether the Commission has received the organisers at an appropriate level in accordance with point (b) of Article 10(1) of Regulation (EU) No 211/2011;\n(b)\nshall ensure, if necessary with the support of the Conference of Committee Chairs, that the Commission is properly involved in organising the public hearing and that it is represented at an appropriate level at the hearing.\n3.\nThe Chair of the committee responsible for the subject-matter shall convene the public hearing at an appropriate date within three months of the submission of the initiative to the Commission pursuant to Article 9 of Regulation (EU) No 211/2011.\n4.\nThe committee responsible for the subject matter shall organise the public hearing at Parliament, if appropriate together with such other institutions and bodies of the Union that wish to participate.

their duties, Members of the European Parliament:\n(a)\nare guided by and observe the following general principles of conduct: disinterest, integrity, openness, diligence, honesty, accountability and respect for Parliament's reputation;\n(b)\nact solely in the public interest and refrain from obtaining or seeking to obtain any direct or indirect financial benefit or other reward.\nArticle 2\nMain duties of Members\nIn exercising their duties, Members of the European Parliament shall:\n(a)\nnot enter into any agreement to act or vote in the interest of any other legal or natural person that would compromise their voting freedom, as enshrined in Article 6 of the Act of 20 September 1976 concerning the election of the members of the European Parliament by direct universal suffrage and Article 2 of the Statute for Members of the European Parliament;\n(b)\nnot solicit, accept or receive any direct or indirect benefit or other reward, whether in cash or in kind, in exchange for specific behaviour in the scope of the Member's parliamentary work, and shall consciously seek to avoid any situation which might imply bribery, corruption, or undue influence;\n(c)\nnot engage in paid professional lobbying directly linked to the Union decision-making process.\nArticle 3\nConflicts of interest\n1.\nA conflict of interest exists where a Member of the European Parliament has a personal interest that could improperly influence the performance of his or her duties as a Member. A conflict of interest does not exist where a Member benefits only as a member of the general public or of a broad class of persons.\n2.\nAny Member who finds that he or she has a conflict of interest shall immediately take the necessary steps to address it, in accordance with the principles and provisions of this Code of Conduct. If the Member is unable to resolve the conflict of interest, he or she shall report this to the President in writing. In cases of ambiguity, the Member may seek advice in confidence from the Advisory Committee on the Conduct of Members, established under Article 7.\n3.\nWithout prejudice to paragraph 2, Members shall disclose, before speaking or voting in plenary or in one of Parliament's bodies, or if proposed as a rapporteur, any actual or potential conflict of interest in relation to the matter under consideration, where such conflict is not evident from the information declared pursuant to Article 4. Such disclosure shall be made in writing or orally to the chair during the parliamentary proceedings in question.\nArticle 4\nDeclaration by Members\n1.\nFor reasons of transparency, Members of the European Parliament shall be personally responsible for submitting a declaration of financial interests to the President by the end of the first part-session after elections to the European Parliament (or within 30 days of taking up office with the Parliament in the course of a parliamentary term), in accordance with a form to be adopted by the Bureau pursuant to Article 9. They shall notify the President of any changes that have an influence on their declaration by the end of the month following each change occurring.\n2.\nThe declaration of financial interests shall contain the following information, which shall be provided in a precise manner:\n(a)\nthe Member's occupation or occupations during the three-year period before he or she took up office with the Parliament, and his or her membership during that period of any boards or committees of companies, non-governmental organisations, associations or other bodies established in law;\n(b)\nany salary which the Member receives for the exercise of a mandate in another parliament;\n(c)\nany regular remunerated activity which the Member undertakes alongside the exercise of his or her office, whether as an employee or as a self-employed person;\n(d)\nmembership of any boards or committees of any companies, non-governmental organisations, associations or other bodies established in law, or any other relevant outside activity that the Member undertakes, whether the membership or activity in question is remunerated or unremunerated;\n(e)\nany occasional remunerated outside activity (including writing, lecturing or the provision of expert advice), if the total remuneration of all the Member's occasional outside activities exceeds EUR 5 000 in a calendar year;\n(f)\nany holding in any company or partnership, where there are potential public policy implications or where that holding gives the Member significant influence over the affairs of the body in question;\n(g)\nany support, whether financial or in terms of staff or material, additional to that provided by Parliament and granted to the Member in connection with his or her political activities by third parties, whose identity shall be disclosed;\n(h)\nany other financial interests which might influence the performance of the Member's duties.\nFor any item to be declared in accordance with the first subparagraph, Members shall, where appropriate, indicate whether it is remunerated or not; for items (a), (c), (d), (e) and (f), Members shall also indicate one of the following income categories:\n—\nUnremunerated,\n—\nEUR 1 to EUR 499 a month,\n—\nEUR 500 to EUR 1 000 a month,\n—\nEUR 1 001 to EUR 5 000 a month,\n—\nEUR 5 001 to EUR 10 000 a month,\n—\nabove EUR 10 000 a month, with an indication of the nearest EUR 10 000 amount.\nAny income that Members receive in respect of each item declared in accordance with the first subparagraph, but not on a regular basis, shall be calculated on an annual basis, divided by twelve and placed in one of the categories set out in the second subparagraph.\n3.\nThe information provided to the President in accordance with this Article shall be published on Parliament's website in an easily accessible manner.\n4.\nMembers may not be elected as office-holders of Parliament or of one of its bodies, be appointed as a rapporteur or participate in an official delegation or interinstitutional negotiations, if they have not submitted their declaration of financial interests.\n5.\nIf the President receives information, which leads him or her to believe that the declaration of financial interests of a Member is substantially incorrect or out of date, the President may consult the advisory committee provided for in Article 7. Where appropriate, the President shall request the Member to correct his or her declaration within 10 days. The Bureau may adopt a decision applying paragraph 4 to Members who do not comply with the President's correction request.\n6.\nRapporteurs may voluntarily list in the explanatory statement to their report outside interests who have been consulted on matters pertaining to the subject of the report (1).\nArticle 5\nGifts or similar benefits\n1.\nMembers of the European Parliament shall refrain from accepting, in the performance of their duties, any gifts or similar benefits, other than those with an approximate value of less than EUR 150 given in accordance with courtesy usage or those given to them in accordance with courtesy usage when they are representing Parliament in an official capacity.\n2.\nAny gifts presented to Members in accordance with paragraph 1 when they are representing Parliament in an official capacity shall be handed over to the President and dealt with in accordance with implementing measures to be laid down by the Bureau pursuant to Article 9.\n3.\nThe provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 shall not apply to the reimbursement of travel, accommodation and subsistence expenses of Members, or to the direct payment of such expenses by third parties, when Members attend, pursuant to an invitation and in the performance of their duties, at any events organised by third parties.\nThe scope of this paragraph, and in particular the rules designed to ensure transparency, shall be specified in the implementing measures to be laid down by the Bureau pursuant to Article 9.\nArticle 6\nActivities of former Members\nFormer Members of the European Parliament who engage in professional lobbying or representational activities directly linked to the European Union decision-making process should inform the European Parliament thereof and may not, throughout the period in which they engage in those activities, benefit from the facilities granted to former Members under the rules laid down by the Bureau to that effect (2).\nArticle 7\nAdvisory Committee on the Conduct of Members\n1.\nAn Advisory Committee on the Conduct of Members (‘the Advisory Committee’) is hereby established.\n2.\nThe Advisory Committee shall be composed of five members, appointed by the President at the beginning of his or her term of office from amongst the members of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs and the Committee on Legal Affairs, taking due account of the Members' experience and of political balance.\nEach member of the Advisory Committee shall serve as chair for six months on a rotating basis.\n3.\nThe President shall also, at the beginning of his or her term of office, appoint reserve members for the Advisory Committee, one for each political group not represented in the Advisory Committee.\nIn the event of an alleged breach of this Code of Conduct by a member of a political group not represented in the Advisory Committee, the relevant reserve member shall serve as a sixth full member of the Advisory Committee for the purposes of investigation of that alleged breach.\n4.\nUpon request by a Member, the Advisory Committee shall give him or her, in confidence and within 30 calendar days, guidance on the interpretation and implementation of the provisions of this Code of Conduct. The Member in question shall be entitled to rely on such guidance.\nAt the request of the President, the Advisory Committee shall also assess alleged breaches of this Code of Conduct and advise the President on possible action to be taken.\n5.\nThe Advisory Committee may, after consulting the President, seek advice from outside experts.\n6.\nThe Advisory Committee shall publish an annual report of its work.\nArticle 8\nProcedure in the event of possible breaches of the Code of Conduct\n1.\nWhere there is reason to think that a Member of the European Parliament may have breached this Code of Conduct, the President shall, except in manifestly vexatious cases, refer the matter to the Advisory Committee.\n2.\nThe Advisory Committee shall examine the circumstances of the alleged breach, and may hear the Member concerned. Based on its findings, it shall make a recommendation to the President concerning a possible decision.\nIn case of an alleged breach of the Code of Conduct by a permanent member or by a reserve member of the Advisory Committee, the member or reserve member concerned shall refrain from taking part in the proceedings of the Advisory Committee on that alleged breach.\n3.\nIf, taking into account that recommendation, and having invited the Member concerned to submit written observations, the President concludes that the Member concerned has breached the Code of Conduct, he or she shall adopt a reasoned decision laying down a penalty. The President shall notify that Member of the reasoned decision.\nThe penalty may consist of one or more of the measures listed in Rule 176(4) to (6) of the Rules of Procedure.\n4.\nThe internal appeal procedures defined in Rule 177 of the Rules of Procedure shall be available to the Member concerned.\nArticle 9\nImplementation\nThe Bureau shall lay down implementing measures for this Code of Conduct, including a monitoring procedure, and shall, when necessary, update the amounts referred to in Articles 4 and 5.\nThe Bureau may bring forward proposals for revision of this Code of Conduct.\n(1)  See Bureau Decision of 12 September 2016 on the implementation of the Inter-Institutional Agreement on the Transparency Register.\n(2)  Bureau Decision of 12 April 1999 on facilities granted to former Members of the European Parliament.\nANNEX II\nCODE OF APPROPRIATE BEHAVIOUR FOR MEMBERS OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT IN EXERCISING THEIR DUTIES\n1.\nIn exercising their duties, Members of the European Parliament will behave towards everyone working in the European Parliament with dignity, courtesy and respect and without prejudice or discrimination.\n2.\nIn exercising their duties, Members will behave in a professional manner and must refrain, in their relations with staff, from, in particular, degrading, insulting, offensive or discriminatory language or any other actions which are unethical, demeaning or unlawful.\n3.\nMembers may not, by their actions, incite or encourage staff to violate, circumvent or ignore the legislation in force, Parliament’s internal rules or this Code, or tolerate such behaviour by staff under their responsibility.\n4.\nWith the aim of ensuring that the European Parliament functions effectively, Members will seek to ensure, exercising appropriate discretion, that any disagreements or conflicts involving staff under their responsibility are handled promptly, fairly and effectively.\n5.\nWhere necessary, Members will cooperate promptly and fully with the procedures in place for managing situations of conflict or harassment (psychological or sexual), including responding promptly to any allegations of harassment.
