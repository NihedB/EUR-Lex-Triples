The European Parliament also noted that Member States’ regimes for spectrum allocation and exploitation differ widely and that those differences represent serious obstacles to the achievement of a well-functioning internal market.\n(3)\nThe Commission, in its Communication of 26 April 2007 on European Space Policy, has also established an objective of facilitating the introduction of innovative satellite communications services, in particular by aggregating demand in remote and rural areas, while stressing the need for pan-European licensing of satellite services and spectrum.\n(4)\nDirective 2002/21/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 7 March 2002 on a common regulatory framework for electronic communications networks and services (Framework Directive) (4) aims at encouraging efficient use and ensuring effective management of radio frequencies and numbering resources, removing the remaining obstacles to the provision of the relevant networks and services, ensuring that there is no discrimination and encouraging the establishment and development of trans-European networks and the interoperability of pan-European services.\n(5)\nThe introduction of new systems providing mobile satellite services (MSS) would contribute to the development of the internal market and enhance competition by increasing the availability of pan-European services and end-to-end connectivity as well as encouraging efficient investment. MSS constitute an innovative alternative platform for various types of pan-European telecommunications and broadcasting/multicasting services, regardless of the location of end users, such as high-speed Internet/intranet access, mobile multimedia and public protection and disaster relief. MSS could, in particular, improve coverage of rural areas in the Community, thus bridging the digital divide in terms of geography, strengthening cultural diversity and media pluralism and simultaneously contributing to the competitiveness of European information and communication technology industries in line with the objectives of the renewed Lisbon strategy. Directive 89/552/EEC of 3 October 1989 of the European Parliament and of the Council on the coordination of certain provisions laid down by law, regulation or administrative action in Member States concerning the provision of audiovisual media services (Audiovisual Media Services Directive) (5) should apply, as appropriate, to audiovisual media services transmitted using MSS systems.\n(6)\nSatellite communications, by their very nature, cross national borders and, as such, are susceptible to international or regional in addition to national regulation. Pan-European satellite services are an important element of the internal market and could make a substantial contribution to achieving European Union objectives, such as expansion of geographical coverage of broadband in line with the i2010 initiative (6). New applications of mobile satellite systems will emerge in the coming years.\n(7)\nCommission Decision 2007/98/EC of 14 February 2007 on the harmonised use of radio spectrum in the 2 GHz frequency bands for the implementation of systems providing mobile satellite services (7) provides that Member States shall make these frequency bands available to systems providing MSS in the Community as of 1 July 2007.\n(8)\nRadio spectrum technical management, as organised by Decision No 676/2002/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 7 March 2002 on a regulatory framework for radio spectrum policy in the European Community (Radio Spectrum Decision) (8) in general and Decision 2007/98/EC in particular, does not cover procedures for assignment of spectrum and granting rights of use for radio frequencies.\n(9)\nWith the exception of Article 8 of Directive 2002/20/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 7 March 2002 on the authorisation of electronic communications networks and services (Authorisation Directive) (9), operators of mobile satellite systems are selected and authorised at national level under the existing Community regulatory framework for electronic communications.\n(10)\nRegulations of the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) provide for procedures for satellite radio frequency coordination as a tool for management of harmful interference, but do not extend to selection or authorisation.\n(11)\nIn order to prevent Member States from taking decisions that might lead to fragmentation of the internal market and undermine the objectives identified in Article 8 of Directive 2002/21/EC, selection criteria for mobile satellite systems should exceptionally be harmonised so that the selection process results in availability of MSS across the European Union. High up-front investment required for the development of mobile satellite systems and the associated high technological and financial risks necessitate an economy of scale for such systems in the form of wide pan-European geographic coverage, so that they remain economically viable.\n(12)\nMoreover, the successful launch of MSS requires coordination of regulatory action by Member States. Differences in national selection procedures could still create fragmentation of the internal market due to the divergent implementation of selection criteria, including the weighting of the criteria, or different timescales of the selection procedures. This would result in a patchwork of successful applicants selected in contradiction to the pan-European nature of those MSS. Selection of different operators of mobile satellite systems by different Member States could imply complex harmful interference situations or could even mean that a selected operator is prevented from providing a pan-European satellite service, for instance where different radio frequencies are assigned to the operator in different Member States. Therefore, harmonisation of the selection criteria should be supplemented by the establishment of a common selection mechanism that would provide a coordinated selection outcome for all Member States.\n(13)\nSince authorisation of the selected operators of mobile satellite systems involves attachment of conditions to such authorisations and a broad range of national provisions applicable in the field of electronic communications must thus be taken into account, the authorisation issues should be dealt with by the competent authorities of the Member States. However, in order to ensure consistency of authorisation approaches between different Member States, provisions relating to the synchronised assignment of spectrum and harmonised authorisation conditions should be established at the Community level, without prejudice to specific national conditions compatible with Community law.\n(14)\nMSS can generally reach geographic areas not well covered by other electronic communications services, in particular rural areas. The coordinated selection and authorisation of new systems providing MSS could therefore play an important role in bridging the digital divide by improving the accessibility, speed, and quality of electronic communications services in these areas, thus contributing to social cohesion. Therefore, the proposed coverage area of MSS (service area), as well as the time frame for providing MSS within all Member States, are important characteristics which should be taken into account in an appropriate manner during the selection procedure.\n(15)\nTaking into account a comparatively long period of time and complex technical development steps required for the launch of MSS, progress in the technical and commercial development of mobile satellite systems should be assessed as part of the selection procedure.\n(16)\nSatellite radio frequency coordination is critical for the effective provision of MSS in the Member States and should therefore be considered when the credibility of applicants and the viability of the proposed mobile satellite systems are assessed during the selection procedure.\n(17)\nThe comparative selection procedure should aim to bring mobile satellite systems in the 2 GHz frequency band into use without undue delay, while taking into account the right of applicants to fair and non-discriminatory participation.\n(18)\nComplementary ground components are an integral part of a mobile satellite system and are used, typically, to enhance the services offered via the satellite in areas where it may not be possible to retain a continuous line of sight with the satellite due to obstructions in the skyline caused by buildings and terrain. In accordance with Decision 2007/98/EC, complementary ground components use the same frequency bands as MSS (1 980 to 2 010 MHz and 2 170 to 2 200 MHz). The authorisation of such complementary ground components will therefore mainly rely on conditions related to local circumstances. They should therefore be selected and authorised at national level, subject to conditions established by Community law. This should be without prejudice to specific requests made by competent national authorities to the selected applicants to provide technical information indicating how particular complementary ground components would improve the availability of the proposed MSS in geographical areas where communications with one or more space stations cannot be ensured with the required quality, provided that such technical information has not already been provided in accordance with Title II.\n(19)\nThe limited amount of radio spectrum available implies that the number of undertakings that may be selected and authorised is also necessarily limited. However, if the selection process leads to a finding that there is no radio spectrum scarcity, all eligible candidates should be selected. The limited amount of radio spectrum available may mean that any merger or takeover of any operator providing MSS with or by another could significantly reduce competition and would therefore be subject to scrutiny under competition law.\n(20)\nThe right to use the specific radio frequencies should be granted to the selected applicants as soon as possible after their selection, in accordance with Article 5(3) of Directive 2002/20/EC.\n(21)\nDecisions on the withdrawal of authorisations granted in relation to MSS or complementary ground components due to the non-fulfilment of obligations should be enforced at national level.\n(22)\nWhile monitoring of the use of radio spectrum by the selected and authorised operators of mobile satellite systems and any required enforcement action is undertaken at national level, it should remain possible for the Commission to define the modalities of a coordinated monitoring and/or enforcement procedure. Wherever necessary, the Commission should have the right to raise enforcement issues relating to the fulfilment by operators of common authorisation conditions, in particular coverage requirements.\n(23)\nThe measures necessary for the implementation of this Decision should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission (10). Decisions on selection of applicants should be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure in view of the importance of the Community procedure for any further national authorisation procedures.\n(24)\nIn particular, the Commission should be empowered to define the modalities for coordinated application of the rules on enforcement. Since those measures are of general scope and are designed to amend non-essential elements of this Decision by supplementing it with new non-essential elements, they must be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny provided for in Article 5a of Decision 1999/468/EC.\n(25)\nSince the objective of this Decision, namely to establish a common framework for the selection and authorisation of operators of mobile satellite systems, cannot be sufficiently achieved by Member States and can therefore, by reason of the scale and effects of the action, be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality as set out in that Article, this Decision does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve that objective,\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\nTITLE I\nOBJECTIVE, SCOPE AND DEFINITIONS\nArticle 1\nObjective and scope\n1.

The calls for tenders are published in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThe decision establishes an MSS-operator selection procedure at EU level and common authorisation rules to be applied by EU countries for use of the 2 GHz frequency band, which comprises radiospectrum : from 1980 to 2010 MHz for ground to satellite communication, and 2170 to 2200 MHz for satellite to ground communication, in accordance with Decision 2007/98/EC.\nOperators submitting an application must be established in the EU, and identify the radio spectrum requested, which should be no more than 15 MHz for each direction of communication. Applicants must also commit to: covering a service area of at least 60% of the aggregate land area of the EU countries, from the time the provision of MSS commences;making MSS available in all EU countries and to at least 50% of the population and over at least 60% of the aggregate land area of each EU country by no later than 7 years from selection.\nThe selection procedure comprises the assessment of both the technical and commercial capacities of applicants as well as the technical and commercial quality of the MSS offered.\nThe Commission publishes the list of selected operators who must then obtain authorisation at national level.\nAuthorisation\nEU countries guarantee the selected operators the right to use radio frequencies for MSS, subject to conditions including: following milestones regarding the satellites’ mating (integration of the communication and service modules) and launch, frequency coordination and the provision of MSS within EU country territories in the 2 years following their selection;selected operators must honour the commitments made during the selection procedure and provide an annual report to national authorities;the rights of use and authorisations are granted for 18 years from the selection date.\nEU countries also issue authorisations for the use of complementary ground components.\nDecision 2009/449/EC determines the following:\nICO Satellite Limited and TerreStar Europe Limited are not eligible for radio spectrum allocation (because they did not demonstrate the required level of technical and commercial development of their respective mobile satellite systems and should not be eligible applicants);\nInmarsat Ventures Limited are selected for radio spectrum from 1980 to 1995 MHz for earth to space communications and from 2170 to 2185 MHz for space to earth communications;\nSolaris Mobile Limited are selected for radio spectrum from 1995 to 2010 MHz for earth to space communications and from 2185 to 2200 MHz for space to earth communications.\nDecision 2007/98/EC determines the following:\nEU countries must designate frequency bands 1980 to 2010 MHz and 2170 to 2200 MHz for MSS;\nany other use of these bands must not cause harmful interference and no claim for harmful interference caused by MSS can be made;\nany complementary ground-based station is an integral part of the MSS and must be controlled by the same system. It must use the same direction of transmission and the same portions of frequency bands as the associated satellite components.\nDecision 2011/667/EU sets out how EU countries coordinate enforcement response in the event of an alleged breach of the common conditions of the MSS operator authorisation.\nFROM WHEN DO THE DECISIONS APPLY?\nDecision No 626/2008/EC has applied since 2 July 2008. Amendments, including revised committee rules and provisions for adopting implementing acts to strengthen enforcement rules, have applied since 26 July 2019.\nDecision 2009/449/EC has applied since 12 June 2009.\nDecision 2007/98/EC has applied since 14 February 2007.\nDecision 2011/667/EU has applied since 11 October 2011.\nBACKGROUND\nDirective 2002/21/EC (see summary) was introduced to create an internal market for MSS open to competition and to reduce digital inequalities by progressively improving coverage in less-developed areas of the EU. The European Electronic Communications Code (Directive (EU) 2018/1972) repeals it from 21 December 2020.\nThe decisions follow the guidelines in the 2007 European Parliament Resolution Towards a European Policy on the Radio Spectrum Policy which emphasises the importance of the diffusion of broadband, mobile communications and new wireless technologies in achieving universal coverage in the EU. Pan-European satellite services also enable the expansion of geographical coverage of broadband in line with the i2010 initiative.\nFor more information, see: Going mobile with satellite services (European Commission)Spectrum in the European Union — factsheet (European Commission).\nKEY TERMS\n              \nComplementary ground components of MSS: fixed ground-based stations, designed to improve the availability of MSS in geographical areas within the footprint of the system’s satellite(s), where communications with the satellite space stations may not have the required quality.\nMAIN DOCUMENTS\n            \nDecision No 626/2008/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 30 June 2008 on the selection and authorisation of systems providing mobile satellite services (MSS) (OJ L 172, 2.7.2008, pp. 15-24)\nSuccessive amendments to Decision No 626/2008/EC have been incorporated into the original text.
