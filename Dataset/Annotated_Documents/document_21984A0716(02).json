Decision (EU) 2021/176 marks the conclusion by the EU concerning the extension of the agreement’s scope and Spain’s accession.\nKEY POINTS\nContracting parties\nThe contracting parties to the Bonn Agreement, as most recently amended in 2021, are the governments of Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom, as well as the European Union.\nSea areas covered by the agreement\nThe agreement concerns the greater North Sea and its wider approaches – one of the busiest sea areas in the world. Since Spain’s accession to the agreement, it covers:\nthe North Sea proper, southwards of latitude 61° 0'00.00\" N;\nthe Skagerrak, the southern limit of which is determined east of the Skaw by the latitude 57° 44'43.00\" N;\nthe Bay of Biscay, bounded on the south and west by the line defined in Part I of the annex to the agreement;\nother waters, comprising the Irish Sea, the Celtic Sea, the Malin Sea, the Great Minch, the Little Minch, part of the Norwegian Sea, and parts of the north-east Atlantic, bounded on the west and north by the line defined in Part II of the annex to the agreement.\nScope of application\nBuilding on an earlier agreement signed in 1969 which covered pollution from spills of crude oil, the 1984 Bonn Agreement also covered spills of other harmful substances polluting or threatening to pollute the sea in the North Sea area.\nIn 2019, the contracting parties decided to amend the agreement to cover cooperation on surveillance in respect of the requirements of Annex VI to the MARPOL Convention . Annex VI introduces stricter sulphur limits for marine fuel in sulphur oxide emission control areas (which includes the North Sea). Directive (EU) 2016/802 on reducing the sulphur content of certain liquid fuels incorporates the main changes in international law on preventing air pollution from ships into EU law (see summary).\nAreas of work\nThe contracting parties agree:\nto cooperate actively among themselves;\nto jointly develop and set guidelines for the practical, operational and technical aspects of joint action;\nto share information about the national organisation which deals with the type of pollution covered by the agreement;the competent authority responsible for receiving and dispatching reports of such pollution and for dealing with questions concerning measures of mutual assistance;their national means for avoiding or dealing with such pollution, which they could make available for international assistance;new ways in which such pollution may be avoided and about new effective measures to deal with it;major pollution incidents of this kind which they have dealt with.\nReporting of incidents and mutual assistance\nThe contracting parties agree to notify each other of any casualty or of the presence of oil or other harmful substances present in the North Sea which are likely to constitute a serious threat to the coast or other related interest of any other contracting party. Together, they have developed a standard notification format for reporting pollution incidents.\nA party facing a pollution incident may request assistance from the other parties. As a general rule, the requesting contracting party reimburses the parties that come to its assistance for costs of any action taken.\nImplementation\nThe contracting parties implement the agreement by:\nkeeping their zones of responsibility under surveillance for threats of marine pollution, including coordinating aerial and satellite surveillance;\nalerting each other to any threats;\nadopting common operational approaches so that they can rely on each other to achieve the necessary standards of prevention and clean-up;\nsupporting each other (when requested) in response operations;\nsharing research and development;\ncarrying out joint exercises.\nBudget and secretariat\nEach contracting party contributes 2.5% towards the agreement’s annual expenditure and the balance of the expenditure is shared among contracting parties (other than the EU) in proportion to their gross national product.\nThe agreement’s secretariat is based in London.\nDATE OF ENTRY INTO FORCE\n              \nThe 1984 Bonn agreement entered into force on 28 June 1984.\nBACKGROUND\n              \nFor more information, see:\nAbout the Bonn Agreement (Bonn Agreement website).\nMAIN DOCUMENTS\n            \nAgreement for cooperation in dealing with pollution of the North Sea by oil and other harmful substances (Bonn Agreement) (OJ L 188, 16.7.1984, pp. 9-16)\nCouncil Decision 84/358/EEC of 28 June 1984 concerning the conclusion of the Agreement for cooperation in dealing with pollution of the North Sea by oil and other harmful substances (OJ L 188, 16.7.1984, pp. 7-8)\nCouncil Decision (EU) 2021/176 of 5 February 2021 on the conclusion of the amendments to the Agreement for cooperation in dealing with pollution of the North Sea by oil and other harmful substances (Bonn Agreement) with regard to the extension of the scope of application of that Agreement and on the accession of the Kingdom of Spain to that Agreement (OJ L 54, 16.2.2021, pp. 1-2)\nRELATED DOCUMENTS\n            \nDirective (EU) 2016/802 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 May 2016 relating to a reduction in the sulphur content of certain liquid fuels (OJ L 132, 21.5.2016, pp. 58-78)\nlast update 26.04.2021", "tags": ["North Sea", "marine pollution", "toxic substance", "oil pollution", "multilateral agreement", "cooperation agreement (EU)", "environmental cooperation"], "subjects": ["Cooperation", "Environment", "External relations"], "split": "train", "reference_annotations": {}, "summary_annotations": {}}
