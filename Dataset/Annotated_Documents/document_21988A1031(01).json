Nitrous oxide is the primary source of stratospheric NOx, which play a vital role in controlling the abundance of stratospheric ozone;\n(ii)\nNitrogen oxides (NOx)\nGround-level sources of NOx play a major direct role only in tropospheric photochemical processes and an indirect role in stratospheric photochemistry, whereas injection of NOx close to the tropopause may lead directly to a change in upper tropospheric and stratospheric ozone;\n(c)\nChlorine substances\n(i)\nFully halogenated alkanes, e.g. CCl4, CFCl3 (CFC-11), CF2Cl2 (CFC-12), C2F3Cl3 (CFC-113), C2F4Cl2 (CFC-114)\nFully halogenated alkanes are anthropogenic and act as a source of ClOx, which plays a vital role in ozone photochemistry, especially in the 30 to 50 kilometre altitude region;\n(ii)\nPartially halogenated alkanes, e.g. CH3Cl, CHF2Cl (CFC-22), CH3CCl3, CHFCl2 (CFC-21)\nThe sources of CH3Cl are natural, whereas the other partially halogenated alkanes mentioned above are anthropogenic in origin. These gases also act as a source of stratospheric ClOx;\n(d)\nBromine substances\nFully halogenated alkanes, e.g. CF3Br\nThese gases are anthropogenic and act as a source of BrOx, which behaves in a manner similar to ClOX;\n(e)\nHydrogen substances\n(i)\nHydrogen (H2)\nHydrogen, the source of which is natural and anthropogenic, plays a minor role in stratospheric photochemistry;\n(ii)\nWater (H2O)\nWater, the source of which is natural, plays a vital role in both tropospheric and stratospheric photochemistry.

It does not require parties* to take specific measures. These would come later in the form of the Montreal Protocol to the Vienna Convention.\nThe Vienna Convention was the first convention of any kind to be signed by every country involved, taking effect in 1988 and reaching universal ratification in 2009.\nDecision 88/540/EEC gives the EU’s legal approval for the Vienna Convention for the protection of the ozone layer and the Montreal Protocol on substances that deplete the ozone layer.\nKEY POINTS\n              \nAs a general obligation, parties must take appropriate measures to protect human health and the environment against adverse effects resulting or likely to result from human activities which modify or are likely to modify the ozone layer. In particular, on the basis of relevant scientific and technical considerations, parties must:\nadopt appropriate legislative or administrative measures;\ncooperate on systematic observations, research and information exchange to better understand the issues involvedin formulating measures, procedures, standards and harmonising appropriate policieswith competent international bodies to effectively implement the Convention and its Protocols.\nOzone layer research and scientific assessments involving the parties, either directly or within international bodies, focus on:\nphysical and chemical processes;\nhuman health and other biological effects, particularly changes in ultraviolet solar radiation;\nclimatic effects;\nsubstances, practices, processes and activities, and their cumulative impact;\neffects deriving from any modifications of the ozone layer;\nalternative substances and technologies;\nrelated socio-economic issues;\nmore detailed factors, such as the physics and chemistry of the atmosphere and specific chemical substances, are set out in the Annexes.\nIn addition, parties must:\nfacilitate and encourage the exchange of scientific, technical, socio-economic, commercial and legal information relevant to the convention (Annex II spells this out in greater detail);\ncooperate, taking account of developing countries’ needs, in promoting the development and transfer of technology by helping partners to acquire alternative technologiesproviding the necessary information, such as manuals and guidessupplying research equipment and facilitiestraining scientific and technical personnel;\ninform the decision-making body (the Conference of the Parties) of the measures they have taken to implement the convention.\nThe Conference of the Parties (on which all signatory countries are represented and have a vote):\nmonitors implementation of the convention;\nreviews scientific information;\npromotes appropriate harmonised policies, strategies and measures;\nadopts programmes on research, scientific and technological cooperation, exchange of information and transfer of technology and knowledge;\nconsiders and adopts amendments to the convention and possible additional protocols;\nwhen appropriate, calls on the expertise of bodies such as the World Meteorological Organization and the World Health Organization;\ntries to settle any disputes on interpretation or application of the convention by negotiation or third party mediation. If these fail, the issue may be referred to a conciliation commission or the International Court of Justice;\nis supported by a secretariat.\nAfter the convention has been in force for 4 years, a party may announce its intention to leave. This takes effect 1 year later.\nFROM WHEN DO THE CONVENTION AND DECISION APPLY?\nThe convention entered into force on 22 September 1988.\nThe decision has applied since 25 October 1988.\nBACKGROUND\nThe Vienna Convention was adopted on 22 March 1985 and entered into force on 22 September 1988, Since its entry into force, international action has reduced global consumption of ozone-depleting substances by 98%; but the ozone layer is not expected to fully recover before the second half of this century.\nThe EU implements the convention and its Montreal Protocol through its own legislation on ozone-depleting substances and flourinated greenhouse gases — among the strictest and most advanced in the world.\nThe EU Ozone Regulation (Regulation (EC) No 1005/2009 on substances that deplete the ozone layer), goes beyond the requirements of the Montreal Protocol in several cases; for instance: it has more ambitious reduction timeframes;it covers more substances; andit also regulates their presence in products and equipment (not only in bulk as in the Montreal Protocol).\nThe EU F-Gas Regulation (Regulation (EU) No 517/2014 on fluorinated greenhouse gases) envisages a more ambitious EU reduction for greenhouse gases already applicable from 2015, and covers greenhouse gases in products and equipment (not only in bulk as in the Montreal Protocol).\nFor more information, see: Protection of the ozone layer (European Commission).\nKEY TERMS\n              \nOzone layer: layer of atmospheric ozone above the planetary boundary.\nParties: a country which has ratified the convention.\nMAIN DOCUMENTS\n            \nVienna Convention for the protection of the ozone layer (OJ L 297, 31.10.1988, pp. 10-20)\nCouncil Decision 88/540/EEC of 14 October 1988 concerning the conclusion of the Vienna Convention for the protection of the ozone layer and the Montreal Protocol on substances that deplete the ozone layer (OJ L 297, 31.10.1988, pp. 8-9)\nRELATED DOCUMENTS\n            \nRegulation (EC) No 1005/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 September 2009 on substances that deplete the ozone layer (OJ L 286, 31.10.2009, pp. 1-30)\nSuccessive amendments to Regulation (EC) No 1005/2009 have been incorporated into the original text.
