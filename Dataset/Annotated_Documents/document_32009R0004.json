{"celex_id": "32009R0004", "reference": "10.1.2009\nEN\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\nL 7/1\nCOUNCIL REGULATION (EC) No 4/2009\nof 18 December 2008\non jurisdiction, applicable law, recognition and enforcement of decisions and cooperation in matters relating to maintenance obligations\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 61(c) and Article 67(2) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the Commission,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European Parliament (1),\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee (2),\nWhereas:\n(1)\nThe Community has set itself the objective of maintaining and developing an area of freedom, security and justice, in which the free movement of persons is ensured. For the gradual establishment of such an area, the Community is to adopt, among others, measures relating to judicial cooperation in civil matters having cross-border implications, in so far as necessary for the proper functioning of the internal market.\n(2)\nIn accordance with Article 65(b) of the Treaty, these measures must aim, inter alia, to promote the compatibility of the rules applicable in the Member States concerning the conflict of laws and of jurisdiction.\n(3)\nIn this respect, the Community has among other measures already adopted Council Regulation (EC) No 44/2001 of 22 December 2000 on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters (3), Council Decision 2001/470/EC of 28 May 2001 establishing a European Judicial Network in civil and commercial matters (4), Council Regulation (EC) No 1206/2001 of 28 May 2001 on cooperation between the courts of the Member States in the taking of evidence in civil or commercial matters (5), Council Directive 2003/8/EC of 27 January 2003 to improve access to justice in cross-border disputes by establishing minimum common rules relating to legal aid for such disputes (6), Council Regulation (EC) No 2201/2003 of 27 November 2003 on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in matrimonial matters and in matters of parental responsibility (7), Regulation (EC) No 805/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 April 2004 creating a European Enforcement Order for uncontested claims (8), and Regulation (EC) No 1393/2007 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 November 2007 on the service in the Member States of judicial and extrajudicial documents in civil or commercial matters (service of documents) (9).\n(4)\nThe European Council in Tampere on 15 and 16 October 1999 invited the Council and the Commission to establish special common procedural rules to simplify and accelerate the settlement of cross-border disputes concerning, inter alia, maintenance claims. It also called for the abolition of intermediate measures required for the recognition and enforcement in the requested State of a decision given in another Member State, particularly a decision relating to a maintenance claim.\n(5)\nA programme of measures for the enforcement of the principle of mutual recognition of decisions in civil and commercial matters (10), common to the Commission and to the Council, was adopted on 30 November 2000. That programme provides for the abolition of the exequatur procedure for maintenance claims in order to boost the effectiveness of the means by which maintenance creditors safeguard their rights.\n(6)\nThe European Council meeting in Brussels on 4 and 5 November 2004 adopted a new programme called ‘The Hague Programme: strengthening freedom, security and justice in the European Union’ (hereinafter referred to as The Hague Programme) (11).\n(7)\nAt its meeting on 2 and 3 June 2005, the Council adopted a Council and Commission Action Plan (12) which implements The Hague Programme in concrete actions and which mentions the necessity of adopting proposals on maintenance obligations.\n(8)\nIn the framework of The Hague Conference on Private International Law, the Community and its Member States took part in negotiations which led to the adoption on 23 November 2007 of the Convention on the International Recovery of Child Support and other Forms of Family Maintenance (hereinafter referred to as the 2007 Hague Convention) and the Protocol on the Law Applicable to Maintenance Obligations (hereinafter referred to as the 2007 Hague Protocol). Both those instruments should therefore be taken into account in this Regulation.\n(9)\nA maintenance creditor should be able to obtain easily, in a Member State, a decision which will be automatically enforceable in another Member State without further formalities.\n(10)\nIn order to achieve this goal, it is advisable to create a Community instrument in matters relating to maintenance obligations bringing together provisions on jurisdiction, conflict of laws, recognition and enforceability, enforcement, legal aid and cooperation between Central Authorities.\n(11)\nThe scope of this Regulation should cover all maintenance obligations arising from a family relationship, parentage, marriage or affinity, in order to guarantee equal treatment of all maintenance creditors. For the purposes of this Regulation, the term ‘maintenance obligation’ should be interpreted autonomously.\n(12)\nIn order to take account of the various ways of resolving maintenance obligation issues in the Member States, this Regulation should apply both to court decisions and to decisions given by administrative authorities, provided that the latter offer guarantees with regard to, in particular, their impartiality and the right of all parties to be heard. Those authorities should therefore apply all the rules of this Regulation.\n(13)\nFor the reasons set out above, this Regulation should also ensure the recognition and enforcement of court settlements and authentic instruments without affecting the right of either party to such a settlement or instrument to challenge the settlement or instrument before the courts of the Member State of origin.\n(14)\nIt should be provided in this Regulation that for the purposes of an application for the recognition and enforcement of a decision relating to maintenance obligations the term ‘creditor’ includes public bodies which are entitled to act in place of a person to whom maintenance is owed or to claim reimbursement of benefits provided to the creditor in place of maintenance. Where a public body acts in this capacity, it should be entitled to the same services and the same legal aid as a creditor.\n(15)\nIn order to preserve the interests of maintenance creditors and to promote the proper administration of justice within the European Union, the rules on jurisdiction as they result from Regulation (EC) No 44/2001 should be adapted. The circumstance that the defendant is habitually resident in a third State should no longer entail the non-application of Community rules on jurisdiction, and there should no longer be any referral to national law. This Regulation should therefore determine the cases in which a court in a Member State may exercise subsidiary jurisdiction.\n(16)\nIn order to remedy, in particular, situations of denial of justice this Regulation should provide a forum necessitatis allowing a court of a Member State, on an exceptional basis, to hear a case which is closely connected with a third State. Such an exceptional basis may be deemed to exist when proceedings prove impossible in the third State in question, for example because of civil war, or when an applicant cannot reasonably be expected to initiate or conduct proceedings in that State. Jurisdiction based on the forum necessitatis should, however, be exercised only if the dispute has a sufficient connection with the Member State of the court seised, for instance the nationality of one of the parties.\n(17)\nAn additional rule of jurisdiction should provide that, except under specific conditions, proceedings to modify an existing maintenance decision or to have a new decision given can be brought by the debtor only in the State in which the creditor was habitually resident at the time the decision was given and in which he remains habitually resident. To ensure proper symmetry between the 2007 Hague Convention and this Regulation, this rule should also apply as regards decisions given in a third State which is party to the said Convention in so far as that Convention is in force between that State and the Community and covers the same maintenance obligations in that State and in the Community.\n(18)\nFor the purposes of this Regulation, it should be provided that in Ireland the concept of ‘domicile’ replaces the concept of ‘nationality’ which is also the case in the United Kingdom, subject to this Regulation being applicable in the latter Member State in accordance with Article 4 of the Protocol on the position of the United Kingdom and Ireland annexed to the Treaty on European Union and the Treaty establishing the European Community.\n(19)\nIn order to increase legal certainty, predictability and the autonomy of the parties, this Regulation should enable the parties to choose the competent court by agreement on the basis of specific connecting factors. To protect the weaker party, such a choice of court should not be allowed in the case of maintenance obligations towards a child under the age of 18.\n(20)\nIt should be provided in this Regulation that, for Member States bound by the 2007 Hague Protocol, the rules on conflict of laws in respect of maintenance obligations will be those set out in that Protocol. To that end, a provision referring to the said Protocol should be inserted. The 2007 Hague Protocol will be concluded by the Community in time to enable this Regulation to apply. To take account of a scenario in which the 2007 Hague Protocol does not apply to all the Member States a distinction for the purposes of recognition, enforceability and enforcement of decisions needs to be made in this Regulation between the Member States bound by the 2007 Hague Protocol and those not bound by it.\n(21)\nIt needs to be made clear in this Regulation that these rules on conflict of laws determine only the law applicable to maintenance obligations and do not determine the law applicable to the establishment of the family relationships on which the maintenance obligations are based. The establishment of family relationships continues to be covered by the national law of the Member States, including their rules of private international law.\n(22)\nIn order to ensure swift and efficient recovery of a maintenance obligation and to prevent delaying actions, decisions in matters relating to maintenance obligations given in a Member State should in principle be provisionally enforceable. This Regulation should therefore provide that the court of origin should be able to declare the decision provisionally enforceable even if the national law does not provide for enforceability by operation of law and even if an appeal has been or could still be lodged against the decision under national law.\n(23)\nTo limit the costs of proceedings subject to this Regulation, the greatest possible use of modern communications technologies, particularly for hearing parties, would be helpful.\n(24)\nThe guarantees provided by the application of rules on conflict of laws should provide the justification for having decisions relating to maintenance obligations given in a Member State bound by the 2007 Hague Protocol recognised and regarded as enforceable in all the other Member States without any procedure being necessary and without any form of control on the substance in the Member State of enforcement.\n(25)\nRecognition in a Member State of a decision relating to maintenance obligations has as its only object to allow the recovery of the maintenance claim determined in the decision. It does not imply the recognition by that Member State of the family relationship, parentage, marriage or affinity underlying the maintenance obligations which gave rise to the decision.\n(26)\nFor decisions on maintenance obligations given in a Member State not bound by the 2007 Hague Protocol, there should be provision in this Regulation for a procedure for recognition and declaration of enforceability. That procedure should be modelled on the procedure and the grounds for refusing recognition set out in Regulation (EC) No 44/2001. To accelerate proceedings and enable the creditor to recover his claim quickly, the court seised should be required to give its decision within a set time, unless there are exceptional circumstances.\n(27)\nIt would also be appropriate to limit as far as possible the formal enforcement requirements likely to increase the costs to be borne by the maintenance creditor. To that end, this Regulation should provide that a maintenance creditor ought not to be required to have a postal address or an authorised representative in the Member State of enforcement, without this otherwise affecting the internal organisation of the Member States in matters relating to enforcement proceedings.\n(28)\nIn order to limit the costs of enforcement proceedings, no translation should be required unless enforcement is contested, and without prejudice to the rules applicable to service of documents.\n(29)\nIn order to guarantee compliance with the requirements of a fair trial, this Regulation should provide for the right of a defendant who did not enter an appearance in the court of origin of a Member State bound by the 2007 Hague Protocol to apply for a review of the decision given against him at the stage of enforcement. However, the defendant must apply for this review within a set period which should start no later than the day on which, in the enforcement proceedings, his property was first made non-disposable in whole or in part. That right to apply for a review should be an extraordinary remedy granted to the defendant in default and not affecting the application of any extraordinary remedies laid down in the law of the Member State of origin provided that those remedies are not incompatible with the right to a review under this Regulation.\n(30)\nIn order to speed up the enforcement in another Member State of a decision given in a Member State bound by the 2007 Hague Protocol it is necessary to limit the grounds of refusal or of suspension of enforcement which may be invoked by the debtor on account of the cross-border nature of the maintenance claim. This limitation should not affect the grounds of refusal or of suspension laid down in national law which are not incompatible with those listed in this Regulation, such as the debtor’s discharge of his debt at the time of enforcement or the unattachable nature of certain assets.\n(31)\nTo facilitate cross-border recovery of maintenance claims, provision should be made for a system of cooperation between Central Authorities designated by the Member States. These Authorities should assist maintenance creditors and debtors in asserting their rights in another Member State by submitting applications for recognition, enforceability and enforcement of existing decisions, for the modification of such decisions or for the establishment of a decision. They should also exchange information in order to locate debtors and creditors, and identify their income and assets, as necessary. Lastly, they should cooperate with each other by exchanging general information and promoting cooperation amongst the competent authorities in their Member States.\n(32)\nA Central Authority designated under this Regulation should bear its own costs, except in specifically determined cases, and should provide assistance for all applicants residing in its Member State. The criterion for determining a person’s right to request assistance from a Central Authority should be less strict than the connecting factor of ‘habitual residence’ used elsewhere in this Regulation. However, the ‘residence’ criterion should exclude mere presence.\n(33)\nIn order to provide full assistance to maintenance creditors and debtors and to facilitate as much as possible cross-border recovery of maintenance, the Central Authorities should be able to obtain a certain amount of personal information. This Regulation should therefore oblige the Member States to ensure that their Central Authorities have access to such information through the public authorities or administrations which hold the information concerned in the course of their ordinary activities. It should however be left to each Member State to decide on the arrangements for such access. Accordingly, a Member State should be able to designate the public authorities or administrations which will be required to supply the information to the Central Authority in accordance with this Regulation, including, if appropriate, public authorities or administrations already designated in the context of other systems for access to information. Where a Member State designates public authorities or administrations, it should ensure that its Central Authority is able to access the requisite information held by those bodies as provided for in this Regulation. A Member State should also be able to allow its Central Authority to access requisite information from any other legal person which holds it and controls its processing.\n(34)\nIn the context of access to personal data and the use and transmission thereof, the requirements of Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data (13), as transposed into the national law of the Member States, should be complied with.\n(35)\nFor the purposes of the application of this Regulation it is however necessary to define the specific conditions of access to personal data and of the use and transmission of such data. In this context, the opinion of the European Data Protection Supervisor (14) has been taken into consideration. Notification of the data subject should take place in accordance with national law. It should however be possible to defer the notification to prevent the debtor from transferring his assets and thus jeopardising the recovery of the maintenance claim.\n(36)\nOn account of the costs of proceedings it is appropriate to provide for a very favourable legal aid scheme, that is, full coverage of the costs relating to proceedings concerning maintenance obligations in respect of children under the age of 21 initiated via the Central Authorities. Specific rules should therefore be added to the current rules on legal aid in the European Union which exist by virtue of Directive 2003/8/EC thus setting up a special legal aid scheme for maintenance obligations. In this context, the competent authority of the requested Member State should be able, exceptionally, to recover costs from an applicant having received free legal aid and lost the case, provided that the person’s financial situation so permits. This would apply, in particular, where someone well-off had acted in bad faith.\n(37)\nIn addition, for maintenance obligations other than those referred to in the preceding recital, all parties should be guaranteed the same treatment in terms of legal aid at the time of enforcement of a decision in another Member State. Accordingly, the provisions of this Regulation on continuity of legal aid should be understood as also granting such aid to a party who, while not having received legal aid in the proceedings to obtain or amend a decision in the Member State of origin, did then benefit from such aid in that State in the context of an application for enforcement of the decision. Similarly, a party who benefited from free proceedings before an administrative authority listed in Annex X should, in the Member State of enforcement, benefit from the most favourable legal aid or the most extensive exemption from costs or expenses, provided that he shows that he would have so benefited in the Member State of origin.\n(38)\nIn order to minimise the costs of translating supporting documents the court seised should only require a translation of such documents when this is necessary, without prejudice to the rights of the defence and the rules applicable concerning service of documents.\n(39)\nTo facilitate the application of this Regulation, Member States should be obliged to provide the Commission with the names and contact details of their Central Authorities and with other information. That information should be made available to practitioners and to the public through publication in the Official Journal of the European Union or through electronic access to the European Judicial Network in civil and commercial matters established by Decision 2001/470/EC. Furthermore, the use of forms provided for in this Regulation should facilitate and speed up communication between the Central Authorities and make it possible to submit applications electronically.\n(40)\nThe relationship between this Regulation and the bilateral or multilateral conventions and agreements on maintenance obligations to which the Member States are party should be specified. In this context it should be stipulated that Member States which are party to the Convention of 23 March 1962 between Sweden, Denmark, Finland, Iceland and Norway on the recovery of maintenance by the Member States may continue to apply that Convention since it contains more favourable rules on recognition and enforcement than those in this Regulation. As regards the conclusion of future bilateral agreements on maintenance obligations with third States, the procedures and conditions under which Member States would be authorised to negotiate and conclude such agreements on their own behalf should be determined in the course of discussions relating to a Commission proposal on the subject.\n(41)\nIn calculating the periods and time limits provided for in this Regulation, Regulation (EEC, Euratom) No 1182/71 of the Council of 3 June 1971 determining the rules applicable to periods, dates and time limits (15) should apply.\n(42)\nThe measures necessary for the implementation of this Regulation should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission (16).\n(43)\nIn particular, the Commission should be empowered to adopt any amendments to the forms provided for in this Regulation in accordance with the advisory procedure provided for in Article 3 of Decision 1999/468/EC. For the establishment of the list of the administrative authorities falling within the scope of this Regulation, and the list of authorities competent to certify the right to legal aid, the Commission should be empowered to act in accordance with the management procedure provided for in Article 4 of that Decision.\n(44)\nThis Regulation should amend Regulation (EC) No 44/2001 by replacing the provisions of that Regulation applicable to maintenance obligations. Subject to the transitional provisions of this Regulation, Member States should, in matters relating to maintenance obligations, apply the provisions of this Regulation on jurisdiction, recognition, enforceability and enforcement of decisions and on legal aid instead of those of Regulation (EC) No 44/2001 as from the date on which this Regulation becomes applicable.\n(45)\nSince the objectives of this Regulation, namely the introduction of a series of measures to ensure the effective recovery of maintenance claims in cross-border situations and thus to facilitate the free movement of persons within the European Union, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore, by reason of the scale and effects of this Regulation, be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality as set out in that Article this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary to achieve those objectives.\n(46)\nIn accordance with Article 3 of the Protocol on the position of the United Kingdom and Ireland, annexed to the Treaty on European Union and to the Treaty establishing the European Community, Ireland has given notice of its wish to take part in the adoption and application of this Regulation.\n(47)\nIn accordance with Articles 1 and 2 of the Protocol on the position of the United Kingdom and Ireland, annexed to the Treaty on European Union and to the Treaty establishing the European Community, the United Kingdom is not taking part in the adoption of this Regulation and is not bound by it or subject to its application. This is, however, without prejudice to the possibility for the United Kingdom of notifying its intention of accepting this Regulation after its adoption in accordance with Article 4 of the said Protocol.\n(48)\nIn accordance with Articles 1 and 2 of the Protocol on the position of Denmark annexed to the Treaty on European Union and the Treaty establishing the European Community, Denmark is not taking part in the adoption of this Regulation and is not bound by it or subject to its application, without prejudice to the possibility for Denmark of applying the amendments made here to Regulation (EC) No 44/2001 pursuant to Article 3 of the Agreement of 19 October 2005 between the European Community and the Kingdom of Denmark on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters (17),\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nCHAPTER I\nSCOPE AND DEFINITIONS\nArticle 1\nScope of application\n1.

That Annex shall be established and amended in accordance with the management procedure referred to in Article 73(2) at the request of the Member State in which the administrative authority concerned is established.\n3.   For the purposes of Articles 3, 4 and 6, the concept of ‘domicile’ shall replace that of ‘nationality’ in those Member States which use this concept as a connecting factor in family matters.\nFor the purposes of Article 6, parties which have their ‘domicile’ in different territorial units of the same Member State shall be deemed to have their common ‘domicile’ in that Member State.\nCHAPTER II\nJURISDICTION\nArticle 3\nGeneral provisions\nIn matters relating to maintenance obligations in Member States, jurisdiction shall lie with:\n(a)\nthe court for the place where the defendant is habitually resident, or\n(b)\nthe court for the place where the creditor is habitually resident, or\n(c)\nthe court which, according to its own law, has jurisdiction to entertain proceedings concerning the status of a person if the matter relating to maintenance is ancillary to those proceedings, unless that jurisdiction is based solely on the nationality of one of the parties, or\n(d)\nthe court which, according to its own law, has jurisdiction to entertain proceedings concerning parental responsibility if the matter relating to maintenance is ancillary to those proceedings, unless that jurisdiction is based solely on the nationality of one of the parties.\nArticle 4\nChoice of court\n1.   The parties may agree that the following court or courts of a Member State shall have jurisdiction to settle any disputes in matters relating to a maintenance obligation which have arisen or may arise between them:\n(a)\na court or the courts of a Member State in which one of the parties is habitually resident;\n(b)\na court or the courts of a Member State of which one of the parties has the nationality;\n(c)\nin the case of maintenance obligations between spouses or former spouses:\n(i)\nthe court which has jurisdiction to settle their dispute in matrimonial matters; or\n(ii)\na court or the courts of the Member State which was the Member State of the spouses’ last common habitual residence for a period of at least one year.\nThe conditions referred to in points (a), (b) or (c) have to be met at the time the choice of court agreement is concluded or at the time the court is seised.\nThe jurisdiction conferred by agreement shall be exclusive unless the parties have agreed otherwise.\n2.

This Article shall not apply to a dispute relating to a maintenance obligation towards a child under the age of 18.\n4.   If the parties have agreed to attribute exclusive jurisdiction to a court or courts of a State party to the Convention on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters (18), signed on 30 October 2007 in Lugano (hereinafter referred to as the Lugano Convention), where that State is not a Member State, the said Convention shall apply except in the case of the disputes referred to in paragraph 3.\nArticle 5\nJurisdiction based on the appearance of the defendant\nApart from jurisdiction derived from other provisions of this Regulation, a court of a Member State before which a defendant enters an appearance shall have jurisdiction. This rule shall not apply where appearance was entered to contest the jurisdiction.\nArticle 6\nSubsidiary jurisdiction\nWhere no court of a Member State has jurisdiction pursuant to Articles 3, 4 and 5 and no court of a State party to the Lugano Convention which is not a Member State has jurisdiction pursuant to the provisions of that Convention, the courts of the Member State of the common nationality of the parties shall have jurisdiction.\nArticle 7\nForum necessitatis\nWhere no court of a Member State has jurisdiction pursuant to Articles 3, 4, 5 and 6, the courts of a Member State may, on an exceptional basis, hear the case if proceedings cannot reasonably be brought or conducted or would be impossible in a third State with which the dispute is closely connected.\nThe dispute must have a sufficient connection with the Member State of the court seised.\nArticle 8\nLimit on proceedings\n1.   Where a decision is given in a Member State or a 2007 Hague Convention Contracting State where the creditor is habitually resident, proceedings to modify the decision or to have a new decision given cannot be brought by the debtor in any other Member State as long as the creditor remains habitually resident in the State in which the decision was given.\n2.   Paragraph 1 shall not apply:\n(a)\nwhere the parties have agreed in accordance with Article 4 to the jurisdiction of the courts of that other Member State;\n(b)\nwhere the creditor submits to the jurisdiction of the courts of that other Member State pursuant to Article 5;\n(c)\nwhere the competent authority in the 2007 Hague Convention Contracting State of origin cannot, or refuses to, exercise jurisdiction to modify the decision or give a new decision; or\n(d)\nwhere the decision given in the 2007 Hague Convention Contracting State of origin cannot be recognised or declared enforceable in the Member State where proceedings to modify the decision or to have a new decision given are contemplated.\nArticle 9\nSeising of a court\nFor the purposes of this Chapter, a court shall be deemed to be seised:\n(a)\nat the time when the document instituting the proceedings or an equivalent document is lodged with the court, provided that the claimant has not subsequently failed to take the steps he was required to take to have service effected on the defendant; or\n(b)\nif the document has to be served before being lodged with the court, at the time when it is received by the authority responsible for service, provided that the claimant has not subsequently failed to take the steps he was required to take to have the document lodged with the court.\nArticle 10\nExamination as to jurisdiction\nWhere a court of a Member State is seised of a case over which it has no jurisdiction under this Regulation it shall declare of its own motion that it has no jurisdiction.\nArticle 11\nExamination as to admissibility\n1.   Where a defendant habitually resident in a State other than the Member State where the action was brought does not enter an appearance, the court with jurisdiction shall stay the proceedings so long as it is not shown that the defendant has been able to receive the document instituting the proceedings or an equivalent document in sufficient time to enable him to arrange for his defence, or that all necessary steps have been taken to this end.\n2.   Article 19 of Regulation (EC) No 1393/2007 shall apply instead of the provisions of paragraph 1 of this Article if the document instituting the proceedings or an equivalent document had to be transmitted from one Member State to another pursuant to that Regulation.\n3.   Where the provisions of Regulation (EC) No 1393/2007 are not applicable, Article 15 of the Hague Convention of 15 November 1965 on the service abroad of judicial and extrajudicial documents in civil or commercial matters shall apply if the document instituting the proceedings or an equivalent document had to be transmitted abroad pursuant to that Convention.\nArticle 12\nLis pendens\n1.   Where proceedings involving the same cause of action and between the same parties are brought in the courts of different Member States, any court other than the court first seised shall of its own motion stay its proceedings until such time as the jurisdiction of the court first seised is established.\n2.   Where the jurisdiction of the court first seised is established, any court other than the court first seised shall decline jurisdiction in favour of that court.\nArticle 13\nRelated actions\n1.   Where related actions are pending in the courts of different Member States, any court other than the court first seised may stay its proceedings.\n2.   Where these actions are pending at first instance, any court other than the court first seised may also, on the application of one of the parties, decline jurisdiction if the court first seised has jurisdiction over the actions in question and its law permits the consolidation thereof.\n3.   For the purposes of this Article, actions are deemed to be related where they are so closely connected that it is expedient to hear and determine them together to avoid the risk of irreconcilable judgments resulting from separate proceedings.\nArticle 14\nProvisional, including protective, measures\nApplication may be made to the courts of a Member State for such provisional, including protective, measures as may be available under the law of that State, even if, under this Regulation, the courts of another Member State have jurisdiction as to the substance of the matter.\nCHAPTER III\nAPPLICABLE LAW\nArticle 15\nDetermination of the applicable law\nThe law applicable to maintenance obligations shall be determined in accordance with the Hague Protocol of 23 November 2007 on the law applicable to maintenance obligations (hereinafter referred to as the 2007 Hague Protocol) in the Member States bound by that instrument.\nCHAPTER IV\nRECOGNITION, ENFORCEABILITY AND ENFORCEMENT OF DECISIONS\nArticle 16\nScope of application of this Chapter\n1.   This Chapter shall govern the recognition, enforceability and enforcement of decisions falling within the scope of this Regulation.\n2.   Section 1 shall apply to decisions given in a Member State bound by the 2007 Hague Protocol.\n3.   Section 2 shall apply to decisions given in a Member State not bound by the 2007 Hague Protocol.\n4.

A decision given in a Member State bound by the 2007 Hague Protocol which is enforceable in that State shall be enforceable in another Member State without the need for a declaration of enforceability.\nArticle 18\nProtective measures\nAn enforceable decision shall carry with it by operation of law the power to proceed to any protective measures which exist under the law of the Member State of enforcement.\nArticle 19\nRight to apply for a review\n1.   A defendant who did not enter an appearance in the Member State of origin shall have the right to apply for a review of the decision before the competent court of that Member State where:\n(a)\nhe was not served with the document instituting the proceedings or an equivalent document in sufficient time and in such a way as to enable him to arrange for his defence; or\n(b)\nhe was prevented from contesting the maintenance claim by reason of force majeure or due to extraordinary circumstances without any fault on his part;\nunless he failed to challenge the decision when it was possible for him to do so.\n2.   The time limit for applying for a review shall run from the day the defendant was effectively acquainted with the contents of the decision and was able to react, at the latest from the date of the first enforcement measure having the effect of making his property non-disposable in whole or in part. The defendant shall react promptly, in any event within 45 days. No extension may be granted on account of distance.\n3.   If the court rejects the application for a review referred to in paragraph 1 on the basis that none of the grounds for a review set out in that paragraph apply, the decision shall remain in force.\nIf the court decides that a review is justified for one of the reasons laid down in paragraph 1, the decision shall be null and void. However, the creditor shall not lose the benefits of the interruption of prescription or limitation periods, or the right to claim retroactive maintenance acquired in the initial proceedings.\nArticle 20\nDocuments for the purposes of enforcement\n1.

The competent authority in the Member State of enforcement shall, on application by the debtor, refuse, either wholly or in part, the enforcement of the decision of the court of origin if the right to enforce the decision of the court of origin is extinguished by the effect of prescription or the limitation of action, either under the law of the Member State of origin or under the law of the Member State of enforcement, whichever provides for the longer limitation period.\nFurthermore, the competent authority in the Member State of enforcement may, on application by the debtor, refuse, either wholly or in part, the enforcement of the decision of the court of origin if it is irreconcilable with a decision given in the Member State of enforcement or with a decision given in another Member State or in a third State which fulfils the conditions necessary for its recognition in the Member State of enforcement.\nA decision which has the effect of modifying an earlier decision on maintenance on the basis of changed circumstances shall not be considered an irreconcilable decision within the meaning of the second subparagraph.\n3.   The competent authority in the Member State of enforcement may, on application by the debtor, suspend, either wholly or in part, the enforcement of the decision of the court of origin if the competent court of the Member State of origin has been seised of an application for a review of the decision of the court of origin pursuant to Article 19.\nFurthermore, the competent authority of the Member State of enforcement shall, on application by the debtor, suspend the enforcement of the decision of the court of origin where the enforceability of that decision is suspended in the Member State of origin.\nArticle 22\nNo effect on the existence of family relationships\nThe recognition and enforcement of a decision on maintenance under this Regulation shall not in any way imply the recognition of the family relationship, parentage, marriage or affinity underlying the maintenance obligation which gave rise to the decision.\nSECTION 2\nDecisions given in a Member State not bound by the 2007 Hague Protocol\nArticle 23\nRecognition\n1.   A decision given in a Member State not bound by the 2007 Hague Protocol shall be recognised in the other Member States without any special procedure being required.\n2.

If the outcome of proceedings in a court of a Member State depends on the determination of an incidental question of recognition, that court shall have jurisdiction over that question.\nArticle 24\nGrounds of refusal of recognition\nA decision shall not be recognised:\n(a)\nif such recognition is manifestly contrary to public policy in the Member State in which recognition is sought. The test of public policy may not be applied to the rules relating to jurisdiction;\n(b)\nwhere it was given in default of appearance, if the defendant was not served with the document which instituted the proceedings or with an equivalent document in sufficient time and in such a way as to enable him to arrange for his defence, unless the defendant failed to commence proceedings to challenge the decision when it was possible for him to do so;\n(c)\nif it is irreconcilable with a decision given in a dispute between the same parties in the Member State in which recognition is sought;\n(d)\nif it is irreconcilable with an earlier decision given in another Member State or in a third State in a dispute involving the same cause of action and between the same parties, provided that the earlier decision fulfils the conditions necessary for its recognition in the Member State in which recognition is sought.\nA decision which has the effect of modifying an earlier decision on maintenance on the basis of changed circumstances shall not be considered an irreconcilable decision within the meaning of points (c) or (d).\nArticle 25\nStaying of recognition proceedings\nA court of a Member State in which recognition is sought of a decision given in a Member State not bound by the 2007 Hague Protocol shall stay the proceedings if the enforceability of the decision is suspended in the Member State of origin by reason of an appeal.\nArticle 26\nEnforceability\nA decision given in a Member State not bound by the 2007 Hague Protocol and enforceable in that State shall be enforceable in another Member State when, on the application of any interested party, it has been declared enforceable there.\nArticle 27\nJurisdiction of local courts\n1.

The Central Authorities shall, within their Member State, transmit the information referred to in Article 61(2) to the competent courts, the competent authorities responsible for service of documents and the competent authorities responsible for enforcement of a decision, as the case may be.\n2.   Any authority or court to which information has been transmitted pursuant to Article 61 may use this only to facilitate the recovery of maintenance claims.\nExcept for information merely indicating the existence of an address, income or assets in the requested Member State, the information referred to in Article 61(2) may not be disclosed to the person having applied to the requesting Central Authority, subject to the application of procedural rules before a court.\n3.   Any authority processing information transmitted to it pursuant to Article 61 may not store such information beyond the period necessary for the purposes for which it was transmitted.\n4.

The right of a public body to act in place of an individual to whom maintenance is owed or to seek reimbursement of benefits provided to the creditor in place of maintenance shall be governed by the law to which the body is subject.\n3.   A public body may seek recognition and a declaration of enforceability or claim enforcement of:\n(a)\na decision given against a debtor on the application of a public body which claims payment of benefits provided in place of maintenance;\n(b)\na decision given between a creditor and a debtor to the extent of the benefits provided to the creditor in place of maintenance.\n4.   The public body seeking recognition and a declaration of enforceability or claiming enforcement of a decision shall upon request provide any document necessary to establish its right under paragraph 2 and to establish that benefits have been provided to the creditor.\nCHAPTER IX\nGENERAL AND FINAL PROVISIONS\nArticle 65\nLegalisation or other similar formality\nNo legalisation or other similar formality shall be required in the context of this Regulation.\nArticle 66\nTranslation of supporting documents\nWithout prejudice to Articles 20, 28 and 40, the court seised may require the parties to provide a translation of supporting documents which are not in the language of proceedings only if it deems a translation necessary in order to give a decision or to respect the rights of the defence.\nArticle 67\nRecovery of costs\nWithout prejudice to Article 54, the competent authority of the requested Member State may recover costs from an unsuccessful party having received free legal aid pursuant to Article 46, on an exceptional basis and if his financial circumstances so allow.\nArticle 68\nRelations with other Community instruments\n1.

Notwithstanding paragraph 1, and without prejudice to paragraph 3, this Regulation shall, in relations between Member States, take precedence over the conventions and agreements which concern matters governed by this Regulation and to which Member States are party.\n3.   This Regulation shall not preclude the application of the Convention of 23 March 1962 between Sweden, Denmark, Finland, Iceland and Norway on the recovery of maintenance by the Member States which are party thereto, since, with regard to the recognition, enforceability and enforcement of decisions, that Convention provides for:\n(a)\nsimplified and more expeditious procedures for the enforcement of decisions relating to maintenance obligations, and\n(b)\nlegal aid which is more favourable than that provided for in Chapter V of this Regulation.\nHowever, the application of the said Convention may not have the effect of depriving the defendant of his protection under Articles 19 and 21 of this Regulation.\nArticle 70\nInformation made available to the public\nThe Member States shall provide within the framework of the European Judicial Network in civil and commercial matters established by Decision 2001/470/EC the following information with a view to making it available to the public:\n(a)\na description of the national laws and procedures concerning maintenance obligations;\n(b)\na description of the measures taken to meet the obligations under Article 51;\n(c)\na description of how effective access to justice is guaranteed, as required under Article 44, and\n(d)\na description of national enforcement rules and procedures, including information on any limitations on enforcement, in particular debtor protection rules and limitation or prescription periods.\nMember States shall keep this information permanently updated.\nArticle 71\nInformation on contact details and languages (modelled on Article 25 of Regulation (EC) No 861/2007)\n1.

Where reference is made to this paragraph, Articles 3 and 7 of Decision 1999/468/EC shall apply.\nArticle 74\nReview clause\nBy five years from the date of application determined in the third subparagraph of Article 76 at the latest, the Commission shall submit to the European Parliament, the Council and the European Economic and Social Committee a report on the application of this Regulation, including an evaluation of the practical experiences relating to the cooperation between Central Authorities, in particular regarding those Authorities’ access to the information held by public authorities and administrations, and an evaluation of the functioning of the procedure for recognition, declaration of enforceability and enforcement applicable to decisions given in a Member State not bound by the 2007 Hague Protocol. If necessary the report shall be accompanied by proposals for adaptation.\nArticle 75\nTransitional provisions\n1.   This Regulation shall apply only to proceedings instituted, to court settlements approved or concluded, and to authentic instruments established after its date of application, subject to paragraphs 2 and 3.\n2.   Sections 2 and 3 of Chapter IV shall apply:\n(a)\nto decisions given in the Member States before the date of application of this Regulation for which recognition and the declaration of enforceability are requested after that date;\n(b)\nto decisions given after the date of application of this Regulation following proceedings begun before that date, in so far as those decisions fall with the scope of Regulation (EC) No 44/2001 for the purposes of recognition and enforcement.\nRegulation (EC) No 44/2001 shall continue to apply to procedures for recognition and enforcement under way on the date of application of this Regulation.\nThe first and second subparagraphs shall apply mutatis mutandis to court settlements approved or concluded and to authentic instruments established in the Member States.\n3.   Chapter VII on cooperation between Central Authorities shall apply to requests and applications received by the Central Authority as from the date of application of this Regulation.\nArticle 76\nEntry into force\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on the 20th day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nArticles 2(2), 47(3), 71, 72 and 73 shall apply from 18 September 2010.\nExcept for the provisions referred to in the second paragraph, this Regulation shall apply from 18 June 2011, subject to the 2007 Hague Protocol being applicable in the Community by that date. Failing that, this Regulation shall apply from the date of application of that Protocol in the Community.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in the Member States in accordance with the Treaty establishing the European Community.\nDone at Brussels, 18 December 2008.\nFor the Council\nThe President\nM.

Such claims arise from the obligation to help family members and may include, for example, maintenance paid to a child or to a former spouse following divorce.\nKEY POINTS\n              \nThe regulation applies to maintenance obligations arising from:\na family relationship;\nparentage;\nmarriage or affinity.\nJurisdiction\nJurisdiction in matters relating to maintenance obligations lies with: the court of the place where the defendant or the creditor usually lives orthe court which has jurisdiction over the status of a person (a divorce for example) or parental responsibility, if these relate to the maintenance claim (provided that jurisdiction is not based solely on the nationality of one of the parties).\nThe parties may, under certain conditions, agree on the court or courts of an European Union (EU) Member State which have jurisdiction to settle the dispute, unless it relates to a maintenance obligation towards a child under the age of 18.\nWhere the defendant appears before a court of a Member State, that court has jurisdiction, unless the defendant contests its jurisdiction.\nIf none of the above conditions apply, the dispute may, under certain conditions, be brought before the courts of a Member State of which both parties are nationals.\nWhen none of the above conditions apply, the matter may be brought before the court of a Member State with which the case has sufficient connection if the proceedings cannot reasonably be brought in a country with which the dispute is closely connected.\nAs long as the creditor continues to reside in the Member State in which the decision on maintenance obligations was taken, the debtor may not, with certain exceptions, bring proceedings to modify the decision in another Member State. The creditor may nevertheless agree that the dispute is decided by another court.\nIf proceedings concerning the same parties and involving the same cause of action are brought before the courts of different Member States, jurisdiction lies with the first court where the action was brought.\nRegardless of the court having jurisdiction as to substance, applications for provisional and protective measures may be lodged before any court of any Member State.\nRecognition and enforcement of decisions\nA decision on maintenance obligations taken in one Member State is to be recognised in another Member State without any special procedure.\nAll Member States, except Denmark, are bound by the Hague Protocol of 23 November 2007 on the Law Applicable to Maintenance Obligations.\nWhere the decision was taken by a Member State bound by the 2007 Hague Protocol, its recognition may not be opposed. This only applies if the Member State was bound by the Hague Protocol at the beginning of the proceedings.\nWhere the decision was taken by a Member State not bound by the 2007 Hague Protocol, its recognition may be refused in certain cases and it may only be enforced in another Member State if a declaration of its enforceability has been obtained in that Member State. This also applies to situations where the original court proceedings were started before the Maintenance Regulation became applicable (18 June 2011), but not before that Member State was bound by Brussels I Regulation (Regulation (EC) No 44/2001).\nIn all cases, the court of origin may declare a decision provisionally enforceable. When the decision is to be enforced in a Member State other than that in which it was originally taken, enforcement is governed by the law of that Member State.\nThe decision taken in a Member State cannot be reviewed as to its substance in the Member State in which its recognition, enforceability or enforcement is sought.\nFree legal aid may be provided in respect of applications on maintenance obligations arising from a parent-child relationship towards a person under the age of 21 provided that such applications are made via the central authorities.\nCentral authorities\nEach Member State must appoint a central authority responsible for assisting parties in the establishment and recovery of maintenance. In particular, they will send and receive applications provided for under the regulation and take all appropriate measures to introduce or facilitate the introduction of the necessary procedures.\nThe central authorities must cooperate with each other, promote cooperation among the competent authorities of their country and seek solutions to difficulties which may arise in the application of this Regulation. To do this, they should use the European Judicial Network in civil and commercial matters set up under Decision 2001/470/EC.\nFinal provisions\nThe regulation replaces the rules concerning maintenance obligations of Regulation (EC) No 44/2001 on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters. It also replaces Regulation (EC) No 805/2004 creating a European enforcement order for uncontested claims, except for European enforcement orders concerning maintenance obligations issued by Member States that are not bound by the 2007 Hague Protocol (see summary).\nAmending legislation\nRegulation (EC) No 4/2009 has been amended 4 times:\nImplementing Regulation (EU) No 1142/2011 set out new annexes (Annexes X and XI) listing Member States’ administrative and competent authorities;\nRegulation (EU) No 517/2013 amended a series of EU regulations and decisions, including Regulation (EC) No 4/2009, because of Croatia’s accession to EU membership;\nImplementing Regulation (EU) 2015/228 replaced Annexes I to VII to take account of Croatia’s accession to EU membershipthe changes in currency in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuaniathe United Kingdom’s wish to take part in the application of Regulation (EC) No 4/2009the need to include references to Denmark in Annexes II and IV in view of its wish to partly implement Regulation (EC) No 4/2009amendments of certain sections of Annexes VI and VII to facilitate their application;\nImplementing Regulation (EU) 2018/1937 replaced Annex X to take account of changes to the administrative authorities notified to the European Commission by the United Kingdom and Latvia.\nFROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?\n              \nThe regulation has applied since 18 June 2011. It applies to Denmark despite its opt-out of the EU’s area of freedom, security and justice.\nDenmark confirmed its intention to implement the regulation, as far as the regulation amends Regulation (EC) No 44/2001, by means of a declaration based on a parallel agreement concluded with the European Community.\nIn 2013, Denmark confirmed its intention to implement the implementing act (Implementing Regulation (EU) No 1142/2011) setting out Annexes X and XI to Regulation (EC) No 4/2009.\nBACKGROUND\n              \nFor more information, see:\nMaintenance obligations — support for family members (Your Europe)\nMaintenance obligations (European e-Justice portal)\nMaintenance obligation forms (European e-Justice portal)\nGuidance on the use of the Annexes under Regulation (EC) No 4/2009 on jurisdiction, applicable law, recognition and enforcement of decisions and cooperation in matters relating to maintenance obligations — publication (European Commission).\nMAIN DOCUMENT\n            \nCouncil Regulation (EC) No 4/2009 of 18 December 2008 on jurisdiction, applicable law, recognition and enforcement of decisions and cooperation in matters relating to maintenance obligations (OJ L 7, 10.1.2009, pp. 1-79)\nSuccessive amendments to Regulation (EC) No 4/2009 have been incorporated into the original text.
