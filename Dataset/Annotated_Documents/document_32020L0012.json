The certification is aimed at facilitating mobility, ensuring the safety of navigation and ensuring the protection of human life and the environment.\n(2)\nIn order to provide minimum harmonised standards for the certification of qualifications, the Commission has been empowered to adopt detailed rules laying down standards for competences and corresponding knowledge and skills, standards for practical exminations, standards for the approval of simulators and standards for medical fitness.\n(3)\nPursuant to Article 32 of Directive (EU) 2017/2397, delegated acts should make reference to standards established by the European Committee for drawing up standards in the field of inland navigation (‘CESNI’) and include the entire text of those, provided that those standards are available and up-to-date, that those standards comply with any applicable requirements set out in the Annexes of the Directive and that Union interests are not compromised by changes in the decision-making process of CESNI. The three conditions were fulfilled with the adoption, by CESNI, during its meeting on 8 November 2018, of the first standards on professional qualifications in inland navigation.\n(4)\nThe standards for competences should lay down the minimum competences required for the safe operation of the craft, and this, for the crew members at operational and management levels, for the boatmasters authorised to sail with the aid of radar and those authorised to sail on waterways with a maritime character, for the passenger navigation experts and for the liquefied natural gas (LNG) experts. Each required competence should be defined with its corresponding required knowledge and skills.\n(5)\nIn order for the competent authorities to carry out in a similar way the practical examinations required by Article 17(3) of Directive (EU) 2017/2397, standards for the practical examinations should be laid down. To this end, the standards should define, for each practical examination, the specific competences and the assessment situations, including a specific scoring system and technical requirements for craft and onshore installations. For the candidates to the qualification of boatmaster who have not previously completed an assessment at operational level, an additional module should be provided for, so that the ability to perform the related supervised tasks can also be verified.\n(6)\nThe standards for the approval of simulators should be laid down to ensure that the simulators used for an assessment of competence are designed in such a way as to allow for the verification of the competences as prescribed under the standards for practical examinations. The standards should cover the technical and functional requirements for vessel-handling and radar simulators as well as the procedure for the administrative approval of those simulators.\n(7)\nIn order to reduce national differences in medical requirements and examination procedures and to ensure that medical certificates which are issued to deck crew members in inland navigation are a valid indicator of their medical fitness for the work they will perform, standards for medical fitness should be laid down. The standards should specify the tests that medical practionners are to carry out and the criteria they are to apply to determine the fitness for work of deck crew members. They should cover eyesight, hearing and physical and psychological conditions which may lead to temporary or permanent unfitness for work, as well as possible mitigation measures and restrictions. For coherence, the standards should be based on the guidelines on the medical examinations of seafarers published by the International Labour Organisation and the International Maritime Organisation, in particular on the criteria applied to coastal services.\n(8)\nThe date of transposition of this delegated Directive should be aligned with the dates of transposition of Directive (EU) 2017/2397 for reasons of coherence and efficiency.\n(9)\nIn accordance with the case law of the Court of Justice of the European Union, the information which Member States are obliged to supply to the Commission in the context of transposing a directive must be clear and precise. This is also the case for this delegated act,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:\nArticle 1\nThe standards for competences and corresponding knowledge and skills referred to in Article 17(1) of Directive (EU) 2017/2397 shall be those laid down in Annex I to this Directive.\nArticle 2\nThe standards for the practical examinations referred to in Article 17(3) of Directive (EU) 2017/2397 shall be those laid down in Annex II to this Directive.\nArticle 3\nThe standards for the approval of simulators referred to in Article 21(2) of Directive (EU) 2017/2397 shall be those laid down in Annex III to this Directive.\nArticle 4\nThe standards for the medical fitness referred to in Article 23(6) of Directive (EU) 2017/2397 shall be those laid down in Annex IV to this Directive.\nArticle 5\n1.   Member States shall bring into force the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive by 17 January 2022 at the latest. They shall forthwith communicate to the Commission the text of those provisions.\nWhen Member States adopt those provisions, they shall contain a reference to this Directive or be accompanied by such a reference on the occasion of their official publication. Member States shall determine how such reference is to be made.\n2.   Paragraph 1 shall not apply to a Member State that has not fully transposed and implemented Directive (EU) 2017/2397 in accordance with Article 39(2), (3) or (4) of that Directive. Where such Member State fully transposes and implements Directive (EU) 2017/2397, it shall at the same time bring into force the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive and inform the Commission that it has done so.\n3.   Member States shall communicate to the Commission the text of the main provisions of national law which they adopt in the field covered by this Directive.\nArticle 6\nThis Directive shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nArticle 7\nThis Directive is addressed to the Member States.\nDone at Brussels, 2 August 2019.\nFor the Commission\nThe President\nJean-Claude JUNCKER\n(1)  OJ L 345, 27.12.2017, p. 53.\nANNEX I\nSTANDARDS FOR COMPETENCES AND CORRESPONDING KNOWLEDGE AND SKILLS\nI.

TECHNICAL AND FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS FOR VESSEL HANDLING AND RADAR SIMULATORS IN INLAND NAVIGATION\nNo\nItem\nQuality level of technical requirement\nTest procedure\nVessel handling simulator\nRadar simulator\n1.\nInland navigational radar installation\nAt least one inland navigational radar installation with the same functionalities as a type approved inland navigational radar installation according to ES-TRIN has to be installed on the simulator.\nIt has to be verified if the installation has the same functionalities as the type approved inland navigational radar installation.\nx\nx\n2.\nCommunication system\nThe simulator shall be fitted with a communication system comprising\n—\nan alternative internal telephone link and\n—\ntwo independent inland waterway radio communication systems.\nIt has to be verified if the simulator is fitted with communication systems.\nx\nx\n3.\nInland ECDIS\nAt least one Inland ECDIS has to be installed on the simulator.\nIt has to be verified if the installation has the same functionalities as an Inland ECDIS.\nx\n4.\nExercise area\nThe exercise area contains at least a representative river with side arms or canals and harbours\nVisual inspection of the area\nx\nx\n5.\nSound signals\nSound signals can be given using foot pedals or buttons.\nIt has to be verified if foot pedals or buttons function correctly.\nx\nx\n6.\nNight time navigation lights panel\nNight-time navigation lights panel is installed on the simulator.\nIt has to be verified if night time navigation lights panel functions correctly.\nx\nx\n7.\nMathematical models for craft\nAt least three mathematical models of representative types of craft with different methods of propulsion and loading conditions including one small craft which could be a tug, one medium-sized craft (e.g. 86 m length) and one large craft (e.g. 110 or 135 m length).\nIt has to be verified if the three mandatory models are available.\nx\n8.\nMathematical models for craft\nAt least one mathematical model of representative type of craft (e.g. 86 m length).\nIt has to be verified if the mandatory model is available.\nx\n9\nNumber of available target craft (1)\nThe simulator shall include target craft of at least 5 European Conference of Ministers of Transport (CEMT) classes.\nIt has to be verified if the required number and variety of target craft is available.\nx\nx\n10.\nOperator station\nThe operator shall be able to communicate on all very high frequency (VHF) channels. The operator has to be able to monitor the use of the channels.\nIt has to be verified if the operator can communicate on all VHF channels and if the operator can monitor the use of all channels.\nx\nx\n11.\nVarious exercises\nThere shall be a possibility to create, store and run various exercises, which shall be manipulable while running.\nDifferent operations shall be performed.\nx\nx\n12.\nSeparable exercises\nDuring examination of more than one applicant, the applicants’ exercises shall not interfere with the examination of another applicant.\nThe exercise shall be replayed for each applicant.\nx\nx\n13.\nCraft’s bridge functions and layout\nThe wheelhouse section shall be designed for radar navigation by one person as set out in ES-TRIN 2017/1.\nIt has to be verified if the bridge layout and equipment functions correspond to the applicable technical requirements for inland waterway craft. It has to be verified if the wheelhouse is designed for one person steering operations.\nx\nx\n14.\nSteering station (bridge/cubicle)\nSteering stations resemble those aboard inland craft as regards form and dimensions.\nVisual inspection.\nx\nx\n15.\nOperator station\n1.\nThere shall be a separate room in which operator(s) and examiner(s) can be seated, where the examiner must be able to perceive the radar image of the applicant.\n2.\nThe wheelhouse and operator space must be separate from each other. They shall be as much soundproof as possible.\n3.\nThe operator must be able to operate at least two VHF channels at the same time.\n4.\nThe operator must be able to clearly identify which radio communication channel the applicant is using.\nVisual inspection of the operator station and functionality check.\nx\nx\n16.\nBriefing/Debriefing station\nPossibility for replay at an operator or debriefing station.\nAssessment activities have to be monitored.\nx\nx\nOwn craft (2)\n17.\nDegrees of freedom\nThe simulator shall be able to visualise the motion in six degrees of freedom.\nThe degrees of freedom implemented in the simulator can be evaluated by observing the visualisation system or by instruments. Therefore, the following manoeuvres are carried out using small craft which usually move more distinctively and faster than bigger ones.\n—\nIf the horizon is swinging when looking forward during navigating along curves, the roll motion is implemented.\n—\nIf the craft’s bow raises and drops with strong longitudinal accelerations, the pitch motion is implemented.\n—\nIf the echo sounder display changes when running at higher speeds at constant water depth, the heave motion is implemented. This test implies the modelling of the squat effect.\nx\n18.\nDegrees of freedom\nThe simulator shall be able to simulate the motion in three degrees of freedom.\nThe degrees of freedom implemented in the simulator have to be evaluated.\nx\n19.\nPropulsion system\nThe simulation of all components of the propulsion system is carried out close to reality and considers all relevant influences.\nThe propulsion system has to be tested by acceleration and stopping manoeuvres during which the performance of the engine (in terms of reaction to throttle) and craft (in terms of maximum speed and time behaviour) can be observed.\nx\nx\n20.\nControl devices\nThe control device behaves close to reality regarding the rudder rate of turn and considers the most important influences.\nTo test the quality of the simulation of control devices, different investigations can be carried out. Limitations are given where it is not possible to evaluate the behaviour without protocols of state variables.\n—\nReaction: The control device is used in forward and backward motion. It is observed if changes of the craft’s direction are initiated.\n—\nRudder rate of turn: The control device is used and the rate of turn is observed on the display. It can be measured if the rate is realistic.\nx\nx\n21.\nShallow water effects\nThe effect of limited water depth on the power demand and the manoeuvring behaviour is modelled correctly in terms of quality.\nTwo types of tests are proposed which allow judging the quality regarding the consideration of the shallow water influence:\nRunning straight ahead: on different water depths the achieved maximum speed is measured, standardised with the speed on deep water and plotted versus the parameter draught by water depth (T/h). The comparison with existing data from model tests gives information about the quality of the shallow water influence in the simulation.\nTurning circle: by running a craft at constant power and a rudder angle of 20° on lateral unrestricted water, the values of speed, drift angle, rate of turn and turning circle diameter of a stationary turning craft can be recorded on stepwise reduced water depth.\nPlotting this date versus T/h allows determining how drift angle, rate of turn, speed and the diameter change with the water depth.\nx\n22.\nInfluence of current\nAt least two current measuring points on the craft exist so that the current yaw moment can be calculated.\nTests are planned to check the existence of the performance characteristic and its consideration in the simulation:\n—\nAn own craft without propulsion is put into a river with existing current. It is observed whether the craft is taken by the current. Besides, it is checked whether it is accelerated up to the current speed. If the current follows the river direction, it will be checked further whether the craft slightly rotates.\n—\nA trial with the port entrance from a river with current shows, to what extent the simulator realistically calculates a yawing moment generated by the inhomogeneous current.\nx\nx\n23.\nInfluence of wind\nThe wind influence generates forces in the horizontal plane according to the actual wind speed and direction. The wind also generates yaw and roll moments.\nTo check the quality level of the wind influence, different tests can be carried out. To be able to easily detect these effects, relatively high wind speeds are to be chosen.\nExecute the test as follows: conduct a test for both head-wind and side-wind in two different wind speeds in an area with no influence but wind. Start the wind and notice the behaviour. Stop the wind and notice the behaviour again. Start with a non-moving craft.\nx\n24.\nBank effect\nThe lateral force and yaw moment tend to change with distance to the bank and speed in a proper manner.\nFor checking the bank effect in the simulator an exercise area is needed which provides an embankment or wall on one side. The following tests have to be carried out:\n—\nThe craft is running parallel along the wall. It is checked, whether the straight motion is affected and if the craft is attracted by the wall and if the bow turned away from it.\n—\nThe distance to the bank or wall and the speed of the craft are varied and it is observed how the effects change.\nx\n25.\nCraft-craft interaction\nCraft are interacting with each other and realistic effects are computed.\nFor an entire check of the craft-craft interaction an exercise with two own craft shall be started on the simulator in a lateral unrestricted water. If this is not possible, the test may also be carried out using a traffic craft as the other craft. For a good assessment of the results, the craft shall start in parallel courses at a relatively small lateral distance.\n—\nFor both overtaking and encountering it will be checked to which extent the own craft shows attraction and rotation.\n—\nThe water depth is reduced. It shall be checked, if the interaction effects increase.\n—\nThe distance between the craft shall be increased to find out, if the effects decrease.\n—\nThe speed of the other craft shall be increased. The functional relation between passing craft effect and encountering speed shall be checked.\nx\n26.\nSquat\nBoth dynamic sinkage and trim are modelled in dependency of the speed, water depth and draught.\nThis feature is best tested in an area with lateral unrestricted water and constant water depth.\n—\nA trial run has to show if the feature ‘squat’ can be checked using echo sounders.\n—\nDifferent values for the under keel clearance at bow and stern show whether the craft trims.\n—\nWith increasing speed the functional relation between squat (difference between under keel clearance during standstill and motion) and craft speed is checked.\n—\nIt is tested whether the squat increases at constant speed but decreasing water depth.\nx\n27.\nCanal effect\nConsideration of the current back flow. The back flow is not linear to the craft speed.\nBack flow is a physical effect brought in the simulator as a resisting force executed on the craft. To test this, a craft is put in a narrow canal, the craft runs steady with constant power. The speed is then measured. The power is increased and the speed is measured. The test is repeated in open water with the same constant power (two levels) is applied. The expected effect is:\n—\nThe speed in the narrow canal is less than in open waters at the same power setting.\n—\nOn a larger power setting, the speed difference is bigger than on a lower power setting.\nx\n28.\nLock effect\nIn a lock the craft experiences the same effects as in a canal. The lock causes an additional effect due to a displacement flow caused by the craft with a large blockage factor entering the lock (the piston effect).\nThe test for the canal effect shows the back flow. This test does not have to be repeated. The piston effect can be demonstrated by:\n—\nTake the craft into the lock at a relatively high speed. The craft shall experience additional resistance after entering the lock (slow down). When the propulsion is stopped the reversing forces shall still be available and the craft shall reverse slightly.\n—\nStart in the lock, set propulsion to a fixed setting. The craft will leave the lock, experience a resisting force due to the piston effect. After leaving the lock (the craft free of the lock) the resisting force shall stop, shown by a sudden increase in speed that can be noted.\nx\n29.\nGrounding\nGrounding slows the craft down, it can be heard by a sound but does not lead in all cases to the craft stopping. Grounding is notified to the operator.\nAn exercise area with an even as well as a softly rising bottom is necessary for the check of grounding. Here, the existence of suitable depth information in the simulator itself is addressed and not the representation in the visualisation system.\nWhen grounding on a beach it has to be tested whether the craft really stops, and if so whether it stops abruptly or it slows down.\nDuring grounding, the change of the horizontal plane of the craft has to be checked with the visualisation system.\nRunning over a flat bottom at extreme shallow water, it has to be tested whether the craft grounds due to squat while the speed is increased continuously.\nFor all groundings it has to be checked, if this incident is accompanied by a sound.\nx\n30.\nGrounding\nCollision craft-shore Collision craft-craft Collision craft-bridge\nA grounding, a collision craft-shore, craft-craft, craft or bridge are notified in the simulation to the candidate and the operator.\nVisual inspection\nx\n31.\nCollision craft-shore\nCollisions craft-shore are notified in the simulation at least by a sound. The simulation slows the craft down. The calculation of the collision is carried out using a 2-dimensional shape of the craft.\nOnly for exercise areas with different objects on the shore the simulation of the collision craft-shore can be tested.\nBy sailing against different objects it can be tested whether the simulator can detect these and react on them.\nFor different objects it shall be tested whether there are certain types, for which no collision reaction occurs.\nThe sound for the collision can be tested with the audio system of the simulator, if available.\nThe observation of the collision in the visualisation system shows whether the collision occurs abruptly or if a crumble zone is simulated.\nA collision with a flat angle at low speed can show whether an elastic push is computed.\nx\n32.\nCollision craft-craft\nCollisions craft –craft are notified in the simulation at least by a sound. The simulation slows the craft down. The calculation of the collision is carried out using a 2-dimensional shape of the craft.\nUnder the precondition that it makes no difference for the own craft whether the other craft it is colliding with is another own craft or a traffic craft, different collisions can be carried out.\nIt is checked which reaction occurs on the simulator during a craft-craft collision for the own craft and whether a sound can be noticed.\nIn the instructor station, it is checked with sufficient magnification, if the outlines of the craft are used for the collision detection.\nIt is tested, if the collision occurs exactly at that moment, when the outlines touch each other.\nIt is checked, if there is a precise detection of the collision also for various craft with different shapes.\nx\n33.\nCollision craft-bridge\nCollisions craft-bridge are detected using a static height value (corresponding to a lowered wheelhouse, lowered mast). Collisions are notified in the simulation at least by a sound. The simulation slows the craft down.\nTo examine this achievement, a bridge must exist in the exercise area and Inland Electronical Navigation Chart is used.\nIt is checked whether during the passage of a bridge with not enough clearance a collision occurs and what is the outcome for the further simulation.\nIt is checked whether a safe passage is possible with sufficient reduction of the water level or increase of the draught. This shall also be checked in the visualisation system.\nDifferent runs are necessary to check the collision point on the ship, if only one exists. In this case it can also be localised whether the bridge causes a collision in the centre line or in the outer boundaries.\nx\n34.\nLifting wheelhouse\nCollision height and eye point shall be adaptable to the position of the bridge. A continuous motion of the lifting wheelhouse shall be available.\nA precondition for testing this performance feature is the availability of a typical inland waterway craft, e.g. a craft of 110 m length.\nThe basic availability of this functionality can be checked by the presence of an operating device for the change of the bridge position.\nThe function can be tested on the bridge and it shall be checked, whether arbitrary positions may be chosen and whether the motion is abrupt or with realistic speed.\nBy positioning another own craft in the vicinity it may be tested whether this functionality is also available for other craft in the visualisation system.\nIt can be observed whether also navigational lights and day signs move according to the motion of the lifting wheelhouse of the second own craft in the visualisation system.\nx\n35.\nRopes\nThe visualisation system shall display the dynamics of both the craft and the rope (e.g. slack, elasticity, weight and breaking and connections to the bollard points).\nIn an exercise area with a quay wall, mooring with a rope shall be tested.\nWhen using the rope, it shall be checked whether the rope connects to certain bollard points.\nThe breaking of a rope shall be checked by trying to stop the craft with a rope from full speed\nThe slack of a rope shall be checked by decreasing force and distance.\nx\n36.\nAnchors\nAnchors can be set and hauled in. The water depth and the dynamics of the chain are considered.\nIn an exercise area with restricted water depth and an own craft with one or several anchors, the anchor function can be examined. It is reasonable, if a constant current with a variable velocity is available.\nSetting and hauling in of the anchor is only possible if appropriate operating elements exist. It has also to be checked whether there are instruments indicating the chain length.\nIt is checked whether the speeds differ while setting and hauling in. Besides, it has to be also checked whether a suitable sound can be heard.\nBy variation of the water depth it has to be checked, if the water depth has an influence on the anchor function.\nAt low current velocity, it has to be tested whether the craft is oscillating and coming to halt after anchoring.\nAt continuous increase of the current, it has to be tested, if the anchor holds the craft.\nIf a single anchor does not hold, it has to be checked, if the craft halts with two anchors when two anchors are used.\nx\n37.\nTowing (operation between two craft)\nWhile towing, the dynamics of both craft and the rope connection are considered.\nThe exercise area for checking of the towing function can be an open sea area. Besides the towing or towed own craft, another craft (own craft or traffic craft) is necessary.\nThe basic condition for towing can be tested by bringing out a towing line between an own craft and the other craft.\nIf this is not possible, it has to be checked whether at least an alternative method for defining a force coming from a virtual tug is given.\nIt is checked whether the other craft, used as towing assistance, can accelerate the towed own craft and also initiate a yaw motion by a lateral pull.\nIt is checked whether the towing own craft can move the other craft by suitable manoeuvres and stop it and whether the other craft also can be brought into rotation by a lateral pull.\nx\nTraffic craft\n38.\nQuantity of traffic craft\nA minimum of ten traffic craft shall be available.\nTest has to show if the required quantity can be inserted in an exercise.\nx\nx\n39.\nControl of traffic craft\nThe traffic craft can follow routes with change of course and speed in a realistic way.\nThe availability of control functions has to be checked by creating a new exercise including traffic craft.\nx\nx\n40.\nMotion behaviour\nReasonably smooth motion behaviour.\nThe test procedure on control of traffic craft applies.\nx\nx\n41.\nInfluence of the wind\nThe traffic craft reacts to a given wind by showing a drift angle.\nWind applied to an exercise has to show a drift angle on the traffic craft changing with the speed and the direction of the wind.\nx\n42.\nInfluence of the current\nThe traffic craft reacts to a given current by showing a drift angle.\nCurrent applied to an exercise has to show a drift angle on the traffic craft changing with the speed and the direction of the current.\nx\nx\n43.\nImage section and size\nThe visualisation system allows a view around the horizon (360 degrees). The horizontal field of view may be obtained by a fixed view of at least 210 degrees and additional switchable view(s) for the rest of the horizon. The vertical view allows the view down to the water and up to the sky as it would be seen from the regular steering position in the wheelhouse.\nVisual inspection of the running simulator.\nx\n44.\nResolution by frame\nThe resolution reaches the resolution of the human eye. The frame rate (ideally > 50 fps, at least showing a realistic smooth picture) reveals no jerking.\nResolution has to be checked by visual inspection.\nx\n45.\nFurther detailing and display quality\nThe level of detail of the display system goes beyond a simplified representation. It shows a good view of the navigational area under all circumstances.\nThe visual model has to be checked by visual inspection.\nx\n46.\nWater surface\nCraft induced waves depend on the craft’s velocity. Water depth is considered. Wind induced waves comply with wind direction and speed.\nThe visual inspection has to show whether the craft induced waves change with the craft’s speed and whether the wind induced waves change with wind direction and speed.\nx\n47.\nSun, moon, celestial bodies\nSun and moon follow a 24-hour interval. The positions do not exactly correspond to place and date of the simulation. The night sky may consist of arbitrary stars.\nThe visual inspection has to show whether the sun, moon and celestial bodies in day, night and twilight situations can be modified\nx\n48.\nWeather\nStationary high cloud layers are represented. Furthermore rainfall, haze and fog can be displayed.\nThe visual inspection shows the required level of detail.\nx\n49.\nAmbient noise\nEngine noises are reproduced in a realistic manner.\nThe engine noises have to be tested in quiet weather and sea conditions by assessing the noises for all engine speeds. It has to be determined if the engine sound is audible and if volume level and sound are appropriate.\nx\nx\n50.\nExternal noise sources (e.g. engine noises, audible warning signals and anchor).\nSingle sound signals are played in a realistic way, but cannot be located acoustically.\nAs a first step on the wheelhouse of the stationary own craft, all available sound signals are activated one after the other. It is assessed whether the sound signals are realistic regarding sound and volume levels. In a second step, the same sound signals are activated on another craft, whereas the distance to the craft is modified. It has to be examined, if the correct signal sounds and if the volume levels are played in the right way.\nAll operable auxiliary power units (e. g. anchors) on craft’s wheelhouse are activated separately. It has to be verified whether the operating status is acoustically perceivable.\nx\n51.\nExternal noise (sound signals)\nSound signals from target craft shall be hearable.\nDuring an exercise a sound signal from a target craft shall be given.\nx\n52.\nInternal acoustic information\nAcoustic signals from bridge devices sound realistically, but are played by speakers located on the console of the simulator.\nAll acoustic signals of all available wheelhouse devices are activated one after the other. It is tested whether the signals are emitted by the devices themselves or by the speakers of the simulator and how far they sound realistic.\nx\n53.\nListening\nThe operator is able to listen to all noises from the craft’s wheelhouse.\nWithin the scope of a simulation it has to be tested whether sounds from craft’s wheelhouse are transmitted clearly and understandably and if the volume level is adjustable.\nx\n54.\nRecording\nSounds from craft’s wheelhouse are recorded synchronously with the simulation.\nAn exercise is executed including radio communication and sounds. Replay must show a proper audible recording synchronously with the replay of the simulation.\nx\n55.\nRadar conformity\nThe angular accuracy for horizontal bearing shall be in accordance with European Technical Specification (ETSI) EN 302 194. Effects related to the vertically limited opening angle are identifiable e.g. when passing bridges.\nConformity ‘vertical’: simulation of bridge passage with consideration of:\n—\nthe height of the antenna above the water surface at current draught,\n—\nthe radiation angle in accordance with the radar lobe and the trim of the craft,\n—\nthe height of the bridge between lower edge of the bridge and the water surface.\nx\nx\n56.\nResolution\nThe radar simulation shall create a realistic radar image.\nThe radar simulation shall meet the requirements of ETSI EN 302 194 [1].\nProper resolution has to be demonstrated at a distance of 1 200  m: two objects with an azimuthal distance of 30 m have to be identified as two separate objects.\nTwo objects at a distance of 1 200  m in the same direction with a distance of 15 m between them have to be identified as two different objects.\nx\nx\n57.\nShadowing caused by own or other craft\nShadowing corresponds to the trigonometric relations, but do not consider changes of the dynamic position of craft.\nThe shadowing caused by own craft has to be tested by approaching a buoy and identifying the distance when the buoy is hidden by the craft’s bow. This distance shall be realistic.\nThe shadowing caused by other craft has to be tested by putting two craft in the same direction. When putting a smaller craft behind a larger craft, the smaller craft shall not appear on radar display.\nx\nx\n58.\nSea and rain clutter\nThe adjustment of filters and their effect correspond to the magnitude of real approved devices.\nAn assessment is done by switching on and adjusting the filters.\nx\nx\n59.\nFalse echoes\nFalse echoes are generated. Additionally, the frequency of multiple echoes changes with the distance in a realistic manner.\nIn an exercise with multiple target craft, false echoes shall be visible. During the test, the observer has to look for interference and multiple echoes.\nx\nx\n60.\nWater depth\nThe bottom topography is described in detail by bathymetric contours and soundings or in any other form in a high resolution, as far as data is available.\nWhen sailing through the area to be inspected, it has to be checked whether the echo sounder shows realistic values.\nx\n61.\nCurrent\nThe current can be arbitrary defined by at least 2- dimensional vector fields with a high resolution adapted to the craft size and the area.\nThe effect of current has to be tested by letting an own craft drifting on a river. The craft shall move with the current in a realistic way.\nx\nx\n62.\nTide\nTidal data is given in a coarse spatial or temporal resolution, or both.\nThe effect of the tide on floating objects can be evaluated by simulating a preferable small floating object without any propulsion or other forces (e.g. from wind or ropes). By changing the time of day, it can be checked whether the tidal current and water level are time dependent and realistic. The water level can be directly seen at the echo sounder, and can be recorded for a full day to be compared with measured or calculated data.\nx\n63.\nWind\nFluctuations and wind vector fields can be defined and allow local modification.\nIf an anemometer is ‘installed’ on board, the instrument on the bridge shall display the relative wind speed and direction. The influence of different wind fields on the craft dynamics has to be tested.\nx\n64.\n2D/3D models of stationary objects\n2D replacements of objects are only allowed for objects far away and are not recognised.\nWhile a craft is moving in the whole simulation area that has to be validated, fixed objects are observed. It can be found, at which distance and in which way the level of detail is reduced and whether 2D-models are used.\nx\n65.\nLevel of detail of stationary objects\nA good level of detail can let appear realistic objects, although simplifications are recognisable in shape and surface.\nThe training area to be assessed will be loaded and an own craft is set. It is first necessary to examine whether all navigationally important objects are identified. The scenery must at first glance appear realistic.\nx\n66.\nDay/night models of moveable objects\nIn the darkness, any object can be illuminated. Navigationally important light sources can emit light at predetermined characteristics.\nThe training area to be assessed will be loaded and an own craft is set. Simulation time is set to midnight. It has to be tested whether all navigationally important objects are illuminated in the simulation as in reality.\nFurthermore it has to be tested whether other objects are illuminated. If the simulator software has this feature, the instructor switches the lighting of the intended items on and off.\nx\n67.\n2D/3D models of moveable objects\nTwo-dimensional objects are only used in the background (large distance) so that they are hardly apparent. Otherwise 3D-models are taken.\nThe training area to be assessed is loaded and an own craft selected. The training area is navigated completely; at the same time the available moveable objects are used, observed and evaluated to determine whether they have flat surfaces turning to the observer.\nx\n68.\nLevel of detail\nIn case of an improved level of detail, realistic objects are presented, though forms and surfaces appear in a simplified way.\nAn own craft runs within an arbitrarily selected operating area. Assessable moving objects are used. They shall appear in a realistic way.\nx\n69.\nSetting of lights and day signals\nThe lights and signal shown can be switched individually, i.e. all the lights and signals are separately stored in the database and are positioned according to the requirements of real craft and according to the applicable regulation for the craft used.\nIn close proximity to a traffic craft an own craft is used in any training area. As far as possible, the operator sets all kinds of day signals and traffic lights aboard the traffic craft. If the simulator allows, a second own craft is used instead of the traffic craft. On the second own craft all kinds of light and day signals are also set. At the steering station of the first own craft it will be checked which light and day signals are visible on both other craft.\nx\n70.\nDay/night models\nLight sources can flash according to certain characteristics.\nAn own craft navigates within an operating area. Simulation time is set to 24:00 h. All assessable moving objects are used. As far as possible, the operator switches on all available light sources installed at the objects for a visual inspection.\nx\n71.\nRadar reflectivity\nThe echo in the radar picture shall be realistic and dependent of the viewing angle.\nIt shall be checked, if reflecting objects show a realistic echo.\nx\nx\n72.\nEchoes caused by waves and precipitation\nSea state echoes are stored for typical wave pattern also covering the range of sea state levels. Echoes by precipitation are shown in a realistic manner.\nSea state echoes have to be tested by introducing different wave heights and directions. Precipitation echoes are checked.\nx\nx\n73.\nWaves\nSea state and wave direction can be adjusted; the craft moves realistically.\nIt has to be tested, if the motion of the craft varies according to the sea state. Wave directions and height have to be visible.\nx\n74.\nPrecipitation\nAll weather conditions (restriction of visibility, precipitation with the exception of lightning and cloud formation) are available resulting in a coherent picture.\nA visual inspection shall be carried out to check whether the visibility may be reduced,.\nx\n75.\nChart display\nThe Inland ECDIS in information mode has to meet the requirements of the most recent standard published by the European Union or the Central Commission for Navigation of the Rhine (Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 909/2013 or CCNR Inland ECDIS edition 2.3 or its updated edition).\nIt has to be checked, if the ECDIS software is certified and Inland Electronical Navigation Chart is used.\nx\n76.\nMeasuring units\nThe simulator uses units for European inland waterway navigation (km, km/h).\nThe displayed units have to be evaluated.\nx\nx\n77.\nLanguage options\nLanguage of examination and/or English shall apply.\nLanguage of the instruments has to be checked.\nx\nx\n78.\nQuantity of exercises\nThere shall be a possibility to create, store and run various exercises, which shall be manipulable while running.\nDifferent operations shall be performed.\nx\nx\n79.\nQuantity of own craft\nFor each bridge a different own craft can be loaded.\nDemonstration of separate exercises on multiple bridges (if applicable).\nx\n80.\nStorage data\nAll simulation values which are necessary to replay the simulation, including video and sound of the performance of the applicant have to be stored.\nA simulation run is started and the storage carried out. The simulation is reloaded and reviewed in order to determine whether all relevant data is available from the recorded simulation run.\nx\nx\n81.\nStorage of displayed examination\nThere must be an opportunity for replay in the operator room or at a debriefing station. Radio communication shall be recordable.\nThe exercise shall be replayed.\nx\nx\nII.

The principles underlying the approach adopted in the table are often capable of being extrapolated to conditions not covered by it. Decisions on fitness when a medical condition is present depend on careful clinical assessment and analysis, and the following points need to be considered whenever a decision on fitness is taken:\n•\nMedical fitness, comprising of physical and psychological fitness, means not suffering from any disease or disability which makes the person serving on board an inland craft unable to do either of the following:\na)\nexecute the tasks necessary to operate the craft,\nb)\nperform assigned duties at any time,\nc)\nperceive correctly the environment.\n•\nThe medical conditions listed are common examples of those that may render crew members unfit. The list can also be used to determine appropriate limitations on fitness. The criteria given can only provide guidance for physicians and shall not replace sound medical judgement.\n•\nThe implications for working and living on inland waters vary widely, depending on the natural history of each condition and the scope for treatment. Knowledge about the condition and an assessment of its features in the individual being examined shall be used to reach a decision on fitness.\n•\nWhere medical fitness cannot be fully demonstrated, mitigation measures and restrictions may be imposed on the condition of equivalent navigation safety. A list of mitigation measures and restrictions is added to the notes of this text. Where necessary, references to those mitigation measures and restrictions are made in the descriptions of the medical fitness criteria.\nThe table is laid out as follows:\nColumn 1: WHO International classification of diseases, 10th revision (ICD-10). Codes are listed as an aid to analysis and, in particular, international compilation of data.\nColumn 2: The common name of the condition or group of conditions, with a brief statement on its relevance to work on inland waterways.\nColumn 3: The medical fitness criteria that lead to the decision: incompatibility.\nColumn 4: The medical fitness criteria that lead to the decision: able to perform assigned duties at any time.\nThere are two appendices:\nAppendix 1 Relevant criteria for vision as meant under diagnostic code H 0059\nAppendix 2 Relevant criteria for hearing as meant under diagnostic code H 68-95.\nICD 10\ndiagnostic Codes\nCondition\nJustification for criteria\nIncompatibility to perform assigned duties at any time\n—\nexpected to be temporary (T)\n—\nexpected to be permanent (P)\nAble to perform assigned duties at any time\nA 00–B99\nINFECTIONS\nA 00 – 09\nGastrointestinal infection\nTransmission to others, recurrence\nT – If detected while onshore (current symptoms or awaiting test results on carrier status) or confirmed carrier status until elimination demonstrated\nNo symptoms affecting safe work\nA 15–16\nPulmonary TB\nTransmission to others, recurrence\nT – Positive screening test or clinical history, until investigated.\nIf infected until treatment stabilised and lack of infectivity confirmed\nP – Relapse or severe residual damage\nSuccessful completion of a course of treatment\nA 50–64\nSexually transmissible infections\nAcute impairment, recurrence\nT – If detected while onshore: until diagnosis confirmed, treatment initiated and successful completion of a course of treatment.\nP – Untreatable impairing late complications\nNo symptoms affecting safe work\nB 15\nHepatitis A\nTransmissible by food or water contamination\nT – Until jaundice resolved or exercise tolerance restored\nNo symptoms affecting safe work\nB 16–19\nHepatitis B.\nTransmissible by contact with blood or other body fluids.

Daytime visual acuity:\nAcuity of both eyes together or of the better eye with or without correction greater than or equal to 0.8. Monocular vision is accepted.\nManifest double vision (motility) which cannot be corrected is not accepted. In the event of monocular vision: normal motility of the good eye.\nRestriction 01*** may be indicated.\n2.   Eyesight at dawn and dusk:\nTo be tested in case of glaucoma retinal disorders or media opacities (e.g. cataract). Contrast sensitivity at 0.032 cd/m2 in the Absence of glare; test result 1:2.7 or better as tested with the mesotest.\n3.   Field of view:\nThe horizontal visual field shall be at least 120 degrees. The extension shall be at least 50 degrees left and right and 20 degrees up and down. No defects shall be present within a radius of the central 20 degrees.\nAt least one eye shall meet the visual acuity standard and have the visual field without pathological scotomata. Formal testing by an eye doctor is mandatory if any abnormalities are found during the initial test or in case of glaucoma or retinal dystrophy.\n4.   Colour sense for deck crew members with navigational duties:\nThe colour sense is considered to be adequate if the candidate passes the Ishihara 24 plate edition test with a maximum of two mistakes. If the candidate does not pass this test, one of the mentioned approved alternative tests have to be performed. In case of doubt, a test with an anomaloscope shall be performed. The anomaloscope quotient shall be between 0.7 and 1.4 and thus exhibit normal trichromacy.\nThe approved alternative tests to the Ishihara plates are:\na)\nVelhagen/Broschmann (result with a maximum of two mistakes);\nb)\nKuchenbecker-Broschmann (maximum of two mistakes);\nc)\nHRR (minimum result ‘mild’);\nd)\nTMC (minimum result ‘second degree’);\ne)\nHolmes Wright B (result with a maximum of 8 errors for small);\nf)\nFarnsworth Panel D 15 test (minimum result: maximum one diametrical crossing in the plot of the arrangement of colours);\ng)\nColour Assessment and Diagnosis (CAD) test (result with a maximum of four CAD units).\nHolders of boatmaster’s certificates issued in accordance with Council Directive 96/50/EC (1) whose anomaloscope quotient for colour sense is between 0,7 and 3,0 are deemed fit if their certificate has been issued before 1 April 2004.\nThe use of filter glass optical correction for colour sense, such as tinted contact lenses and glasses, is not allowed.\nAppendix 2\nRelevant hearing criteria as meant under diagnostic code H 68-95\nMinimum hearing criteria\nHearing shall be deemed adequate if the average value of the hearing loss in both ears, with or without hearing aid, does not exceed 40 dB at the frequencies 500, 1000, 2000 and 3000 Hz. If the value of 40 dB is exceeded, hearing shall nonetheless be deemed adequate if a hearing test with an audiometer which complies with ISO 8253-1:2010 or equivalent is passed.\nRestriction 02*** may be indicated.\nNotes to the table and the Appendices:\n* Recurrence rates:\nWhere the terms very low and low are used for the excess likelihood of a recurrence. Those are essentially clinical judgements but for some conditions quantitative evidence on the likelihood of recurrence is available. Where that is available, e.g. for seizure and cardiac events, it may indicate the need for additional investigations to determine an individual’s excess likelihood of a recurrence. Quantitative recurrence levels approximate to:\nvery low: recurrence rate less than 2 per cent per year;\nlow: recurrence rate 2–5 per cent per year.\n** Adult asthma:\nAsthma may persist from childhood or start over the age of 16. There is a wide range of intrinsic and external causes for asthma developing in adult life. In late entry recruits with a history of adult onset asthma the role of specific allergens, including those causing occupational asthma, shall be investigated. Less specific inducers such as cold, exercise and respiratory infection also need to be considered. All can affect fitness for work on inland waters.\nMild intermittent asthma – infrequent episodes of mild wheezing occurring less than once every two weeks, readily and rapidly relieved by beta agonist inhaler.\nMild asthma: frequent episodes of wheezing requiring use of beta agonist inhaler or the introduction of a corticosteroid inhaler. Taking regular inhaled steroids (or steroid/long acting beta agonists) may effectively eliminate symptoms and the need for use of beta agonist treatment.\nExercise-induced asthma: episodes of wheezing and breathlessness provoked by exertion especially in the cold. Episodes may be effectively treated by inhaled steroids (or steroid/long acting beta agonist) or other oral medication.\nModerate asthma: frequent episodes of wheezing despite regular use of inhaled steroid (or steroid/long acting beta agonist) treatment requiring continued use of frequent beta agonist inhaler treatment, or the addition of other medication, occasional requirement for oral steroids.\nSevere asthma: frequent episodes of wheeze and breathlessness, frequent hospitalisation, frequent use of oral steroid treatment.\n***Mitigation measures and restrictions\n01 Sight correction (glasses or contact lenses, or both) required\n02 Hearing aid required\n03 Limb prosthesis required\n04 No solo duty in the steering house\n05 Only during daylight\n06 No navigational duties allowed\n07 Limited to one craft, named ...\n08 Limited area, namely ...\n09 Limited task, namely ...\nThe mitigation measures and restrictions may be combined.

After verifying the conditions are met, the authority issues a certificate of competence which must be recognised in other EU countries.\nDirective 91/672/EEC (repealed by Directive (EU) 2017/2397 as of 18 January 2022) sets out rules for reciprocal recognition of national boat-masters’ certificates for carrying goods and passengers by inland waterway, subdivided as follows:\ngroup A: valid for certain waterways of a ‘maritime character’,\ngroup B: valid for the other waterways in the EU, with the exception of the Rhine, the Lek and the Waal.\nAdditional points:\nRhine navigation licences are valid for all EU waterways;\nreciprocal recognition may be limited to those categories of vessels for which the certificate is valid in the EU country which issued it;\nboat-masters may be required to have additional knowledge: of local conditions,when transporting dangerous substances on their territories.\nDirective 96/50/EC (repealed by Directive (EU) 2017/2397 as of 18 January 2022) harmonises the conditions for obtaining national boat-masters’ certificates, aiming to combat distortions of competition between carriers and improve safety. A certificate is issued if the following conditions are met:\na minimum age of 21;\nphysical and mental aptitude — a medical examination is required every year after age 65;\nat least 4 years’ professional experience as a member of the deck crew on an inland waterway vessel;\nsuccessful examination of professional knowledge.\nSpecial conditions apply for:\ntransporting passengers;\nnavigating with the aid of radar;\ncertain local situations.\nExemption may be granted to boat-masters operating exclusively on national waterways not linked to the navigable network of another EU country.\nDirective 2014/112/EU implements the EU agreement setting out rules governing the working time of mobile workers in EU inland waterways across the EU, meaning that Directive 2003/88/EC, the EU’s working time directive (see summary) does not apply to the sector. These rules include the following.\nWorking time is based on an 8-hour day. It must not exceed: an average of 48 hours per week over a 12-month period;2,304 hours over 48 weeks;14 hours in any 24-hour period;84 hours in any 7 days;an average of 72 hours per week over 4 months if there are more working days than rest days in the work schedule;31 consecutive days.\nSpecial conditions may apply to workers employed on seasonal passenger vessels during the season. They can be entitled to 0.2 rest days for each working day. Working time cannot exceed 12 hours in any 24-hour period or 72 hours in any 7-day period.\nRest periods must be sufficient to guarantee the health and safety of workers and not be less than 10 hours in any 24-hour period, of which at least 6 hours uninterrupted, and 84 hours in any 7-day period.\nBreaks must be given to anyone who works more than 6 hours a day.\nNight working is limited to 7 hours and a maximum of 42 hours over 7 days.\nEach worker is entitled to paid annual leave of at least 4 weeks.\nWorkers under 18 are covered by Directive 94/33/EC on the protection of young people at work (see summary); special exceptions apply for young workers over 16 years of age.\nDetailed records must be kept of each individual’s working and rest time.\nBoat-masters may require crew members to work any necessary hours in the event of an emergency. Should this happen during workers’ scheduled rest period, they will be provided with an adequate period of rest.\nAll crew members are entitled to a free annual health check.\nDirective (EU) 2017/2397 repeals Directive 91/672/EEC and Directive 96/50/EC as of 18 January 2022. It sets up a harmonised system for certifying the qualifications of persons involved in operating vessels navigating on EU inland waterways, as well the recognition of these qualifications in the EU.\nIt aims to remove barriers to labour mobility, to improve safety and to develop the skills of and offer better career prospects to all crew members, as well as helping to transition experienced workers from other sectors. Under the directive:\ndeck crew members, persons qualified to take measures in emergency situations on board passenger vessels and persons involved in refuelling vessels operating on liquefied natural gas must have an EU certificate of qualification;\nboat-masters must have specific authorisations when they: navigate on stretches of inland waterway with specific risks,navigate on inland waterways with a maritime character,navigate by radar,operate vessels powered by liquefied natural gas,sail large convoys;\nEU qualification certificates, service record books and logbooks are valid on all inland waterways in the EU;\ncertificates issued in accordance with the regulation for Rhine navigation personnel, laying down requirements identical to those of the directive, are valid on all EU waterways;\nany non-EU country may apply to the European Commission for recognition of the certificates, service record books or logbooks issued by its authorities, if they are issued on the basis of identical requirements.\nThe directive also:\nsets out minimum requirements for age, administrative compliance, competence and navigation time for the different qualifications;\nrequires all deck crew members to meet medical fitness standards;\ntakes account of the different characteristics of EU countries by allowing exemptions from some measures.\nA delegated act, Delegated Directive (EU) 2020/12, introduces standards for competences, for practical examinations, for the approval of simulators and for medical fitness.\nThe standards were drawn up by the European committee for standardisation in inland navigation (CESNI).\nThe standards for competences include the required specific competences and corresponding knowledge and skills in compliance with the essential competence requirements set out in the directive.\nThey have been adopted for:\nthe operational level (defining the key competence for boatmen and any other qualification at operational level),\nthe management level (boat-masters),\nthe specific authorisation for a boat-master sailing on inland waterways with a maritime character,\nthe specific authorisation for a boat-master sailing with the aid of radar,\npassenger navigation experts,\nliquefied natural gas experts.\nFor the operational and managements levels, the standards for competences cover the following chapters:\n1.navigation\n2.operation of craft\n3.cargo handling, stowage and passenger transport\n4.marine engineering and electrical, electronic and control engineering\n5.maintenance and repair\n6.communication\n7.health, safety and environmental protection.\nAn implementing act, Implementing Regulation (EU) 2020/182, provides models for professional qualification certificates and other documents. This includes model formats for:\nEU certificates of qualification as a boat-master, as a liquefied natural gas expert and as a passenger navigation expert,\nservice record books,\nthe single document combining EU certificates of qualification and the service record book,\npractical examination certificates,\nlogbooks.\nThe models were drawn up by CESNI.\nFor the certificates of qualification as a boat-master, as a liquefied natural gas expert and as a passenger navigation expert, there is a model for an electronic form as an alternative to a hard copy of the certificates.\nA second delegated act, Delegated Regulation (EU) 2020/473, lays down the characteristics and conditions for the use of the databases that will allow information exchange on certificates of qualification, service record books and logbooks.\nIt concerns especially users and access rights, functionalities, data and personal data protection and communication between the EU database and national registers, as well as the designation of single contact points. The EU database on crew-related documents will provide a consolidated overview of the data related to crew members’ qualifications that are kept in national registers. It will also record information on the crew members’ service record book.
