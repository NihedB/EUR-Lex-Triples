Community and the Government of the Russian Federation on cooperation in fisheries and the conservation of the living marine resources in the Baltic SeaTHE EUROPEAN COMMUNITYandTHE GOVERNMENT OF THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION,hereinafter referred to as the \"Parties\",NOTING that the Convention on Fishing and Conservation of the Living Resources in the Baltic Sea and the Belts (Gdansk Convention) of 1973 will cease to be applied on 1 January 2007,RECOGNISING that following the accession of Sweden and Finland to the Community on 1 January 1995 and Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland on 1 May 2004,

Finland, the Republic of Estonia, the Republic of Poland and the Republic of Lithuania with the Government of the Russian Federation are now managed by the Community,RECOGNISING the necessity to replace these fisheries agreements, insofar as they concern the maritime fisheries in the Baltic Sea, and the Gdansk Convention of 1973, with a new agreement between the European Community and the Government of the Russian Federation,AFFIRMING their common desire to ensure the conservation and long-term sustainable management and exploitation of the fish stocks in the Baltic Sea,GUIDED by the provisions of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea of 10 December 1982 and of the United Nations Agreement for the implementation of the provisions of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea of 10 December 1982 relating to the conservation and management of straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks of 4 December 1995,GUIDED by the Agreement on partnership

Organisation of the United Nations at the FAO Conference in 1995,TAKING INTO ACCOUNT the Johannesburg Declaration on Sustainable Development adopted by the World Summit on Sustainable Development in September 2002,CONSIDERING that some of the living marine resources of the Baltic Sea consists of straddling stocks migrating between the Exclusive Economic Zones of the two Parties and associated and dependent stocks, and that an effective conservation and sustainable exploitation of these stocks can therefore only be achieved through cooperation between the Parties in fisheries management as well as through control and enforcement,RECOGNISING that the Parties are committed to developing an ecosystem based approach to fisheries management based on the best available scientific advice and based on respecting the duties of the coastal State to ensure proper conservation and management measures for the maintenance of the living resources in the Exclusive Economic Zone in accordance with the United Nations Convention of the Law of the Sea of 10 December 1982,DESIROUS to continue their cooperation in the framework of the appropriate international fisheries organisations for the purpose of the joint conservation, sustainable exploitation and management of all relevant fishery resources and confirming the intention of the Parties to continue to develop the principles enshrined in the Gdansk Convention,RECOGNISING the importance of scientific research for the conservation, sustainable exploitation and management of fishery resources, in particular within the context of the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) and desirous to promote further cooperation in this field,HAVE AGREED AS FOLLOWS:Article 1Use of termsFor the purpose of this Agreement:(a)
