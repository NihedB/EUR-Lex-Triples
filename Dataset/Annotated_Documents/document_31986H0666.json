Aim and means of ensuring safety in existing hotels 1.The introduction of fire precautions in existing hotels is intended to: 1.1.reduce the risk of fire breaking out; 1.2.prevent the spread of flames and smoke; 1.3.ensure that all occupants can be evacuated safely; 1.4.enable the emergency services to take action. 2.In order to meet these objectives, all necessary precautions should be taken within the  establishment so that: 2.1.safe escape routes are available, are clearly indicated and remain accessible and  unobstructed; 2.2.the building's structural stability in the event of fire is guaranteed at least for as long as  is needed for the occupants to evacuate the building safely; 2.3.the presence or use of highly flammable materials in wall, ceiling or floor coverings and  interior decorations is carefully limited; 2.4.all technical equipment and appliances (electrical, gas, heating, etc.) operate safely; 2.5.appropriate systems are installed and maintained in proper working order for alerting the  occupants; 2.6.safety instructions and a plan of the premises with an indication of the escape routes are  displayed in each room normally occupied by guests or staff; 2.7.emergency fire-fighting equipment (ex- tinguishers, etc.) is provided and maintained in proper working order; 2.8.the staff is given suitable instruction and training. 3.In applying the above principles to existing commercially operated establishments which occupy  all or part of a building and which, under the name of hotel, boarding house, inn, tavern, motel or  other equivalent designation, can offer accommodation to at least 20 temporary paying guests,  Member States should take into account the technical guidelines set out in the Annex. Member States  may use different or more stringent measures than those specified in the Annex, if they achieve at  least an equivalent result. In particular, if any of the provisions of the Annex cannot be  implemented for economic, technical (including anti-seismic or architectural) reasons, the  alternative solutions adopted must ensure the overall minimum safety standard which the provisions  of that Annex are designed to establish. For establishments offering accommodation to less than 20 temporary paying guests, Member States  should adopt the most appropriate measures in order to guarantee their safety in conformity with  the principles set out under points 1 and 2 above, taking into account the size of the risk; (2)to subject hotels to periodic inspection of their conformity with the national provisions based  on the principles set out above; (3)to inform the Commission of all national measures designed to ensure that hotels meet the  requirements set out above and of the measures which they intend to take for this purpose within  the next five years. The Commission will report to the Council, within a period of six months, on  the measures taken or proposed. Done at Brussels, 22 December 1986. For the CouncilThe PresidentG.

ANNEX TECHNICAL GUIDELINES 1.ESCAPE ROUTES 1.1.General 1.1.1.The escape routes must be arranged and located in such a way as to lead independently into  the street or into an open space large enough to allow people to move away from the building and to  enable persons to evacuate the premises quickly and safely. 1.1.2.Doors, staircases, exits and routes thereto shall be indicated by standard safety signs  visible day and night. For this purpose, use shall be made in particular of the symbols for public information laid down  in ISO/DIS standard 6309.2 (11 December 1985). 1.1.3.Doors which must not be used by the public in the event of fire and which give direct access  to escape routes must, unless they are normally locked, be kept closed or be self-closing and bear  an appropriate standard sign. 1.2.Direction of opening of doors - obstruction of escape routes 1.2.1.As far as possible, doors located on escape routes must be capable of opening in the intended  direction of evacuation. 1.2.2.It must always be possible for the final exit door of an escape route to be opened easily  from the inside by a person escaping from the hotel. 1.2.3.A door opening in the intended direction of evacuation must be provided alongside a revolving  or sliding door. 1.2.4.Obstacles (stores, furniture, etc.) which might impede movement and create a risk of fire  spread must not be placed in escape routes. 1.2.5.Mirrors which might mislead occupants as to the direction of exits and stairways must not be  hung in escape routes. 1.3.Minimum number of staircases 1.3.1.Various criteria may be used to determine whether an existing hotel has a sufficient number  of staircases: 1.3.1.1.either the total number of persons that may be in the hotel, 1.3.1.2.or the distance to be covered to reach the staircases. 1.3.2.If the criterion used is the number of persons, hotels with two or more levels above the  ground which can accommodate a total of more than 50 persons must have at least two staircases. 1.3.3.If the criterion used is the distance to be covered: 1.3.3.1.the length of blind passages must not exceed 10 metres, 1.3.3.2.when the hotel has two or more stair cases the distance to be covered from any point on an  escape route to reach one of them must not exceed 35 metres. 1.3.4.An existing hotel in a building of more than three levels above the ground should generally  be provided with at least two staircases. 1.3.5.The maximum lengths of 10 metres for blind passages and 35 metres for the distance to be  covered to reach a staircase must be observed in all cases. 1.3.6.An outside staircase may be accepted as a second staircase, provided that it offers  satisfactory conditions of safety. 1.3.7.In a hotel, the existing staircases must each be sufficiently wide to allow satisfactory  evacuation of the persons likely to be on the premises. However, should it prove necessary to  provide additional staircases to make an existing hotel safe, each of these new staircases shall  have a minimum width of 0,80 metre. 2.CONSTRUCTION FEATURES 2.1.It must be ensured that the construction features of existing hotels are such that: 2.1.1.the fire resistance of the load-bearing components is adequate to ensure the structural  stability of the whole for a sufficient length of time in the event of fire; 2.1.2.the compartmentation provides a barrier to the spread of fire and smoke adequate to keep the  escape routes accessible and usable for a sufficient length of time; 2.1.3.in general, the situation must be assessed case by case on the basis of the minimum  requirements set out below. 2.2.Building structures 2.2.1.In buildings having not more than three levels above the ground, with the exception of  one-storey buildings without a basement, the fire resistance (R) of the structure of the building  must be at least 30 minutes (R 30). 2.2.2.In buildings having more than three levels above the ground, the fire resistance (R) of the  structure of the building must be at least 60 minutes (R 60). 2.3.Floors 2.3.1.In buildings having not more than three levels above the ground, the fire resistance (REI) of  the floors must be at least 30 minutes (REI 30). 2.3.2.In buildings having more than three levels above the ground, the fire resistance (REI) of the  floors must be at least 60 minutes (REI 60). 2.4.Staircase enclosures 2.4.1.In general, the staircases of existing hotels having more than two levels above the ground  must be enclosed. 2.4.1.1.The wall of the stairwell must have a fire resistance (REI) of at least 30 minutes (REI  30). 2.4.1.2.The access door sets to the stairwells must have a fire resistance (RE) of at least 30  minutes (RE 30), and the doors must be self-closing and bear an appropriate sign indicating that  they must be kept shut. 2.4.2.If the same staircase provides access both to levels accessible to the public and to the  basement, its enclosure shall be designed so as to enable the basement to be isolated from the  remainder of the stairwell. 2.4.3.The upper part of each stairwell must have a skylight or window glazed in the glass about 1  m2 in an area which, if it is not directly accessible, must be fitted with a device allowing it to  be opened easily from the ground floor. 2.4.4.The protection of the service stairwells accessible only to the staff of the establishment  shall be based on the same principles as those applicable to the stairwells to which the public  have access. 2.5.Partitions 2.5.1.In general, floor-to-ceiling partitions separating bedrooms from escape routes must have a  fire resistance (REI) of at least 30 minutes (REI 30); their access door sets must have a fire  resistance (RE) of at least 15 minutes (RE 15). 2.5.2.In general, the structures (floors, floor-to ceiling partitions and ceilings) separating  bedrooms and escape routes from areas presenting special fire hazards must have a fire resistance  (REI) of at least 60 minutes (REI 60); their door sets must have a fire resistance (RE) of at least 60 minutes (RE  60) and the doors must be self-closing and bear an appropriate sign indicating that they must be  kept shut. 3.COVERINGS AND DECORATIONS 3.1.The fire behaviour of the interior coverings and decorations of existing hotels shall be such  that they do not constitute a particular hazard by contributing to fire spread and smoke  production. 3.1.1.This requirement applies in particular to parts of the premises such as: 3.1.1.1.escape routes, especially corridors, staircases and open areas such as halls; 3.1.1.2.rooms accessible to the public and in particular to hotel guests, other than bedrooms. 3.1.2.In the areas referred to in 3.1.1 the coverings and decorations particularly concerned are: 3.1.2.1.floor coverings, 3.1.2.2.wall coverings and decorations, 3.1.2.3.ceiling coverings and decorations. 3.1.3.Since methods for testing and classifying materials as regards their reaction to fire have  not as yet been harmonized, the minimum requirements to be met by interior coverings and  decorations in existing hotels shall for the time being be expressed by reference to the national  provisions on the subject. 3.2.Escape routes 3.2.1.The material classifications in the following table are regarded as corresponding to the  minimum safety standard required for interior coverings and decorations in the escape routes of  existing hotels: >TABLE> 3.2.2.The national provisions to which this table refers are as follows: (a)Federal Republic of Germany Standard DIN 4102, Part 1 Reaction to fire of construction components and materials.

These include:\nsafe escape routes should be available, unobstructed and clearly marked;\nbuildings should be structurally stable in the event of fire — at least for as long as necessary to allow occupants to evacuate safely;\nthe presence or use of highly flammable materials in wall, ceiling and floor coverings and interior decoration is limited;\nwarning systems should be installed and in full working order;\nstaff should be given suitable instructions and training.\nTechnical guidelines\nThe annex to the recommendation contains technical guidelines. These relate in particular to:\nthe location and signage of escape routes;\nthe construction of the building;\ncoverings and decoration;\nelectricity, heating and ventilation systems;\nfirefighting, alarm and alerting equipment; and\nsafety instructions.\nInspections\nHotels should be inspected periodically.\nReport\nIn 2001, as envisaged in the recommendation, the European Commission issued a report on the measures EU countries had introduced to apply it. It noted that the impact in the different EU countries depended on the level of protection already in place and on how national law has been transposed. In some countries, national laws already included or even went beyond the recommendation’s technical guidelines or minimum requirements; however, in others, it had only been partially implemented, being applied only to the construction of new hotels or work in existing establishments.\nFollow-up\nOn a related issue, the Commission prepared a report in 2013 on the existing rules on the safety of certain services to consumers at national level across the EU and in Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein. Among other things, this looked at their respective national rules on the safety of tourism accommodation services.\nA public consultation on the safety of tourism accommodation services was conducted by the Commission in 2014. Having processed the feedback, the Commission concluded that there was no connection between the existing rules across EU countries, the absence of EU-level regulation due to subsidiarity and risks to consumers.\nFROM WHEN DOES THE RECOMMENDATION APPLY?\n              \nIt has applied since 22 December 1986.\nACT\n            \nCouncil Recommendation 86/666/EEC of 22 December 1986 on fire safety in existing hotels (OJ L 384, 31.12.1986, pp. 60–68)\nRELATED ACTS\n            \nReport from the Commission on application of the Council Recommendation of 22 December 1986 on fire safety in existing hotels (86/666/EEC) (COM(2001) 348 final of 27.6.2001)\nlast update 27.06.2016", "tags": ["hotel industry", "fire protection", "consumer protection", "occupational safety", "dissemination of information", "safety standard"], "subjects": ["Provisions under Article 235 EEC", "Consumer protection"], "split": "train", "reference_annotations": {}, "summary_annotations": {}}
