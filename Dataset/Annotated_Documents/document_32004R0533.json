It endorsed the Council's conclusions of 16 June 2003, including the Annex entitled \"The Thessaloniki Agenda for the western Balkans: moving towards European integration\". The \"Thessaloniki Agenda\" identifies ways and means of intensifying the stabilisation and association process, including the drawing-up of European partnerships.(4) Under the Thessaloniki Declaration of the EU-Western Balkans Summit of 21 June 2003, the \"Thessaloniki Agenda\" is considered to be a shared agenda between the European Union and the western Balkan countries, which they commit themselves to implement. The enriched stabilisation and association process remains the overall framework for the European course of the western Balkan countries, all the way to their accession.(5) The European partnerships for the western Balkan countries will identify priorities for action in order to support efforts to move closer to the European Union while serving as a checklist against which to measure progress. They will be adapted to the countries' specific needs and respective stages of preparation, and to the specificities of the stabilisation and association process, including regional cooperation. Informal consultations will be held with the countries and, as appropriate, with the wider international community in preparing the European partnerships.(6) The European partnerships, updated as necessary, are needed in order to assist the western Balkan countries in preparing for membership within a coherent framework and in developing plans with timetables of reforms and details in terms of measures of how they intend to address the requirements for further integration into the European Union.(7) It would be appropriate for Community assistance to focus on the challenges to be defined within the framework of the European partnerships, which will provide guidance for financial assistance, and which will observe defined principles, priorities and conditions.(8) Community assistance under the stabilisation and association process to the western Balkan countries will be provided by the relevant financial instruments, and in particular by Council Regulation (EC) No 2666/2000 of 5 December 2000 on assistance for Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia(2); accordingly, this Regulation will have no financial implications.(9) The programming of the financial resources making up Community assistance should be based on the priorities of the European partnerships and decided in accordance with the procedures set out in the relevant financial instruments.(10) Revisions of the European partnerships priorities may have a significant political impact on relations with the western Balkan countries. It is therefore appropriate for the Council to adopt the principles, priorities and conditions applicable to each European partnership.(11) The follow-up of these European partnerships is ensured within the framework of the mechanisms established under the stabilisation and association process, notably the annual reports on the stabilisation and association process,HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:Article 1European partnerships shall be established to cover Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Serbia and Montenegro including Kosovo as defined by the United Nations Security Council Resolution 1244 of 10 June 1999, (hereinafter referred to as \"the Partners\"). The European partnerships shall provide a framework covering the priorities resulting from the analysis of Partners' different situations, on which preparations for further integration into the European Union must concentrate in the light of the criteria defined by the European Council, and the progress made in implementing the stabilisation and association process including stabilisation and association agreements, where appropriate, and in particular regional cooperation.Article 2The Council shall decide by qualified majority on a proposal from the Commission, the principles, priorities and conditions to be contained in the European partnerships, as well as any subsequent adjustments.Article 3This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.Done at Brussels, 22 March 2004.For the CouncilThe PresidentB.

These partnerships set up a framework of priority action and a financial structure to improve the stability and prosperity of the region, with a view to greater integration with the EU as these countries are recognised as potential candidates for membership. As a candidate country for which membership negotiations have already begun, Croatia benefits from its own accession partnership.\nACT\nCouncil Regulation (EC) No 533/2004 of 22 March 2004 on the establishment of partnerships in the framework of the stabilisation and association process [See amending acts].\nSUMMARY\nThe European Union (EU) applies the same methodology to the countries of the Western Balkans as that followed for the new Member States and acceding countries. The enriched stabilisation and association process therefore remains the overall framework for the Western Balkans' European journey until their integration into the EU.\nPartnerships are established with Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro and Serbia, including Kosovo, as defined by the United Nations Security Council Resolution 1244 of 10 June 1999.\nCroatia, for whom membership negotiations have already begun, and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, benefit from an accession partnership, which takes into account their special status as candidate countries.\nThe partnerships aim to support the Western Balkans' efforts to implement the stabilisation and association process and to meet the accession criteria (Copenhagen criteria) with a view to their eventual EU membership. They provide a coherent structure for the reforms which are needed and a corresponding financial framework. The countries concerned are developing plans with timetables of reforms and details in terms of measures of how they intend to address the requirements for further integration into the EU.\nMechanisms of the European partnerships\nThe partnerships provide a framework covering the priorities resulting from the analysis of each of the partners' differing situations, on which preparations for further integration into the European Union must concentrate in the light of the criteria defined by the European Council, and, where appropriate, the progress made in implementing the stabilisation and association process including stabilisation and association agreements, and in particular regional cooperation.\nThe partnerships are regularly revised on the basis of the progress made by each country and any new priorities identified. The Council decides by qualified majority and on a proposal from the Commission the principles, priorities and conditions to be contained in the European partnerships, as well as any subsequent adjustments.\nThe follow-up of these European partnerships is ensured by means of the mechanisms established under the stabilisation and association process, in particular the annual reports.\nFinancial assistance\nThe partnerships also provide a framework for financial assistance aimed mainly at pursuing the priorities and objectives identified.\nCommunity assistance for the Western Balkan countries under the stabilisation and association process is provided by the relevant financial instruments, i.e. the instrument for pre-accession assistance (IAP) for the 2007-13 period which replaces the 2000-06 CARDS Programme.\nContext\nThe Feira European Council in June 2000 recognised that all the countries of the Western Balkans are potential candidates for membership of the EU. This prospect requires fulfilment of the political, economic and institutional criteria laid down at the Copenhagen European Council in June 1993 (Articles 6 and 49 of the EU Treaty), as recognised by the Zagreb Declaration of November 2000 between the EU and the countries participating in the stabilisation and association process and as reaffirmed by the Thessaloniki European Council of June 2003.\nThe \"Thessaloniki Agenda\" of June 2003 identifies ways and means of intensifying the stabilisation and association process, including the drawing-up of partnerships.\nCroatia and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia are both candidate countries - they were accorded this status in 2004 and 2005 respectively. Furthermore, the Member States began membership negotiations with Croatia on 3 October 2005.\nReferences\nAct\nEntry into force - Date of expiry\nDeadline for transposition in the Member States\nOfficial Journal\nRegulation (EC) No 533/2004\n27.3.2004\n-\nOJ L 86 of 24.3.2004\nAmending act(s)\nEntry into force\nDeadline for transposition in the Member States\nOfficial Journal\nRegulation (EC) No 269/2006\n20.2.2006\n-\nOJ L 47 of 17.2.2006\nRegulation (EC) No 229/2008\n18.3.2008\n-\nOJ L 73 of 15.3.2008\nLast updated: 31.08.2011", "tags": ["accession to the European Union", "European integration", "regional cooperation", "Western Balkans", "European association", "stabilisation and association agreement"], "subjects": ["Association Agreement", "Cooperation", "External relations"], "split": "train", "reference_annotations": {}, "summary_annotations": {}}
