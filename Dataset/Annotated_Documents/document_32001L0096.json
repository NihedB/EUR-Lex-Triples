The protection of the safety of bulk carriers can be enhanced through the adoption of measures aimed at reducing the risk of structural damage and losses due to improper loading and unloading operations.(3) At international level, the International Maritime Organisation (the \"IMO\"), through a number of Assembly Resolutions, has adopted recommendations on the safety of bulk carriers addressing ship/port interface issues in general and loading and unloading operations in particular.(4) By Assembly Resolution A.862(20), the IMO adopted a Code of Practice for the Safe Loading and Unloading of Bulk Barriers (\"the BLU Code\"), and urged contracting governments to implement this Code at the earliest possible opportunity and to inform IMO of any non-compliance. In the Resolution, the IMO further urged contracting governments in whose territories solid bulk cargo loading and unloading terminals are situated to introduce laws so that a number of key principles necessary for the implementation of this Code could be enforced.(5) The impact of loading and unloading operations on bulk carrier safety, in view of the global character of trade in dry cargo in bulk, has transboundary implications. The development of action to prevent the foundering of bulk carriers due to improper loading and unloading practices is therefore best done at Community level by establishing harmonised requirements and procedures to implement the IMO recommendations laid down in the Assembly Resolution A.862(20) and the BLU Code.(6) In view of the subsidiarity principle set out in Article 5 of the Treaty, a Directive is the appropriate legal instrument as it provides a framework for the Member States' uniform and compulsory application of the requirements and procedures for the safe loading and unloading of bulk carriers, while leaving each Member State the right to decide which implementation tools best fit its internal system. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, this Directive does not go beyond what is necessary for the objectives pursued.(7) The safety of bulk carriers and their crews can be enhanced by reducing the risks of improper loading and unloading at dry bulk cargo terminals. This can be implemented by establishing harmonised procedures for cooperation and communication between ship and terminal and by laying down suitability requirements for ships and terminals.(8) In the interests of enhancing bulk carrier safety and avoiding distortion of competition, the harmonised procedures and suitability criteria should apply to all bulk carriers, irrespective of the flag they fly, and to all terminals in the Community at which, under normal circumstances, such carriers call for the purpose of loading or unloading solid bulk cargoes.(9) Bulk carriers calling at terminals for the loading or unloading of solid bulk cargoes should be suitable for that purpose. Equally, terminals should also be suitable for receiving and loading or unloading visiting bulk carriers. For these purposes suitability criteria have been established in the BLU Code.(10) Terminals should, in the interests of enhancing cooperation and communication with the ship's master on matters relating to the loading and unloading of solid bulk cargoes, appoint a terminal representative responsible for such operations in the terminal and make information books with the terminal's and port's requirements available to the masters. There are, for this purpose, provisions in the BLU Code.(11) The development, implementation and maintenance of a quality management system by the terminals would ensure that the cooperation and communication procedures and the actual loading and unloading by the terminal are planned and executed in accordance with a harmonised framework that is internationally recognised and auditable. In view of its international recognition, the quality management system should be compatible with the ISO 9000 series of standards adopted by the International Standardisation Organisation. To allow new terminals sufficient time to achieve the relevant certification, it is important to ensure that a temporary authorisation to operate is available to them for a limited period of time.(12) For the purpose of ensuring that loading and unloading operations are carefully prepared, agreed and conducted in order to avoid endangering the safety of the ship or crew, the responsibilities of the master and the terminal representative should be laid down. To this end, relevant provisions can be found in the 1974 International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (1974 SOLAS Convention), IMO Assembly Resolution A.862(20) and the BLU Code. For the same purpose, procedures for the preparation, agreement and conduct of loading or unloading operations can be based on the provisions of those international instruments.(13) In the general interests of the Community, in deflecting sub-standard shipping from its ports, the terminal representative should notify apparent deficiencies on board a bulk carrier which could prejudice the safety of loading or unloading operations.(14) It is necessary that the competent authorities of the Member States prevent or halt loading or unloading operations whenever they have clear indications that ship or crew safety is endangered by these operations. The authorities should also intervene in the interests of safety in the event of disagreement between the master and the terminal representative as to the application of these procedures. The safety-related action of the competent authorities should not be dependent on commercial interests related to terminals.(15) It is necessary to lay down procedures for the purpose of reporting damage to ships incurred during loading or unloading operations to the appropriate bodies, such as the relevant classification societies, and of repairing such damage if necessary. Where such damage could impair the safety or seaworthiness of the ship, the decision as to the necessity and urgency of repairs should be taken by the port State control authorities in consultation with the administration of the flag State. In view of the technical expertise necessary to take such a decision, the authorities should have the right to call upon a recognised organisation to inspect the damage and to advise them on any need for repairs.(16) Enforcement of this Directive should be enhanced by efficient monitoring and verification procedures in the Member States. Reporting the results of this monitoring effort will provide valuable information on the effectiveness of the harmonised requirements and procedures laid down in this Directive.(17) In IMO Assembly Resolution A.797(19) of 23 November 1995 on the safety of ships carrying solid bulk cargoes it is requested that port State authorities submit confirmation that loading and unloading terminals for solid bulk cargoes comply with the IMO Codes and recommendations on ship/shore cooperation. Notification of the adoption of this Directive to the IMO will provide an appropriate response to this request and a clear signal to the international maritime community that the Community is committed to supporting the efforts undertaken at international level to enhance the safe loading and unloading of bulk carriers.(18) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Directive should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission(4).(19) It should be possible to amend certain provisions of this Directive in accordance with that procedure, so as to bring them into line with international and Community instruments adopted, amended or entering into force after the entry into force of this Directive and for the implementation of the procedures laid down in this Directive, without broadening its scope.(20) Council Directive 89/391/EEC of 12 June

Before solid bulk cargoes are loaded or unloaded, the master shall agree with the terminal representative on the loading or unloading plan in accordance with the provisions of Regulation VI/7.3 of the 1974 SOLAS Convention. The loading or unloading plan shall be prepared in the form laid down in Appendix 2 of the BLU Code, it shall contain the IMO number of the bulk carrier concerned, and the master and the terminal representative shall confirm their agreement to the plan by signing it.Any change to the plan, which according to either party may affect the safety of the vessel or crew, shall be prepared, accepted and agreed by both parties in the form of a revised plan.The agreed loading or unloading plan and any subsequent agreed revisions shall be kept by the ship and the terminal for a period of six months for the purpose of any necessary verification by the competent authorities.2. Before loading or unloading is commenced, the ship/shore safety checklist shall be completed and signed jointly by the master and the terminal representative in accordance with the guidelines of Appendix 4 of the BLU Code.3. An effective communication between the ship and the terminal shall be established and maintained at all times, capable of responding to requests for information on the loading or unloading process and to ensure prompt compliance should the master or the terminal representative order the loading or unloading operations to be suspended.4. The master and the terminal representative shall conduct the loading or unloading operations in accordance with the agreed plan. The terminal representative shall be responsible for the loading or unloading of the solid bulk cargo as regards the hold order, quantity and rate of loading or unloading stated on that plan. He shall not deviate from the agreed loading or unloading plan, otherwise than by prior consultation and written agreement with the master.5. On completion of the loading or unloading, the master and the terminal representative shall agree in writing that the loading or unloading has been done in accordance with the loading or unloading plan, including any agreed changes. In the case of unloading, such agreement shall include a record that the cargo holds have been emptied and cleaned to the master's requirements and shall record any damage suffered by the ship and any repairs carried out.Article 9Role of the competent authorities1. Without prejudice to the rights and obligations of the master provided under Regulation VI/7.7 of the 1974 SOLAS Convention, Member States shall ensure that their competent authorities prevent or halt the loading or unloading of solid bulk cargoes whenever they have clear indications that the safety of the ship or crew would be endangered thereby.2. In cases where the competent authority is informed of disagreement between the master and the terminal representative as to the application of the procedures provided for in Article 8, the competent authority shall intervene where this is required in the interests of safety and/or the marine environment.Article 10Repair of damage incurred during loading or unloading1. If damage to the ship's structure or equipment occurs during loading or unloading, it shall be reported by the terminal representative to the master and, if necessary, repaired.2. If the damage could impair the structural capability or watertight integrity of the hull, or the ship's essential engineering systems, the administration of the flag State, or an organisation recognised by it and acting on its behalf, and the port State control authority shall be informed by the terminal representative and/or the master. The decision as to whether immediate repair is necessary or whether it can be deferred shall be taken by the port State control authority, due account being taken of the opinion, if any, of the administration of the flag State, or the organisation recognised by it and acting on its behalf, and of the opinion of the master. Where immediate repair is considered necessary, it shall be carried out to the satisfaction of the master and the competent authority before the ship leaves the port.3. For the purpose of taking the decision referred to in paragraph 2, a port State control authority may rely upon a recognised organisation to undertake the inspection of the damage and to advise on the necessity of carrying-out repairs or their deferral.4. This Article applies without prejudice to Directive 95/21/EC.Article 11Verification and reporting1. Member States shall regularly verify that terminals comply with the requirements of Article 5(1), Article 7(2) and Article 8.

For that purpose the terminal representative shall advise the master of the nominal tonnage contained on the terminal's conveyor system and any requirements for clearing the conveyor system on completion of the loading.10. in the case of unloading, give the master the maximum warning when it is intended to increase, or to reduce, the number of unloading heads used and advise the master when unloading is considered to be completed from each hold.11. ensure that no hot work is carried out on board or in the vicinity of the ship while the ship is alongside the berth, except with the permission of the master and in accordance with any requirements of the competent authority.", "summary": "Loading and unloading of bulk carriers\nLoading and unloading of bulk carriers\nSUMMARY OF:\nDirective 2001/96/EC — EU requirements and procedures for the safe loading and unloading of bulk carriers\nSUMMARY\nWHAT DOES THE DIRECTIVE DO?\nIt increases safety procedures for bulk carriers loading and unloading their solid bulk cargo in EU ports.\nIt aims to reduce the risk of damage to ships during loading and unloading.\nIt harmonises standards for ships and for terminals, and for cooperation and communication between them.\nKEY POINTS\nThe legislation applies to EU terminals* and bulk carriers, irrespective of their flag, that use these to load and unload solid bulk cargo.\nEU countries must ensure\nterminal operators are confident the visiting carriers and their own terminals comply with the legislation\nloading and unloading plans in line with the 1974 SOLAS Convention are agreed between the shipmaster and the terminal representative before any work begins\ntheir own authorities prevent or halt any operation it they believe it would endanger the safety of the ship or crew\nregular inspections, including unannounced visits, of loading and unloading operations are carried out to verify compliance with the legislation. The results of the inspections are forwarded to the European Commission every 3 years.\nShipmasters are responsible at all times for the safe loading and unloading of the carriers under their command.\nTerminal representatives must provide the master with relevant information, such as the name of the berth, and the equipment available where the operation will take place, before the vessel arrives.\nTerminal representatives must report to the harbour master any damage to a vessel or its equipment during loading or unloading. If necessary, it should be repaired.\nFROM WHEN DOES THE DIRECTIVE APPLY?\n              \nIt applies from 5 February 2002.
