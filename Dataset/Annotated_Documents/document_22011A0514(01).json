If, as a result of the reduction or elimination of a customs duty under this Agreement, originating goods of a Party are being imported into the territory of the other Party in such increased quantities, in absolute terms or relative to domestic production, and under such conditions as to cause or threaten to cause serious injury to a domestic industry producing like or directly competitive goods, the importing Party may adopt measures provided for in paragraph 2 in accordance with the conditions and procedures laid down in this Section.2. The importing Party may take a bilateral safeguard measure which:(a) suspends further reduction of the rate of customs duty on the good concerned provided for under this Agreement; or(b) increases the rate of customs duty on the good to a level which does not exceed the lesser of:(i) the MFN applied rate of customs duty on the good in effect at the time the measure is taken; or(ii) the base rate of customs duty specified in the Schedules included in Annex 2-A (Elimination of Customs Duties) pursuant to Article 2.5.2 (Elimination of Customs Duties).Article 3.2Conditions and limitations1.

The duration of any provisional measure shall not exceed 200 days, during which time the Party shall comply with the requirements of Articles 3.2.2 and 3.2.3. The Party shall promptly refund any tariff increases if the investigation described in Article 3.2.2 does not result in a finding that the requirements of Article 3.1 are met.

The duty under paragraph 1 shall not exceed the lesser of the prevailing MFN applied rate, or the MFN applied rate of duty in effect on the day immediately preceding the date this Agreement enters into force, or the tariff rate set out in the Party’s Schedule included in Annex 3.3. The duties each Party applies under paragraph 1 shall be set according to its Schedules included in Annex 3.4.

Any supplies of the goods in question which were en route on the basis of a contract made before the additional duty is imposed under paragraphs 1 through 4 shall be exempted from any such additional duty, provided that they may be counted in the volume of imports of the goods in question during the following year for the purpose of triggering paragraph 1 in that year.SECTION CGlobal safeguard measuresArticle 3.7Global safeguard measures1. Each Party retains its rights and obligations under Article XIX of GATT 1994 and the Agreement on Safeguards. Unless otherwise provided in this Article, this Agreement does not confer any additional rights or impose any additional obligations on the Parties with regard to measures taken under Article XIX of GATT 1994 and the Agreement on Safeguards.2. At the request of the other Party, and provided it has a substantial interest, the Party intending to take safeguard measures shall provide immediately ad hoc written notification of all pertinent information on the initiation of a safeguard investigation, the provisional findings and the final findings of the investigation.3.

Neither Party may apply, with respect to the same good, at the same time:(a) a bilateral safeguard measure in accordance with Article 3.1; and(b) a measure under Article XIX of GATT 1994 and the Agreement on Safeguards.5. Neither Party may have recourse to Chapter Fourteen (Dispute Settlement) for any matter arising under this Section.SECTION DAnti-dumping and countervailing dutiesArticle 3.8General provisions1. Except as otherwise provided for in this Chapter, the Parties maintain their rights and obligations under Article VI of GATT 1994, the Agreement on Implementation of Article VI of GATT 1994, contained in Annex 1A to the WTO Agreement (hereinafter referred to as the \"Anti-Dumping Agreement\") and the Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures, contained in Annex 1A to the WTO Agreement (hereinafter referred to as the \"SCM Agreement\").2. The Parties agree that anti-dumping and countervailing duties should be used in full compliance with the relevant WTO requirements and should be based on a fair and transparent system as regards proceedings affecting goods originating in the other Party. For this purpose the Parties shall ensure, immediately after any imposition of provisional measures and in any case before the final determination, full and meaningful disclosure of all essential facts and considerations which form the basis for the decision to apply measures, without prejudice to Article 6.5 of the Anti-Dumping Agreement and Article 12.4 of the SCM Agreement. Disclosures shall be made in writing, and allow interested parties sufficient time to make their comments.3. In order to ensure the maximum efficiency in handling anti-dumping or countervailing duty investigations, and in particular considering the adequate right of defence, the use of English shall be accepted by the Parties for documents filed in anti-dumping or countervailing duty investigations. Nothing in this paragraph shall prevent Korea from requesting a clarification written in Korean if:(a) the meaning of the documents filed is not deemed reasonably clear by Korea’s investigating authorities for the purposes of the anti-dumping or countervailing duty investigation; and(b) the request is strictly limited to the part which is not reasonably clear for the purposes of the anti-dumping or countervailing duty investigation.4. Provided that it does not unnecessarily delay the conduct of the investigation, interested parties shall be granted the opportunity to be heard in order to express their views during the anti-dumping or countervailing duty investigations.Article 3.9Notification1. After receipt by a Party’s competent authorities of a properly documented anti-dumping application with respect to imports from the other Party, and no later than 15 days before initiating an investigation, the Party shall provide written notification to the other Party of its receipt of the application.2. After receipt by a Party’s competent authorities of a properly documented countervailing duty application with respect to imports from the other Party, and before initiating an investigation, the Party shall provide written notification to the other Party of its receipt of the application and afford the other Party a meeting to consult with its competent authorities regarding the application.Article 3.10Consideration of public interestsThe Parties shall endeavour to consider the public interests before imposing an anti-dumping or countervailing duty.Article 3.11Investigation after termination resulting from a reviewThe Parties agree to examine, with special care, any application for initiation of an anti-dumping investigation on a good originating in the other Party and on which anti-dumping measures have been terminated in the previous 12 months as a result of a review. Unless this pre-initiation examination indicates that the circumstances have changed, the investigation shall not proceed.Article 3.12Cumulative assessmentWhen imports from more than one country are simultaneously subject to anti-dumping or countervailing duty investigation, a Party shall examine, with special care, whether the cumulative assessment of the effect of the imports of the other Party is appropriate in light of the conditions of competition between the imported goods and the conditions of competition between the imported goods and the like domestic goods.Article 3.13De-minimis standard applicable to review1. Any measure subject to a review pursuant to Article 11 of the Anti-Dumping Agreement shall be terminated where it is determined that the likely recurring dumping margin is less than the de-minimis threshold set out in Article 5.8 of the Anti-Dumping Agreement.2. When determining individual margins pursuant to Article 9.5 of the Anti-Dumping Agreement, no duty shall be imposed on exporters or producers in the exporting Party for which it is determined, on the basis of representative export sales, that the dumping margin is less than the de-minimis threshold set out in Article 5.8 of the Anti-Dumping Agreement.Article 3.14Lesser duty ruleShould a Party decide to impose an anti-dumping or countervailing duty, the amount of such duty shall not exceed the margin of dumping or countervailable subsidies, and it should be less than the margin if such lesser duty would be adequate to remove the injury to the domestic industry.Article 3.15Dispute settlementNeither Party may have recourse to Chapter Fourteen (Dispute Settlement) for any matter arising under this Section.SECTION EInstitutional provisionsArticle 3.16Working Group on Trade Remedy Cooperation1.

In particular, the Parties agree(a) to fulfil the transparency obligations of the Parties as indicated in the TBT Agreement;(b) to use relevant international standards as a basis for technical regulations including conformity assessment procedures, except when such international standards would be an ineffective or inappropriate means for the fulfilment of the legitimate objectives pursued, and where international standards have not been used as a basis, to explain on request to the other Party the reasons why such standards have been judged inappropriate or ineffective for the aim pursued;(c) when a Party has adopted or is proposing to adopt a technical regulation, to provide the other Party on request with available information regarding the objective, legal basis and rationale for the technical regulation;(d) to establish mechanisms for providing improved information on technical regulations (including through a public website) to the other Party’s economic operators, and in particular to provide written information, and as appropriate and available, written guidance on compliance with their technical regulations to the other Party or its economic operators upon request without undue delay;(e) to take appropriate consideration of the other Party’s views where a part of the process of developing a technical regulation is open to public consultation, and on request to provide written responses to the comments made by the other Party;(f) when making notifications in accordance with the TBT Agreement, to allow at least 60 days following the notification for the other Party to provide comments in writing on the proposal; and(g) to leave sufficient time between the publication of technical regulations and their entry into force for economic operators of the other Party to adapt, except where urgent problems of safety, health, environmental protection or national security arise or threaten to arise, and where practicable to give appropriate consideration to reasonable requests for extending the comment period.2. Each Party shall ensure that economic operators and other interested persons of the other Party are allowed to participate in any formal public consultative process concerning development of technical regulations, on terms no less favourable than those accorded to its own legal or natural persons.3. Each Party shall endeavour to apply technical regulations uniformly and consistently throughout its territory. If Korea notifies the EU Party of an issue of trade that appears to arise from variations in the legislation of the Member States of the European Union that Korea considers not to be compatible with the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, the EU Party will make its best endeavours to address the issue in a timely manner.Article 4.5Standards1. The Parties reconfirm their obligations under Article 4.1 of the TBT Agreement to ensure that their standardising bodies accept and comply with the Code of Good Practice for the Preparation and Adoption of Standards in Annex 3 to the TBT Agreement, and also have regard to the principles set out in Decisions and Recommendations adopted by the Committee since 1 January 1995, G/TBT/1/rev.8, 23 May 2002, Section IX (Decision of the Committee on Principles for the Development of International Standards, Guides and Recommendations with relation to Articles 2, 5 and Annex 3 of the Agreement), issued by the WTO Committee on Technical Barriers to Trade.2. The Parties undertake to exchange information on:(a) their use of standards in connection with technical regulations;(b) each other’s standardisation processes, and the extent of use of international standards as a base for their national and regional standards; and(c) cooperation agreements implemented by either Party on standardisation, for example information on standardisation issues in free trade agreements with third parties.Article 4.6Conformity assessment and accreditation1. The Parties recognise that a broad range of mechanisms exist to facilitate the acceptance of the results of conformity assessment procedures conducted in the territory of the other Party, including:(a) agreements on mutual acceptance of the results of conformity assessment procedures with respect to specific technical regulations conducted by bodies located in the territory of the other Party;(b) accreditation procedures for qualifying conformity assessment bodies located in the territory of the other Party;(c) governmental designation of conformity assessment bodies located in the territory of the other Party;(d) recognition by a Party of the results of conformity assessment procedures conducted in the territory of the other Party;(e) voluntary arrangements between conformity assessment bodies in the territory of each Party; and(f) the importing Party’s acceptance of a supplier’s declaration of conformity.2. Having regard in particular to those considerations, the Parties undertake:(a) to intensify their exchange of information on these and similar mechanisms with a view to facilitating the acceptance of conformity assessment results;(b) to exchange information on conformity assessment procedures, and in particular on the criteria used to select appropriate conformity assessment procedures for specific products;(c) to exchange information on accreditation policy, and to consider how to make best use of international standards for accreditation, and international agreements involving the Parties’ accreditation bodies, for example, through the mechanisms of the International Laboratory Accreditation Cooperation and the International Accreditation Forum; and(d) in line with Article 5.1.2 of the TBT Agreement, to require conformity assessment procedures that are not more strict than necessary.3. Principles and procedures established in respect of development and adoption of technical regulations under Article 4.4 with a view to avoiding unnecessary obstacles to trade and ensuring transparency and non-discrimination shall also apply in respect of mandatory conformity assessment procedures.Article 4.7Market surveillanceThe Parties undertake to exchange views on market surveillance and enforcement activities.Article 4.8Conformity assessment feesThe Parties reaffirm their obligation under Article 5.2.5 of the TBT Agreement, that fees for mandatory conformity assessment of imported products shall be equitable in relation to the fees charged for conformity assessment of like products of national origin or originating in other countries, taking into account communication, transportation and other costs arising from differences between location of facilities of the applicant and the conformity assessment body, and undertake to apply this principle in the areas covered by this Chapter.Article 4.9Marking and labelling1. The Parties note the provision of paragraph 1 of Annex 1 of the TBT Agreement, that a technical regulation may include or deal exclusively with marking or labelling requirements, and agree that where their technical regulations contain mandatory marking or labelling, they will observe the principles of Article 2.2 of the TBT Agreement, that technical regulations should not be prepared with a view to, or with the effect of, creating unnecessary obstacles to international trade, and should not be more trade restrictive than necessary to fulfil a legitimate objective.2. In particular, the Parties agree that where a Party requires mandatory marking or labelling of products:(a) the Party shall endeavour to minimise its requirements for marking or labelling other than marking or labelling relevant to consumers or users of the product. Where labelling for other purposes, for example, for fiscal purposes is required, such a requirement shall be formulated in a manner that is not more trade restrictive than necessary to fulfil a legitimate objective;(b) the Party may specify the form of labels or markings, but shall not require any prior approval, registration or certification in this regard. This provision is without prejudice to the right of the Party to require prior approval of the specific information to be provided on the label or marking in the light of the relevant domestic regulation;(c) where the Party requires the use of a unique identification number by economic operators, the Party shall issue such number to the economic operators of the other Party without undue delay and on a non-discriminatory basis;(d) the Party shall remain free to require that the information on the marks or labels be in a specified language. Where there is an international system of nomenclature accepted by the Parties, this may also be used. The simultaneous use of other languages shall not be prohibited, provided that, either the information provided in the other languages shall be identical to that provided in the specified language, or that the information provided in the additional language shall not constitute a deceptive statement regarding the product; and(e) the Party shall, in cases where it considers that legitimate objectives under the TBT Agreement are not compromised thereby, endeavour to accept non-permanent or detachable labels, or marking or labelling in the accompanying documentation rather than physically attached to the product.Article 4.10Coordination mechanism1. The Parties agree to nominate TBT Coordinators and to give appropriate information to the other Party when their TBT Coordinator changes. The TBT Coordinators shall work jointly in order to facilitate the implementation of this Chapter and cooperation between the Parties in all matters pertaining to this Chapter.2. The Coordinator’s functions shall include:(a) monitoring the implementation and administration of this Chapter, promptly addressing any issue that either Party raises related to the development, adoption, application or enforcement of standards, technical regulations and conformity assessment procedures, and upon either Party’s request, consulting on any matter arising under this Chapter;(b) enhancing cooperation in the development and improvement of standards, technical regulations and conformity assessment procedures;(c) arranging the establishment of regulatory dialogues as appropriate in accordance with Article 4.3;(d) arranging the establishment of working groups, which may include or consult with non-governmental experts and stakeholders as mutually agreed by the Parties;(e) exchanging information on developments in non-governmental, regional and multilateral fora related to standards, technical regulations and conformity assessment procedures; and(f) reviewing this Chapter in light of any developments under the TBT Agreement.3.

Geographical indications referred to in Articles 10.18 and 10.19 shall be protected against:(a) the use of any means in the designation or presentation of a good that indicates or suggests that the good in question originates in a geographical area other than the true place of origin in a manner which misleads the public as to the geographical origin of the good;(b) the use of a geographical indication identifying a good for a like good [56] not originating in the place indicated by the geographical indication in question, even where the true origin of the good is indicated or the geographical indication is used in translation or transcription or accompanied by expressions such as \"kind\", \"type\", \"style\", \"imitation\" or the like; and(c) any other use which constitutes an act of unfair competition within the meaning of Article 10 bis of the Paris Convention.2. This Agreement shall in no way prejudice the right of any person to use, in the course of trade, that person’s name or the name of that person’s predecessor in business, except where such name is used in such a manner as to mislead consumers.3. If geographical indications of the Parties are homonymous, protection shall be granted to each indication provided that it has been used in good faith. The Working Group on Geographical Indications shall decide the practical conditions of use under which the homonymous geographical indications will be differentiated from each other, taking into account the need to ensure equitable treatment of the producers concerned and that consumers are not misled. If a geographical indication protected through this Agreement is homonymous with a geographical indication of a third country, each Party shall decide the practical conditions of use under which the homonymous geographical indications will be differentiated from each other, taking into account the need to ensure equitable treatment of the producers concerned and that consumers are not misled.4. Nothing in this Agreement shall oblige the European Union or Korea to protect a geographical indication which is not or ceases to be protected in its country of origin or which has fallen into disuse in that country.5. The protection of a geographical indication under this Article is without prejudice to the continued use of a trademark which has been applied for, registered or established by use, if that possibility is provided for by the legislation concerned, in the territory of a Party before the date of the application for protection or recognition of the geographical indication, provided that no grounds for the trademark’s invalidity or revocation exist in the legislation of the Party concerned. The date of application for protection or recognition of the geographical indication is determined in accordance with Article 10.23.2.Article 10.22Enforcement of protectionThe Parties shall enforce the protection provided for in Articles 10.18 through 10.23 on their own initiative by appropriate intervention of their authorities. They shall also enforce such protection at the request of an interested party.Article 10.23Relationship with trademarks1. The registration of a trademark that corresponds to any of the situations referred to in Article 10.21.1 in relation to a protected geographical indication for like goods, shall be refused or invalidated by the Parties, provided an application for registration of the trademark is submitted after the date of application for protection or recognition of the geographical indication in the territory concerned.2. For the purposes of paragraph 1:(a) for geographical indications referred to in Articles 10.18 and 10.19, the date of application for protection or recognition shall be the date when this Agreement enters into force; and(b) for geographical indications referred to in Article 10.24, the date of application for protection or recognition shall be the date of a Party’s receipt of a request by the other Party to protect or recognise a geographical indication.Article 10.24Addition of geographical indications for protection [57]1. The European Union and Korea agree to add geographical indications to be protected to the Annexes 10-A and 10-B in accordance with the procedure set out in Article 10.25.2. The European Union and Korea agree to process, without undue delay, the other’s requests for adding geographical indications to be protected to the Annexes.3. A name may not be registered as a geographical indication where it conflicts with the name of a plant variety, including a grape variety, or an animal breed and as a result is likely to mislead the consumer as to the true origin of the product.Article 10.25Working Group on Geographical Indications1. The Working Group on Geographical Indications established pursuant to Article 15.3.1 (Working Groups) shall meet, as mutually agreed or upon request of a Party, for the purpose of intensifying cooperation between the Parties and dialogue on geographical indications. The Working Group may make recommendations and adopt decisions by consensus.2. The location of the meeting shall alternate between the Parties. The Working Group shall meet at a time and a place and in a manner which may include by videoconference, mutually determined by the Parties, but no later than 90 days after the request.3.

The Working Group shall also ensure the proper functioning of this Sub-section and may consider any matter related to its implementation and operation. In particular, it shall be responsible for:(a) exchanging information on legislative and policy developments on geographical indications;(b) exchanging information on individual geographical indications for the purpose of considering their protection in accordance with this Agreement; and(c) exchanging information to optimise the operation of this Agreement.5. The Working Group may discuss any matter of mutual interest in the area of geographical indications.Article 10.26Individual applications for protection of geographical indicationsThe provisions of this Sub-section are without prejudice to the right to seek recognition and protection of a geographical indication under the relevant legislation of the European Union or Korea.Sub-section DDesignsArticle 10.27Protection of registered designs1.

The duration of protection available in the Parties following registration shall amount to at least 15 years.2. The duration of protection available in the European Union and Korea for unregistered appearance shall amount to at least three years.Article 10.31Exceptions1. The European Union and Korea may provide limited exceptions to the protection of designs, provided that such exceptions do not unreasonably conflict with the normal exploitation of protected designs and do not unreasonably prejudice the legitimate interests of the owner of the protected design, taking account of the legitimate interests of third parties.2. Design protection shall not extend to designs dictated essentially by technical or functional considerations.3. A design right shall not subsist in a design which is contrary to public policy or to accepted principles of morality.Article 10.32Relationship with copyrightA design protected by a design right registered in the European Union or in Korea in accordance with this Sub-section shall also be eligible for protection under the law of copyright applicable in the territory of the Parties as from the date on which the design was created or fixed in any form [63].Sub-section EPatentsArticle 10.33International agreementThe Parties shall make all reasonable efforts to comply with articles 1 through 16 of the Patent Law Treaty (2000).Article 10.34Patents and public health1.

The Parties shall guarantee the confidentiality, non-disclosure of and non-reliance on data submitted for the purpose of obtaining an authorisation to put a pharmaceutical product on the market.2. For that purpose, the Parties shall ensure in their respective legislation that data, as referred to in Article 39 of the TRIPS Agreement, concerning safety and efficacy, submitted for the first time by an applicant to obtain a marketing authorisation for a new pharmaceutical product in the territory of the respective Parties, is not used for granting another marketing authorisation for a pharmaceutical product, unless proof of the explicit consent of the marketing authorisation holder to use these data is provided.3.

Each Party shall ensure that, even before the commencement of proceedings on the merits of the case, the competent judicial authorities may, on application by a party who has presented reasonably available evidence to support its claims that its intellectual property right has been infringed or is about to be infringed, order prompt and effective provisional measures to preserve relevant evidence in respect of the alleged infringement, subject to the protection of confidential information.2. Each Party may provide that such measures include the detailed description, with or without the taking of samples, or the physical seizure of the infringing goods, and in appropriate cases, the materials and implements used in the production or distribution of these goods and the documents relating thereto.

The judicial authorities shall order that those measures be carried out at the expense of the infringer, unless particular reasons are invoked for not doing so.3. In considering a request for corrective measures, the need for proportionality between the seriousness of the infringement and the remedies ordered as well as the interests of third parties shall be taken into account.Article 10.48Injunctions1. Each Party shall ensure that, where a judicial decision is taken finding an infringement of an intellectual property right, the judicial authorities may issue against the infringer an injunction aimed at prohibiting the continuation of the infringement.2. Where provided for by law, non-compliance with an injunction shall, where appropriate, be subject to a recurring penalty payment, with a view to ensuring compliance.

Where the infringer did not knowingly, or with reasonable grounds to know, engage in infringing activity, the Parties may provide that the judicial authorities may order the recovery of profits or the payment of damages which may be pre-established.3. In civil judicial proceedings, each Party, at least with respect to works, phonograms, and performances protected by copyright or related rights, and in cases of trademark counterfeiting, may establish or maintain pre-established damages, which shall be available on the election of the right holder.Article 10.51Legal costsEach Party shall ensure that reasonable and proportionate legal costs and other expenses incurred by the successful party shall as a general rule be borne by the unsuccessful party, unless equity does not allow as such.Article 10.52Publication of judicial decisionsIn cases of infringement of an intellectual property right, each Party shall ensure that the judicial authorities may order, where appropriate, at the request of the applicant and at the expense of the infringer, appropriate measures for the dissemination of the information concerning the decision, including displaying the decision and publishing it in full or in part.

The Parties shall maintain in their respective territories comprehensive competition laws which effectively address restrictive agreements, concerted practices [78] and abuse of dominance by one or more enterprises, and which provide effective control of concentrations between enterprises.3. The Parties agree that the following activities restricting competition are incompatible with the proper functioning of this Agreement, in so far as they may affect trade between them:(a) agreements between enterprises, decisions by associations of enterprises and concerted practices, which have as their object or effect the prevention, restriction or distortion of competition in the territory of either Party as a whole or in a substantial part thereof;(b) any abuse by one or more enterprises of a dominant position in the territory of either Party as a whole or in a substantial part thereof; or(c) concentrations between enterprises, which significantly impede effective competition, in particular as a result of the creation or strengthening of a dominant position in the territory of either Party as a whole or in a substantial part thereof.Article 11.2DefinitionsFor the purposes of this Section, competition laws means:(a) for the European Union, Articles 101, 102 and 106 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, Council Regulation (EC) No 139/2004 on the control of concentrations between undertakings, and their implementing regulations and amendments;(b) for Korea, the Monopoly Regulation and Fair Trade Act and its implementing regulations and amendments; and(c) any changes that instruments set out in this Article may undergo after the entry into force of this Agreement.Article 11.3Implementation1.

This Article is without prejudice to the rights and obligations set out under Chapter Nine (Government Procurement).Article 11.6Cooperation1.

A subsidy is a measure which fulfils the conditions set out in Article 1.1 of the SCM Agreement.2. A subsidy is specific if it falls within the meaning of Article 2 of the SCM Agreement. A subsidy shall be subject to this Section only if it is specific within the meaning of Article 2 of the SCM Agreement.Article 11.11Prohibited subsidies [81], [82]The following subsidies shall be deemed to be specific under the conditions of Article 2 of the SCM Agreement and shall be prohibited for the purposes of this Agreement in so far as they adversely affect international trade of the Parties [83]:(a) subsidies granted under any legal arrangement whereby a government or any public body is responsible for covering debts or liabilities of certain enterprises within the meaning of Article 2.1 of the SCM Agreement without any limitation, in law or in fact, as to the amount of those debts and liabilities or the duration of such responsibility; and(b) subsidies (such as loans and guarantees, cash grants, capital injections, provision of assets below market prices or tax exemptions) to insolvent or ailing enterprises, without a credible restructuring plan based on realistic assumptions with a view to ensuring the return of the insolvent or ailing enterprise within a reasonable period of time to long-term viability and without the enterprise significantly contributing itself to the costs of restructuring. This does not prevent the Parties from providing subsidies by way of temporary liquidity support in the form of loan guarantees or loans limited to the amount needed to merely keep an ailing enterprise in business for the time necessary to work out a restructuring or liquidation plan.This subparagraph does not apply to subsidies granted as compensation for carrying out public service obligations and to the coal industry.Article 11.12Transparency1. Each Party shall ensure transparency in the area of subsidies. To this end, each Party shall report annually to the other Party on the total amount, types and the sectoral distribution of subsidies which are specific and may affect international trade. Reporting should contain information concerning the objective, form, the amount or budget and where possible the recipient of the subsidy granted by a government or any public body.2. Such report is deemed to have been provided if it is sent to the other Party, or if the relevant information is made available on a publicly accessible Internet website, by 31 December of the subsequent calendar year.3. Upon request by a Party, the other Party shall provide further information on any subsidy schemes and particular individual cases of subsidy which is specific. The Parties shall exchange this information, taking into account the limitations imposed by the requirements of professional and business secrecy.Article 11.13Relation with the WTO AgreementThe provisions in this Section are without prejudice to the rights of a Party in accordance with the relevant provisions of the WTO Agreement to apply trade remedies or to take dispute settlement or other appropriate action against a subsidy granted by the other Party.Article 11.14Monitoring and reviewThe Parties shall keep under constant review the matters to which reference is made in this Section. Each Party may refer such matters to the Trade Committee. The Parties agree to review progress in implementing this Section every two years after the entry into force of this Agreement, unless both Parties agree otherwise.Article 11.15Scope1. The provisions of Articles 11.9 through 11.14 shall apply to subsidies for goods with the exception of fisheries subsidies, subsidies related to products covered by Annex 1 of the Agreement on Agriculture and other subsidies covered by the Agreement on Agriculture.2.

If the Party complained against fails to notify any measure taken to comply with the arbitration panel ruling before the expiry of the reasonable period of time, or if the arbitration panel rules that no measure taken to comply exists or that the measure notified under Article 14.10.1 is inconsistent with that Party’s obligations under the provisions referred to in Article 14.2, the Party complained against shall, if so requested by the complaining Party, present an offer for temporary compensation.2. If no agreement on compensation is reached within 30 days of the end of the reasonable period of time or of the issuance of the arbitration panel ruling under Article 14.10 that no measure taken to comply exists or the measure notified under Article 14.10.1 is inconsistent with the provisions referred to in Article 14.2, the complaining Party shall be entitled, upon notification to the Party complained against and to the Trade Committee, to suspend obligations arising from any provision referred to in Article 14.2 at a level equivalent to the nullification or impairment caused by the violation. The notification shall specify the level of obligations that the complaining Party intends to suspend. The complaining Party may implement the suspension 10 days after the date of the notification, unless the Party complained against has requested arbitration under paragraph 4.3. In suspending obligations, the complaining Party may choose to increase its tariff rates to the level applied to other WTO Members on a volume of trade to be determined in such a way that the volume of trade multiplied by the increase of the tariff rates equals the value of the nullification or impairment caused by the violation.4. If the Party complained against considers that the level of suspension is not equivalent to the nullification or impairment caused by the violation, it may request in writing the original arbitration panel to rule on the matter. Such request shall be notified to the complaining Party and to the Trade Committee before the expiry of the 10 day period referred to in paragraph 2. The original arbitration panel shall issue its ruling on the level of the suspension of obligations to the Parties and to the Trade Committee within 30 days of the date of the submission of the request. Obligations shall not be suspended until the original arbitration panel has issued its ruling, and any suspension shall be consistent with the arbitration panel ruling.5. In the event that any member of the original arbitration panel is no longer available, the procedures laid down in Article 14.5 shall apply. The period for issuing the ruling shall be 45 days from the date of the submission of the request referred to in paragraph 4.6. The suspension of obligations shall be temporary and apply only until any measure found to be inconsistent with the provisions referred to in Article 14.2 has been withdrawn or amended so as to bring it into conformity with those provisions, as established under Article 14.12, or until the Parties have agreed to settle the dispute.Article 14.12Review of any measure taken to comply after the suspension of obligations1. The Party complained against shall notify the complaining Party and the Trade Committee of any measure it has taken to comply with the ruling of the arbitration panel and of its request for the termination of the suspension of obligations applied by the complaining Party.2. If the Parties do not reach an agreement on the compatibility of the notified measure with the provisions referred to in Article 14.2 within 30 days of the date of the notification, the complaining Party shall request in writing the original arbitration panel to rule on the matter. Such request shall be notified to the Party complained against and to the Trade Committee. The arbitration panel ruling shall be issued to the Parties and to the Trade Committee within 45 days of the date of the submission of the request. If the arbitration panel rules that any measure taken to comply is in conformity with the provisions referred to in Article 14.2, the suspension of obligations shall be terminated.3. In the event that any member of the original arbitration panel is no longer available, the procedures laid down in Article 14.5 shall apply. The period for issuing the ruling shall be 60 days from the date of the submission of the request referred to in paragraph 2.Sub-section CCommon provisionsArticle 14.13Mutually agreed solutionThe Parties may reach a mutually agreed solution to a dispute under this Chapter at any time. They shall notify the Trade Committee of any such solution. Upon notification of the mutually agreed solution, the procedure shall be terminated.Article 14.14Rules of procedure1. Dispute settlement procedures under this Chapter shall be governed by Annex 14-B.2. Any hearing of the arbitration panel shall be open to the public in accordance with Annex 14-B.Article 14.15Information and technical adviceAt the request of a Party, or upon its own initiative, the arbitration panel may obtain information from any source, including the Parties involved in the dispute, as it deems appropriate for the arbitration panel proceeding. The arbitration panel also has the right to seek the relevant opinion of experts as it deems appropriate. Any information obtained in this manner must be disclosed to both Parties which may submit comments. Interested natural or legal persons of the Parties are authorised to submit amicus curiae briefs to the arbitration panel in accordance with Annex 14-B.Article 14.16Rules of interpretationAny arbitration panel shall interpret the provisions referred to in Article 14.2 in accordance with customary rules of interpretation of public international law, including those codified in the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties. Where an obligation under this Agreement is identical to an obligation under the WTO Agreement, the arbitration panel shall adopt an interpretation which is consistent with any relevant interpretation established in rulings of the WTO Dispute Settlement Body (hereinafter referred to as the \"DSB\"). The rulings of the arbitration panel cannot add to or diminish the rights and obligations provided for in the provisions referred to in Article 14.2.Article 14.17Arbitration panel decisions and rulings1. The arbitration panel shall make every effort to take any decision by consensus. Where, nevertheless, a decision cannot be arrived at by consensus, the matter at issue shall be decided by majority vote. In no case shall dissenting opinions of arbitrators be published.2. Any ruling of the arbitration panel shall be binding on the Parties and shall not create any rights or obligations for natural or legal persons. The ruling shall set out the findings of fact, the applicability of the relevant provisions of this Agreement and the basic rationale behind any findings and conclusions that it makes. The Trade Committee shall make the arbitration panel rulings publicly available in its entirety unless it decides not to do so.SECTION DGeneral provisionsArticle 14.18List of arbitrators1. The Trade Committee shall, no later than six months after the entry into force of this Agreement, establish a list of 15 individuals who are willing and able to serve as arbitrators. Each Party shall propose five individuals to serve as arbitrators. The Parties shall also select five individuals who are not nationals of either Party and shall act as chairperson to the arbitration panel. The Trade Committee will ensure that the list is always maintained at this level.2. Arbitrators shall have specialised knowledge or experience of law and international trade. They shall be independent, serve in their individual capacities and not take instructions from any organisation or government with regard to matters related to the dispute, or be affiliated with the government of any Party, and shall comply with Annex 14-C.Article 14.19Relation with WTO obligations1. Recourse to the dispute settlement provisions of this Chapter shall be without prejudice to any action in the WTO framework, including dispute settlement action.2. However, where a Party has, with regard to a particular measure, initiated a dispute settlement proceeding, either under this Chapter or under the WTO Agreement, it may not institute a dispute settlement proceeding regarding the same measure in the other forum until the first proceeding has been concluded. In addition, a Party shall not seek redress of an obligation which is identical under this Agreement and under the WTO Agreement in the two forums. In such case, once a dispute settlement proceeding has been initiated, the Party shall not bring a claim seeking redress of the identical obligation under the other Agreement to the other forum, unless the forum selected fails for procedural or jurisdictional reasons to make findings on the claim seeking redress of that obligation.3. For the purposes of paragraph 2:(a) dispute settlement proceedings under the WTO Agreement are deemed to be initiated by a Party’s request for the establishment of a panel under Article 6 of the Understanding on Rules and Procedures Governing the Settlement of Disputes contained in Annex 2 of the WTO Agreement (hereinafter referred to as the \"DSU\") and are deemed to be concluded when the DSB adopts the Panel’s report, and the Appellate Body’s report as the case may be, under Articles 16 and 17.14 of the DSU; and(b) dispute settlement proceedings under this Chapter are deemed to be initiated by a Party’s request for the establishment of an arbitration panel under Article 14.4.1 and are deemed to be concluded when the arbitration panel issues its ruling to the Parties and to the Trade Committee under Article 14.7.4. Nothing in this Agreement shall preclude a Party from implementing the suspension of obligations authorised by the DSB. The WTO Agreement shall not be invoked to preclude a Party from suspending obligations under this Chapter.Article 14.20Time limits1. All time limits laid down in this Chapter, including the limits for the arbitration panels to issue their rulings, shall be counted in calendar days, the first day being the day following the act or fact to which they refer.2. Any time limit referred to in this Chapter may be extended by mutual agreement of the Parties.CHAPTER FIFTEENINSTITUTIONAL, GENERAL AND FINAL PROVISIONSArticle 15.1Trade Committee1.

TIFF ++++++++++ TIFF ++++++++++ TIFF +++++[1] For the purposes of this Agreement, goods means products as understood in GATT 1994 unless otherwise provided in this Agreement.[2] The Parties understand that this definition is without prejudice to the treatment that the Parties, in line with the WTO Agreement, may accord to trade conducted on a most-favoured-nation basis.[3] A Party may require an importer to provide sufficient guarantee in the form of a surety, a deposit or some other appropriate instruments, covering the ultimate payment of the customs duties, taxes and fees in connection with the importation of the goods.[4] The sole fact of requiring a visa for natural persons of certain countries and not for those of others shall not be regarded as nullifying or impairing benefits under the terms of a specific commitment in this Chapter and its Annexes.[5] Central administration means the head office where ultimate decision-making takes place.[6] In line with its notification of the Treaty establishing the European Community to the WTO (WT/REG39/1), the EU Party understands the concept of \"effective and continuous link\" with the economy of a Member State of the European Union enshrined in Article 48 of the Treaty as equivalent to the concept of \"substantive business operations\" provided for in paragraph 6 of Article V of the GATS. Accordingly, for a juridical person set up in accordance with the laws of Korea and having only its registered office or central administration in the territory of Korea, the EU Party shall only extend the benefits of this Agreement if that juridical person possesses an effective and continuous link with the economy of Korea.[7] This subparagraph shall not apply to establishment.[8] The exclusion of audiovisual services from the scope of this Section is without prejudice to the rights and obligations derived from the Protocol on Cultural Cooperation.[9] This subparagraph includes measures which require a service supplier of the other Party to have an establishment within the meaning of Article 7.9(a) or to be resident in a Party’s territory as a condition for the cross-border supply of services.[10] This subparagraph does not cover measures of a Party which limit inputs for the cross-border supply of services.[11] Nothing in this Article shall be interpreted as extending the scope of this Section.[12] The terms \"constitution\" and \"acquisition\" of a juridical person shall be understood as including capital participation in a juridical person with a view to establishing or maintaining lasting economic links.[13] Where the economic activity is not performed directly by a juridical person but through other forms of establishment such as a branch or a representative office, the investor including the juridical person shall, nonetheless, through such establishment be accorded the treatment provided for investors under this Agreement. Such treatment shall be extended to the establishment through which the economic activity is performed and need not be extended to any other parts of the investor located outside the territory where the economic activity is performed.[14] Investment protection, other than the treatment deriving from Article 7.12, including investor-state dispute settlement procedures, is not covered by this Chapter.[15] For greater certainty, processing of nuclear materials covers all the activities included in the International Standard Industrial Classification of all Economic Activities as set out in Statistical Office of the United Nations, Statistical Papers, Series M, N 4, ISIC REV 3.1, 2002 code 2330.[16] War material is limited to any product which is solely intended and made for military use in connection with the conduct of war or defence activities.[17] The exclusion of audiovisual services from the scope of this Section is without prejudice to the rights and obligations derived from the Protocol on Cultural Cooperation.[18] Subparagraphs (a) through (c) do not cover measures taken in order to limit the production of an agricultural product.[19] This Article applies to measures governing the composition of boards of directors of an establishment, such as nationality and residency requirements.[20] Nothing in this Article shall be interpreted as extending the scope of this Section.[21] The obligation contained in this paragraph does not extend to the investment protection provisions not covered by this Chapter, including provisions relating to investor-state dispute settlement procedures.[22] This includes this Chapter and Annexes 7-A and 7-C.[23] The recipient establishment may be required to submit a training programme covering the duration of stay for prior approval, demonstrating that the purpose of the stay is for training corresponding to the level of a university degree.[24] The service contract referred to under this subparagraph shall comply with the laws, regulations and requirements of the Party where the contract is executed.[25] The service contract referred to under this subparagraph shall comply with the laws, regulations and requirements of the Party where the contract is executed.[26] A Party may authorise an extension for the period allowed in conformity with the laws and regulations in force in its territory.[27] This paragraph is without prejudice to the rights and obligations deriving from bilateral visa waiver agreements between Korea and one of the Member States of the European Union.[28] Unless otherwise provided in Annex 7-A, neither Party may require that an establishment appoints to senior management positions natural persons of any particular nationality or having residency in its territory.[29] This Article is without prejudice to the rights and obligations deriving from bilateral visa waiver agreements between Korea and one of the Member States of the European Union.[30] CPC means the Central Products Classification as set out in Statistical Office of the United Nations, Statistical Papers, Series M, No 77, CPC Prov, 1991.[31] For greater certainty, nothing in this Article shall be interpreted as intending to change the regulatory framework of the existing regulatory body in Korea which regulates private delivery service suppliers upon the entry into force of this Agreement.[32] These include services listed in items from a through g under C. Telecommunication Services of 2.

Each Party shall ensure that licence fees are imposed and applied in a non-discriminatory manner upon the entry into force of this Agreement.[36] Or margin squeeze for the EU Party.[37] Each Party will implement this obligation in accordance with its relevant legislation.[38] For disputes between service suppliers or between service suppliers and users, the appeal body shall be independent of the parties involved in the dispute.[39] Any measure which is applied to financial service suppliers established in a Party’s territory that are not regulated and supervised by the financial supervisory authority of that Party would be deemed to be a prudential measure for the purposes of this Agreement. For greater certainty, any such measure shall be taken in line with this Article.[40] It is understood that the term \"prudential reasons\" may include the maintenance of the safety, soundness, integrity or financial responsibility of individual financial service suppliers.[41] For greater certainty, this commitment indicates the rights and freedoms set out in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the Guidelines for the Regulation of Computerised Personal Data Files (adopted by the United General Assembly Resolution 45/95 of 14 December 1990), and the OECD Guidelines on the Protection of Privacy and Transborder Flows of Personal Data (adopted by the OECD Council on 23 September 1980).[42] The inclusion of the provisions on electronic commerce in this Chapter is made without prejudice to Korea’s position on whether deliveries by electronic means should be categorised as trade in services or goods.[43] The public order exception may be invoked only where a genuine and sufficiently serious threat is posed to one of the fundamental interests of society.[44] Measures that are aimed at ensuring the equitable or effective imposition or collection of direct taxes include measures taken by a Party under its taxation system which:(a)apply to non-resident investors and service suppliers in recognition of the fact that the tax obligation of non-residents is determined with respect to taxable items sourced or located in the Party’s territory;(b)apply to non-residents in order to ensure the imposition or collection of taxes in the Party’s territory;(c)apply to non-residents or residents in order to prevent the avoidance or evasion of taxes, including compliance measures;(d)apply to consumers of services supplied in or from the territory of the other Party in order to ensure the imposition or collection of taxes on such consumers derived from sources in the Party’s territory;(e)distinguish investors and service suppliers subject to tax on worldwide taxable items from other investors and service suppliers, in recognition of the difference in the nature of the tax base between them; or(f)determine, allocate or apportion income, profit, gain, loss, deduction or credit of resident persons or branches, or between related persons or branches of the same person, in order to safeguard the Party’s tax base.Tax terms or concepts in this paragraph and this footnote are determined according to tax definitions and concepts, or equivalent or similar definitions and concepts, under the domestic law of the Party taking the measure.[45] \"serious difficulties for the operation of monetary policy or exchange rate policy\" shall include, but not be limited to, serious balance of payments or external financial difficulties, and the safeguard measures under this Article shall not apply with respect to foreign direct investments.[46] In particular, safeguard measures provided for in this Article should be applied in such a way that they:(a)are not confiscatory;(b)do not constitute a dual or multiple exchange rate practice;(c)do not otherwise interfere with investors’ ability to earn a market rate of return in the territory of the Party who took safeguard measures on any restricted assets;(d)avoid unnecessary damage to the commercial, economic or financial interests of the other Party;(e)are temporary and phased out progressively as the situation calling for imposition of such measures improves; and(f)are promptly published by the competent authorities responsible for foreign exchange policy.[47] The European Union or Member States of the European Union or Korea.[48] As long as the circumstances present at the time of initial adoption of safeguard measures or any equivalent thereto still exist, the application of safeguard measures can be extended once for another six months by the Party concerned. However, if extremely exceptional circumstances arise such that a Party seeks further extension of the safeguard measures, it will coordinate in advance with the other Party concerning the implementation of any proposed extension.[49] Contained in WTO Document negs 268 (Job No[1].8274) dated 19 November 2007.[50] For the purposes of this paragraph, retransmission within a Party’s territory over a closed and defined subscriber network that is not accessible from outside the Party’s territory does not constitute retransmission on the Internet.[51] \"Geographical indication\" in this Sub-section refers to:(a)geographical indications, designations of origin, quality wines produced in a specified region and table wines with geographical indication as referred to in Council Regulation (EC) No 510/2006 of 20 March 2006; Regulation (EC) No 110/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 January 2008; Council Regulation (EEC) No 1601/1991 of 10 June 1991; Council Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999 of 17 May 1999; and Council Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 of 22 October 2007, or provisions replacing these regulations; and(b)geographical indications as covered by the Agricultural Products Quality Control Act (Act No. 9759, Jun. 9, 2009) and the Liquor Tax Act (Act No. 8852, Feb. 29, 2008) of Korea.[52] The protection of a geographical indication under this Sub-section is without prejudice to other provisions in this Agreement.[53] Wines within the meaning of this Sub-section are products falling under heading 22.04 of the HS and which:(a)comply with Council Regulation (EC) 1234/2007 of 22 October 2007, Commission Regulation (EC) 606/2009 of 10 July 2009 and Commission Regulation (EC) 607/2009 of 14 July 2009, or legislation replacing it; or(b)comply with the Agricultural Products Quality Control Act (Act No. 9759, Jun. 9, 2009) and the Liquor Tax Act (Act No. 8852, Feb. 29, 2008) of Korea.[54] Aromatised wines within the meaning of this Sub-section are products falling under heading 22.05 of the HS and which:(a)comply with Council Regulation (EEC) No 1601/1991 of 10 June 1991, or legislation replacing it; or(b)comply with the Agricultural Products Quality Control Act (Act No. 9759, Jun. 9, 2009) and the Liquor Tax Act (Act No. 8852, Feb. 29, 2008) of Korea.[55] Spirits within the meaning of this Sub-section are products falling under heading 22.08 of the HS and which:(a)comply with Regulation (EC) No 110/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 January 2008, and Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1014/90 of 24 April 1990, or legislation replacing it; or(b)comply with the Agricultural Products Quality Control Act (Act No. 9759, Jun. 9, 2009) and the Liquor Tax Act (Act No. 8852, Feb. 29, 2008) of Korea.[56] For all goods, the term \"like good\" shall be interpreted in line with Article 23.1 of the TRIPS Agreement relating to the use of a geographical indication identifying wines for wines not originating in the place indicated by the geographical indication in question or identifying spirits for spirits not originating in the place indicated by the geographical indication in question.[57] If a proposal is made by:(a)Korea for an originating product falling into the scope of the legislation of the European Union set out under Article 10.18.2 and footnotes of Article 10.19; or(b)the European Union for an originating product falling into the scope of the legislation of Korea set out under Article 10.18.1 and footnotes of Article 10.19,to add a name of origin to this Agreement which has been recognised by either Party as a geographical indication within the meaning of Article 22.1 of the TRIPS Agreement through laws of either Party other than those referred to in Articles 10.18.1 and 10.18.2 and footnotes of Article 10.19, the Parties agree to examine whether the geographical indication can be added to this Agreement pursuant to this Sub-section.[58] This refers to the modification of the geographical indication as such, including the name and product category. Modifications of specifications as referred to in Articles 10.18.3 and 10.18.4 or modifications of the responsible control bodies as referred to in Article 10.18.6(d) remain the sole responsibility of the Party where a geographical indication originates. Such modifications may be communicated for information purposes.[59] A decision to cease protection of a geographical indication remains the sole responsibility of the Party where the geographical indication originates.[60] Korea considers designs not to be new if an identical or similar design has been publicly known or publicly worked before the application for design registration is filed. Korea considers designs not to be original if they could have been easily created from the combinations of designs that have been publicly known or publicly worked before the application for design registration is filed. The European Union considers designs not to be new if an identical design has been made available to the public before the filing date of a registered design or before the date of disclosure of an unregistered design. The European Union considers design not to have individual character if the overall impression it produces on the informed users does not differ from the overall impression produced on such a user by any design which has been made available to the public.[61] For the purposes of this Article, the European Union and Korea consider that \"unregistered design\" and \"unregistered appearance\" have a similar meaning. The conditions for protection of \"unregistered design\" or \"unregistered appearance\" are provided for:(a)by Korea in the Unfair Competition Prevention and Trade Secret Protection Act (Act No. 8767, Dec. 21, 2007); and(b)by the European Union in Council Regulation (EC) No 6/2002 of 12 December 2001 on Community designs, as last amended by Council Regulation (EC) No 1891/2006 of 18 December 2006.[62] For the purposes of this Article, the European Union considers \"presenting\" as \"offering\" or \"putting on the market\" and Korea considers \"presenting\" as \"assigning, leasing or exhibition for assigning or leasing\".[63] The protection of a design under the law of copyright is not granted automatically, but granted only if a design qualifies for protection in accordance with the law of copyright.[64] As defined in Annex 2-D (Pharmaceutical Products and Medical Devices).[65] Plant protection products, in the form in which they are supplied to the user, consist of or contain active substances, safeners or synergists, and are intended for one of the following uses:(a)protecting plants or plant products against all harmful organisms or preventing the action of such organisms, unless the main purpose of these products is considered to be for reasons of hygiene rather than for the protection of plants or plant products;(b)influencing the life processes of plants, such as substances influencing their growth, other than as a nutrient;(c)preserving plant products, in so far as such substances or products are not subject to the European Union’s special provisions on preservatives;(d)destroying undesired plants or parts of plants, except algae unless the products are applied on soil or water to protect plants; or(e)checking or preventing undesired growth of plants, except algae unless the products are applied on soil or water to protect plants.[66] This is without prejudice to a possible extension for paediatric use, if provided for by the Parties.[67] As defined in Annex 2-D (Pharmaceutical Products and Medical Devices).[68] As defined in Article 10.2.2(a) through (h).[69] For the purposes of this paragraph, the scope of \"intermediary\" is determined in each Party’s legislation, but shall include those who deliver or distribute infringing goods, and also where appropriate, include online service providers.[70] For the purposes of this paragraph, the scope of \"intermediary\" is determined in each Party’s legislation, but shall include those who deliver or distribute infringing goods, and also where appropriate, include online service providers.[71] The term \"related rights\" is defined by each Party in accordance with its international obligations.[72] For the purposes of the function referred to in Article 10.63, service provider means a provider of transmission, routing, or connections for digital online communications without modification of their content between or among points specified by the user of material of the user’s choosing, and for the purpose of the functions referred to in Articles 10.64 and 10.65 service provider means a provider or operator of facilities for online services or network access.[73] It is understood that there shall be no obligation to apply such procedures to imports of goods put on the market in another country by or with the consent of the right holder.[74] \"customs transit, transhipment and placement under a free zone\" as defined in the Kyoto Convention.[75] For Korea, \"placement under a suspensive procedure\" includes temporary importation and bonded factory. For the European Union, \"placement under a suspensive procedure\" includes temporary importation, inward processing and processing under customs control.[76] For the purposes of this Article, goods infringing an intellectual property right means:(a)counterfeit goods, which are:(i)goods, including packaging, bearing without authorisation a trademark identical to the trademark duly registered in respect of the same type of goods, or which cannot be distinguished in its essential aspects from such a trademark, and which thereby infringes the trademark holder’s rights;(ii)any trademark symbol (logo, label, sticker, brochure, instructions for use or guarantee document), even if presented separately, on the same conditions as the goods referred to in subparagraph (a)(i); or(iii)packaging materials bearing the trademarks of counterfeit goods, presented separately, on the same conditions as the goods referred to in subparagraph (a)(i);(b)pirated copyright goods, which are or contain copies made without the consent of the right holder, or of a person duly authorised by the right holder in the country of production, of a copyright or related right, regardless of whether it is registered in each Party’s legislation;

Recalling the obligations of the Parties under the WTO Agreement, in particular the TBT Agreement, and recognising the importance of electronics for growth, employment and trade for each Party, the Parties confirm their shared objectives and principles of:(a) progressively and simultaneously eliminating tariffs and non-tariff obstacles to bilateral trade;(b) establishing competitive market conditions based on principles of openness, non-discrimination, proportionality and transparency;(c) gradually aligning their domestic regulations with existing international standards;(d) promoting \"one test\" and, where practicable, a supplier’s declaration of conformity through elimination of duplicative and unnecessarily burdensome conformity assessment procedures;(e) implementing appropriate regulatory and legal enforcement mechanisms related to product liability and market surveillance; and(f) enhancing cooperation to foster continued mutually beneficial development in trade, as well as to improve product quality with a view to ensuring protection of public health and safety of products.2. This Annex shall apply to any standard, technical regulation and conformity assessment procedure that either Party may introduce or maintain with respect to the safety and electromagnetic compatibility (hereinafter referred to as \"EMC\") of electrical and electronic equipment, professional electrotechnical equipment, electrical household appliances and consumer electronics defined in Appendix 2-B-1 (hereinafter referred to as \"covered products\").Article 2International standards and standard-setting bodies1. The Parties recognise that the International Organisation for Standards (hereinafter referred to as the \"ISO\"), the International Electrotechnical Commission (hereinafter referred to as the \"IEC\") and the International Telecommunication Union (hereinafter referred to as the \"ITU\") are the relevant international standard-setting bodies for EMC and safety of covered products [1].2. Where relevant international standards established by the ISO, IEC and ITU exist, the Parties shall use these international standards or the relevant parts of them as a basis for any standard, technical regulation or conformity assessment procedure [2].3. The Parties shall ensure that their standard-setting bodies participate in the development of international standards in the ISO, IEC and ITU, and commit to consult with a view to establishing common approaches.Article 3Conformity assessment procedureIn case a Party requires a positive assurance of conformity with technical regulations on EMC or safety of covered products, the following rules shall apply [3]:(a) conformity assessment procedures shall not be prepared, adopted or applied with a view to or with the effect of creating unnecessary obstacles to trade with the other Party;(b) except as otherwise provided under this Annex, including the transitional arrangements set out in Article 4, each Party shall accept products on its market [4] on the basis of one or more of the following procedures as positive assurance of conformity to its technical regulations on EMC or safety of covered products:(i) a supplier’s declaration of conformity without requiring the intervention of any conformity assessment body or testing of the product by recognised testing laboratories;(ii) a supplier’s declaration of conformity based on a test report from any testing laboratory in the other Party’s territory that has been notified by the Party at the entry into force of this Agreement or in any subsequent notifications. The notifying Party shall be solely responsible for notifying any laboratory which is competent [5] to perform the relevant tests in its territory, without prior approval or verification by the importing Party. The importing Party may require that the declaration of conformity is submitted by the supplier before the product is placed on its market and that the declaration contains the name of the testing laboratory issuing the test report and the issuing date of the test report. The importing Party may also require a copy of the test report, including a list of critical components, demonstrating conformity to the requirements applicable to the product, and a general description of the product; or(iii) a supplier’s declaration of conformity based on a test report issued by:(A) any testing laboratory in the other Party that has concluded voluntary arrangements for mutual acceptance of test reports with one or more conformity assessment bodies designated by the importing Party; or(B) a CB Test Laboratory of the other Party under the IECEE CB Scheme, accompanied by a valid CB Test Certificate, in accordance with the rules and procedures of the IECEE CB Scheme and the commitments by the Parties thereunder.The importing Party may require for review before the product is placed on its market the submission of the declaration of conformity which contains a copy of the test report, including a list of critical components, demonstrating conformity to the requirements applicable to the product, and a general description of the product.The choice among the procedures in this subparagraph shall rest with each Party subject to the limitations set out in Appendix 2-B-2;(c) the Parties shall accept the supplier as solely responsible for issuing, changing or withdrawing the declaration of conformity. The Parties may require that the declaration of conformity is dated and identifies the supplier or the supplier’s authorised representative in their territories, the person empowered by the manufacturer or his authorised representative to sign the declaration, the products covered by the declaration, and the applied technical regulations to which conformity is declared. When a supplier’s declaration of conformity is for a batch of products, it shall cover each article of the batch. When testing is undertaken, the choice of the testing laboratory shall rest with the supplier; and(d) beyond what is set out in this Article, a Party shall not require any form of registration of products that may prevent or otherwise delay the placing on the market of products that comply with the Party’s technical regulations. In so far as a Party reviews the supplier’s declaration in line with subparagraph (b)(iii), the review shall be solely limited to verifying, on the basis of the documentation submitted, that the test has been done in accordance with the Party’s relevant technical regulations and that the information contained in the documentation is complete. Any such review shall not cause undue delay for the placing of the products on the Party’s market and the declaration shall be accepted, without exceptions, if the products comply with the Party’s technical regulations and the documentation submitted is complete. In the event that a declaration is rejected, the Party shall communicate its decision to the supplier immediately, together with a detailed explanation of the grounds for the rejection and how these can be rectified by the supplier, as well as an explanation of possibilities to appeal the decision.Article 4Transitional arrangements1. The European Union shall comply with Article 3(b) of this Annex upon the entry into force of this Agreement while Korea shall comply with that subparagraph within three years of the entry into force of this Agreement.2. During the transitional period set out in paragraph 1, in so far as Korea applies, upon the entry into force of this Agreement, mandatory certification to its technical regulations on EMC or safety of covered products, including third party testing, for a product falling under the scope of this Annex, Korea may require to accept such product on its market [6]:(a) a certificate issued by a conformity assessment body in the European Union that has been designated as a \"Notified Body\" according to the legislation of the European Union. The European Union shall be solely responsible for choosing conformity assessment bodies in its territory, without prior approval or verification by Korea, and shall notify Korea of its list of relevant bodies upon the entry into force of this Agreement and any change thereafter; or(b) a certificate to its technical regulations issued by a conformity assessment body that has been designated according to the procedures of Korea. Korea shall accept such certificates based on a test report issued by:(i) any testing laboratory in the European Union that has concluded voluntary arrangements for mutual acceptance of test reports with one or more conformity assessment bodies designated by Korea; or(ii) an EU CB Test Laboratory under the IECEE CB Scheme, accompanied by a valid CB Test Certificate, in accordance with the rules and procedures of the IECEE CB Scheme and the commitments by the European Union and Korea thereunder.The choice between the procedures in this subparagraph shall rest with Korea subject to the limitations set out in Appendix 2-B-2.3. For those products listed in Appendix 2-B-3, Korea may continue to require positive assurance of conformity with its technical regulations on safety of covered products on the basis of a certificate in accordance with Article 4.2(b) of this Annex after the expiry of the transitional period set out in paragraph 1. For each product listed in Appendix 2-B-3, it will be reviewed, by the end of the transitional period set out in paragraph 1, whether accepting positive assurance of the conformity of such products with its technical regulations on safety of covered products in accordance with Article 3(b) of this Annex would create risks for human health and safety. Such risk assessment will be conducted for such products on the market, on the basis of available scientific and technical information such as consumer reports on safety accidents and non-conformity rate of product inspection. It will also be considered whether the products are used for their intended end-uses and with reasonable and usual care. If the results of risk assessment demonstrate that complying with Article 3(b) of this Annex for the products concerned would create risks for human health and safety, or if the post-market surveillance system set up cannot effectively address such risks, positive assurance of conformity as set out in Article 4.2(b) of this Annex can be maintained. Every three years following the end of the transitional period, the Parties shall review in the Committee on Trade in Goods the risk assessment with the aim of further reducing products listed in Appendix 2-B-3.Article 5Consolidation and gradual reduction in requirements1. The Parties shall, for covered products, not maintain or impose any requirements that are more trade-restrictive, or otherwise have the effect of delaying access to their markets, than what is set out in this Annex regarding conformity assessment procedures covering EMC or safety of covered products or administrative procedures for approving or reviewing test reports.2. No later than five years after the entry into force of this Agreement, Korea shall introduce a supplier’s declaration of conformity in accordance with Article 3(b)(i) of this Annex for the placing on the market of some products falling within the scope of this Annex. Every five years following the introduction of a supplier’s declaration of conformity, the Parties shall review the possibility of gradually eliminating technical and administrative requirements including mandatory third party testing, through expanding the introduction of a supplier’s declaration of conformity in accordance with Article 3(b)(i) of this Annex and developing effective market surveillance for the proper functioning of such system.Article 6Exceptions and emergency measures1. Notwithstanding Articles 3 through 5 of this Annex, either Party may introduce requirements for mandatory third party testing or certification for EMC or safety of covered products, or introduce administrative procedures for approving or reviewing test reports, for particular products falling within the scope of this Annex under the following conditions:(a) there exist urgent and compelling reasons related to the protection of human health and safety that justify the introduction of such requirements or procedures;(b) the reasons for the introduction of any such requirements or procedures are supported by substantiated technical or scientific information regarding the performance of the products in question;(c) any such requirements or procedures are not more trade-restrictive than necessary to fulfil the Party’s legitimate objective, taking account of the risks that non-fulfilment would create; and(d) the Party could not have reasonably foreseen the need for introducing any such requirements or procedures at the time of entry into force of this Agreement.Before introducing the requirements or procedures, the Party shall notify the other Party and, following consultations, take the comments of the other Party into account, to the greatest extent possible, in devising any such requirements or procedures. Any requirements introduced shall, to the greatest extent possible, be in compliance with this Annex. Once adopted, any requirement or procedure introduced shall be reviewed every third year from the date of its adoption and repealed if the reasons for its introduction no longer exist.2. If a Party has good cause to believe that a covered product creates risk for human health and safety, notably because it does not comply with requirements applicable to it, the Party may require withdrawal of that product from its market. Any such temporary emergency measures shall be notified to the other Party with an objective and reasoned explanation of why such actions have been taken, indicating whether the need for such measures is due to:(a) failure to comply with applicable standards or technical regulations;(b) incorrect application of standards or technical regulations; or(c) shortcomings in the standards or technical regulations themselves.Article 7Implementation and cooperation1. The Parties shall closely cooperate to promote common understanding on regulatory issues, including those related to radio frequency equipment, and consider any request of the other Party regarding the implementation of this Annex.2. The Parties shall cooperate to maintain and expand the voluntary arrangements for mutual acceptance of test reports between them.3. Whenever Korea requires as a positive assurance of conformity the procedures set out in Article 3(b)(iii) and Article 4.2(b) of this Annex for a product falling within the scope of this Annex, it shall ensure that its certification bodies have Memoranda of Understanding (MOUs) with testing laboratories in the European Union, or are National Certification Bodies under the IECEE CB Scheme, for that product unless its technical regulations for that product substantially differ from relevant IEC standards. This paragraph shall apply as from the expiry of the transitional period set out in Article 4.1 of this Annex.4. When amending existing technical regulations or developing any new technical regulation for EMC or safety of covered products, a Party shall notify the other Party in advance, provide, upon request, additional available information or written responses to the comments made by the other Party and, as appropriate, consider the other Party’s views.5. The Parties agree to consult promptly on any issue that may arise concerning the implementation of this Annex, and to cooperate for the further facilitation of trade in covered products, including, as appropriate, through the promotion of international standards.6. The Parties shall protect any confidential business information obtained under the procedures referred to in this Annex.[1] The Parties may agree in the future by decision of the Trade Committee on any new international standard-setting bodies which they deem relevant for the purpose of implementing this Article.[2] In case no such international standards exist, or where a Party has adopted any standard, technical regulation or conformity assessment procedure which differs from that under international standards, the Party shall limit its standard, technical regulation or conformity assessment procedure to what is necessary for the achievement of legitimate objectives on safety and other public interest requirements and, wherever appropriate, base them on products requirements in terms of performance rather than design or descriptive characteristics, in accordance with Chapter Four (Technical Barriers to Trade).[3] Either Party reserves its right to require in the future positive assurance of conformity for any product currently not subject to positive assurance of conformity, in which case the Party has to comply with its obligations under this Annex.[4] The permission to place a product on the market in accordance with this subparagraph shall include permission to affix any mandatory marks that are required for placing such product on the market.[5] The specific testing laboratories that are competent in the notifying Party in accordance with its legislation, that obtain accreditation (for example under ISO/IEC 17025) by the accreditation body or that are competent for post-market surveillance for conformity assessment in the notifying Party, will be considered competent for the task envisaged in this Annex.[6] The permission to place a product on the market in accordance with this Article shall include permission to affix any mandatory marks that are required for placing the product on the market.--------------------------------------------------Appendix 2-B-11. Annex 2-B shall cover those products listed in Article 1.2 of Annex 2-B which:(a) in the case of the European Union’s obligations, fall, at the date of signature of this Agreement, within the scope of Directive 2006/95/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 December 2006 on the harmonisation of the laws of Member States relating to electrical equipment designed for use within certain voltage limits (codified version), or Directive 2004/108/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 December 2004 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to electromagnetic compatibility and repealing Directive 89/336/EEC, or of the provisions on safety or electromagnetic compatibility of Directive 1999/5/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 9 March 1999 on radio equipment and telecommunications terminal equipment and the mutual recognition of their conformity; and(b) in the case of Korea’s obligations, fall, at the date of signature of this Agreement, within the scope of the Radio Waves Act (Act No.8867, Feb. 29, 2008), the Framework Act on Telecommunications (Act No.8974, Mar. 21, 2008) or the Electrical Appliances Safety Control Act [1] (Act No.8852, Feb. 29, 2008).2. The Parties understand that the products covered by the domestic laws listed in this Appendix, which include all the products to which Annex 2-B applies, are intended to cover the universe of electronics products. It is understood that in case a product is not covered by Annex 2-B for a Party but is covered for the other Party, or at the time of signature of this Agreement or subsequently [2] subject to mandatory third party certification by a Party but not by the other Party, the other Party can subject such product to a similar treatment as may be necessary for the protection of health and safety. Before such measures are implemented, the Party wishing to introduce them shall notify the other Party of its intentions and provide for a period of three months for consultations.[1] Notwithstanding this subparagraph, Korea may, when necessary, subject electrical equipment operated with direct current to conformity assessment procedures under the Electrical Appliances Safety Control Act in accordance with this Article.[2] For instance, pursuant to Article 6 of Annex 2-B or in case specific instruments are introduced pursuant to Article 1 (4) of Directive 2004/108/EC on electromagnetic compatibility.--------------------------------------------------Appendix 2-B-21. The European Union shall accept, for all covered products, the procedure set out in Article 3(b)(i) of Annex 2-B as positive assurance of conformity with its own technical regulations.2. Korea shall accept as positive assurance of conformity with its own technical regulations,(a) for products falling within the scope of the Radio Waves Act or the Framework Act on Telecommunications at the date of signature of this Agreement:(i) during the transitional period set out in Article 4.1 of Annex 2-B the procedure defined in Article 4.2(a) of Annex 2-B; and(ii) after the transitional period, the procedures defined in Article 3(b)(i) or 3(b)(ii) of Annex 2-B, where the choice between the two procedures shall rest with Korea.(b) for products falling within the scope of the Electrical Appliances Safety Control Act at the date of signature of this Agreement:(i) during the transitional period set out in Article 4.1 of Annex 2-B, the procedure defined in Article 4.2(b) of Annex 2-B; and(ii) after the transitional period, the procedures defined in Article 3(b)(i), 3(b)(ii) or 3(b)(iii) of Annex 2-B, where the choice among the three procedures shall rest with Korea;3. For products falling, at the date of signature of this Agreement, within the scope of more than one Act referred to in paragraph 2 of this Appendix, the supplier shall remain free to provide positive assurance of conformity with EMC in accordance with either of the procedures selected by Korea in accordance with subparagraph (a) or (b) of paragraph 2 of this Appendix. In case a product falls, in the future, within the scope of more than one Act referred to in paragraph 2 of this Appendix, whether EMC or safety of covered products is concerned, the same rule shall apply.--------------------------------------------------Appendix 2-B-3No | Products | HS code |1 | Cables and cord sets | 854442, 854449, 854459, 854460 |2 | Switches | 853590, 853650 |3 | Interceptors for electrical appliances | 853521, 853529, 853620, 853630, 853650 |4 | Magnetic switches | 853650 |5 | Capacitors and noise filters | 853210, 853221, 853222, 853223, 853224, 853225, 853229, 853230, 853540 |6 | Installation accessories and connection devices | 853650, 853669 |7 | Fuses and fuse holders, thermal-links | 853510, 853610, 853630 |8 | Power transformers and voltage regulators | 850421, 850422, 850431, 850432, 850433, 850434, 850440 |9 | Vacuum cleaners, floor treatment machines, steam cleaners, surface-cleaning appliances | 842430, 850811, 850819, 850860 |10 | Electric irons and press | 851640, 845130 |11 | Dish washers and dish driers | 842211, 842219, 842220, 845140, 842240 |12 | Heating appliances for kitchen | 841989, 841990, 851410, 851650, 851660, 851672 |13 | Washing machines and spin extractors | 842112, 845011, 845012, 845019, 845020 |14 | Appliances for hair care | 851631, 851632 |15 | Warming plates and electric hot cupboards | 851660, 851679, 851680 |16 | Motor-operated appliances for kitchen | 821490, 843510, 846722, 850940, 850980 |17 | Electric appliances for heating liquids | 841981, 841989, 851660, 851671, 851679, 851680 |18 | Electric blankets and mats, electric beds | 630110 |19 | Cauterising machines and foot warmers | 392210, 630110, 851680 |20 | Storage water heaters and Instantaneous water heaters | 851610, 851660, 851679, 851680 |21 | Electric refrigerators and ice makers | 841490, 841581, 841582, 841810, 841821, 841829, 841830, 841840, 841850, 841869, 841899 |22 | Microwave ovens (using the frequencies of 300 MHz -

Recognising the importance of motor vehicles and parts for growth, employment and trade for each Party, the Parties confirm their shared objectives and principles, for these products, of:(a) ensuring full reciprocal market access by elimination of tariffs and non-tariff obstacles to bilateral trade pursuant to this Agreement;(b) promoting compatibility of regulations based on international standards;(c) establishing competitive market conditions based on principles of openness, non-discrimination and transparency;(d) securing the protection of human health, safety and environment; and(e) enhancing cooperation to foster continued mutually beneficial development in trade.2. This Annex shall apply to all forms of motor vehicles, systems and parts thereof falling under Chapters 40, 84, 85, 87 and 94 of the HS, except those products set out in Appendix 2-C-1.Article 2Regulatory convergence1. The Parties recognise that the World Forum for Harmonisation of Vehicle Regulations (hereinafter referred to as the \"WP.29\"), within the framework of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (hereinafter referred to as the \"UN ECE\"), is the relevant international standard-setting body for the products covered by this Annex.2. The Parties agree to participate actively in the development of regulations in WP.29 and shall cooperate for the adoption, without undue delay, of new regulations by WP.29.Article 3Market accessEach Party shall allow on its market the products originating in the other Party, in accordance with this Article:(a) (i) the competent approval authorities in the European Union shall accept for the purpose of EU type-approval any product that complies with the requirements listed in Table 1 of Appendix 2-C-2 as complying with the corresponding provisions of the applicable EU technical regulations [1];(ii) Korea shall accept any product that complies with the requirements listed in Table 1 of Appendix 2-C-3 as complying with the corresponding provisions of the applicable Korean technical regulations [1];(iii) The Parties shall harmonise the regulations listed in Table 2 of Appendix 2-C-2, in case of the European Union, and in Table 2 of Appendix 2-C-3, in case of Korea, with the corresponding UN ECE Regulations or Global Technical Regulations (hereinafter referred to as the \"GTR\") within a period of five years of the entry into force of this Agreement, unless exceptionally a Party demonstrates that a specific UN ECE Regulation or GTR would be ineffective or inappropriate for the fulfilment of legitimate objectives pursued on the basis of substantiated scientific or technical information [1], [2]; and(iv) If there arises any trade issue with regard to the technical regulations not covered by subparagraph (a)(i) or (a)(ii) or, with regard to the technical regulations covered by subparagraph (a)(iii) while there is no harmonisation, upon request of either Party, the Parties shall enter into consultations to seek a mutually satisfactory solution. In these consultations the Party intending to impose a measure materially affecting market access conditions shall provide the other Party with the basis of its intended decision, including a detailed explanation in terms of the relevant scientific or technical information [2].(b) The Parties shall ensure that their respective procedures are accomplished without undue delay for the marketing of the products covered by this Annex.(c) Each Party shall promptly communicate to the concerned economic operators any decision taken on applications regarding conformity assessment, as well as the basis for any such decision and information on available legal remedies.(d) The Parties shall review Appendices 2-C-2 and 2-C-3 of this Annex no less than every three years from the entry into force of this Agreement with a view to furthering the acceptance of products as set out in subparagraph (a) of this Article, taking into account any regulatory developments that may have occurred internationally or in the Parties. Any modifications to these Appendices shall be decided upon by the Trade Committee.Article 4Consolidation of regulatory convergence1. The Parties shall:(a) at any time refrain from introducing any new domestic technical regulations diverging from UN ECE Regulations or GTR in areas covered by such regulations, or where the completion of such regulations is imminent, in particular in the areas covered by Appendix 2-C-2, in the case of the European Union, and Appendix 2-C-3, in the case of Korea; and(b) as soon as practicable after any new UN ECE Regulations or GTR is adopted by UN ECE in areas covered by existing domestic technical regulations, provide treatment for products originating in the other Party complying with UN ECE Regulations or GTR in accordance with Article 3 of this Annex, mutatis mutandis,unless there are substantiated reasons based on scientific or technical information why a specific UN ECE Regulation or GTR is ineffective or inappropriate for ensuring road safety or the protection of the environment or public health. In these cases, any such reasons shall be notified to the other Party and made public.2. In so far as a Party introduces or maintains technical regulations that differ from existing UN ECE Regulations in areas covered by these UN ECE Regulations, that Party shall review these technical regulations no less than every three years from the entry into force of this Agreement in order to assess whether the reasons for the imposition of the relevant technical regulations remain valid. The outcome from these reviews, as well as the technical or scientific information underpinning the outcome of these reviews, shall be made public and notified to the other Party upon request.3. In areas where there are no UN ECE Regulations or GTR and at least one Party introduces or maintains a technical regulation, the Parties shall consult on the possibility for developing international standards covering such areas. If the development of such international standards is not possible or is inappropriate, and if the Parties introduce or maintain domestic technical regulations in such areas, the Parties undertake to consult on the possibility for approximation of their respective regulations.Article 5MFN treatmentWith respect to internal taxes and emission regulations on products covered by this Annex, each Party shall accord to the products originating in the other Party no less favourable treatment than that accorded to the like products originating in any third country not party to this Agreement, including as provided in any free trade agreement with such third country.Article 6Products with new technologies or new features1. Neither Party shall prevent or unduly delay the placing on its market of a product on the ground that it incorporates a new technology or a new feature which has not yet been regulated unless it can demonstrate, based on scientific or technical information, that this new technology or new feature creates a risk for human health, safety or the environment.2. When a Party decides to refuse the placing on the market or require the withdrawal from the market of a product on the ground that it incorporates a new technology or a new feature creating a risk for human health, safety or the environment, it shall immediately notify this decision to the other Party and to the economic operators concerned. The notification shall include all relevant scientific or technical information.Article 7Other measures restricting tradeEach Party shall refrain from nullifying or impairing the market access benefits accruing to the other Party under this Annex through other regulatory measures specific to the sector covered by this Annex. This is without prejudice to the right to adopt measures necessary for road safety, the protection of the environment or public health and the prevention of deceptive practices provided such measures are based on substantiated scientific or technical information.Article 8Application of regulations1. When a Party accepts compliance or harmonisation with UN ECE requirements in conformity with Article 3 of this Annex, UN ECE type-approval certificates issued by competent authorities shall be considered as providing a presumption of conformity. If a Party finds that a certain product covered by a type-approval certificate does not conform to the approved type, it shall inform the other Party. This paragraph is without prejudice to the Parties’ right to take appropriate measures, as set out in paragraphs 2 and 3.2. The competent administrative authorities of each Party may verify by random sampling in accordance with its domestic legislation that the products, including those self-certified by manufacturers, comply as appropriate with:(a) all the technical regulations of that Party; or(b) the domestic technical regulations and the other requirements, as set out in Article 3(a) of this Annex.Each Party may require the supplier to withdraw a product from its market in case the product concerned does not comply with those regulations or requirements as the case may be.3. Type-approval can be refused if the documentation is incomplete, the relevant procedures for verifying conformity of production are not complied with, or the products concerned do not comply as appropriate with:(a) all the technical regulations of a Party; or(b) a Party’s technical regulations and the other requirements, as set out in Article 3(a) of this Annex.4. Notwithstanding compliance with the technical regulations or the requirements referred to in Article 3(a) of this Annex, a Party may, in exceptional circumstances, refuse to a supplier the placing of a product on its market or require a supplier to withdraw that product from its market if there are urgent and compelling risks for road safety, public health or the environment based on substantiated scientific or technical information. Such a refusal shall not constitute a means of arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination against the products of the other Party or a disguised restriction on trade. Before it is implemented, any such temporary emergency measure shall be notified to the other Party and to the supplier with an objective, reasoned and sufficiently detailed explanation of the motivation for the measure.Article 9Working Group on Motor Vehicles and Parts1. In order to further facilitate trade in motor vehicles and parts and to address market access problems before they arise, the Parties agree to cooperate and to consult promptly on any matters concerning the application of this Annex. They agree to inform each other of any measure that may affect trade in products falling under the scope of this Annex, in accordance with Chapter Four (Technical Barriers to Trade). Upon request, each Party shall in a timely manner respond in writing to comments and questions regarding any problems arising with respect to any such measure, and be ready to enter into consultations on such measure with a view to seeking a mutually satisfactory outcome.2.

The Working Group shall meet at least once a year, unless agreed otherwise. Its meetings shall normally be held in conjunction with meetings of WP.29 or any other forum addressing automotive issues. The Working Group may also carry out its works by e-mail, teleconference or videoconference or any other appropriate means of communications.Article 10Compliance1. Chapter Fourteen (Dispute Settlement) shall apply to this Annex subject to the following modifications:(a) Dispute concerning the interpretation or application of this Annex shall be considered a matter of urgency;(b) The period foreseen for consultations under Article 14.3 (Consultations) shall be reduced from 30 days to 15 days;(c) The period foreseen for the issuance of the interim panel report under Article 14.6 (Interim Panel Report) shall be reduced from 90 days to 60 days;(d) The period foreseen for the issuance of the arbitration panel ruling under Article 14.7 (Arbitration Panel Ruling) shall be reduced from 120 days to 75 days; and(e) The following sentence shall be deemed to be added to Article 14.9 (The Reasonable Period of Time for Compliance): \"The Party complained against shall comply with the arbitration panel ruling without delay. If immediate compliance is not possible, the reasonable period of time should normally not exceed 90 days and in no case it shall exceed 150 days from the issuance of the arbitration panel ruling in cases where the adoption of a measure of general application that does not require legislative action is necessary for the Party complained against in order to bring itself into compliance.\".2. The Parties may agree not to apply specific provisions of this Article.[1] The classification of the products, for the purpose of applying Article 3(a)(i) through 3(a)(iii) and determining the applicable regulations, shall be that under the legislation of the importing Party.[2] The Parties understand that the regulations covered by subparagraph (a)(iii) and (a)(iv) existing at the time of signature of this Agreement have not caused serious market access problems and under the provisions of these subparagraphs they will not result in worsening of the market access conditions as compared with the situation prevailing at that time.--------------------------------------------------Appendix 2-C-1Annex 2-C shall not cover:(a) Tractors (in HS 8701.10, 8701.20, 8709.11, 8709.19 and

To the extent that they have a continuous and effective link with the economy of the European Union, they are beneficiaries of the EU internal market, which includes, inter alia, the freedom to establish and to provide services in all Member States of the European Union.[9] Such investment tends to imply not only economic interests, but also non-economic interests for these entities.[10] Total sum of assets, or total sum of debts plus capital.[11] Advisory and consultancy services related to agriculture, hunting, forestry and fishing are to be found in BUSINESS SERVICES under 6.F.f) and 6.F.g).[12] Advisory and consultancy services related to agriculture, hunting, forestry and fishing are to be found in BUSINESS SERVICES under 6.F.f) and 6.F.g).[13] Advisory and consultancy services related to agriculture, hunting, forestry and fishing are to be found in BUSINESS SERVICES under 6.F.f) and 6.F.g).[14] The horizontal limitation on public utilities applies.[15] Does not include services incidental to mining rendered on a fee or contract basis at oil and gas fields which are to be found in ENERGY SERVICES under 19.A.[16] A juridical person is controlled by other natural or juridical person(s) if the latter has/have the power to name a majority of its directors or otherwise legally direct its actions.

Legal services in respect of EU law shall in principle be carried out by or through a fully qualified lawyer admitted to the Bar in a Member State of the European Union acting personally, and legal services in respect of the law of a Member State of the European Union shall in principle be carried out by or through a fully qualified lawyer admitted to the Bar in that Member State acting personally. Full admission to the Bar in the relevant Member State of the European Union might therefore be necessary for representation before courts and other competent authorities in the EU Party since it involves practice of EU and national procedural law.

The Parties recognise the importance of the cross-border transfer of information by financial service suppliers. Korea has expressed its intent to undertake modification to its regulatory regime that will result in its adoption of approaches that will permit the transfer of financial information across borders while addressing such areas as the protection of sensitive information of consumers, prohibitions on unauthorised reuse of the sensitive information, the ability of financial regulators to have access to records of financial service suppliers relating to the handling of such information, and requirements for the location of technology facilities [1].Performance of functions2. The Parties recognise the benefits of allowing a financial service supplier in a Party’s territory to perform certain functions at its head office or affiliates located inside or outside the Party’s territory. To the extent practicable, each Party should allow such an office or affiliate to perform these functions which generally include, but are not limited to:(a) trade and transaction processing functions, including confirmation and statement production;(b) technology-related functions, such as data processing [2], programming and system development;(c) administrative services, including procurement, travel arrangements, mailing services, physical security, office space management and secretarial services;(d) human resource activities, including training and education;(e) accounting functions, including bank reconciliation, budgeting, payroll, tax, account reconciliation and customer and proprietary accounting; and(f) legal functions, including the provision of advice and litigation strategy.3.

The regulation of insurance services supplied by a Party’s postal service supplier to the public should not accord to the Party’s postal service supplier a competitive advantage over private service suppliers of like insurance services in the territory of the Party.6. To this end, Korea should, to the extent practicable, provide that the Financial Services Commission (hereinafter referred to as the \"FSC\") exercise regulatory oversight over the insurance underwriting services supplied by Korea Post to the public and that those services be subject to the same rules applicable to private suppliers supplying like insurance underwriting services in its territory [3].Sectoral cooperatives selling insurance7. The regulation of insurance services supplied by a sectoral cooperative should not provide the cooperative a competitive advantage over private suppliers of like insurance services. To the extent practicable, a Party should apply the same rules to services supplied by such cooperatives that it applies to like services supplied by private insurers.8. To this end, the FSC should exercise regulatory oversight over services supplied by sectoral cooperatives. At a minimum, Korea shall provide that no later than three years after the entry into force of this Agreement, solvency matters related to the sale of insurance by the National Agricultural Cooperative Federation, the National Federation of Fisheries Cooperatives, the Korea Federation of Community Credit Cooperatives and the National Credit Union Federation of Korea shall be subject to regulation by the FSC.Self-Regulatory Organisations9. The Korea Insurance Development Institute is subject to the discipline of Article 7.40. This confirmation is without prejudice to the status of any other organisation in this or any other financial services sub-sector.10. For greater certainty, if each Party’s financial regulatory authority delegates a function related to insurance to a self-regulatory organisation or other non-governmental body, the authority shall take reasonable steps to ensure compliance with Article 7.39 (Transparency) and Article 7.23.2 (Domestic Regulation) with regard to any actions taken by the organisation or other non-governmental body pursuant to the delegated function.[1] This includes, in particular, the transfer of information for the purpose of compliance with transparency and reporting requirements of financial services suppliers with regard to financial regulators of their home country.[2] To the extent that a Party is obligated under Article 7.43 to allow the transfer of information outside its territory, that Party shall also allow data processing of that information after the transfer.[3] This commitment shall also apply to the European Union in case the postal service supplier of any jurisdiction of a Member State of the European Union engages in insurance underwriting services in its territory.--------------------------------------------------ANNEX 8Intentionally left blank--------------------------------------------------ANNEX 9BOT CONTRACTS AND PUBLIC WORKS CONCESSIONSArticle 1Definitions1.

A Party may request, at any time, that the other Party enter into a mediation procedure. Such request shall be addressed to the other Party in writing. The request shall be sufficiently detailed to present clearly the concerns of the requesting Party and shall:(a) identify the specific measure at issue;(b) provide a statement of the alleged adverse effects that the requesting Party believes the measure has on trade between the Parties; and(c) explain how the requesting Party considers that those trade effects are linked to the measure.2. The Party to which such request is addressed shall favourably consider the request and provide a written reply to the request within 15 days of its receipt.Article 4Selection of mediator1. Upon launch of the mediation procedure, the Parties are encouraged to agree on a mediator no later than 15 days after the receipt of the reply to the request. If the Parties cannot agree on the mediator within the established time frame, either Party may request appointment of the mediator by lot. Within five days of the submission of the request, each Party shall establish a list of at least three persons who are not nationals of that Party, fulfil the conditions of paragraph 2 and may act as mediator. Within five days of submission of the list, each Party shall select at least one name from the other Party’s list. The chair of the Trade Committee or the chair’s delegate shall then select the mediator by lot among the selected names. The selection by lot shall be made in the presence of representatives of the Parties and within 15 days of the submission of the request for appointment by lot.2. The mediator shall be an expert on the subject matter to which the measure in question relates [2]. The mediator shall assist, in an impartial and transparent manner, the Parties in bringing clarity to the measure and its possible trade effects, and in reaching a mutually agreed solution.Article 5Rules of the mediation procedure1. In the initial stage of the procedure, within 10 days of the appointment of the mediator, the Party having launched the mediation procedure shall present, in writing, a detailed description of the problem to the mediator and to the other Party, in particular of the operation of the measure at issue and its trade effects. Within 20 days of the date of delivery of this submission, the other Party may provide, in writing, its comments to the description of the problem. Either Party may include in its description or comments any information that it deems relevant.2. The mediator may decide on the most appropriate way of conducting the initial stage, in particular whether to consult the Parties jointly or individually, seek the assistance of or consult with relevant experts and stakeholders.3. Following the initial stage, the mediator may provide an advisory opinion and propose a solution for the Parties’ consideration. In any such opinion, the mediator shall not consider whether the measure at issue is consistent or not with this Agreement; nor shall the mediator question the legitimacy of the policy objectives of the measure. The mediator may meet individually or jointly with the Parties in order to facilitate a mutually agreed solution. This stage of the procedure shall normally be completed within 60 days of the date of the appointment of the mediator.4. The procedure shall be confidential and shall take place in the territory of the Party to which the request was addressed, or by a mutual agreement in any other location or by any other means.5. The procedure shall be terminated:(a) by the signature of a settlement agreement by the Parties, on the date of that signature;(b) by a mutual agreement of the Parties at any stage of the procedure, on the date of that agreement;(c) by a written declaration of the mediator, after consultation with the Parties, that further efforts at mediation are no longer justified; or(d) by a written declaration of a Party after exploring mutually agreed solutions under the mediation n procedure and after having considered any advisory opinions and proposals by the mediator.SECTION BIMPLEMENTATIONArticle 6Implementation of a mutually agreed solution1. Where the Parties have agreed to a solution, each Party shall take any measure necessary to implement the mutually agreed solution without undue delay.2. The implementing Party shall inform the other Party in writing of any steps or measures taken to implement the mutually agreed solution.SECTION CGENERAL PROVISIONSArticle 7Relationship to dispute settlement1. The procedure under this mediation mechanism is not intended to serve as a basis for dispute settlement procedures under this Agreement or another agreement. A Party shall not rely on or introduce as evidence in such dispute settlement procedures:(a) positions taken by the other Party in the course of the mediation procedure;(b) the fact that the other Party has indicated its willingness to accept a solution to the non-tariff measure subject to mediation; or(c) proposals made by the mediator.2. The mediation mechanism is without prejudice to the Parties’ rights and obligations under Chapter Fourteen (Dispute Settlement).Article 8Time limitsAny time limit referred to in this Annex may be extended by mutual agreement of the Parties.Article 9Costs1. Each Party shall bear its own expenses derived from the participation in the mediation procedure.2. The Parties shall share the expenses derived from organisational matters, including the expenses of the mediator.Article 10Review1. The Parties agree that any matter not falling within the scope defined in Article 14.2 shall become subject to the mediation mechanism if WTO Members agree on the establishment of a corresponding mechanism [3] that covers such matter. The extension of the scope of application shall be as from the date of application of the latter agreement. This shall also apply to any further extensions of the scope of application of the WTO corresponding mechanism.2. Five years after the entry into force of this Agreement, the Parties shall consult each other on the need to modify the mediation mechanism in light of the experience gained and the development of a corresponding mechanism in the WTO.[1] For the purposes of this Annex, market access in goods covers non-agricultural market access (NAMA) and its related trade rules including trade remedies, technical barriers to trade, sanitary and phytosanitary measures, trade facilitation, rules of origin, safeguards and the Sectoral Annexes to Chapter Two (National Treatment and Market Access for Goods). It excludes trade in agricultural products, services and establishment, cultural cooperation, government procurement, competition, intellectual property rights, payments and capital movements and trade and sustainable development.[2] For example, in cases concerning standards and technical requirements, the mediator should have expertise in the area of relevant international standard setting bodies.[3] The Parties understand that \"corresponding mechanism\" means the mechanism proposed by the African Group, Canada, European Union, LDC Group, NAMA -11 Group of Developing Countries, New Zealand, Norway, Pakistan and Switzerland in the document TN/MA/W/88 of 23 July 2007, \"Non Tariff Barriers – Proposal on Procedures for the Facilitation of Solutions to NTBs\", or any other similar mechanism proposed in documents replacing document TN/MA/W/88 of 23 July 2007.--------------------------------------------------ANNEX 14-BRULES OF PROCEDURE FOR ARBITRATIONArticle 1General provisions1.

This liberalisation applies to over 98% of goods (listed in Annex 2-A).\nThere are longer transition periods (7 years or more) for the elimination of duties for certain sensitive farm or fishery products.\nIn certain circumstances, one party may apply bilateral safeguard measures where an increase in imports causes or threatens to cause serious damage (e.g. loss of market share or reduced prices) to the relevant sector in their own economy.\nOn technical barriers to trade (TBTs), the EU and Korea agree to cooperate on standards and regulations, opening discussions when appropriate.\nSanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) measures may be introduced in order to protect human, animal or plant life or health. However, the partners agree to minimise the effects of these measures on the development of trade.\nTrade in services, establishment and e-commerce\nThe partners agree to liberalise part of their offer of services in accordance with the WTO’s General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS). They have therefore drawn up a list of commitments and limitations (Annex 7-A) concerning the liberalised service sectors.\nThe agreement defines the rules on the right of establishment for access to the market in services, and on the right of residence for professionals.\nThe partners recognise that e-commerce contributes to economic growth and barriers to its use and development must be avoided. However, its development must be fully compatible with international data protection standards.\nThe parties agree to open their financial services sectors to one another.\nGovernment procurement\nThe EU and Korea agree to give each other access to their markets in products and services, in compliance with the rules on openness, transparency and non-discrimination in the WTO’s Agreement on Government Procurement.\nThe rules applying to public works contracts are laid down in Annex 9 to the agreement.\nIntellectual property\nThis chapter includes the parties’ commitments with regard to intellectual property rights (IPRs) and in particular trademarks, copyright, designs and geographical indications. These complement and update the WTO Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) Agreement. The chapter also includes a section on enforcement of IPRs based on the EU’s internal rules contained in the enforcement directive.\nDispute settlement\nIn the event of non-compliance with the FTA, there is a dispute settlement mechanism similar to that of the WTO. The FTA dispute settlement involves consultation and arbitration, and there is a mediation mechanism.\nSustainable development\nThe EU and South Korea are committed to implementing the conventions and standards of the International Labour Organization ratified by the parties, as well as the multilateral environmental agreements they have signed.\nThe partners agree to set up institutional structures to implement and monitor their joint commitments and mechanisms for cooperation on trade and sustainable development.\nAmendment of the agreement\nIn 2014, the agreement was amended to take account of Croatia’s joining the EU in July 2013. Croatia now benefits from the same conditions as other EU countries.\nEvaluation process\nIn 2016, the European Commission published the terms of reference for an evaluation of the impact of implementing the FTA. Experience in implementing this FTA may in the future serve as a basis for improving the design of similar agreements being negotiated with other countries.\nFROM WHEN DOES THE AGREEMENT APPLY?\nThe FTA has been provisionally applied since July 2011 and formally entered into force on 13 December 2015.\nThe additional protocol to the FTA to take account of Croatia’s joining the EU entered into force on 1 January 2016.\nBACKGROUND\nAccording to a 2010 study, this agreement should allow bilateral trade to double over the next 20 years compared to a situation without an agreement in place.\nFor more information, see:\nSouth Korea (European Commission)\nExporters’ stories (European Commission)\nEU-South Korea Free Trade Agreement: A quick reading guide, October 2010 (European Commission).\nMAIN DOCUMENTS\n            \nCouncil Decision 2011/265/EU of 16 September 2010 on the signing, on behalf of the European Union, and provisional application of the Free Trade Agreement between the European Union and its Member States, of the one part, and the Republic of Korea, of the other part (OJ L 127, 14.5.2011, pp. 1–3)\nFree trade Agreement between the European Union and its Member States, of the one part, and the Republic of Korea, of the other part (OJ L 127, 14.5.2011, pp. 6–1343)\nSuccessive amendments to the agreement have been incorporated in the original text.
