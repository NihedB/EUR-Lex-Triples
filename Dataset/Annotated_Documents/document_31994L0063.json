Whereas emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from petrol and solvents in the Community  would be in the order of 10 million tonnes per year if no control measures were taken; whereas VOC  emissions contribute to the formation of photochemical oxidants such as ozone, which in high  concentrations can impair human health and damage vegetation and materials; whereas some of the VOC  emissions from petrol are classified as toxic, carcinogenic or teratogenic; Whereas on 2 April 1992 the Community signed the Protocol to the 1979 Convention on long range  transboundary air pollution concerning the control of emissions of volatile organic compounds  (VOCs) or their transboundary fluxes, which provides for a considerable reduction of the VOC  emissions; Whereas a significant step in a strategy for an overall reduction of VOC emissions in the Community  was taken by Council Directive 91/441/EEC of 26 June 1991 amending Directive 70/220/EEC on the  approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to measures to be taken against air  pollution by emissions from motor vehicles (5) which aims at reducing by some 80 to 90 %, over 10  to 15 years, VOC emissions from tail-pipe exhaust gases and evaporative emissions from motor  vehicles, representing some 40 % of the present emissions of man-made VOCs to the atmosphere;  whereas, at the time of adoption of that Directive, the Commission was requested to submit a  proposal for a Directive on the measures to reduce evaporation losses at every stage in the process  of storage and distribution of motor fuels; Whereas the VOC emissions from the system for storage and distribution of petrol represent some 500  000 tonnes per year or some 5 % of the total emissions of man-made VOCs in the Community; whereas  these emissions, represent a significant contribution to air pollution especially in urban areas; Whereas available technologies can ensure a considerable reduction of the evaporative losses in the  distribution system for petrol, not least through the recovery of vapours which are displaced; Whereas, on grounds of international standardization and of safety during the loading of ships,  standards must be drawn up at International Maritime Organization level for vapour control and  recovery systems to apply to both loading installations and ships; whereas the Community must  therefore endeavour to ensure that the necessary provisions are introduced into the Marpol  Convention during the current revision of Marpol due to be completed in 1996; whereas in the event  that the Marpol Convention is not so revised, the Community, after discussion with its major  trading partners, should propose appropriate measures to apply to ships and port installations  servicing ships; Whereas further action will be needed to reduce the vapour emissions during refuelling operations  at service stations, which at present amount so some 200 000 tonnes per year, thereby controlling  all vapour emissions during the distribution of petrol; Whereas, in order to avoid distortion of competition and in order to ensure the operation of the  internal market, it is necessary to harmonize certain measures concerning the distribution of  petrol on the basis of a high level of environmental protection; Whereas account should nevertheless be taken of the advantages and burdens which may result from  action or the absence of action; whereas it is therefore appropriate to provide for the possibility  of derogations and sometimes of exclusions in certain cases; whereas certain Member States should  also be given the option of longer periods in which to adapt in order to take account of any major  environmental measures of differing kinds which they may already have adopted in this area or of  the particular burden imposed by the measures in this Directive owing to the structure of their  networks; Whereas Community action must take account of environmental conditions in the various regions of  the Community; whereas in this connection Member States must be able to uphold or impose more  stringent measures relating to the evaporative losses from fixed installations throughout their  territory or in geographical areas where it is established that such measures are necessary for the  protection of human health or the environment because of special conditions; Whereas the provisions of paragraph 1 of Articles 3, 4 and 6 of this Directive apply without  prejudice to Council Directive 83/189/EEC of 28 March 1983 laying down a procedure for the  provision of information in the field of technical standards and regulations; Whereas it is necessary to introduce harmonized specifications for the equipment for bottom loading  of road tankers in order to ensure the possibility of free trade in petrol and equipment within the  Community and to ensure a high level of safety; whereas provision should be made for standardizing  such specifications and adapting them to technical progress; Whereas a committee should be set up to assist the Commission in adapting the Annexes to this  Directive to technical progress, HAVE ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE: Article 1 Scope This Directive shall apply to the operations, installations, vehicles and vessels used for storage,  loading and transport of petrol from one terminal to another or from a terminal to a service  station.

The external wall and  roof of tanks above ground must be painted in a colour with a total radiant heat reflectance of 70  % or more. These operations may be programmed so as to be carried out as part of the usual  maintenance cycles of the tanks within a period of three years. Member States may grant a  derogation from this provision where required for the protection of special landscape areas which  have been designated by national authority. This provision shall not apply to tanks linked to a vapour recovery unit which conforms with the  requirements set out in Annex II, point 2. 2.  Tanks with external floating roofs must be equipped with a primary seal to cover the annular  space between the tank wall and the outer periphery of the floating roof and with a secondary seal  fitted above the primary seal. The seals should be designed to achieve an overall containment of  vapours of 95 % or more as compared to a comparable fixed-roof tank with no vapour-containment  controls (that is a fixed-roof tank with only vacuum/pressure relief valve). 3.  All new storage installations at terminals, where vapour recovery is required according to  Article 4 of the Directive (see Annex II) must be either: (a) fixed-roof tanks connected to the vapour recovery unit in conformity with the requirements of  Annex II; or (b) designed with a floating roof, either external or internal, equipped with primary and secondary  seals to meet the performance requirements set down in point 2. 4.  Existing fixed-roof tanks must either: (a) be connected to a vapour-recovery unit in conformity with the requirements of Annex II; or (b) have an internal floating roof with a primary seal which should be designed to achieve an  overall containment of vapours of 90 % or more in relation to a comparable fixed-roof tank with no  vapour controls. 5.  The requirements for vapour-containment controls mentioned under points 3 and 4 do not apply to  fixed-roof tanks at terminals, where intermediate storage of vapours is permitted according to  Annex II, point 1. ANNEX II REQUIREMENTS FOR LOADING AND UNLOADING INSTALLATIONS AT TERMINALS 1.   Displacement vapours from the mobile container being loaded must be returned through a vapour-tight  connection line to a vapour recovery unit for regeneration at the terminal. This provision does not apply to top-loading tankers as long as that loading system is permitted. At terminals which load petrol onto vessels, a vapour incineration unit may be substituted for a  vapour recovery unit if vapour recovery is unsafe or technically impossible because of the volume  of return vapour. The requirements concerning atmospheric emissions from the vapour recovery unit  shall also apply to the vapour incineration unit. At terminals with a throughput of less than 25 000 tonnes/year, intermediate storage of vapours may  be substituted for immediate vapour recovery at the terminal. 2.  The mean concentration of vapours in the exhaust from the vapour recovery - unit corrected for  dilution during treatment - must not exceed 35 g/normal cubic metre (Nm³) for any one hour. For vapour recovery units, installed before 1 January 1993, the United Kingdom may grant a  derogation from the limit value of 35 g/Nm³ for any one hour, set down in this Annex, subject to  the following conditions: - the installation shall meet a limit value of 50 g/Nm³ for any one hour measured according to the  specifications set down in this Annex, - the derogation shall expire at the latest nine years from the date referred to in Article 10 of  the Directive, - the Commission shall be notified of the individual installations affected by this derogation  including information on their throughput of petrol and vapour emissions from the installation. The Member States' competent authorities must ensure that the measurement and analysis methods and  their frequency are established. The measurements must be made over the course of one full working day (seven hours minimum) of  normal throughput. Measurements may be continuous or discontinuous. If discontinuous measurements are employed, at  least four measurements per hour must be made. The overall measurement error due to the equipment used, the calibration gas and the procedure used  must not exceed 10 % of the measured value. The equipment used must be capable of measuring concentrations at least as low as 3 g/Nm³. The precision must be at least 95 % of the measured value. 3.  The Member States' competent authorities must ensure that the connection lines and pipe  installations are checked regularly for leaks. 4.  The Member States' competent authorities must ensure that loading operations are shut down at  the gantry in the case of a leak of vapour. Equipment for such shutdown operations must be  installed at the gantry. 5.  Where top-loading of mobile containers is permissible, the outlet of the loading arm must be  kept near the bottom of the mobile container, in order to avoid splash loading. ANNEX III REQUIREMENTS FOR LOADING AND STORAGE INSTALLATIIONS AT SERVICE STATIONS AND  TERMINALS WHERE THE INTERMEDIATE STORAGE OF VAPOURS IS CARRIED OUT Vapours displaced by the  delivery of petrol into storage installations at service stations and in fixed-roof tanks used for  the intermediate storage of vapours must be returned through a vapour-tight connection line to the  mobile container delivering the petrol. Loading operations may not take place unless the  arrangements are in place and properly functioning.

Whereas emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from petrol and solvents in the Community  would be in the order of 10 million tonnes per year if no control measures were taken; whereas VOC  emissions contribute to the formation of photochemical oxidants such as ozone, which in high  concentrations can impair human health and damage vegetation and materials; whereas some of the VOC  emissions from petrol are classified as toxic, carcinogenic or teratogenic; Whereas on 2 April 1992 the Community signed the Protocol to the 1979 Convention on long range  transboundary air pollution concerning the control of emissions of volatile organic compounds  (VOCs) or their transboundary fluxes, which provides for a considerable reduction of the VOC  emissions; Whereas a significant step in a strategy for an overall reduction of VOC emissions in the Community  was taken by Council directive 91/441/eec of 26 June 1991 amending directive 70/220/eec on the  approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to measures to be taken against air  pollution by emissions from motor vehicles (5) which aims at reducing by some 80 to 90 %, over 10  to 15 years, VOC emissions from tail-pipe exhaust gases and evaporative emissions from motor  vehicles, representing some 40 % of the present emissions of man-made VOCs to the atmosphere;  whereas, at the time of adoption of that Directive, the Commission was requested to submit a  proposal for a Directive on the measures to reduce evaporation losses at every stage in the process  of storage and distribution of motor fuels; Whereas the VOC emissions from the system for storage and distribution of petrol represent some 500  000 tonnes per year or some 5 % of the total emissions of man-made VOCs in the Community; whereas  these emissions, represent a significant contribution to air pollution especially in urban areas; Whereas available technologies can ensure a considerable reduction of the evaporative losses in the  distribution system for petrol, not least through the recovery of vapours which are displaced; Whereas, on grounds of international standardization and of safety during the loading of ships,  standards must be drawn up at International Maritime Organization level for vapour control and  recovery systems to apply to both loading installations and ships; whereas the Community must  therefore endeavour to ensure that the necessary provisions are introduced into the Marpol  Convention during the current revision of Marpol due to be completed in 1996; whereas in the event  that the Marpol Convention is not so revised, the Community, after discussion with its major  trading partners, should propose appropriate measures to apply to ships and port installations  servicing ships; Whereas further action will be needed to reduce the vapour emissions during refuelling operations  at service stations, which at present amount so some 200 000 tonnes per year, thereby controlling  all vapour emissions during the distribution of petrol; Whereas, in order to avoid distortion of competition and in order to ensure the operation of the  internal market, it is necessary to harmonize certain measures concerning the distribution of  petrol on the basis of a high level of environmental protection; Whereas account should nevertheless be taken of the advantages and burdens which may result from  action or the absence of action; whereas it is therefore appropriate to provide for the possibility  of derogations and sometimes of exclusions in certain cases; whereas certain Member States should  also be given the option of longer periods in which to adapt in order to take account of any major  environmental measures of differing kinds which they may already have adopted in this area or of  the particular burden imposed by the measures in this Directive owing to the structure of their  networks; Whereas Community action must take account of environmental conditions in the various regions of  the Community; whereas in this connection Member States must be able to uphold or impose more  stringent measures relating to the evaporative losses from fixed installations throughout their  territory or in geographical areas where it is established that such measures are necessary for the  protection of human health or the environment because of special conditions; Whereas the provisions of paragraph 1 of Articles 3, 4 and 6 of this Directive apply without  prejudice to Council directive 83/189/eec of 28 March 1983 laying down a procedure for the  provision of information in the field of technical standards and regulations; Whereas it is necessary to introduce harmonized specifications for the equipment for bottom loading  of road tankers in order to ensure the possibility of free trade in petrol and equipment within the  Community and to ensure a high level of safety; whereas provision should be made for standardizing  such specifications and adapting them to technical progress; Whereas a committee should be set up to assist the Commission in adapting the Annexes to this  Directive to technical progress, HAVE ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE: Article 1 Scope This Directive shall apply to the operations, installations, vehicles and vessels used for storage,  loading and transport of petrol from one terminal to another or from a terminal to a service  station.

The external wall and  roof of tanks above ground must be painted in a colour with a total radiant heat reflectance of 70  % or more. These operations may be programmed so as to be carried out as part of the usual  maintenance cycles of the tanks within a period of three years. Member States may grant a  derogation from this provision where required for the protection of special landscape areas which  have been designated by national authority. This provision shall not apply to tanks linked to a vapour recovery unit which conforms with the  requirements set out in Annex II, point 2. 2.  Tanks with external floating roofs must be equipped with a primary seal to cover the annular  space between the tank wall and the outer periphery of the floating roof and with a secondary seal  fitted above the primary seal. The seals should be designed to achieve an overall containment of  vapours of 95 % or more as compared to a comparable fixed-roof tank with no vapour-containment  controls (that is a fixed-roof tank with only vacuum/pressure relief valve). 3.  All new storage installations at terminals, where vapour recovery is required according to  Article 4 of the Directive (see Annex II) must be either: (a) fixed-roof tanks connected to the vapour recovery unit in conformity with the requirements of  Annex II; or (b) designed with a floating roof, either external or internal, equipped with primary and secondary  seals to meet the performance requirements set down in point 2. 4.  Existing fixed-roof tanks must either: (a) be connected to a vapour-recovery unit in conformity with the requirements of Annex II; or (b) have an internal floating roof with a primary seal which should be designed to achieve an  overall containment of vapours of 90 % or more in relation to a comparable fixed-roof tank with no  vapour controls. 5.  The requirements for vapour-containment controls mentioned under points 3 and 4 do not apply to  fixed-roof tanks at terminals, where intermediate storage of vapours is permitted according to  Annex II, point 1. ANNEX II REQUIREMENTS FOR LOADING AND UNLOADING INSTALLATIONS AT TERMINALS 1.   Displacement vapours from the mobile container being loaded must be returned through a vapour-tight  connection line to a vapour recovery unit for regeneration at the terminal. This provision does not apply to top-loading tankers as long as that loading system is permitted. At terminals which load petrol onto vessels, a vapour incineration unit may be substituted for a  vapour recovery unit if vapour recovery is unsafe or technically impossible because of the volume  of return vapour. The requirements concerning atmospheric emissions from the vapour recovery unit  shall also apply to the vapour incineration unit. At terminals with a throughput of less than 25 000 tonnes/year, intermediate storage of vapours may  be substituted for immediate vapour recovery at the terminal. 2.  The mean concentration of vapours in the exhaust from the vapour recovery - unit corrected for  dilution during treatment - must not exceed 35 g/normal cubic metre (Nm³) for any one hour. For vapour recovery units, installed before 1 January 1993, the United Kingdom may grant a  derogation from the limit value of 35 g/Nm³ for any one hour, set down in this Annex, subject to  the following conditions: - the installation shall meet a limit value of 50 g/Nm³ for any one hour measured according to the  specifications set down in this Annex, - the derogation shall expire at the latest nine years from the date referred to in Article 10 of  the Directive, - the Commission shall be notified of the individual installations affected by this derogation  including information on their throughput of petrol and vapour emissions from the installation. The Member States' competent authorities must ensure that the measurement and analysis methods and  their frequency are established. The measurements must be made over the course of one full working day (seven hours minimum) of  normal throughput. Measurements may be continuous or discontinuous. If discontinuous measurements are employed, at  least four measurements per hour must be made. The overall measurement error due to the equipment used, the calibration gas and the procedure used  must not exceed 10 % of the measured value. The equipment used must be capable of measuring concentrations at least as low as 3 g/Nm³. The precision must be at least 95 % of the measured value. 3.  The Member States' competent authorities must ensure that the connection lines and pipe  installations are checked regularly for leaks. 4.  The Member States' competent authorities must ensure that loading operations are shut down at  the gantry in the case of a leak of vapour. Equipment for such shutdown operations must be  installed at the gantry. 5.  Where top-loading of mobile containers is permissible, the outlet of the loading arm must be  kept near the bottom of the mobile container, in order to avoid splash loading. ANNEX III REQUIREMENTS FOR LOADING AND STORAGE INSTALLATIIONS AT SERVICE STATIONS AND  TERMINALS WHERE THE INTERMEDIATE STORAGE OF VAPOURS IS CARRIED OUT Vapours displaced by the  delivery of petrol into storage installations at service stations and in fixed-roof tanks used for  the intermediate storage of vapours must be returned through a vapour-tight connection line to the  mobile container delivering the petrol. Loading operations may not take place unless the  arrangements are in place and properly functioning.
