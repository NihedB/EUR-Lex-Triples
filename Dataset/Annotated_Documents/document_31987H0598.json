(1) COM(86) 754 final.  EUROPEAN CODE OF CONDUCT RELATING TO ELECTRONIC PAYMENT  I. OBJECTIVE  1. The Code sets out the conditions which should be fulfilled if the new, electronic means of payment are to be developed for the benefit of all economic partners and are to afford:  - for consumers, security and convenience,  - for traders and issuers, greater security and productivity,  - for industry in the Community, a leading market.  2. The principles of fair practice must be observed by all those who bring card payment systems into operation or make use of them.  3. The technological development of electronic means of payment should have an eye to their European dimension: such means must be as widely interoperable as possible, to avoid having isolated systems and, hence, a partitioned market.  II. DEFINITIONS  For the purposes of this Code:  1. 'Electronic payment' means any payment transaction carried out by means of a card incorporating a magnetic strip or microcircuit used at an electronic payment terminal (EPT) or point-of-sale (POS) terminal.  The Code does not cover:  - 'company-specific' cards not covered by the above definition,  - cards serving purposes other than direct or deferred payment,  - payments by cheque with bank-card guarantee,  - payments by card using mechanical processes (invoice slips).  2. 'Issuer' means any banking or credit institution issuing a payment card for electronic use, plus any production or service undertaking which can also issue such a card.  3. 'Trader' means distributive trading or service establishment.  4. 'Consumer' means cardholder.  5. 'Interoperability' means a state of affairs whereby cards issued in one Member State and/or belonging to a given card system can be used in other Member States and/or in the networks installed by other systems. This requires that the cards and readers used in the various systems must be technologically compatible and that systems must be opened up by means of reciprocity agreements.  III. GENERAL PRINCIPLES  1. Contracts  (a) Contracts concluded by issuers, or their agents, with traders and consumers shall be in writing and must be the result of a prior application. They shall set out in detail the general and specific conditions of the agreement.  (b) They shall be drawn up in the official language(s) of the Member State in which the contract is concluded.  (c) Any scale of charges must be determined in a transparent manner, taking account of actual costs and risks and without involving any restriction of competition.  (d) All conditions, provided they are in conformity with the law, shall be freely negotiable and clearly stipulated in the contract.  (e) Conditions specific to termination of a contract must be stated and brought to the notice of the parties prior to such contract being concluded. 2. Interoperability  By a given date (1), interoperability, in the Comunity at any rate, should be full and complete, so that traders and consumers can join the network(s) or contract with the issuer(s) of their choice, with each terminal being able to process all cards.  3. Equipment  (a) Electronic payment terminals are required to register, control and transmit payments and may be integrated into a point-of-sale terminal.  (b) Traders must be able, if they wish, to install a single, multi-card-terminal.  (c) Traders must be free to choose which point-of-sale terminal they will install. They must be at liberty either to rent or purchase such equipment, provided only that it is certified as satisfying the requirements of the whole payment system and can be used on an interoperable basis.  4. Data protection and security  (a) Electronic payments are irreversible. An order given by means of a payment card shall be irrevocable and may not be countermanded.  (b) The information transmitted, at the time of payment, to the trader's bank and subsequently to the issuer must not in any circumstances prejudice the protection of privacy. It shall be strictly limited to that normally laid down for cheques and transfers.  (c) Any problems whatsoever that arise in connection with the protection of information or with security must be openly acknowledged and cleared up at whatever stage in the contract between the parties.  (d) Contracts must not restrict trader's freedom of operation or freedom to compete.  5. Fair access to the system  (a) Irrespective of their economic size, all service establishments concerned must be allowed fair access to the system of electronic payment. A trader may be refused access for a legitimate reason only.  (b) There must be no unwarranted difference in the remuneration for services concerning transactions within one Member State and the remuneration for the same services concerning transnational transactions with other Community countries, especially in border regions.  IV. SUPPLEMENTARY PROVISIONS  1. Relations between issuers and traders  (a) To promote mutual access among different card systems, contracts between card issuers and traders must contain no exclusive trading clause requiring the trader to operate only the system with which he has contracted an agreement.  (b) Contracts with traders must admit effective competition between the various issuers. Compulsory provisions must be limited strictly to technical requirements for ensuring that the system functions properly.  2. Relations between issuers and consumers  Cardholders shall take all reasonable precautions to ensure the safety of the card issued and shall observe the special conditions (loss or theft) in the contract which they have signed.  3. Relations between traders and consumers  Traders shall display, in a fully visible manner, the signs of the companies to which they are affiliated; they shall be obliged to accept such cards.
