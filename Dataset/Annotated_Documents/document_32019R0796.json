These cyber-attacks include those against non-EU countries or international organisations where action is considered necessary to achieve the EU’s common foreign and security policy objectives.\nKEY POINTS\nSanctions for listed persons and entities\nThis framework allows the EU to impose sanctions on persons or entities responsible for cyber-attacks or attempted cyber-attacks, who provide financial, technical or material support for such attacks or who are involved in other ways. Sanctions may also be imposed on persons or entities associated with them. Restrictive measures include bans on persons travelling to the EU, and asset freezing.\nPersons subject to such sanctions will be listed in Annex I of Decision CFSP 2019/797, as identified by the Council; all funds and economic resources belonging to, owned, held or controlled by any natural or legal person, entity or body listed in Annex I will be frozen.\nEU countries are responsible for setting out rules on penalties for infringements.\nCyber-attacks\nThe cyber-attacks falling within the scope of this new sanctions regime are those which have significant impact and which:\noriginate or are carried out from outside the EU; or\nuse infrastructure outside the EU; or\nare carried out by persons or entities established or operating outside the EU; or\nare carried out with the support of person or entities operating outside the EU.\nCyber-attacks which are a threat to EU countries include those affecting information systems relating to:\ncritical infrastructure essential to the vital functions of society, or citizens’ health, safety, security, and economic or social well-being;\nservices necessary for essential social and economic activities, in particular energy, transport, banking; finance, healthcare, drinking water, digital infrastructure;\ncritical state functions, in particular defence, the governance and functioning of institutions, public elections, economic and civil infrastructure, internal security, and external relations, including diplomatic missions;\nthe storage or processing of classified information; or\ngovernment emergency response teams.\nFROM WHEN DO THE DECISION AND THE REGULATION APPLY?\n              \nThey have applied since 18 May 2019.\nBACKGROUND\n              \nA joint communication issued in June 2018 pointed out that activities by State and non-state actors such as cyber-attacks disrupting the economy and public services, through targeted disinformation campaigns, to hostile military actions continue to pose a serious and acute threat to the EU and to EU countries. It identified areas where action should be intensified to further deepen and strengthen the EU contribution to addressing these threats, and called upon EU countries and the Commission to ensure swift follow-up.\nIn October 2018, in the wake of the cyber attacks on the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, the European Council adopted conclusions calling for measures to be drawn up to further strengthen the EU’s deterrence, resilience and response to hybrid, cyber as well as chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear threats. The Council was called upon to devise a sanctions regime specific to cyber-attacks.\nSee also:\nResilience, Deterrence and Defence: Building strong cybersecurity in Europe (European Commission)\nReform of cybersecurity in Europe (European Council and Council of the European Union)\nCyber-attacks: Council is now able to impose sanctions — Press release (European Council and Council of the European Union).\nKEY TERMS\n              \nCyber-attacks: unauthorised actions involving access to and interference with information systems, data interference or data interception.\nMAIN DOCUMENTS\n            \nCouncil Decision (CFSP) 2019/797 of 17 May 2019 concerning restrictive measures against cyber-attacks threatening the Union or its Member States (OJ L 129I, 17.5.2019, pp. 13-19)\nCouncil Regulation (EU) 2019/796 of 17 May 2019 concerning restrictive measures against cyber-attacks threatening the Union or its Member States (OJ L 129I, 17.5.2019, pp. 1-12)\nRELATED DOCUMENTS\n            \nJoint communication to the European Parliament, the European Council and the Council — Increasing resilience and bolstering capabilities to address hybrid threats (JOIN(2018) 16 final, 13.6.2018)\nlast update 20.01.2020", "tags": ["computer crime", "international sanctions", "economic sanctions", "information system", "data protection", "information technology", "information security", "EU restrictive measure", "information warfare"], "subjects": ["Common foreign and security policy"], "split": "train", "reference_annotations": {"32019R0796_p1": {"text": "(2)  regulation 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing directive 95/46/ec (General Data Protection Regulation) (OJ L 119, 4.5.2016, p. 1).", "triples": [" regulation 2016/679,  repealing,  directive 95/46/ec"]}, "32019R0796_p2": {"text": "(3)  regulation 2018/1725 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 October 2018 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data by the Union institutions, bodies, offices and agencies and on the free movement of such data, and repealing regulation 45/2001 and decision 1247/2002/ec (OJ L 295, 21.11.2018, p. 39).", "triples": [" regulation 2018/1725,  repealing,  regulation 45/2001", " regulation 2018/1725,  repealing,  decision 1247/2002/ec"]}}, "summary_annotations": {}}
