Now that new amendments are being made to the Directive, it is desirable, for reasons of clarity and rationalisation, that the provisions in question should be recast.(4) Living organisms, whether released into the environment in large or small amounts for experimental purposes or as commercial products, may reproduce in the environment and cross national frontiers thereby affecting other Member States. The effects of such releases on the environment may be irreversible.(5) The protection of human health and the environment requires that due attention be given to controlling risks from the deliberate release into the environment of genetically modified organisms (GMOs).(6) Under the Treaty, action by the Community relating to the environment should be based on the principle that preventive action should be taken.(7) It is necessary to approximate the laws of the Member States concerning the deliberate release into the environment of GMOs and to ensure the safe development of industrial products utilising GMOs.(8) The precautionary principle has been taken into account in the drafting of this Directive and must be taken into account when implementing it.(9) Respect for ethical principles recognised in a Member State is particularly important. Member States may take into consideration ethical aspects when GMOs are deliberately released or placed on the market as or in products.(10) For a comprehensive and transparent legislative framework, it is necessary to ensure that the public is consulted by either the Commission or the Member States during the preparation of measures and that they are informed of the measures taken during the implementation of this Directive.(11) Placing on the market also covers import. Products containing and/or consisting of GMOs covered by this Directive cannot be imported into the Community if they do not comply with its provisions.(12) Making GMOs available to be imported or handled in bulk quantities, such as agricultural commodities, should be regarded as placing on the market for the purpose of this Directive.(13) The content of this Directive duly takes into account international experience in this field and international trade commitments and should respect the requirements of the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety to the Convention on Biological Diversity. As soon as possible, and in any case before July 2001, the Commission should, in the context of the ratification of the Protocol, submit the appropriate proposals for its implementation.(14) Guidance on the implementation of provisions related to the definition of the placing on the market in this Directive should be provided by the Regulatory Committee.(15) When defining \"genetically modified organism\" for the purpose of this Directive, human beings should not be considered as organisms.(16) The provisions of this Directive should be without prejudice to national legislation in the field of environmental liability, while Community legislation in this field needs to be complemented by rules covering liability for different types of environmental damage in all areas of the European Union. To this end the Commission has undertaken to bring forward a legislative proposal on environmental liability before the end of 2001, which will also cover damage from GMOs.(17) This Directive should not apply to organisms obtained through certain techniques of genetic modification which have conventionally been used in a number of applications and have a long safety record.(18) It is necessary to establish harmonised procedures and criteria for the case-by-case evaluation of the potential risks arising from the deliberate release of GMOs into the environment.(19) A case-by-case environmental risk assessment should always be carried out prior to a release. It should also take due account of potential cumulative long-term effects associated with the interaction with other GMOs and the environment.(20) It is necessary to establish a common methodology to carry out the environmental risk assessment based on independent scientific advice. It is also necessary to establish common objectives for the monitoring of GMOs after their deliberate release or placing on the market as or in products. Monitoring of potential cumulative long-term effects should be considered as a compulsory part of the monitoring plan.(21) Member States and the Commission should ensure that systematic and independent research on the potential risks involved in the deliberate release or the placing on the market of GMOs is conducted. The necessary resources should be secured for such research by Member States and the Community in accordance with their budgetary procedures and independent researchers should be given access to all relevant material, while respecting intellectual property rights.(22) The issue of antibiotic-resistance genes should be taken into particular consideration when conducting the risk assessment of GMOs containing such genes.(23) The deliberate release of GMOs at the research stage is in most cases a necessary step in the development of new products derived from, or containing GMOs.(24) The introduction of GMOs into the environment should be carried out according to the \"step by step\" principle. This means that the containment of GMOs is reduced and the scale of release increased gradually, step by step, but only if evaluation of the earlier steps in terms of protection of human health and the environment indicates that the next step can be taken.(25) No GMOs, as or in products, intended for deliberate release are to be considered for placing on the market without first having been subjected to satisfactory field testing at the research and development stage in ecosystems which could be affected by their use.(26) The implementation of this Directive should be carried out in close liaison with the implementation of other relevant instruments such as Council Directive 91/414/EEC of 15 July 1991 concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market(5). In this context the competent authorities concerned with the implementation of this Directive and of those instruments, within the Commission and at national level, should coordinate their action as far as possible.(27) Concerning the environmental risk assessment for part C, risk management, labelling, monitoring, information to the public and safeguard clause, this Directive should be a point of reference for GMOs as or in products authorised by other Community legislation which should therefore provide for a specific environmental risk assessment, to be carried out in accordance with the principles set out in Annex II and on the basis of information specified in Annex III without prejudice to additional requirements laid down by the Community legislation mentioned above, and for requirements as regards risk management, labelling, monitoring as appropriate, information to the public and safeguard clause at least equivalent to that laid down in this Directive. To this end it is necessary to provide for cooperation with the Community and Member State bodies mentioned in this Directive for the purpose of its implementation.(28) It is necessary to establish a Community authorisation procedure for the placing on the market of GMOs, as or in products, where the intended use of the product involves the deliberate release of the organism(s) into the environment.(29) The Commission is invited to conduct a study which should contain an assessment of various options to improve further the consistency and efficiency of this framework, particularly focusing on a centralised authorisation procedure for the placing on the market of GMOs within the Community.(30) For sectoral legislation, monitoring requirements may have to be adapted to the product concerned.(31) Part C of this Directive does not apply to products covered by Council Regulation (EEC) No 2309/93 of 22 July 1993 laying down Community procedures for the authorisation and supervision of medicinal products for human and veterinary use and establishing a European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products(6), provided that it includes an environmental risk assessment equivalent to that provided for by this Directive.(32) Any person, before undertaking a deliberate release into the environment of a GMO, or the placing on the market of GMOs, as or in products, where the intended use of the product involves its deliberate release into the environment, is to submit a notification to the national competent authority.(33) That notification should contain a technical dossier of information including a full environmental risk assessment, appropriate safety and emergency response, and, in the case of products, precise instructions and conditions for use, and proposed labelling and packaging.(34) After notification, no deliberate release of GMOs should be carried out unless the consent of the competent authority has been obtained.(35) A notifier should be able to withdraw his dossier at any stage of the administrative procedures laid down in this Directive. The administrative procedure should come to an end when a dossier is withdrawn.(36) Rejection of a notification for the placing on the market of a GMO as or in products by a competent authority should be without prejudice to the submission of a notification of the same GMO to another competent authority.(37) An agreement should be reached at the end of the mediation period when no objections remain.(38) Rejection of a notification following a confirmed negative assessment report should be without prejudice to future decisions based on the notification of the same GMO to another competent authority.(39) In the interests of the smooth functioning of this Directive, Member States should be able to avail themselves of the various provisions for the exchange of information and experience before having recourse to the safeguard clause in this Directive.(40) In order to ensure that the presence of GMOs in products containing, or consisting of, genetically modified organisms is appropriately identified, the words \"This product contains genetically modified organisms\" should appear clearly either on a label or in an accompanying document.(41) A system should be designed using the appropriate committee procedure, for the assignment of a unique identifier to GMOs, taking into account relevant developments in international fora.(42) It is necessary to ensure traceability at all stages of the placing on the market of GMOs as or in products authorised under part C of this Directive.(43) It is necessary to introduce into this Directive an obligation to implement a monitoring plan in order to trace and identify any direct or indirect, immediate, delayed or unforeseen effects on human health or the environment of GMOs as or in products after they have been placed on the market.(44) Member States should be able, in accordance with the Treaty, to take further measures for monitoring and inspection, for example by official services, of the GMOs as or in products placed on the market.(45) Means should be sought for providing possibilities for facilitating the control of GMOs or their retrieval in the event of severe risk.(46) Comments by the public should be taken into consideration in the drafts of measures submitted to the Regulatory Committee.(47) The competent authority should give its consent only after it has been satisfied that the release will be safe for human health and the environment.(48) The administrative procedure for granting consents for the placing on the market of GMOs as or in products should be made more efficient and more transparent and first-time consent should be granted for a fixed period.(49) For products for which consent has been granted for a fixed period a streamlined procedure should apply as regards the renewal of consent.(50) The existing consents granted under Directive 90/220/EEC have to be renewed in order to avoid disparities between consents granted under that Directive and those pursuant to this Directive and in order to take full account of the conditions of consent under this Directive.(51) Such renewal requires a transitional period during which existing consents granted under Directive 90/220/EEC remain unaffected.(52) When a consent is renewed, it should be possible to revise all the conditions of the original consent, including those related to monitoring and the time limitation of the consent.(53) Provision should be made for consultation of the relevant Scientific Committee(s) established by Commission Decision 97/579/EC(7) on matters which are likely to have an impact on human health and/or the environment.(54) The system of exchange of information contained in notifications, established under Directive 90/220/EEC, has been useful and should be continued.(55) It is important to follow closely the development and use of GMOs.(56) When a product containing a GMO, as or in products, is placed on the market, and where such a product has been properly authorised under this Directive, a Member State may not prohibit, restrict or impede the placing on the market of GMOs, as or in products, which comply with the requirements of this Directive. A safeguard procedure should be provided in case of risk to human health or the environment.(57) The Commission's European Group on Ethics in Science and New Technologies should be consulted with a view to obtaining advice on ethical issues of a general nature regarding the deliberate release or placing on the market of GMOs. Such consultations should be without prejudice to the competence of Member States as regards ethical issues.(58) Member States should be able to consult any committee they have established with a view to obtaining advice on the ethical implications of biotechnology.(59) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Directive are to be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission(8).(60) The information exchange set up under this Directive should also cover experience gained with the consideration of ethical aspects.(61) In order to increase the effective implementation of the provisions adopted under this Directive it is appropriate to provide for penalties to be applied by Member States, including in the event of release or placing on the market contrary to the provisions of this Directive, particularly as a result of negligence.(62) A report to be issued every three years by the Commission, taking into account the information provided by Member States, should contain a separate chapter regarding the socioeconomic advantages and disadvantages of each category of GMOs authorised for placing on the market, which will take due account of the interest of farmers and consumers.(63) The regulatory framework for biotechnology should be reviewed so as to identify the feasibility of improving further the consistency and efficiency of that framework. Procedures may need to be adapted so as to optimise efficiency, and all options which might achieve that should be considered,HAVE ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:PART AGENERAL PROVISIONSArticle 1ObjectiveIn accordance with the precautionary principle, the objective of this Directive is to approximate the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States and to protect human health and the environment when:- carrying out the deliberate release into the environment of genetically modified organisms for any other purposes than placing on the market within the Community,- placing on the market genetically modified organisms as or in products within the Community.Article 2DefinitionsFor the purposes of this Directive:(1) \"organism\" means any biological entity capable of replication or of transferring genetic material;(2) \"genetically modified organism (GMO)\" means an organism, with the exception of human beings, in which the genetic material has been altered in a way that does not occur naturally by mating and/or natural recombination;Within the terms of this definition:(a) genetic modification occurs at least through the use of the techniques listed in Annex I A, part 1;(b) the techniques listed in Annex I A, part 2, are not considered to result in genetic modification;(3) \"deliberate release\" means any intentional introduction into the environment of a GMO or a combination of GMOs for which no specific containment measures are used to limit their contact with and to provide a high level of safety for the general population and the environment;(4) \"placing on the market\" means making available to third parties, whether in return for payment or free of charge;The following operations shall not be regarded as placing on the market:- making available genetically modified microorganisms for activities regulated under Council Directive 90/219/EEC of 23 April 1990 on the contained use of genetically modified microorganisms(9) including culture collections,- making available GMOs other than microorganisms referred to in the first indent, to be used exclusively for activities where appropriate stringent containment measures are used to limit their contact with and to provide a high level of safety for the general population and the environment, the measures should be based on the same principles of containment as laid down in Directive 90/219/EEC,- making available GMOs to be used exclusively for deliberate releases complying with the requirements laid down in part B of this Directive;(5) \"notification\" means the submission of the information required under this Directive to the competent authority of a Member State;(6) \"notifier\" means the person submitting the notification;(7) \"product\" means a preparation consisting of, or containing, a GMO or a combination of GMOs, which is placed on the market;(8) \"environmental risk assessment\" means the evaluation of risks to human health and the environment, whether direct or indirect, immediate or delayed, which the deliberate release or the placing on the market of GMOs may pose and carried out in accordance with Annex II.Article 3Exemptions1. This Directive shall not apply to organisms obtained through the techniques of genetic modification listed in Annex I B.2. This Directive shall not apply to the carriage of genetically modified organisms by rail, road, inland waterway, sea or air.Article 4General obligations1. Member States shall, in accordance with the precautionary principle, ensure that all appropriate measures are taken to avoid adverse effects on human health and the environment which might arise from the deliberate release or the placing on the market of GMOs. GMOs may only be deliberately released or placed on the market in conformity with part B or part C respectively.2. Any person shall, before submitting a notification under part B or part C, carry out an environmental risk assessment. The information which may be necessary to carry out the environmental risk assessment is laid down in Annex III. Member States and the Commission shall ensure that GMOs which contain genes expressing resistance to antibiotics in use for medical or veterinary treatment are taken into particular consideration when carrying out an environmental risk assessment, with a view to identifying and phasing out antibiotic resistance markers in GMOs which may have adverse effects on human health and the environment. This phasing out shall take place by the 31 December 2004 in the case of GMOs placed on the market according to part C and by 31 December 2008 in the case of GMOs authorised under part B.3. Member States and where appropriate the Commission shall ensure that potential adverse effects on human health and the environment, which may occur directly or indirectly through gene transfer from GMOs to other organisms, are accurately assessed on a case-by-case basis. This assessment shall be conducted in accordance with Annex II taking into account the environmental impact according to the nature of the organism introduced and the receiving environment.4. Member States shall designate the competent authority or authorities responsible for complying with the requirements of this Directive. The competent authority shall examine notifications under part B and part C for compliance with the requirements of this Directive and whether the assessment provided for in paragraph 2 is appropriate.5. Member States shall ensure that the competent authority organises inspections and other control measures as appropriate, to ensure compliance with this Directive. In the event of a release of GMO(s) or placing on the market as or in products for which no authorisation was given, the Member State concerned shall ensure that necessary measures are taken to terminate the release or placing on the market, to initiate remedial action if necessary, and to inform its public, the Commission and other Member States.6. Member States shall take measures to ensure traceability, in line with the requirements laid down in Annex IV, at all stages of the placing on the market of GMOs authorised under part C.PART BDELIBERATE RELASE OF GMOs FOR ANY OTHER PURPOSE THAN FOR PLACING ON THE MARKETArticle 51. Articles 6 to 11 shall not apply to medicinal substances and compunds for human use consisting of, or containing, a GMO or combination of GMOs provided that their deliberate release for any purpose other than that of being placed on the market is authorised by Community legislation which provides:(a) for a specific environmental risk assessment in accordance with Annex II and on the basis of the type of information specified in Annex III without prejudice to additional requirements provided for by the said legislation;(b) for explicit consent prior to release;(c) for a monitoring plan in accordance with the relevant parts of Annex III, with a view to detecting the effects of the GMO or GMOs on human health or the environment;(d) in an appropriate manner for requirements relating to treatment of new items of information, information to the public, information on the results of releases, and exchanges of information at least equivalent to those contained in this Directive and in the measures taken in accordance therewith.2. Assessment of the risks to the environment presented by such substances and compounds shall be carried out in coordination with the national and Community authorities mentioned in this Directive.3. Procedures ensuring conformity of the specific environmental risk assessment and equivalence with the provisions of this Directive must be provided for by the said legislation, which must refer to this Directive.Article 6Standard authorisation procedure1. Without prejudice to Article 5, any person must, before undertaking a deliberate release of a GMO or of a combination of GMOs, submit a notification to the competent authority of the Member State within whose territory the release is to take place.2. The notification referred to in paragraph 1 shall include:(a) a technical dossier supplying the information specified in Annex III necessary for carrying out the environmental risk assessment of the deliberate release of a GMO or combination of GMOs, in particular:(i) general information including information on personnel and training,(ii) information relating to the GMO(s),(iii) information relating to the conditions of release and the potential receiving environment,(iv) information on the interactions between the GMO(s) and the environment,(v) a plan for monitoring in accordance with the relevant parts of Annex III in order to identify effects of the GMO(s) on human health or the environment,(vi) information on control, remediation methods, waste treatment and emergency response plans,(vii) a summary of the dossier;(b) the environmental risk assessment and the conclusions required in Annex II, section D, together with any bibliographic reference and indications of the methods used.3. The notifier may refer to data or results from notifications previously submitted by other notifiers, provided that the information, data and results are non confidential or these notifiers have given their agreement in writing, or may submit additional information he considers relevant.4. The competent authority may accept that releases of the same GMO or of a combination of GMOs on the same site or on different sites for the same purpose and within a defined period may be notified in a single notification.5. The competent authority shall acknowledge the date of receipt of the notification and, having considered, where appropriate, any observations by other Member States made in accordance with Article 11, shall respond in writing to the notifier within 90 days of receipt of the notification by either:(a) indicating that it is satisfied that the notification is in compliance with this Directive and that the release may proceed; or(b) indicating that the release does not fulfil the conditions of this Directive and that notification is therefore rejected.6. For the purpose of calculating the 90 day period referred to in paragraph 5, no account shall be taken of any periods of time during which the competent authority:(a) is awaiting further information which it may have requested from the notifier, or(b) is carrying out a public inquiry or consultation in accordance with Article 9; this public inquiry or consultation shall not prolong the 90 day period referred to in paragraph 5 by more than 30 days.7. If the competent authority requests new information it must simultaneously give its reasons for so doing.8. The notifier may proceed with the release only when he has received the written consent of the competent authority, and in conformity with any conditions required in this consent.9. Member States shall ensure that no material derived from GMOs which are deliberately released in accordance with part B is placed on the market, unless in accordance with part C.Article 7Differentiated procedures1. If sufficient experience has been obtained of releases of certain GMOs in certain ecosystems and the GMOs concerned meet the criteria set out in Annex V, a competent authority may submit to the Commission a reasoned proposal for the application of differentiated procedures to such types of GMOs.2. Following its own initiative or at the latest 30 days following the receipt of a competent authority's proposal, the Commission shall,(a) forward the proposal to the competent authorities, which may, within 60 days, present observations and at the same time;(b) make available the proposal to the public which may, within 60 days, make comments; and(c) consult the relevant Scientific Committee(s) which may, within 60 days give an opinion.3. A decision shall be taken on each proposal in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 30(2). This decision shall establish the minimum amount of technical information from Annex III necessary for evaluating any foreseeable risks from the release, in particular:(a) information relating to the GMO(s);(b) information relating to the conditions of release and the potential receiving environment;(c) information on the interactions between the GMO(s) and the environment;(d) the environmental risk assessment.4. This decision shall be taken within 90 days of the date of the Commission's proposal or of receipt of the competent authority's proposal. This 90 day period shall not take into account the period of time during which the Commission is awaiting the observations of competent authorities, the comments of the public or the opinion of Scientific Committees, as provided for in paragraph 2.5. The decision taken under paragraphs 3 and 4 shall provide that the notifier may proceed with the release only when he has received the written consent of the competent authority. The notifier shall proceed with the release in conformity with any conditions required in this consent.The decision taken under paragraphs 3 and 4 may provide that releases of a GMO or of a combination of GMOs on the same site or on different sites for the same purpose and within a defined period may be notified in a single notification.6. Without prejudice to paragraphs 1 to 5, Commission Decision 94/730/EC of 4 November 1994 establishing simplified procedures concerning the deliberate release into the environment of genetically modified plants pursuant to Article 6(5) of Council Directive 90/220/EEC(10) shall continue to apply.7. Where a Member State decides to make use or not of a procedure established in a decision taken in accordance with paragraphs 3 and 4 for releases of GMOs within its territory, it shall inform the Commission thereof.Article 8Handling of modifications and new information1. In the event of any modification of, or unintended change to, the deliberate release of a GMO or of a combination of GMOs which could have consequences with regard to risks for human health and the environment after the competent authority has given its written consent, or if new information has become available on such risks, either while the notification is being examined by the competent authority of a Member State or after that authority has given its written consent, the notifier shall immediately:(a) take the measures necessary to protect human health and the environment;(b) inform the competent authority in advance of any modification or as soon as the unintended change is known or the new information is available;(c) revise the measures specified in the notification.2. If information becomes available to the competent authority referred to in paragraph 1 which could have significant consequences with regard to risks for human health and the environment or under the circumstances described in paragraph 1, the competent authority shall evaluate such information and make it available to the public. It may require the notifier to modify the conditions of, suspend or terminate the deliberate release and shall inform the public thereof.Article 9Consultation of and information to the public1. Member States shall, without prejudice to the provisions of Articles 7 and 25, consult the public and, where appropriate, groups on the proposed deliberate release. In doing so, Member States shall lay down arrangements for this consultation, including a reasonable time-period, in order to give the public or groups the opportunity to express an opinion.2. Without prejudice to the provisions of Article 25:- Member States shall make available to the public information on all part B releases of GMOs in their territory;- the Commission shall make available to the public the information contained in the system of exchange of information pursuant to Article 11.Article 10Reporting by notifiers on releasesAfter completion of a release, and thereafter, at any intervals laid down in the consent on the basis of the results of the environmental risk assessment, the notifier shall send to the competent authority the result of the release in respect of any risk to human health or the environment, with, where appropriate, particular reference to any kind of product that the notifier intends to notify at a later stage. The format for the presentation of this result shall be established in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 30(2).Article 11Exchange of information between competent authorities and the Commission1. The Commission shall set up a system of exchange of the information contained in the notifications. The competent authorities shall send to the Commission, within 30 days of its receipt, a summary of each notification received under Article 6. The format of this summary shall be established and modified if appropriate in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 30(2).2. The Commission shall, at the latest 30 days following their receipt, forward these summaries to the other Member States, which may, within 30 days, present observations through the Commission or directly. At its request, a Member State shall be permitted to receive a copy of the full notification from the competent authority of the relevant Member State.3. The competent authorities shall inform the Commission of the final decisions taken in compliance with Article 6(5), including where relevant the reasons for rejecting a notification, and of the results of the releases received in accordance with Article 10.4. For the releases of GMOs referred to in Article 7, once a year Member States shall send a list of GMOs which have been released on their territory and a list of notifications that were rejected to the Commission, which shall forward them to the competent authorities of the other Member States.PART CPLACING ON THE MARKET OF GMOs AS OR IN PRODUCTSArticle 12Sectoral legislation1. Articles 13 to 24 shall not apply to any GMO as or in products as far as they are authorised by Community legislation which provides for a specific environmental risk assessment carried out in accordance with the principles set out in Annex II and on the basis of information specified in Annex III without prejudice to additional requirements provided for by the Community legislation mentioned above, and for requirements as regards risk management, labelling, monitoring as appropriate, information to the public and safeguard clause at least equivalent to that laid down in this Directive.2. As far as Council Regulation (EEC) No 2309/93 is concerned, Articles 13 to 24 of this Directive shall not apply to any GMO as or in products as far as they are authorised by that Regulation provided that a specific environmental risk assessment is carried out in accordance with the principles set out in Annex II to this Directive and on the basis of the type of information specified in Annex III to this Directive without prejudice to other relevant requirements as regards risk assessment, risk management, labelling, monitoring as appropriate, information to the public and safeguard clause provided by Community legislation concerning medicinal products for human and veterinary use.3. Procedures ensuring that the risk assessment, requirements regarding risk management, labelling, monitoring as appropriate, information to the public and safeguard clause are equivalent to those laid down in this Directive shall be introduced, in a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. Future sectoral legislation based on the provisions of that Regulation shall make a reference to this Directive. Until the Regulation enters into force, any GMO as or in products as far as they are authorised by other Community legislation shall only be placed on the market after having been accepted for placing on the market in accordance with this Directive.4. During evaluation of the requests for the placing on the market of the GMOs referred to in paragraph 1, the bodies established by the Community under this Directive and by Member States for the purpose of implementing this Directive shall be consulted.Article 13Notification procedure1. Before a GMO or a combination of GMOs as or in products is placed on the market, a notification shall be submitted to the competent authority of the Member State where such a GMO is to be placed on the market for the first time. The competent authority shall acknowledge the date of receipt of the notification and immediately forward the summary of the dossier referred to in paragraph 2(h) to the competent authorities of the other Member States and the Commission.The competent authority shall without delay examine whether the notification is in accordance with paragraph 2 and shall, if necessary, ask the notifier for additional information.When the notification is in accordance with paragraph 2, and at the latest when it sends its assessment report in accordance with Article 14(2), the competent authority shall forward a copy of the notification to the Commission which shall, within 30 days of its receipt, forward it to the competent authorities of the other Member States.2. The notification shall contain:(a) the information required in Annexes III and IV. This information shall take into account the diversity of sites of use of the GMO as or in a product and shall include information on data and results obtained from research and developmental releases concerning the impact of the release on human health and the environment;(b) the environmental risk assessment and the conclusions required in Annex II, section D;(c) the conditions for the placing on the market of the product, including specific conditions of use and handling;(d) with reference to Article 15(4), a proposed period for the consent which should not exceed ten years;(e) a plan for monitoring in accordance with Annex VII, including a proposal for the time-period of the monitoring plan; this time-period may be different from the proposed period for the consent;(f) a proposal for labelling which shall comply with the requirements laid down in Annex IV. The labelling shall clearly state that a GMO is present. The words \"this product contains genetically modified organisms\" shall appear either on a label or in an accompanying document;(g) a proposal for packaging which shall comprise the requirements laid down in Annex IV;(h) a summary of the dossier. The format of the summary shall be established in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 30(2).If on the basis of the results of any release notified under part B, or on other substantive, reasoned scientific grounds, a notifier considers that the placing on the market and use of a GMO as or in a product do not pose a risk to human health and the environment, he may propose to the competent authority not to provide part or all of the information required in Annex IV, section B.3. The notifier shall include in this notification information on data or results from releases of the same GMOs or the same combination of GMOs previously or currently notified and/or carried out by the notifier either inside or outside the Community.4. The notifier may also refer to data or results from notifications previously submitted by other notifiers or submit additional information he considers relevant, provided that the information, data and results are non-confidential or these notifiers have given their agreement in writing.5. In order for a GMO or combination of GMOs to be used for a purpose different from that already specified in a notification, a separate notification shall be submitted.6. If new information has become available with regard to the risks of the GMO to human health or the environment, before the written consent is granted, the notifier shall immediately take the measures necessary to protect human health and the environment, and inform the competent authority thereof. In addition, the notifier shall revise the information and conditions specified in the notification.Article 14Assessment report1. On receipt and after acknowledgement of the notification in accordance with Article 13(2), the competent authority shall examine it for compliance with this Directive.2. Within 90 days after receipt of the notification the competent authority shall:- prepare an assessment report and send it to the notifier. A subsequent withdrawal by the notifier shall be without prejudice to any further submission of the notification to another competent authority;- in the case referred to in paragraph 3(a), send its report, together with the information referred to in paragraph 4 and any other information on which it has based its report, to the Commission which shall, within 30 days of its receipt, forward it to the competent authorities of the other Member States.In the case referred to paragraph 3(b), the competent authority shall send its report, together with the information referred to in paragraph 4 and any other information on which it has based its report, to the Commission no earlier than 15 days after sending the assessment report to the notifier and no later than 105 days after receipt of the notification.

It will be supplemented by guidance notes to be developed in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 30(2). These guidance notes shall be completed by 17 October 2002.With a view to contributing to a common understanding of the terms \"direct, indirect, immediate and delayed\" when implementing this Annex, without prejudice to further guidance in this respect and in particular as regards the extent to which indirect effects can and should be taken into account, these terms are described as follows:- \"direct effects\" refers to primary effects on human health or the environment which are a result of the GMO itself and which do not occur through a causal chain of events;- \"indirect effects\" refers to effects on human health or the environment occurring through a causal chain of events, through mechanisms such as interactions with other organisms, transfer of genetic material, or changes in use or management.Observations of indirect effects are likely to be delayed;- \"immediate effects\" refers to effects on human health or the environment which are observed during the period of the release of the GMO. Immediate effects may be direct or indirect;- \"delayed effects\" refers to effects on human health or the environment which may not be observed during the period of the release of the GMO, but become apparent as a direct or indirect effect either at a later stage or after termination of the release.A general principle for environmental risk assessment is also that an analysis of the \"cumulative long-term effects\" relevant to the release and the placing on the market is to be carried out. \"Cumulative long-term effects\" refers to the accumulated effects of consents on human health and the environment, including inter alia flora and fauna, soil fertility, soil degradation of organic material, the feed/ food chain, biological diversity, animal health and resistance problems in relation to antibiotics.A. ObjectiveThe objective of an e.r.a. is, on a case by case basis, to identify and evaluate potential adverse effects of the GMO, either direct and indirect, immediate or delayed, on human health and the environment which the deliberate release or the placing on the market of GMOs may have. The e.r.a. should be conducted with a view to identifying if there is a need for risk management and if so, the most appropriate methods to be used.B. General PrinciplesIn accordance with the precautionary principle, the following general principles should be followed when performing the e.r.a.:- identified characteristics of the GMO and its use which have the potential to cause adverse effects should be compared to those presented by the non-modified organism from which it is derived and its use under corresponding situations;- the e.r.a. should be carried out in a scientifically sound and transparent manner based on available scientific and technical data;- the e.r.a. should be carried out on a case by case basis, meaning that the required information may vary depending on the type of the GMOs concerned, their intended use and the potential receiving environment, taking into account, i.a., GMOs already in the environment;- if new information on the GMO and its effects on human health or the environment becomes available, the e.r.a. may need to be readdressed in order to:- determine whether the risk has changed;- determine whether there is a need for amending the risk management accordingly.C. MethodologyC.1. Characteristics of GMOs and releasesDepending on the case the e.r.a. has to take into account the relevant technical and scientific details regarding characteristics of:- the recipient or parental organism(s);- the genetic modification(s), be it inclusion or deletion of genetic material, and relevant information on the vector and the donor;- the GMO;- the intended release or use including its scale;- the potential receiving environment; and- the interaction between these.Information from releases of similar organisms and organisms with similar traits and their interaction with similar environments can assist the e.r.a.C.2. Steps in the e.r.a.In drawing conclusions for the e.r.a. referred to in Articles 4, 6, 7 and 13 the following points should be addressed:1. Identification of characteristics which may cause adverse effects:Any characteristics of the GMOs linked to the genetic modification that may result in adverse effects on human health or the environment shall be identified. A comparison of the characteristics of the GMO(s) with those of the non-modified organism under corresponding conditions of the release or use, will assist in identifying the particular potential adverse effects arising from the genetic modification. It is important not to discount any potential adverse effect on the basis that it is unlikely to occur.Potential adverse effects of GMOs will vary from case to case, and may include:- disease to humans including allergenic or toxic effects (see for example items II.A.11. and II.C.2(i) in Annex III A, and B 7 in Annex III B);- disease to animals and plants including toxic, and where appropriate, allergenic effects (see for example items II.A.11. and II.C.2(i) in Annex III A, and B 7 and D 8 in Annex III B);- effects on the dynamics of populations of species in the receiving environment and the genetic diversity of each of these populations (see for example items IV B 8, 9 and 12 in Annex III A);- altered susceptibility to pathogens facilitating the dissemination of infectious diseases and/or creating new reservoirs or vectors;- compromising prophylactic or therapeutic medical, veterinary, or plant protection treatments, for example by transfer of genes conferring resistance to antibiotics used in human or veterinary medicine (see for example items II.A.11(e) and II.C.2(i)(iv) in Annex III A);- effects on biogeochemistry( biogeochemical cycles), particularly carbon and nitrogen recycling through changes in soil decomposition of organic material (see for example items II.A.11(f) and IV.B.15 in Annex III A, and D 11 in Annex III B).Adverse effects may occur directly or indirectly through mechanisms which may include:- the spread of the GMO(s) in the environment,- the transfer of the inserted genetic material to other organisms, or the same organism whether genetically modified or not,- phenotypic and genetic instability,- interactions with other organisms,- changes in management, including, where applicable, in agricultural practices.2. Evaluation of the potential consequences of each adverse effect, if it occursThe magnitude of the consequences of each potential adverse effect should be evaluated.This evaluation should assume that such an adverse effect will occur. The magnitude of the consequences is likely to be influenced by the environment into which the GMO(s) is (are) intended to be released and the manner of the release.3. Evaluation of the likelihood of the occurrence of each identified potential adverse effectA major factor in evaluating the likelihood or probability of adverse effects occurring is the characteristics of the environment into which the GMO(s) is intended to be released, and the manner of the release.4. Estimation of the risk posed by each identified characteristic of the GMO(s)An estimation of the risk to human health or the environment posed by each identified characteristic of the GMO which has the potential to cause adverse effects should be made as far as possible, given the state of the art, by combining the likelihood of the adverse effect occurring and the magnitude of the consequences, if it occurs.5. Application of management strategies for risks from the deliberate release or marketing of GMO(s)The risk assessment may identify risks that require management and how best to manage them, and a risk management strategy should be defined.6. Determination of the overall risk of the GMO(s)An evaluation of the overall risk of the GMO(s) should be made taking into account any risk management strategies which are proposed.D. Conclusions on the potential environmental impact from the release or the placing on the market of GMOsOn the basis of an e.r.a. carried out in accordance with the principles and methodology outlined in sections B and C, information on the points listed in sections D1 or D2 should be included, as appropriate, in notifications with a view to assisting in drawing conclusions on the potential environmental impact from the release or the placing on the market of GMOs:D.1.

These aspects should be specified. The conclusion should clearly address the use proposed, risk management and the monitoring plan proposed. In the case that it has been concluded that the GMOs should not be placed on the market, the competent authority shall give reasons for its conclusion.ANNEX VIIMONITORING PLANThis Annex describes in general terms the objective to be achieved and the general principles to be followed to design the monitoring plan referred to in Articles 13(2), 19(3) and 20. It will be supplemented by guidance notes to be developed in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 30(2).These guidance notes shall be completed by 17 October 2002.A. ObjectiveThe objective of a monitoring plan is to:- confirm that any assumption regarding the occurrence and impact of potential adverse effects of the GMO or its use in the e.r.a. are correct, and- identify the occurrence of adverse effects of the GMO or its use on human health or the environment which were not anticipated in the e.r.a.B. General principlesMonitoring, as referred to in Articles 13, 19 and 20, takes place after the consent to the placing of a GMO on the market.The interpretation of the data collected by monitoring should be considered in the light of other existing environmental conditions and activities. Where changes in the environment are observed, further assessment should be considered to establish whether they are a consequence of the GMO or its use, as such changes may be the result of environmental factors other than the placing of the GMO on the market.Experience and data gained through the monitoring of experimental releases of GMOs may assist in designing the post marketing monitoring regime required for the placing on the market of GMOs as or in products.C. Design of the monitoring planThe design of the monitoring plan should:1. be detailed on a case by case basis taking into account the e.r.a.,2. take into account the characteristics of the GMO, the characteristics and scale of its intended use and the range of relevant environmental conditions where the GMO is expected to be released,3. incorporate general surveillance for unanticipated adverse effects and, if necessary, (case-) specific monitoring focusing on adverse effects identified in the e.r.a.:3.1. whereas case-specific monitoring should be carried out for a sufficient time period to detect immediate and direct as well as, where appropriate, delayed or indirect effects which have been identified in the e.r.a.,3.2. whereas surveillance could, if appropriate, make use of already established routine surveillance practices such as the monitoring of agricultural cultivars, plant protection, or veterinary and medical products. An explanation as to how relevant information collected through established routine surveillance practices will be made available to the consent-holder should be provided.4. facilitate the observation, in a systematic manner, of the release of a GMO in the receiving environment and the interpretation of these observations with respect to safety to human health or the environment.5. identify who (notifier, users) will carry out the various tasks the monitoring plan requires and who is responsible for ensuring that the monitoring plan is set into place and carried out appropriately, and ensure that there is a route by which the consent holder and the competent authority will be informed on any observed adverse effects on human health and the environment. (Time points and intervals for reports on the results of the monitoring shall be indicated).6. give consideration to the mechanisms for identifying and confirming any observed adverse effects on human health and environment and enable the consent holder or the competent authority, where appropriate, to take the measures necessary to protect human health and the environment.ANNEX VIIICORRELATION TABLE>TABLE>Commission DeclarationArticle 32 (Amendment 28)The Commission notes the agreement of the co-legislators relating to recital 13 and Article 30(a), on the basis of Amendments 1 and 28, in particular concerning the date by which a proposal should be presented for the implementation of the Cartagena Protocol and the content of any such proposal.In the respect of its right of initiative, the Commission states that it cannot accept to be bound by the provisions of this article neither as to timing nor as to the content of a future proposal.The Commission does however confirm its commitment, after a comprehensive examination of all the potential implications, to presenting a proposal with a view to full implementation of the Cartagena Protocol.Commission Declaration with respect to Amendment 35With a view to facilitating the obligation of Member States to take the necessary measures to ensure traceability and labelling at all the stages of the placing on the market of GMOs authorised in accordance with part C of a revised Directive 90/220/EEC, the Commission reaffirms its intention to present in the course of year 2001 appropriate proposals for this purpose.In addition, the Commission at the same time having regard to the results of the meeting with the experts of the Member States on 29 November 2000, affirms its intention to present proposals aiming to provide appropriate traceability for products derived from GMOs, as well as to supplement the labelling regime in accordance with the White Paper on Food Safety.", "summary": "Regulating GM crops: EU countries’ rights\nRegulating GM crops: EU countries’ rights\nSUMMARY OF:\nDirective 2001/18/EC on the deliberate release into the environment of genetically modified organisms\nWHAT IS THE AIM OF THE DIRECTIVE?\nIt aims to make the procedure for granting consent for the deliberate release* and placing on the market of genetically modified organisms (GMOs)* more efficient and more transparent.\nIt also limits that consent to a period of 10 years (renewable) and introduces compulsory monitoring after GMOs have been placed on the market.\nKEY POINTS\n              \nThis directive provides for:\na system for assessing case-by-case the environmental risks associated with releasing GMOs;\ncommon objectives for monitoring GMOs after their deliberate release on the market; and\na mechanism that modifies, suspends or terminates deliberately released GMOs once information regarding the risks of releasing becomes available.\nGMO labelling and public consultation is made compulsory. The European Commission is obliged to consult the competent scientific committees on any question affecting human health or the environment.\nRegisters must be established for the purpose of recording information on genetic modifications in GMOs alongside their location. Rules on the operation of these registers are laid down in Decision 2004/204/EC.\nThe Commission must publish a report on the experience of GMOs placed on the market and a summary of the measures taken by EU countries to implement this directive every 3 years.\nAlthough this directive allows EU countries to restrict or prohibit the release of GMOs that constitute a risk to human health and the environment, Directive (EU) 2015/412 amends it allowing for EU countries to prohibit or restrict GMOs that have been authorised or are under authorisation at EU level on wider grounds. These grounds that can be used by EU countries include town and country planning, land use, socio-economic impacts, co-existence* and public policy.\nThe amending directive also establishes the set of deadlines and responsibilities governing the decisions taken concerning the adjustment of the geographical scope of the authorisation, including a right to opt out based on new objective circumstances.\nAs of 3 April 2017, EU countries in which GMOs are cultivated have to introduce measures in border areas of their territory with the aim of avoiding possible cross-border contamination into neighbouring EU countries in which the cultivation of those GMOs is prohibited, unless such measures are unnecessary in the light of particular geographical conditions.\nFROM WHEN DOES THIS DIRECTIVE APPLY?\n              \nIt has applied since17 April 2001. EU countries had to incorporate it into their national law by 17 October 2002.\nBACKGROUND\n              \nThis directive is only one of the several building blocks of the EU’s legal framework for GMOs. The other building blocks are directives and regulations (focusing on issues like genetically modified food or transboundary movements of GMOs) that work to protect human and animal health and the environment, put in place harmonised procedures, and ensure the traceability of GMOs placed on the market.\nFor more information, see:\nGenetically modified organisms (European Commission).\nKEY TERMS\n              \nDeliberate release: in the context of this legislation, any intentional introduction into the environment of GMOs without specific containment measures.\nGenetically modified organisms: using techniques of modern biotechnology called gene technology, the genetic make-up of living cells and organisms can be modified. This allows man to breed plants and animals which can, for example, have a higher yield or resist disease.\nCoexistence: the existence of genetically modified, conventional and organic crops requires rules to ensure that that they can be kept segregated from one another during cultivation, harvest, transport, storage and processing.\nMAIN DOCUMENT\n            \nDirective 2001/18/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 March 2001 on the deliberate release into the environment of genetically modified organisms and repealing Council Directive 90/220/EEC - Commission Declaration (OJ L 106, 17.4.2001, pp. 1-39)\nThe successive amendments to Directive 2001/18/EC have been incorporated into the basic text.

Now that new amendments are being made to the Directive, it is desirable, for reasons of clarity and rationalisation, that the provisions in question should be recast.(4) Living organisms, whether released into the environment in large or small amounts for experimental purposes or as commercial products, may reproduce in the environment and cross national frontiers thereby affecting other Member States. The effects of such releases on the environment may be irreversible.(5) The protection of human health and the environment requires that due attention be given to controlling risks from the deliberate release into the environment of genetically modified organisms (GMOs).(6) Under the Treaty, action by the Community relating to the environment should be based on the principle that preventive action should be taken.(7) It is necessary to approximate the laws of the Member States concerning the deliberate release into the environment of GMOs and to ensure the safe development of industrial products utilising GMOs.(8) The precautionary principle has been taken into account in the drafting of this Directive and must be taken into account when implementing it.(9) Respect for ethical principles recognised in a Member State is particularly important. Member States may take into consideration ethical aspects when GMOs are deliberately released or placed on the market as or in products.(10) For a comprehensive and transparent legislative framework, it is necessary to ensure that the public is consulted by either the Commission or the Member States during the preparation of measures and that they are informed of the measures taken during the implementation of this Directive.(11) Placing on the market also covers import. Products containing and/or consisting of GMOs covered by this Directive cannot be imported into the Community if they do not comply with its provisions.(12) Making GMOs available to be imported or handled in bulk quantities, such as agricultural commodities, should be regarded as placing on the market for the purpose of this Directive.(13) The content of this Directive duly takes into account international experience in this field and international trade commitments and should respect the requirements of the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety to the Convention on Biological Diversity. As soon as possible, and in any case before July 2001, the Commission should, in the context of the ratification of the Protocol, submit the appropriate proposals for its implementation.(14) Guidance on the implementation of provisions related to the definition of the placing on the market in this Directive should be provided by the Regulatory Committee.(15) When defining \"genetically modified organism\" for the purpose of this Directive, human beings should not be considered as organisms.(16) The provisions of this Directive should be without prejudice to national legislation in the field of environmental liability, while Community legislation in this field needs to be complemented by rules covering liability for different types of environmental damage in all areas of the European Union. To this end the Commission has undertaken to bring forward a legislative proposal on environmental liability before the end of 2001, which will also cover damage from GMOs.(17) This Directive should not apply to organisms obtained through certain techniques of genetic modification which have conventionally been used in a number of applications and have a long safety record.(18) It is necessary to establish harmonised procedures and criteria for the case-by-case evaluation of the potential risks arising from the deliberate release of GMOs into the environment.(19) A case-by-case environmental risk assessment should always be carried out prior to a release. It should also take due account of potential cumulative long-term effects associated with the interaction with other GMOs and the environment.(20) It is necessary to establish a common methodology to carry out the environmental risk assessment based on independent scientific advice. It is also necessary to establish common objectives for the monitoring of GMOs after their deliberate release or placing on the market as or in products. Monitoring of potential cumulative long-term effects should be considered as a compulsory part of the monitoring plan.(21) Member States and the Commission should ensure that systematic and independent research on the potential risks involved in the deliberate release or the placing on the market of GMOs is conducted. The necessary resources should be secured for such research by Member States and the Community in accordance with their budgetary procedures and independent researchers should be given access to all relevant material, while respecting intellectual property rights.(22) The issue of antibiotic-resistance genes should be taken into particular consideration when conducting the risk assessment of GMOs containing such genes.(23) The deliberate release of GMOs at the research stage is in most cases a necessary step in the development of new products derived from, or containing GMOs.(24) The introduction of GMOs into the environment should be carried out according to the \"step by step\" principle. This means that the containment of GMOs is reduced and the scale of release increased gradually, step by step, but only if evaluation of the earlier steps in terms of protection of human health and the environment indicates that the next step can be taken.(25) No GMOs, as or in products, intended for deliberate release are to be considered for placing on the market without first having been subjected to satisfactory field testing at the research and development stage in ecosystems which could be affected by their use.(26) The implementation of this Directive should be carried out in close liaison with the implementation of other relevant instruments such as Council directive 91/414/eec of 15 July 1991 concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market(5). In this context the competent authorities concerned with the implementation of this Directive and of those instruments, within the Commission and at national level, should coordinate their action as far as possible.(27) Concerning the environmental risk assessment for part C, risk management, labelling, monitoring, information to the public and safeguard clause, this Directive should be a point of reference for GMOs as or in products authorised by other Community legislation which should therefore provide for a specific environmental risk assessment, to be carried out in accordance with the principles set out in Annex II and on the basis of information specified in Annex III without prejudice to additional requirements laid down by the Community legislation mentioned above, and for requirements as regards risk management, labelling, monitoring as appropriate, information to the public and safeguard clause at least equivalent to that laid down in this Directive. To this end it is necessary to provide for cooperation with the Community and Member State bodies mentioned in this Directive for the purpose of its implementation.(28) It is necessary to establish a Community authorisation procedure for the placing on the market of GMOs, as or in products, where the intended use of the product involves the deliberate release of the organism(s) into the environment.(29) The Commission is invited to conduct a study which should contain an assessment of various options to improve further the consistency and efficiency of this framework, particularly focusing on a centralised authorisation procedure for the placing on the market of GMOs within the Community.(30) For sectoral legislation, monitoring requirements may have to be adapted to the product concerned.(31) Part C of this Directive does not apply to products covered by Council regulation 2309/93 of 22 July 1993 laying down Community procedures for the authorisation and supervision of medicinal products for human and veterinary use and establishing a European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products(6), provided that it includes an environmental risk assessment equivalent to that provided for by this Directive.(32) Any person, before undertaking a deliberate release into the environment of a GMO, or the placing on the market of GMOs, as or in products, where the intended use of the product involves its deliberate release into the environment, is to submit a notification to the national competent authority.(33) That notification should contain a technical dossier of information including a full environmental risk assessment, appropriate safety and emergency response, and, in the case of products, precise instructions and conditions for use, and proposed labelling and packaging.(34) After notification, no deliberate release of GMOs should be carried out unless the consent of the competent authority has been obtained.(35) A notifier should be able to withdraw his dossier at any stage of the administrative procedures laid down in this Directive. The administrative procedure should come to an end when a dossier is withdrawn.(36) Rejection of a notification for the placing on the market of a GMO as or in products by a competent authority should be without prejudice to the submission of a notification of the same GMO to another competent authority.(37) An agreement should be reached at the end of the mediation period when no objections remain.(38) Rejection of a notification following a confirmed negative assessment report should be without prejudice to future decisions based on the notification of the same GMO to another competent authority.(39) In the interests of the smooth functioning of this Directive, Member States should be able to avail themselves of the various provisions for the exchange of information and experience before having recourse to the safeguard clause in this Directive.(40) In order to ensure that the presence of GMOs in products containing, or consisting of, genetically modified organisms is appropriately identified, the words \"This product contains genetically modified organisms\" should appear clearly either on a label or in an accompanying document.(41) A system should be designed using the appropriate committee procedure, for the assignment of a unique identifier to GMOs, taking into account relevant developments in international fora.(42) It is necessary to ensure traceability at all stages of the placing on the market of GMOs as or in products authorised under part C of this Directive.(43) It is necessary to introduce into this Directive an obligation to implement a monitoring plan in order to trace and identify any direct or indirect, immediate, delayed or unforeseen effects on human health or the environment of GMOs as or in products after they have been placed on the market.(44) Member States should be able, in accordance with the Treaty, to take further measures for monitoring and inspection, for example by official services, of the GMOs as or in products placed on the market.(45) Means should be sought for providing possibilities for facilitating the control of GMOs or their retrieval in the event of severe risk.(46) Comments by the public should be taken into consideration in the drafts of measures submitted to the Regulatory Committee.(47) The competent authority should give its consent only after it has been satisfied that the release will be safe for human health and the environment.(48) The administrative procedure for granting consents for the placing on the market of GMOs as or in products should be made more efficient and more transparent and first-time consent should be granted for a fixed period.(49) For products for which consent has been granted for a fixed period a streamlined procedure should apply as regards the renewal of consent.(50) The existing consents granted under directive 90/220/eec have to be renewed in order to avoid disparities between consents granted under that Directive and those pursuant to this Directive and in order to take full account of the conditions of consent under this Directive.(51) Such renewal requires a transitional period during which existing consents granted under directive 90/220/eec remain unaffected.(52) When a consent is renewed, it should be possible to revise all the conditions of the original consent, including those related to monitoring and the time limitation of the consent.(53) Provision should be made for consultation of the relevant Scientific Committee(s) established by Commission decision 97/579/ec(7) on matters which are likely to have an impact on human health and/or the environment.(54) The system of exchange of information contained in notifications, established under directive 90/220/eec, has been useful and should be continued.(55) It is important to follow closely the development and use of GMOs.(56) When a product containing a GMO, as or in products, is placed on the market, and where such a product has been properly authorised under this Directive, a Member State may not prohibit, restrict or impede the placing on the market of GMOs, as or in products, which comply with the requirements of this Directive. A safeguard procedure should be provided in case of risk to human health or the environment.(57) The Commission's European Group on Ethics in Science and New Technologies should be consulted with a view to obtaining advice on ethical issues of a general nature regarding the deliberate release or placing on the market of GMOs. Such consultations should be without prejudice to the competence of Member States as regards ethical issues.(58) Member States should be able to consult any committee they have established with a view to obtaining advice on the ethical implications of biotechnology.(59) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Directive are to be adopted in accordance with Council decision 1999/468/ec of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission(8).(60) The information exchange set up under this Directive should also cover experience gained with the consideration of ethical aspects.(61) In order to increase the effective implementation of the provisions adopted under this Directive it is appropriate to provide for penalties to be applied by Member States, including in the event of release or placing on the market contrary to the provisions of this Directive, particularly as a result of negligence.(62) A report to be issued every three years by the Commission, taking into account the information provided by Member States, should contain a separate chapter regarding the socioeconomic advantages and disadvantages of each category of GMOs authorised for placing on the market, which will take due account of the interest of farmers and consumers.(63) The regulatory framework for biotechnology should be reviewed so as to identify the feasibility of improving further the consistency and efficiency of that framework. Procedures may need to be adapted so as to optimise efficiency, and all options which might achieve that should be considered,HAVE ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:PART AGENERAL PROVISIONSArticle 1ObjectiveIn accordance with the precautionary principle, the objective of this Directive is to approximate the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States and to protect human health and the environment when:- carrying out the deliberate release into the environment of genetically modified organisms for any other purposes than placing on the market within the Community,- placing on the market genetically modified organisms as or in products within the Community.Article 2DefinitionsFor the purposes of this Directive:(1) \"organism\" means any biological entity capable of replication or of transferring genetic material;(2) \"genetically modified organism (GMO)\" means an organism, with the exception of human beings, in which the genetic material has been altered in a way that does not occur naturally by mating and/or natural recombination;Within the terms of this definition:(a) genetic modification occurs at least through the use of the techniques listed in Annex I A, part 1;(b) the techniques listed in Annex I A, part 2, are not considered to result in genetic modification;(3) \"deliberate release\" means any intentional introduction into the environment of a GMO or a combination of GMOs for which no specific containment measures are used to limit their contact with and to provide a high level of safety for the general population and the environment;(4) \"placing on the market\" means making available to third parties, whether in return for payment or free of charge;The following operations shall not be regarded as placing on the market:- making available genetically modified microorganisms for activities regulated under Council directive 90/219/eec of 23 April 1990 on the contained use of genetically modified microorganisms(9) including culture collections,- making available GMOs other than microorganisms referred to in the first indent, to be used exclusively for activities where appropriate stringent containment measures are used to limit their contact with and to provide a high level of safety for the general population and the environment, the measures should be based on the same principles of containment as laid down in directive 90/219/eec,- making available GMOs to be used exclusively for deliberate releases complying with the requirements laid down in part B of this Directive;(5) \"notification\" means the submission of the information required under this Directive to the competent authority of a Member State;(6) \"notifier\" means the person submitting the notification;(7) \"product\" means a preparation consisting of, or containing, a GMO or a combination of GMOs, which is placed on the market;(8) \"environmental risk assessment\" means the evaluation of risks to human health and the environment, whether direct or indirect, immediate or delayed, which the deliberate release or the placing on the market of GMOs may pose and carried out in accordance with Annex II.Article 3Exemptions1. This Directive shall not apply to organisms obtained through the techniques of genetic modification listed in Annex I B.2. This Directive shall not apply to the carriage of genetically modified organisms by rail, road, inland waterway, sea or air.Article 4General obligations1. Member States shall, in accordance with the precautionary principle, ensure that all appropriate measures are taken to avoid adverse effects on human health and the environment which might arise from the deliberate release or the placing on the market of GMOs. GMOs may only be deliberately released or placed on the market in conformity with part B or part C respectively.2. Any person shall, before submitting a notification under part B or part C, carry out an environmental risk assessment. The information which may be necessary to carry out the environmental risk assessment is laid down in Annex III. Member States and the Commission shall ensure that GMOs which contain genes expressing resistance to antibiotics in use for medical or veterinary treatment are taken into particular consideration when carrying out an environmental risk assessment, with a view to identifying and phasing out antibiotic resistance markers in GMOs which may have adverse effects on human health and the environment. This phasing out shall take place by the 31 December 2004 in the case of GMOs placed on the market according to part C and by 31 December 2008 in the case of GMOs authorised under part B.3. Member States and where appropriate the Commission shall ensure that potential adverse effects on human health and the environment, which may occur directly or indirectly through gene transfer from GMOs to other organisms, are accurately assessed on a case-by-case basis. This assessment shall be conducted in accordance with Annex II taking into account the environmental impact according to the nature of the organism introduced and the receiving environment.4. Member States shall designate the competent authority or authorities responsible for complying with the requirements of this Directive. The competent authority shall examine notifications under part B and part C for compliance with the requirements of this Directive and whether the assessment provided for in paragraph 2 is appropriate.5. Member States shall ensure that the competent authority organises inspections and other control measures as appropriate, to ensure compliance with this Directive. In the event of a release of GMO(s) or placing on the market as or in products for which no authorisation was given, the Member State concerned shall ensure that necessary measures are taken to terminate the release or placing on the market, to initiate remedial action if necessary, and to inform its public, the Commission and other Member States.6. Member States shall take measures to ensure traceability, in line with the requirements laid down in Annex IV, at all stages of the placing on the market of GMOs authorised under part C.PART BDELIBERATE RELASE OF GMOs FOR ANY OTHER PURPOSE THAN FOR PLACING ON THE MARKETArticle 51. Articles 6 to 11 shall not apply to medicinal substances and compunds for human use consisting of, or containing, a GMO or combination of GMOs provided that their deliberate release for any purpose other than that of being placed on the market is authorised by Community legislation which provides:(a) for a specific environmental risk assessment in accordance with Annex II and on the basis of the type of information specified in Annex III without prejudice to additional requirements provided for by the said legislation;(b) for explicit consent prior to release;(c) for a monitoring plan in accordance with the relevant parts of Annex III, with a view to detecting the effects of the GMO or GMOs on human health or the environment;(d) in an appropriate manner for requirements relating to treatment of new items of information, information to the public, information on the results of releases, and exchanges of information at least equivalent to those contained in this Directive and in the measures taken in accordance therewith.2. Assessment of the risks to the environment presented by such substances and compounds shall be carried out in coordination with the national and Community authorities mentioned in this Directive.3. Procedures ensuring conformity of the specific environmental risk assessment and equivalence with the provisions of this Directive must be provided for by the said legislation, which must refer to this Directive.Article 6Standard authorisation procedure1. Without prejudice to Article 5, any person must, before undertaking a deliberate release of a GMO or of a combination of GMOs, submit a notification to the competent authority of the Member State within whose territory the release is to take place.2. The notification referred to in paragraph 1 shall include:(a) a technical dossier supplying the information specified in Annex III necessary for carrying out the environmental risk assessment of the deliberate release of a GMO or combination of GMOs, in particular:(i) general information including information on personnel and training,(ii) information relating to the GMO(s),(iii) information relating to the conditions of release and the potential receiving environment,(iv) information on the interactions between the GMO(s) and the environment,(v) a plan for monitoring in accordance with the relevant parts of Annex III in order to identify effects of the GMO(s) on human health or the environment,(vi) information on control, remediation methods, waste treatment and emergency response plans,(vii) a summary of the dossier;(b) the environmental risk assessment and the conclusions required in Annex II, section D, together with any bibliographic reference and indications of the methods used.3. The notifier may refer to data or results from notifications previously submitted by other notifiers, provided that the information, data and results are non confidential or these notifiers have given their agreement in writing, or may submit additional information he considers relevant.4. The competent authority may accept that releases of the same GMO or of a combination of GMOs on the same site or on different sites for the same purpose and within a defined period may be notified in a single notification.5. The competent authority shall acknowledge the date of receipt of the notification and, having considered, where appropriate, any observations by other Member States made in accordance with Article 11, shall respond in writing to the notifier within 90 days of receipt of the notification by either:(a) indicating that it is satisfied that the notification is in compliance with this Directive and that the release may proceed; or(b) indicating that the release does not fulfil the conditions of this Directive and that notification is therefore rejected.6. For the purpose of calculating the 90 day period referred to in paragraph 5, no account shall be taken of any periods of time during which the competent authority:(a) is awaiting further information which it may have requested from the notifier, or(b) is carrying out a public inquiry or consultation in accordance with Article 9; this public inquiry or consultation shall not prolong the 90 day period referred to in paragraph 5 by more than 30 days.7. If the competent authority requests new information it must simultaneously give its reasons for so doing.8. The notifier may proceed with the release only when he has received the written consent of the competent authority, and in conformity with any conditions required in this consent.9. Member States shall ensure that no material derived from GMOs which are deliberately released in accordance with part B is placed on the market, unless in accordance with part C.Article 7Differentiated procedures1. If sufficient experience has been obtained of releases of certain GMOs in certain ecosystems and the GMOs concerned meet the criteria set out in Annex V, a competent authority may submit to the Commission a reasoned proposal for the application of differentiated procedures to such types of GMOs.2. Following its own initiative or at the latest 30 days following the receipt of a competent authority's proposal, the Commission shall,(a) forward the proposal to the competent authorities, which may, within 60 days, present observations and at the same time;(b) make available the proposal to the public which may, within 60 days, make comments; and(c) consult the relevant Scientific Committee(s) which may, within 60 days give an opinion.3. A decision shall be taken on each proposal in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 30(2). This decision shall establish the minimum amount of technical information from Annex III necessary for evaluating any foreseeable risks from the release, in particular:(a) information relating to the GMO(s);(b) information relating to the conditions of release and the potential receiving environment;(c) information on the interactions between the GMO(s) and the environment;(d) the environmental risk assessment.4. This decision shall be taken within 90 days of the date of the Commission's proposal or of receipt of the competent authority's proposal. This 90 day period shall not take into account the period of time during which the Commission is awaiting the observations of competent authorities, the comments of the public or the opinion of Scientific Committees, as provided for in paragraph 2.5. The decision taken under paragraphs 3 and 4 shall provide that the notifier may proceed with the release only when he has received the written consent of the competent authority. The notifier shall proceed with the release in conformity with any conditions required in this consent.The decision taken under paragraphs 3 and 4 may provide that releases of a GMO or of a combination of GMOs on the same site or on different sites for the same purpose and within a defined period may be notified in a single notification.6. Without prejudice to paragraphs 1 to 5, Commission decision 94/730/ec of 4 November 1994 establishing simplified procedures concerning the deliberate release into the environment of genetically modified plants pursuant to Article 6(5) of Council directive 90/220/eec(10) shall continue to apply.7.

It will be supplemented by guidance notes to be developed in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 30(2). These guidance notes shall be completed by 17 October 2002.With a view to contributing to a common understanding of the terms \"direct, indirect, immediate and delayed\" when implementing this Annex, without prejudice to further guidance in this respect and in particular as regards the extent to which indirect effects can and should be taken into account, these terms are described as follows:- \"direct effects\" refers to primary effects on human health or the environment which are a result of the GMO itself and which do not occur through a causal chain of events;- \"indirect effects\" refers to effects on human health or the environment occurring through a causal chain of events, through mechanisms such as interactions with other organisms, transfer of genetic material, or changes in use or management.Observations of indirect effects are likely to be delayed;- \"immediate effects\" refers to effects on human health or the environment which are observed during the period of the release of the GMO. Immediate effects may be direct or indirect;- \"delayed effects\" refers to effects on human health or the environment which may not be observed during the period of the release of the GMO, but become apparent as a direct or indirect effect either at a later stage or after termination of the release.A general principle for environmental risk assessment is also that an analysis of the \"cumulative long-term effects\" relevant to the release and the placing on the market is to be carried out. \"Cumulative long-term effects\" refers to the accumulated effects of consents on human health and the environment, including inter alia flora and fauna, soil fertility, soil degradation of organic material, the feed/ food chain, biological diversity, animal health and resistance problems in relation to antibiotics.A. ObjectiveThe objective of an e.r.a. is, on a case by case basis, to identify and evaluate potential adverse effects of the GMO, either direct and indirect, immediate or delayed, on human health and the environment which the deliberate release or the placing on the market of GMOs may have. The e.r.a. should be conducted with a view to identifying if there is a need for risk management and if so, the most appropriate methods to be used.B. General PrinciplesIn accordance with the precautionary principle, the following general principles should be followed when performing the e.r.a.:- identified characteristics of the GMO and its use which have the potential to cause adverse effects should be compared to those presented by the non-modified organism from which it is derived and its use under corresponding situations;- the e.r.a. should be carried out in a scientifically sound and transparent manner based on available scientific and technical data;- the e.r.a. should be carried out on a case by case basis, meaning that the required information may vary depending on the type of the GMOs concerned, their intended use and the potential receiving environment, taking into account, i.a., GMOs already in the environment;- if new information on the GMO and its effects on human health or the environment becomes available, the e.r.a. may need to be readdressed in order to:- determine whether the risk has changed;- determine whether there is a need for amending the risk management accordingly.C. MethodologyC.1. Characteristics of GMOs and releasesDepending on the case the e.r.a. has to take into account the relevant technical and scientific details regarding characteristics of:- the recipient or parental organism(s);- the genetic modification(s), be it inclusion or deletion of genetic material, and relevant information on the vector and the donor;- the GMO;- the intended release or use including its scale;- the potential receiving environment; and- the interaction between these.Information from releases of similar organisms and organisms with similar traits and their interaction with similar environments can assist the e.r.a.C.2. Steps in the e.r.a.In drawing conclusions for the e.r.a. referred to in Articles 4, 6, 7 and 13 the following points should be addressed:1. Identification of characteristics which may cause adverse effects:Any characteristics of the GMOs linked to the genetic modification that may result in adverse effects on human health or the environment shall be identified. A comparison of the characteristics of the GMO(s) with those of the non-modified organism under corresponding conditions of the release or use, will assist in identifying the particular potential adverse effects arising from the genetic modification. It is important not to discount any potential adverse effect on the basis that it is unlikely to occur.Potential adverse effects of GMOs will vary from case to case, and may include:- disease to humans including allergenic or toxic effects (see for example items II.A.11. and II.C.2(i) in Annex III A, and B 7 in Annex III B);- disease to animals and plants including toxic, and where appropriate, allergenic effects (see for example items II.A.11. and II.C.2(i) in Annex III A, and B 7 and D 8 in Annex III B);- effects on the dynamics of populations of species in the receiving environment and the genetic diversity of each of these populations (see for example items IV B 8, 9 and 12 in Annex III A);- altered susceptibility to pathogens facilitating the dissemination of infectious diseases and/or creating new reservoirs or vectors;- compromising prophylactic or therapeutic medical, veterinary, or plant protection treatments, for example by transfer of genes conferring resistance to antibiotics used in human or veterinary medicine (see for example items II.A.11(e) and II.C.2(i)(iv) in Annex III A);- effects on biogeochemistry( biogeochemical cycles), particularly carbon and nitrogen recycling through changes in soil decomposition of organic material (see for example items II.A.11(f) and IV.B.15 in Annex III A, and D 11 in Annex III B).Adverse effects may occur directly or indirectly through mechanisms which may include:- the spread of the GMO(s) in the environment,- the transfer of the inserted genetic material to other organisms, or the same organism whether genetically modified or not,- phenotypic and genetic instability,- interactions with other organisms,- changes in management, including, where applicable, in agricultural practices.2. Evaluation of the potential consequences of each adverse effect, if it occursThe magnitude of the consequences of each potential adverse effect should be evaluated.This evaluation should assume that such an adverse effect will occur. The magnitude of the consequences is likely to be influenced by the environment into which the GMO(s) is (are) intended to be released and the manner of the release.3. Evaluation of the likelihood of the occurrence of each identified potential adverse effectA major factor in evaluating the likelihood or probability of adverse effects occurring is the characteristics of the environment into which the GMO(s) is intended to be released, and the manner of the release.4. Estimation of the risk posed by each identified characteristic of the GMO(s)An estimation of the risk to human health or the environment posed by each identified characteristic of the GMO which has the potential to cause adverse effects should be made as far as possible, given the state of the art, by combining the likelihood of the adverse effect occurring and the magnitude of the consequences, if it occurs.5. Application of management strategies for risks from the deliberate release or marketing of GMO(s)The risk assessment may identify risks that require management and how best to manage them, and a risk management strategy should be defined.6. Determination of the overall risk of the GMO(s)An evaluation of the overall risk of the GMO(s) should be made taking into account any risk management strategies which are proposed.D. Conclusions on the potential environmental impact from the release or the placing on the market of GMOsOn the basis of an e.r.a. carried out in accordance with the principles and methodology outlined in sections B and C, information on the points listed in sections D1 or D2 should be included, as appropriate, in notifications with a view to assisting in drawing conclusions on the potential environmental impact from the release or the placing on the market of GMOs:D.1.

The taxonomic status and the biology (for example mode of reproduction and pollination, ability to cross with related species, pathogenecity) of the non-modified (recipient) organism shall be well-known.2. There shall be sufficient knowledge about the safety for human health and the environment of the parental, where appropriate, and recipient organisms in the environment of the release.3. Information shall be available on any interaction of particular relevance for the risk assessment, involving the parental, where appropriate, and recipient organism and other organisms in the experimental release ecosystem.4. Information shall be available to demonstrate that any inserted genetic material is well characterised. Information on the construction of any vector systems or sequences of genetic material used with the carrier DNA shall be available. Where a genetic modification involves the deletion of genetic material, the extent of the deletion shall be known. Sufficient information on the genetic modification shall also be available to enable identification of the GMO and its progeny during a release.5. The GMO shall not present additional or increased risks to human health or the environment under the conditions of the experimental release that are not presented by releases of the corresponding parental, where appropriate, and recipient organisms. Any capacity to spread in the environment and invade other unrelated ecosystems and capacity to transfer genetic material to other organisms in the environment shall not result in adverse effects.ANNEX VIGUIDELINES FOR THE ASSESSMENT REPORTSThe assessment report provided for by Articles 13, 17, 19 and 20 should include in particular the following:1. Identification of the characteristics of the recipient organism which are relevant to the assessment of the GMO(s) in question. Identification of any known risks to human health and the environment resulting from the release into the environment of the recipient non-modified organism.2. Description of the result of the genetic modification in the modified organism.3. Assessment of whether the genetic modification has been characterised sufficiently for the purpose of evaluating any risks to human health and the environment.4. Identification of any new risks to human health and the environment that may arise from the release of the GMO(s) in question as compared to the release of the corresponding non-modified organism(s), based on the environmental risk assessment carried out in accordance with Annex II.5. A conclusion on whether the GMO(s) in question should be placed on the market or as (a) product(s) and under which conditions, whether the GMOs in question shall not be placed on the market or whether the views of other competent authorities and the Commission are sought for on specific issues of the e.r.a.. These aspects should be specified. The conclusion should clearly address the use proposed, risk management and the monitoring plan proposed. In the case that it has been concluded that the GMOs should not be placed on the market, the competent authority shall give reasons for its conclusion.ANNEX VIIMONITORING PLANThis Annex describes in general terms the objective to be achieved and the general principles to be followed to design the monitoring plan referred to in Articles 13(2), 19(3) and 20. It will be supplemented by guidance notes to be developed in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 30(2).These guidance notes shall be completed by 17 October 2002.A. ObjectiveThe objective of a monitoring plan is to:- confirm that any assumption regarding the occurrence and impact of potential adverse effects of the GMO or its use in the e.r.a. are correct, and- identify the occurrence of adverse effects of the GMO or its use on human health or the environment which were not anticipated in the e.r.a.B. General principlesMonitoring, as referred to in Articles 13, 19 and 20, takes place after the consent to the placing of a GMO on the market.The interpretation of the data collected by monitoring should be considered in the light of other existing environmental conditions and activities. Where changes in the environment are observed, further assessment should be considered to establish whether they are a consequence of the GMO or its use, as such changes may be the result of environmental factors other than the placing of the GMO on the market.Experience and data gained through the monitoring of experimental releases of GMOs may assist in designing the post marketing monitoring regime required for the placing on the market of GMOs as or in products.C. Design of the monitoring planThe design of the monitoring plan should:1. be detailed on a case by case basis taking into account the e.r.a.,2. take into account the characteristics of the GMO, the characteristics and scale of its intended use and the range of relevant environmental conditions where the GMO is expected to be released,3. incorporate general surveillance for unanticipated adverse effects and, if necessary, (case-) specific monitoring focusing on adverse effects identified in the e.r.a.:3.1. whereas case-specific monitoring should be carried out for a sufficient time period to detect immediate and direct as well as, where appropriate, delayed or indirect effects which have been identified in the e.r.a.,3.2. whereas surveillance could, if appropriate, make use of already established routine surveillance practices such as the monitoring of agricultural cultivars, plant protection, or veterinary and medical products. An explanation as to how relevant information collected through established routine surveillance practices will be made available to the consent-holder should be provided.4. facilitate the observation, in a systematic manner, of the release of a GMO in the receiving environment and the interpretation of these observations with respect to safety to human health or the environment.5. identify who (notifier, users) will carry out the various tasks the monitoring plan requires and who is responsible for ensuring that the monitoring plan is set into place and carried out appropriately, and ensure that there is a route by which the consent holder and the competent authority will be informed on any observed adverse effects on human health and the environment. (Time points and intervals for reports on the results of the monitoring shall be indicated).6. give consideration to the mechanisms for identifying and confirming any observed adverse effects on human health and environment and enable the consent holder or the competent authority, where appropriate, to take the measures necessary to protect human health and the environment.ANNEX VIIICORRELATION TABLE>TABLE>Commission DeclarationArticle 32 (Amendment 28)The Commission notes the agreement of the co-legislators relating to recital 13 and Article 30(a), on the basis of Amendments 1 and 28, in particular concerning the date by which a proposal should be presented for the implementation of the Cartagena Protocol and the content of any such proposal.In the respect of its right of initiative, the Commission states that it cannot accept to be bound by the provisions of this article neither as to timing nor as to the content of a future proposal.The Commission does however confirm its commitment, after a comprehensive examination of all the potential implications, to presenting a proposal with a view to full implementation of the Cartagena Protocol.Commission Declaration with respect to Amendment 35With a view to facilitating the obligation of Member States to take the necessary measures to ensure traceability and labelling at all the stages of the placing on the market of GMOs authorised in accordance with part C of a revised directive 90/220/eec, the Commission reaffirms its intention to present in the course of year 2001 appropriate proposals for this purpose.In addition, the Commission at the same time having regard to the results of the meeting with the experts of the Member States on 29 November 2000, affirms its intention to present proposals aiming to provide appropriate traceability for products derived from GMOs, as well as to supplement the labelling regime in accordance with the White Paper on Food Safety.", "triples": [" directive 2001/18/ec,  repealing,  directive 90/220/eec"]}}, "summary_annotations": {"32001L0018_p1": {"text": "directive 2001/18/ec of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 March 2001 on the deliberate release into the environment of genetically modified organisms and repealing Council directive 90/220/eec - Commission Declaration (OJ L 106, 17.4.2001, pp. 1-39)", "triples": [" directive 2001/18/ec,  repealing,  directive 90/220/eec"]}, "32001L0018_p2": {"text": "regulation 1830/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 September 2003 concerning the traceability and labelling of genetically modified organisms and the traceability of food and feed products produced from genetically modified organisms and amending directive 2001/18/ec (OJ L 268, 18.10.2003, pp. 24-28).
