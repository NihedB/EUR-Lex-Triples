GENERAL AND FINAL PROVISIONSArticle 10Transitional provisions and development of the Agreement1. For five years after the entry into force of the Agreement, Switzerland may maintain quantitative limits in respect of access to an economic activity for the following two categories of residence: residence for a period of more than four months and less than one year and residence for a period equal to, or exceeding, one year. There shall be no restriction on residence for less than four months.From the beginning of the sixth year, all quantitative limits applicable to nationals of the Member States of the European Community shall be abolished.2. For a maximum period of two years, the Contracting Parties may maintain the controls on the priority of workers integrated into the regular labour market and wage and working conditions applicable to nationals of the other Contracting Party, including the persons providing services referred to in Article 5. Before the end of the first year, the Joint Committee shall consider whether these restrictions need to be maintained. It may curtail the maximum period of two years. The controls on the priority of workers integrated into the regular labour market shall not apply to providers of services liberalised by a specific agreement between the Contracting Parties concerning the provision of services (including the Agreement on certain aspects of government procurement in so far as it covers the provision of services).3. On entry into force of this Agreement and until the end of the fifth year, each year Switzerland shall reserve, within its overall quotas, for employed and self-employed persons of the European Community at least 15000 new residence permits valid for a period equal to, or exceeding, one year and 115500 valid for more than four months and less than one year.4. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 3, the Contracting Parties have agreed on the following arrangements: if, after five years and up to 12 years after the entry into force of the Agreement, the number of new residence permits of either of the categories referred to in paragraph 1 issued to employed and self-employed persons of the European Community in a given year exceeds the average for the three preceding years by more than 10 %, Switzerland may, for the following year, unilaterally limit the number of new residence permits of that category for employed and self-employed persons of the European Community to the average of the three preceding years plus 5 %. The following year, the number may be limited to the same level.Notwithstanding the provisions of the previous subparagraph, the number of new residence permits issued to employed and self-employed persons of the European Community may not be limited to fewer than 15000 per year valid for a period equal to, or exceeding, one year and 115500 per year valid for more than four months and less than one year.5. The transitional provisions of paragraphs 1 to 4, and in particular those of paragraph 2 concerning the priority of workers integrated into the regular labour market and controls on wage and working conditions, shall not apply to employed and self-employed persons who, at the time of this Agreement's entry into force, are authorised to pursue an economic activity in the territory of the Contracting Parties. Such persons shall in particular enjoy occupational and geographical mobility. The holders of residence permits valid for less than one year shall be entitled to have their permits renewed; the exhaustion of quantitative limits may not be invoked against them. The holders of residence permits valid for a period equal to, or exceeding, one year shall automatically be entitled to have their permits extended. Such employed and self-employed persons shall therefore enjoy the rights to free movement accorded to established persons in the basic provisions of this Agreement, and in particular Article 7 thereof, from its entry into force.6. Switzerland shall regularly and promptly forward to the Joint Committee any useful statistics and information, including measures implementing paragraph 2. A Contracting Party may request a review of the situation within the Joint Committee.7. No quantitative limits may be applied to frontier workers.8. The transitional provisions on social security and the retrocession of unemployment insurance contributions are laid down in the Protocol to Annex II.Article 11Processing of appeals1.

Appeals must be processed within a reasonable period of time.3. Persons covered by this Agreement shall have the opportunity to appeal to the competent national judicial body in respect of decisions on appeals, or the absence of a decision within a reasonable period of time.Article 12More favourable provisionsThis Agreement shall not preclude any more favourable national provisions which may exist for both nationals of the Contracting Parties and their family members.Article 13StandstillThe Contracting Parties undertake not to adopt any further restrictive measures vis-à-vis each other's nationals in fields covered by this Agreement.Article 14Joint Committee1. A Joint Committee composed of representatives of the Contracting Parties is hereby established. It shall be responsible for the management and proper application of the Agreement. To that end it shall issue recommendations. It shall take decisions in the circumstances provided for in the Agreement. The Joint Committee shall reach its decisions by mutual agreement.2. In the event of serious economic or social difficulties, the Joint Committee shall meet, at the request of either Contracting Party, to examine appropriate measures to remedy the situation. The Joint Committee may decide what measures to take within 60 days of the date of the request. This period may be extended by the Joint Committee. The scope and duration of such measures shall not exceed that which is strictly necessary to remedy the situation. Preference shall be given to measures that least disrupt the working of this Agreement.3. For the purposes of proper implementation of the Agreement, the Contracting Parties shall regularly exchange information and, at the request of either of them, shall consult each other within the Joint Committee.4. The Joint Committee shall meet as and when necessary and at least once a year. Either Party may request the convening of a meeting. The Joint Committee shall meet within 15 days of a request under paragraph 2.5.

The Final Act shall contain the declarations.Article 16Reference to Community law1. In order to attain the objectives pursued by this Agreement, the Contracting Parties shall take all measures necessary to ensure that rights and obligations equivalent to those contained in the legal acts of the European Community to which reference is made are applied in relations between them.2. Insofar as the application of this Agreement involves concepts of Community law, account shall be taken of the relevant case-law of the Court of Justice of the European Communities prior to the date of its signature. Case-law after that date shall be brought to Switzerland's attention. To ensure that the Agreement works properly, the Joint Committee shall, at the request of either Contracting Party, determine the implications of such case-law.Article 17Development of law1. As soon as one Contracting Party initiates the process of adopting a draft amendment to its domestic legislation, or as soon as there is a change in the case-law of authorities against whose decisions there is no judicial remedy under domestic law in a field governed by this Agreement, it shall inform the other Contracting Party through the Joint Committee.2. The Joint Committee shall hold an exchange of views on the implications of such an amendment for the proper functioning of the Agreement.Article 18RevisionIf a Contracting Party wishes to have this Agreement revised, it shall submit a proposal to that effect to the Joint Committee. Amendments to this Agreement shall enter into force after the respective internal procedures have been completed, with the exception of amendments to Annexes II and III, which shall be adopted by decision of the Joint Committee and may enter into force immediately after that decision.Article 19Settlement of disputes1. The Contracting Parties may bring a matter under dispute which concerns the interpretation or application of this Agreement to the Joint Committee.2. The Joint Committee may settle the dispute. Any information which might be of use in making possible an in-depth examination of the situation with a view to finding an acceptable solution shall be supplied to the Joint Committee. To this end, the Joint Committee shall consider every possible means to maintain the good functioning of this Agreement.Article 20Relationship to bilateral social security agreementsUnless otherwise provided for under Annex II, bilateral social security agreements between Switzerland and the Member States of the European Community shall be suspended on the entry into force of this Agreement, in so far as the latter covers the same subject-matter.Article 21Relationship to bilateral agreements on double taxation1. The provisions of bilateral agreements between Switzerland and the Member States of the European Community on double taxation shall be unaffected by the provisions of this Agreement. In particular, the provisions of this Agreement shall not affect the double taxation agreements' definition of \"frontier workers\".2. No provision of this Agreement may be interpreted in such a way as to prevent the Contracting Parties from distinguishing, when applying the relevant provisions of their fiscal legislation, between taxpayers whose situations are not comparable, especially as regards their place of residence.3. No provision of this Agreement shall prevent the Contracting Parties from adopting or applying measures to ensure the imposition, payment and effective recovery of taxes or to forestall tax evasion under their national tax legislation or agreements aimed at preventing double taxation between Switzerland, of the one part, and one or more Member States of the European Community, of the other part, or any other tax arrangements.Article 22Relationship to bilateral agreements on matters other than social security and double taxation1. Notwithstanding the provisions of Articles 20 and 21, this Agreement shall not affect agreements linking Switzerland, of the one part, and one or more Member States of the European Community, of the other part, such as those concerning private individuals, economic operators, cross-border cooperation or local frontier traffic, in so far as they are compatible with this Agreement.2. In the event of incompatibilities between such agreements and this Agreement, the latter shall prevail.Article 23Acquired rightsIn the event of termination or non-renewal, rights acquired by private individuals shall not be affected. The Contracting Parties shall settle by mutual agreement what action is to be taken in respect of rights in the process of being acquired.Article 24Territorial scopeThis Agreement shall apply, on the one hand, to the territory of Switzerland and, on the other hand, to the territories in which the Treaty establishing the European Community is applicable and under the conditions laid down by that Treaty.Article 25Entry into force and duration1.

The Contracting Party concerned shall grant these persons every facility for obtaining any necessary visas.2. The Contracting Parties shall grant nationals of the Contracting Parties, and members of their family within the meaning of Article 3 of this Annex and posted workers within the meaning of Article 17 of this Annex, the right to leave their territory simply upon production of a valid identity card or passport. The Contracting Parties may not demand any exit visa or equivalent requirement from nationals of the other Contracting Parties.The Contracting Parties, acting in accordance with their laws, shall issue to such nationals, or renew, an identity card or passport, which shall state in particular the holder's nationality.The passport must be valid at least for all the Contracting Parties and for the countries through which the holder must pass when travelling between them. Where the passport is the only document on which the holder may lawfully leave the country, its period of validity may not be less than five years.Article 2Residence and economic activity1. Without prejudice to the provisions for the transitional period, which are laid down in Article 10 of this Agreement and Chapter VII of this Annex, nationals of a Contracting Party shall have the right to reside and pursue an economic activity in the territory of the other Contracting Party under the procedures laid down in Chapters II to IV. That right shall be substantiated through the issue of a residence permit or, for persons from frontier zones, by means of a special permit.Nationals of a Contracting Party shall also have the right to visit another Contracting Party or to remain there after a period of employment of less than one year in order to seek employment and to reside there for a reasonable amount of time, which may be up to six months, to allow them to find out about the employment opportunities corresponding to their professional qualifications and, if necessary, take the appropriate steps to take up employment.

That right shall be substantiated through the issue of a residence permit.3. The residence or special permit granted to nationals of the Contracting Parties shall be issued and renewed free of charge or on payment of a sum not exceeding the charges or taxes which nationals are required to pay for the issue of identity cards. The Contracting Parties shall take the necessary measures to simplify the formalities and procedures for obtaining those documents as far as possible.4.

A person who has the right of residence and is a national of a Contracting Party is entitled to be joined by the members of his family. An employed person must possess housing for his family which is regarded as of normal standard for national employed persons in the region where he is employed, but this provision may not lead to discrimination between national employed persons and employed persons from the other Contracting Party.2. The following shall be regarded as members of the family, whatever their nationality:(a) his spouse and their relatives in the descending line who are under the age of 21 or are dependent;(b) his relatives in the ascending line and those of his spouse who are dependent on him;(c) in the case of a student, his spouse and their dependent children.The Contracting Parties shall facilitate the admission of any member of the family not covered by the provisions of this paragraph under (a), (b) and (c), if that person is a dependant or lives in the household of the national of a Contracting Party in the country of provenance.3. When issuing a residence permit to members of the family of a national of a Contracting Party, the Contracting Parties may require only the documents listed below:(a) the document by virtue of which they entered the territory;(b) a document issued by the competent authority of the state of origin or provenance proving their relationship;(c) for dependants, a document issued by the competent authority of the state of origin or provenance certifying that they are dependants of the person referred to in paragraph 1 or that they live in his household in that state.4. The period of validity of a residence permit issued to a member of the family shall be the same as that of the permit issued to the person on whom he is dependent.5. The spouse and the dependent children or children aged under 21 of a person having a right of residence shall have the right to take up an economic activity whatever their nationality.6. The children of a national of a Contracting Party, whether or not he is pursuing or has pursued an economic activity in the territory of the other Contracting Party, shall be admitted to general education, apprenticeships and vocational training courses on the same basis as nationals of the host state, if those children are living in its territory.The Contracting Parties shall promote initiatives to enable such children to follow the abovementioned courses under the best conditions.Article 4Right to stay1. Nationals of a Contracting Party and members of their family shall have the right to stay in the territory of another Contracting Party after their economic activity has finished.2. In accordance with Article 16 of the Agreement, reference is made to Regulation (EEC) No 1251/70 (OJ L 142, 1970, p. 24)(1) and Directive 75/34/EEC (OJ L 14, 1975, p. 10)(2).Article 5Public order1. The rights granted under the provisions of this Agreement may be restricted only by means of measures which are justified on grounds of public order, public security or public health.2. In accordance with Article 16 of the Agreement, reference is made to Directives 64/221/EEC (OJ L 56, 4.4.1964, p. 850/64)(3), 72/194/EEC (OJ L 121, 26.5.1972, p. 32)(4) and 75/35/EEC (OJ L 14, 20.1.1975, p. 14.)(5)II. EMPLOYED PERSONSArticle 6Rules regarding residence1. An employed person who is a national of a Contracting Party (hereinafter referred to as \"employed person\") and is employed for a period of one year or more by an employer in the host state shall receive a residence permit which is valid for at least five years from its date of issue. It shall be extended automatically for a period of at least five years. When renewed for the first time, its period of validity may be limited, but not to less than one year, where its holder has been involuntarily unemployed for more than 12 consecutive months.2. An employed person who is employed for a period of more than three months but less than one year by an employer in the host state shall receive a residence permit for the same duration as his contract.An employed person who is employed for a period of up to three months does not require a residence permit.3. When issuing residence permits, the Contracting Parties may not require an employed person to produce more than the following documents:(a) the document by virtue of which he entered their territory;(b) a contractual statement from the employer or a written confirmation of engagement.4. A residence permit shall be valid throughout the territory of the issuing state.5. Breaks in residence of less than six consecutive months and absences for the purposes of fulfilling military service obligations shall not affect the validity of the residence permit.6. A valid residence permit may not be withdrawn from an employed person merely on the grounds that he is no longer working, either because he has become temporarily unable to work owing to an accident or illness, or because he is involuntarily unemployed as certified by the competent employment office.7. Completion of the formalities for obtaining a residence permit shall not prevent an applicant immediately taking up employment under the contract he has concluded.Article 7Employed frontier workers1. An employed frontier worker is a national of a Contracting Party who has his residence in the territory of a Contracting Party and who pursues an activity as an employed person in the territory of the other Contracting Party, returning to his place of residence as a rule every day, or at least once a week.2. Frontier workers shall not require a residence permit.The competent authorities of the state of employment may nevertheless issue the frontier worker with a special permit for a period of at least five years or for the duration of his employment where this is longer than three months and less than one year. It shall be extended for at least five years provided that the frontier worker furnishes proof that he is actually pursuing an economic activity.3. Special permits shall be valid throughout the territory of the issuing state.Article 8Occupational and geographical mobility1. Employed persons shall have the right to occupational and geographical mobility throughout the territory of the host state.2. Occupational mobility shall include changes of employer, employment or occupation and changing from employed to self-employed status. Geographical mobility shall include changes in the place of work and residence.Article 9Equal treatment1. An employed person who is a national of a Contracting Party may not, by reason of his nationality, be treated differently in the territory of the other Contracting Party from national employed persons as regards conditions of employment and working conditions, especially as regards pay, dismissal, or reinstatement or re-employment if he becomes unemployed.2. An employed person and the members of his family referred to in Article 3 of this Annex shall enjoy the same tax concessions and welfare benefits as national employed persons and members of their family.3.

These persons may also remain after the end of their employment if they have sufficient financial means to support themselves and the members of their families without having to draw on welfare benefits during their stay, and if they have sickness insurance cover for all risks. Unemployment benefit to which they are entitled under national legislation, and which may if necessary be supplemented under aggregation rules, is to be regarded as such financial means. Financial means are deemed adequate if they exceed the amount below which nationals of the State concerned may, while taking into account their personal circumstances and possibly those of their families, claim welfare benefits. If this precondition is not applicable, the financial means of the applicant are considered adequate if they exceed the level of the minimum social security pension granted by the host State.Seasonal workers may exercise their rights to unemployment benefits in the State of last employment regardless of when the season concerned comes to an end. They may remain after the end of their employment provided that they satisfy the conditions mentioned in the previous paragraph. If they make themselves available for work in the State of residence, they will receive unemployment benefits in that State in accordance with the provisions of Article 71 of Regulation (EEC) no 1408/71.Frontier workers may make themselves available for work in the State of residence or in the State of last employment if they have maintained personal and professional links and thus have better prospects of finding employment there. They will draw unemployment benefits in the State in which they make themselves available for work.PROTOCOLto Annex II to the Agreement on the free movement of personsUnemployment insurance1. The following rules shall apply with respect to unemployment insurance for workers holding a residence permit with a period of validity of less than one year:1.1. Only workers who have paid contributions in Switzerland for the minimum period required under the Federal Unemployment Insurance and Insolvency Allowances Act (loi fédérale sur l'assurance-chômage obligatoire et l'indemnité en cas d'insolvabilité - LACI)(1) and who also satisfy the other conditions of eligibility for unemployment benefit shall be entitled to such benefit provided by the unemployment insurance under the conditions laid down by law.1.2. A portion of the contributions levied for workers whose period of contribution is too short to give entitlement to unemployment benefit in Switzerland under 1.1 shall be refunded to their States of origin in accordance with the provisions of 1.3. in order to contribute towards the cost of benefits provided to these workers in the event of full unemployment; these workers shall then have no entitlement to benefit in the event of their being fully unemployed in Switzerland. They shall, however, be entitled to allowances for bad weather and in the event of the employer becoming insolvent. Benefits in the event of full unemployment shall be paid by the State of origin, provided that the workers concerned make themselves available for work. Periods of insurance completed in Switzerland shall be taken into account in the same way as if they had been completed in the State of origin.1.3. The portion of the contributions levied for workers referred to in 1.2 shall be refunded on an annual basis in accordance with the following provisions:(a) The total contributions of these workers shall be calculated, by country, on the basis of the annual number of workers employed and the average annual contributions paid for each worker (employer's and employee's contributions).(b) Of the amount calculated in this way, a portion thereof corresponding to the relative share represented by unemployment benefit as a percentage of all the allowances referred to in 1.2 shall be refunded to the workers' States of origin, and a portion shall be retained by Switzerland as a reserve for subsequent benefits.(2)(c) Switzerland shall, on an annual basis, provide a statement showing the contributions refunded. If the States of origin so request, it shall indicate the bases for the calculation and the sums refunded. The States of origin shall each year notify Switzerland of the number of recipients of unemployment benefit as referred to in 1.2.2. Frontier workers' unemployment insurance contributions in Switzerland, as provided for under the respective bilateral agreements, shall continue to be refunded.3. The arrangements under 1 and 2 shall apply for a period of seven years from the date of entry into effect of the Agreement. If, at the end of the seven-year period, a Member State encounters difficulties with the ending of the arrangements for refunding of contributions, or Switzerland encounters difficulties with the aggregation arrangements, the matter may be referred to the Joint Committee by any of the contracting parties.Allowances for helpless personsAllowances for helpless persons under the Federal Old-Age and Survivors' Insurance Act (loi fédérale sur l'assurance-vieillesse et survivants) and the Federal Invalidity Insurance Act (loi fédérale sur l'assurance-invalidité) shall, by means of a decision of the Joint Committee, be provided for in the text of Annex II to the Agreement on the free movement of persons in Annex IIa to Regulation No 1408/71, as soon as the amendment of these Acts stipulating that these benefits shall be financed exclusively by the public authorities enters into effect.Occupational benefit plans concerning old-age, survivors' and invalidity pensionsNotwithstanding Article 10 (2) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 1408/71, the vested benefit provided for under the Federal Act on free movement among occupational benefit plans concerning old-age, survivors' and invalidity pensions (Loi fédérale sur le libre passage dans la prévoyance professionnelle vieillesse, survivants et invalidité) of 17 December 1993 shall be paid out on request to an employed or self-employed person who intends to leave Switzerland for good and who, under Title II of the Regulation, will no longer be subject to Swiss law, provided that they leave Switzerland within five years of this Agreement entering into effect.(1) Currently six months, or 12 months in the event of recurrent unemployment.(2) Refunded contributions for workers who will exercise their right to unemployment benefit in Switzerland after having paid contributions for at least six months - over several periods of residence - within the space of two years.ANNEX IIIMUTUAL RECOGNITION OF PROFESSIONAL QUALIFICATIONS(Diplomas, certificates and other evidence of formal qualifications)1.

The agreement provides protection against discrimination based on nationality.Other rights related to the free movement of persons concern:\nthe right to occupational and geographical mobility;\nthe right of residence for members of the family and their right to pursue an economic activity, irrespective of their nationality;\nthe right to acquire immovable property, specifically in order to establish a main or secondary residence in the host country;\nthe right to return to the host country after the end of an economic activity or period of residence there.\nThe agreement also provides for the coordination of social security systems under the principle of equal treatment, as well as the mutual recognition of professional qualifications.\nProviding servicesService providers, including companies, may temporarily provide a service on the territory of another contracting party to the agreement under the same conditions as nationals of that country. This right does not apply to services carried out on the territory of a contracting party for persons receiving services who are located in the territory of the other party.This service must not exceed 90 days of work in a calendar year.
