Scope of the common principles (a) The common principles laid down in this Annex shall apply to cover for supplier credit transactions with public or private buyers and to cover for buyer credit transactions with public or private borrowers.(b) The common principles shall apply to cover for all risks as defined in point 4. Nevertheless, the insurer may decide in each individual case to limit its cover to certain risks only.(c) When all the obligations of a private debtor are wholly and unconditionally guaranteed by an entity which is considered public in accordance with point 5 of this Annex, the common principles for public debtors shall apply.When used in this Annex, the term 'debtor` means either the buyer or borrower as referred to in point 1(a), or their guarantor with regard to the insured transaction.2. Characteristics of supplier credit (a) The term 'supplier credit` shall apply to a commercial contract providing for an export of goods and/or services originating in a Member State between one or more suppliers and one or more buyers, whereby the buyer(s) undertake to pay the supplier(s) on cash terms or on credit terms.(b) Cover provisions for supplier credit shall apply where cover is given to enterprises established in a Member State in accordance with Article 58 of the Treaty.(c) If a commercial contract is being financed by means of a buyer credit or any other financing arrangement, cover given to the exporter for the commercial contract itself shall follow the provisions for cover for supplier credits.3. Characteristics of buyer credit (a) The term 'buyer credit` shall apply to a loan agreement between one or more financial institutions and one or more borrowers financing a commercial contract providing for an export of goods and/or services originating in a Member State, whereby the lending institution(s) undertake to pay the supplier(s) under the underlying transaction on cash terms on behalf of the buyer(s)/borrower(s), while the buyer(s)/borrower(s) will reimburse the lending institution(s) on credit terms.(b) Cover provisions for buyer credit shall apply where cover is given to financial institutions, irrespective of their place of establishment or registration, provided that the buyer credit constitutes an unconditional obligation of the borrower to repay its debt, irrespective of the performance of the commercial contract to be financed.(c) Cover provisions for buyer credit shall apply to cover given to a financial institution in respect of negotiable instruments properly held by that financial institution and payable by a buyer pursuant to any arrangement for the financing of a commercial contract.4. Definition of the risks involved (a) The commercial risk for private debtors is determined by points 14, 15 and 16.(b) The political risk for private debtors is determined by points 17 to 22, and for public debtors by points 15 to 22.(c) The manufacturing risk is determined by point 6(b).(d) The credit risk is determined by point 6(c).5. Status of the debtor (a) Any entity which, in whatever form, represents the public authority itself and which cannot, either judicially or administratively, be declared insolvent, shall be considered as a public debtor. This may either be a sovereign debtor, i.e. an entity which represents the full faith and credit of the State, e.g. the Ministry of Finance or the Central Bank, or any other subordinate public entity, such as regional, municipal or parastatal authorities or other public institutions.(b) When assessing the status of a debtor, the insurer shall take into account:- the legal status of the debtor,- the real effectiveness of any legal action against the debtor,- the debtor's sources of finance and revenue; this shall take account of the fact that a public debtor may also discharge his debts by using sources which are not related to central government funds, for example through revenues raised by local taxation, or by providing public services,- the degree of influence or control over the debtor that can be exercised by the host country government.(c) Any debtor which is not public, according to the aforementioned criteria, shall be, in principle, considered as private.Section 2: Scope of cover 6. Covered risk (a) The covered risks shall be the risk of loss arising from the manufacturing and the credit risk.(b) Loss arising from manufacturing risk materialises when the performance of the contractual obligations of the policyholder, or the manufacture of the goods ordered, has been suspended for a period of six consecutive months, provided that such suspension is caused directly and exclusively by the occurrence of one or more of the covered causes of loss listed in points 14 to 22.(c) Loss arising from credit risk materialises when the policyholder has been unable to obtain payment of any amount due to it under the relevant commercial contract or loan agreement during a period of three months after the due date, provided that such non-payment is caused directly and exclusively by the occurrence of one or more of the covered causes of loss listed in points 14 to 22.(d) Where the risk related to a buyer credit is guaranteed unconditionally the insurer shall follow the principles and procedures laid down in points 32, 33, and 47(a).7. Extent of cover (a) Cover for manufacturing risk shall include, within the limit of the contract amount, the costs incurred by the policyholder either in performing its contractual obligations or in manufacturing the goods subject to the contract, provided that such costs are properly attributable to the performance of the contract.Cover for the manufacturing risk shall not include:- costs incurred in respect of goods and/or services for which cover of the credit risk has already taken effect,- amounts paid by the policyholder following the calling of a bond issued in respect of the covered contract; however, this does not prevent the insurer from covering such risks outside the scope of this Directive, and- amounts corresponding to penalties and damages paid by the policyholder to the debtor.(b) Cover for credit risk shall include the amount (principal and interest) owed by the buyer under the commercial contract or by the borrower under the loan agreement, including interest accruing after the due date (post-maturity interest).Cover for credit risk shall exclude amounts corresponding to penalties and damages paid by the policyholder to the debtor.8. Percentage of cover (a) The percentage of cover and the basis for determining the maximum amount of the indemnity for which the insurer may be liable shall be expressly laid down in the credit insurance policy issued by the insurer.(b) If an insurer gives a cover percentage higher than 95 %, it shall follow the principles and procedures laid down in points 32, 33 and 47(a).9. Uninsured percentage Without prejudice to the provisions of point 8(b), the policyholder shall retain for its own account any uninsured percentage. The insurer may decide to allow the policyholder to wholly or partially lay off such uninsured percentage.10.

Foreign supplies Subcontracts with parties in one or more Member States are automatically included in the cover in accordance with Council Decision 82/854/EEC of 10 December 1982 on the rules applicable, in the fields of export guarantees and finance for export, to certain subcontracts with parties in other Member States or in non-member countries (1).12. Effective date of cover (a) In case of a buyer credit, cover shall take effect on the date of entry into force of the loan agreement, provided that the conditions precedent stipulated in the credit insurance policy and the loan agreement have been met.(b) In case of a supplier credit, cover of the manufacturing risk shall take effect on the date of entry into force of the commercial contract, provided that the conditions precedent stipulated in the credit insurance policy and the commercial contract have been met.Cover of the credit risk shall take effect on the date on which full completion of the contractual obligations of the policyholder entitles the latter to payment, provided that the conditions precedent stipulated in the credit insurance policy and the commercial contract have been met. However, cover of the credit risk may take effect on the date of each partial delivery or partial dispatch, provided that the policyholder, under the terms of the contract, is entitled to payment of a fixed and definitive amount corresponding to the value of the goods and/or services delivered or dispatched.Section 3: Causes of loss and exclusions of liability 13. Liability of the insurer The insurer shall be liable if the loss is directly and exclusively attributable to one or more of the covered causes of loss laid down in points 14 to 22.14.

Decision of the country of the insurer or of the policyholder Any measure or decision of the government of the country of the insurer or of the policyholder, including measures and decisions of the European Community, relating to trade between a Member State and third countries, such as a ban on exports, in so far as its effects are not covered otherwise by the government concerned.22.

Claim waiting period (a) The claim waiting period shall correspond to the period of time set for the covered risk to materialise, as laid down in point 6(b) and (c).(b) No claim waiting period need apply:- when, in the case of a private debtor, the non-payment is due to the debtor's insolvency, either de jure or de facto,- in case of a bilateral intergovernmental debt restructuring agreement.25. Indemnification and assignment (a) The policyholder is entitled to indemnification at the end of the claim waiting period as defined in point 24, provided that the conditions precedent to the insurance and the indemnification have been fulfilled, the claim is legally valid, and the policyholder has managed the risk with due diligence.(b) The insurer is entitled to assignment of the policyholder's rights under, respectively, the loan agreement or the commercial contract.26. Secured obligations If the debtor's obligations to the policyholder have been secured by means of a guarantee or other security, the policyholder must have taken all necessary measures as required in the policy to ensure not only that the guarantee or other security is valid and enforceable, but also to actually enforce the security.27. Calculation of the claim Without prejudice to the provisions of point 31, the insurer shall, in calculating the payment of a claim, not pay the policyholder an amount exceeding the actual amount of its total loss, and/or exceeding the amount which the policyholder was actually entitled to receive from the borrower under the loan agreement or from the buyer under the commercial contract, respectively.28. Payment of the claim The claim shall be paid without delay, at the latest, however, within one month of the end of the claim waiting period, provided that the insurer has been notified promptly of the occurrence of the claim and received all necessary information, documents, and evidence in order to establish the validity of the claim in good time.In the case of cover for manufacturing risk, the claim shall be paid within one month either of the end of the claim waiting period, or of the date of receipt of an expert's report, where relevant, or of the date of agreement by the policyholder and the insurer on the amount of the claim, whichever is later.29. Disputes relating to the claim If losses subject to an application for indemnification by the policyholder relate to rights which are in dispute, the insurer may defer the payment of the claim until the dispute is settled in favour of the policyholder by the court or arbitration body provided for in the loan agreement or the commercial contract, respectively.30. Bilateral intergovernmental debt restructuring agreement (a) If the covered loan agreement or commercial contract is subject to a bilateral intergovernmental debt restructuring agreement, the policyholder shall follow the conditions of the restructuring agreement in respect of both the insured and the uninsured portions of that loan agreement or commercial contract, respectively. The policyholder shall give any necessary assistance to the insurer for the performance of the restructuring agreement.(b) If the insured amount is included in a bilateral intergovernmental debt restructuring agreement, the insurer may waive the one-month period provided for in point 28, once the bilateral agreement is effective.31. Additional costs Additional costs resulting from action to minimise or avoid loss shall be covered proportionally to the percentage of cover under the credit insurance policy, provided that they have been approved by the insurer. Additional costs include costs of court action and other legal expenses to minimise or avoid loss but exclude costs of establishing the validity of a claim.However, if such costs also relate to amounts or maturities not covered by the insurer, they shall be attributed proportionally to the insured and uninsured amounts or maturities.CHAPTER II: PREMIUM 32. General principles for setting the premium Premiums shall converge. To this end the premium charged for export credit insurance shall:- correspond to the risk (country, sovereign, public and/or private risk) covered,- adequately reflect the scope and the quality of the cover granted,- not be inadequate to cover long-term operating costs and losses.33. Quality of cover When determining the quality of cover as mentioned in point 32, the insurer shall duly take into account the percentage of cover, the conditionality of cover, and any other condition affecting the quality of cover.34. Country risk assessment The level of premium charged for each country or each country category shall be based on an appropriate country risk assessment.35. Creditworthiness of the debtor When setting premium rates, the insurer shall appropriately take the creditworthiness of the debtor including its status as set out in point 5 into account.36. Risk period When calculating the premium, the insurer shall take account of the total risk period as well as the repayment profile and interest.37. Chargeable amount (a) Premium shall be paid on the chargeable amount and shall be based, as far as possible, on minimum premium benchmarks. The benchmarks shall be expressed in percentages of a reference value as if the premium were collected in full at the date of the insurance or guarantee; for credit risk this reference value shall at least be, respectively, the amount of the principal of the loan or the (re-)financed portion of the commercial contract, and for manufacturing risk the total contract value minus the downpayment.(b) In the case of manufacturing risk, the chargeable amount may be reduced to the expected maximum loss.38. Payment of premium (a) The total premium amount shall be due on the date of the credit insurance policy or guarantee or when the contract or loan agreement becomes fully effective.(b) The premium may be paid in instalments or by adding a spread to the interest rate, provided that this corresponds, in net present value terms, to the premium amount referred to in point 38(a) above.CHAPTER III: COUNTRY COVER POLICY 39. Determination of the country cover policy (a) The insurer shall, in the light of its size and the structural economic constraints, base its country cover policy on its assessment of the risk by country, its total outstanding exposure for each country, and the composition of its country risk portfolio.(b) In setting its country cover policy, the insurer shall take into account each debtor country's classification.(c) Nevertheless, the insurer shall be free to stop or limit insuring business for a particular country, regardless of the country classification.40. Definition of total outstanding exposure The total outstanding exposure shall, within the limits of the percentage of cover, be determined on the basis of the amounts for medium and long-term business, as defined in Article 1 of the Directive.41. Country risk (a) As regards the group of countries which constitute the best risk, the insurer shall, in principle, set no restrictions on its cover policy.(b) For other countries, the insurer may set restrictions on its cover policy.(c) An insurer which, in principle, does not offer cover for a country or a particular group of countries, may, however, exceptionally cover certain transactions for reasons of bilateral policy or national interest, or where sufficient freely convertible foreign exchange is available for the transaction in question.(d) Concerning the countries referred to in point (b) above, insurers may set risk limits, in cumulative or alternative manner, for example:- the total outstanding exposure for that country,- the total value of offers of cover,- the value of new contracts to be covered,- the maximum amount covered per transaction.Insurers may also increase the applicable premium.Below the risk limits for a particular country, there shall in principle be no limit on cover policy.42. Specific conditions for country cover In any case, the insurer may routinely apply to a particular country, irrespective of the corresponding country category, certain cover conditions such as:- payment and/or transfer guarantee by the Central Bank or the Finance Ministry of the relevant country,- irrevocable letter of credit or bank guarantee,- extension of the claim waiting period,- reduction in the cover percentage,- restriction of the cover for certain sectors of activity or for certain types of projects.CHAPTER IV: NOTIFICATION PROCEDURES 43. Scope of the notification procedures (a) Insurers shall apply the following procedures to the common principles set out in Chapters I, II and III.(b) These procedures shall supplement those established under Council Decision 73/391/EEC of 3 December 1973 on consultation and information procedures in matters of credit insurance, credit guarantees and financial credits (2).44.
