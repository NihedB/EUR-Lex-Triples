Privileged access shall not be regarded as being established by those measures which give rise to:  - obligations for funding social housing under special terms such as, inter alia, an obligation to centralize funds with public financial institutions, when the funding terms prevailing for the public sector are identical to those for funding of the  same nature granted to private borrowers for the same purposes,  - the obligation to centralize funds with a public credit institution, in so far as such a constraint is an integral part, as at 1 January 1994, of the organization of a particular network of credit institutions or of specific savings arrangements  designed for households and intended to provide the whole of the network or the specific arrangements with financial security. The use of such centralized funds must be determined by the management bodies of the public credit institution concerned and  comply with the principle of a market economy where there is free competition,  - obligations to finance the repair of disaster damage, provided that the conditions for financing repairs are not more favourable when damage is sustained by the public sector than when it is sustained by the private sector.  Article 2  For the purposes of Article 104a of the Treaty, 'prudential considerations' shall be those which underlie national laws, regulations or administrative actions based on, or consistent with, EC law and designed to promote the soundness of financial  institutions so as to strengthen the stability of the financial system as a whole and the protection of the customers of those institutions.  Article 3  1. For the purposes of Article 104a of the Treaty, 'public undertaking' shall be defined as any undertaking over which the State or other regional or local authorities may exercise directly or indirectly a dominant influence by virtue of their ownership  of it, their financial participation therein or the rules which govern it.  A dominant influence on the part of the State or other regional or local authorities shall be presumed when these authorities, directly or indirectly in relation to an undertaking:  (a) hold the major part of the undertaking's subscribed capital;  (b) control the majority of the votes attaching to shares issued by the undertaking; or (c) can appoint more than half of the members of the undertaking's administrative, managerial or supervisory body.  2. Without prejudice to their obligation as public authorities not to take measures establishing privileged access within the meaning of Article 104a of the Treaty, the European Central Bank and the national central banks shall not, for the purposes of  this Article, be considered as forming part of the public sector.  3. 'National central banks' means the central banks of the Member States and the Luxembourg Monetary Institute.  Article 4  1.
