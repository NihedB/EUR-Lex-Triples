{"celex_id": "32009R1223", "reference": "22.12.2009\nEN\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\nL 342/59\nREGULATION (EC) No 1223/2009 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL\nof 30 November 2009\non cosmetic products\n(recast)\n(Text with EEA relevance)\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 95 thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the Commission,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee (1),\nActing in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty (2),\nWhereas:\n(1)\nCouncil Directive 76/768/EEC of 27 July 1976 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to cosmetic products (3) has been significantly amended on several occasions. Since further amendments are to be made, in this particular case it should be recast as one single text in the interests of clarity.\n(2)\nA Regulation is the appropriate legal instrument as it imposes clear and detailed rules which do not give room for diverging transposition by Member States. Moreover, a Regulation ensures that legal requirements are implemented at the same time throughout the Community.\n(3)\nThis Regulation aims at simplifying procedures and streamlining terminology, thereby reducing administrative burden and ambiguities. Moreover, it strengthens certain elements of the regulatory framework for cosmetics, such as in-market control, with a view to ensuring a high level of protection of human health.\n(4)\nThis Regulation comprehensively harmonises the rules in the Community in order to achieve an internal market for cosmetic products while ensuring a high level of protection of human health.\n(5)\nThe environmental concerns that substances used in cosmetic products may raise are considered through the application of Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 December 2006 concerning the Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH) and establishing a European Chemicals Agency (4), which enables the assessment of environmental safety in a cross-sectoral manner.\n(6)\nThis Regulation relates only to cosmetic products and not to medicinal products, medical devices or biocidal products. The delimitation follows in particular from the detailed definition of cosmetic products, which refers both to their areas of application and to the purposes of their use.\n(7)\nThe assessment of whether a product is a cosmetic product has to be made on the basis of a case-by-case assessment, taking into account all characteristics of the product. Cosmetic products may include creams, emulsions, lotions, gels and oils for the skin, face masks, tinted bases (liquids, pastes, powders), make-up powders, after-bath powders, hygienic powders, toilet soaps, deodorant soaps, perfumes, toilet waters and eau de Cologne, bath and shower preparations (salts, foams, oils, gels), depilatories, deodorants and anti-perspirants, hair colorants, products for waving, straightening and fixing hair, hair-setting products, hair-cleansing products (lotions, powders, shampoos), hair-conditioning products (lotions, creams, oils), hairdressing products (lotions, lacquers, brilliantines), shaving products (creams, foams, lotions), make-up and products removing make-up, products intended for application to the lips, products for care of the teeth and the mouth, products for nail care and make-up, products for external intimate hygiene, sunbathing products, products for tanning without sun, skin-whitening products and anti-wrinkle products.\n(8)\nThe Commission should define the categories of cosmetic products which are relevant for the application of this Regulation.\n(9)\nCosmetic products should be safe under normal or reasonably foreseeable conditions of use. In particular, a risk-benefit reasoning should not justify a risk to human health.\n(10)\nThe presentation of a cosmetic product and in particular its form, odour, colour, appearance, packaging, labelling, volume or size should not endanger health and safety of consumers due to confusion with foodstuffs, in accordance with Council Directive 87/357/EEC of 25 June 1987 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States concerning products which, appearing to be other than they are, endanger the health or safety of consumers (5).\n(11)\nIn order to establish clear responsibilities, each cosmetic product should be linked to a responsible person established within the Community.\n(12)\nEnsuring traceability of a cosmetic product throughout the whole supply chain helps to make market surveillance simpler and more efficient. An efficient traceability system facilitates market surveillance authorities’ task of tracing economic operators.\n(13)\nIt is necessary to determine under which conditions a distributor is to be considered as the responsible person.\n(14)\nAll legal or natural persons in the wholesale trade as well as retailers selling directly to the consumer are covered by reference to the distributor. The obligations of the distributor should therefore be adapted to the respective role and part of the activity of each of these operators.\n(15)\nThe European cosmetics sector is one of the industrial activities affected by counterfeiting, which may increase risks to human health. Member States should pay particular attention to the implementation of horizontal Community legislation and measures regarding counterfeit products in the field of cosmetic products, for example Council Regulation (EC) No 1383/2003 of 22 July 2003 concerning customs action against goods suspected of infringing certain intellectual property rights and the measures to be taken against goods found to have infringed such rights (6) and Directive 2004/48/EC of the European parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on the enforcement of intellectual property rights (7). In-market controls represent a powerful means of identifying products that do not comply with the requirements of this Regulation.\n(16)\nTo ensure their safety, cosmetic products placed on the market should be produced according to good manufacturing practice.\n(17)\nFor the purpose of effective market surveillance, a product information file should be made readily accessible, at one single address within the Community, to the competent authority of the Member State where the file is located.\n(18)\nIn order to be comparable and of high quality, the results of the non-clinical safety studies carried out for the purposes of assessing the safety of a cosmetic product should comply with the relevant Community legislation.\n(19)\nIt should be made clear which information is to be made available to the competent authorities. That information should include all the necessary particulars relating to identity, quality, safety for human health and the effects claimed for the cosmetic product. In particular, this product information should include a cosmetic product safety report documenting that a safety assessment has been conducted.\n(20)\nTo ensure the uniform application and control of the restrictions for substances, sampling and analysis should be carried out in a reproducible and standardised manner.\n(21)\nThe term ‘mixture’ as defined in this Regulation should have the same meaning as the term ‘preparation’ previously used in Community legislation.\n(22)\nFor reasons of effective market surveillance, the competent authorities should be notified of certain information about the cosmetic product placed on the market.\n(23)\nIn order to allow for rapid and appropriate medical treatment in the event of difficulties, the necessary information about the product formulation should be submitted to poison control centres and assimilated entities, where such centres have been established by Member States to that end.\n(24)\nIn order to keep administrative burdens to a minimum, the notified information for competent authorities, poison control centres and assimilated entities should be submitted centrally for the Community by way of an electronic interface.\n(25)\nIn order to ensure a smooth transition to the new electronic interface, economic operators should be allowed to notify the information required in accordance with this Regulation before its date of application.\n(26)\nThe general principle of the responsibility of the manufacturer or importer for the safety of the product should be supported by restrictions of some substances in Annexes II and III. Moreover, substances which are intended to be used as colorants, preservatives and UV-filters should be listed in the Annexes IV, V and VI respectively in order to be allowed for these uses.\n(27)\nTo avoid ambiguities, it should be clarified that the list of allowed colorants contained in Annex IV includes only substances which colour through absorption and reflection and not substances which colour through photoluminescence, interference, or chemical reaction.\n(28)\nTo address safety concerns raised, Annex IV, which is currently restricted to skin colorants, should also include hair colorants once the risk assessment of these substances by the Scientific Committee for Consumer Safety (SCCS) set up by Commission Decision 2008/721/EC of 5 September 2008 setting up an advisory structure of Scientific Committees and experts in the field of consumer safety, public health and the environment (8) has been finalised. To this end, the Commission should have the possibility to include hair colorants in the scope of that Annex by the comitology procedure.\n(29)\nThe use of nanomaterials in cosmetic products may increase with the further development of technology. In order to ensure a high level of consumer protection, free movement of goods and legal certainty for manufacturers, it is necessary to develop a uniform definition for nanomaterials at international level. The Community should endeavour to reach an agreement on a definition in appropriate international fora. Should such an agreement be reached, the definition of nanomaterials in this Regulation should be adapted accordingly.\n(30)\nAt present, there is inadequate information on the risks associated with nanomaterials. In order to better assess their safety the SCCS should provide guidance in cooperation with relevant bodies on test methodologies which take into account specific characteristics of nanomaterials.\n(31)\nThe Commission should regularly review the provisions on nanomaterials in the light of scientific progress.\n(32)\nGiven the hazardous properties of substances classified as carcinogenic, mutagenic or toxic for reproduction (CMR), category 1A, 1B and 2, pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 December 2008 on classification, labelling and packaging of substances and mixtures (9), their use in cosmetic products should be prohibited. However, as a hazardous property of a substance does not necessarily always entail a risk, there should be a possibility to allow the use of substances classified as CMR 2 substances where, in view of exposure and concentration, they have been found safe for use in cosmetic products by the SCCS and are regulated by the Commission in the Annexes to this Regulation. With regard to substances which are classified as CMR 1A or 1B substances, there should be a possibility, in the exceptional case that these substances comply with food safety requirements, inter alia as a result of their naturally occurring in food, and that no suitable alternative substances exist, to use such substances in cosmetic products on the condition that such use has been found safe by the SCCS. Where such conditions are met, the Commission should amend the relevant Annexes to this Regulation within 15 months of classification of substances as CMR 1A or 1B substances under Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008. Such substances should be continuously reviewed by the SCCS.\n(33)\nA safety assessment of substances, particularly those classified as CMR 1A or 1B substances, should consider the overall exposure to such substances stemming from all sources. At the same time, for those involved in producing safety assessments, it is essential that there be a harmonised approach to the development and use of such overall exposure estimates. In consequence, the Commission, in close cooperation with the SCCS, the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA), the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and other relevant stakeholders, should, as a matter of urgency, carry out a review and develop guidance regarding the production and use of overall exposure estimates for these substances.\n(34)\nThe assessment by the SCCS of the use of substances classified as CMR 1A and 1B in cosmetic products should also take into account the exposure to those substances of vulnerable population groups, such as children under three years of age, elderly people, pregnant and breast-feeding women and persons with compromised immune responses.\n(35)\nThe SCCS should give opinions where appropriate on the safety of use of nanomaterials in cosmetic products. These opinions should be based on full information being made available by the responsible person.\n(36)\nAction by the Commission and Member States relating to the protection of human health should be based on the precautionary principle.\n(37)\nIn order to ensure product safety, prohibited substances should be acceptable at trace levels only if they are technologically inevitable with correct manufacturing processes and provided that the product is safe.\n(38)\nThe Protocol on protection and welfare of animals annexed to the Treaty provides that the Community and the Member States are to pay full regard to the welfare requirements of animals in the implementation of Community policies, in particular with regard to the internal market.\n(39)\nCouncil Directive 86/609/EEC of 24 November 1986 on the approximation of laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States regarding the protection of animals used for experimental and other scientific purposes (10) established common rules for the use of animals for experimental purposes within the Community and laid down the conditions under which such experiments must be carried out in the territory of the Member States. In particular, Article 7 of that Directive requires that animal experiments be replaced by alternative methods, where such methods exist and are scientifically satisfactory.\n(40)\nThe safety of cosmetic products and their ingredients may be ensured through the use of alternative methods which are not necessarily applicable to all uses of chemical ingredients. Therefore, the use of such methods by the whole cosmetic industry should be promoted and their adoption at Community level ensured, where such methods offer an equivalent level of protection to consumers.\n(41)\nThe safety of finished cosmetic products can already be ensured on the basis of knowledge of the safety of the ingredients that they contain. Provisions prohibiting animal testing of finished cosmetic products should therefore be laid down. The application, in particular by small and medium-sized enterprises, of both test methods and assessment procedures for relevant available data, including the use of read-across and weight-of-evidence approaches, which do not involve the use of animals for assessing the safety of finished cosmetic products could be facilitated by Commission guidelines.\n(42)\nIt will gradually become possible to ensure the safety of ingredients used in cosmetic products by using non-animal alternative methods validated at Community level, or approved as being scientifically validated, by the European Centre for the Validation of Alternative Methods (ECVAM) and with due regard to the development of validation within the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). After consulting the SCCS as regards the applicability of the validated alternative methods to the field of cosmetic products, the Commission should immediately publish the validated or approved methods recognised as being applicable to such ingredients. In order to achieve the highest possible degree of animal protection, a deadline should be set for the introduction of a definitive prohibition.\n(43)\nThe Commission established timetables of deadlines up to 11 March 2009 for prohibiting the marketing of cosmetic products, the final formulation, ingredients or combinations of ingredients which have been tested on animals, and for prohibiting each test currently carried out using animals. In view, however, of tests concerning repeated-dose toxicity, reproductive toxicity and toxicokinetics, it is appropriate for the final deadline for prohibiting the marketing of cosmetic products for which those tests are used to be 11 March 2013. On the basis of annual reports, the Commission should be authorised to adapt the timetables within the abovementioned maximum time limit.\n(44)\nBetter coordination of resources at Community level will contribute to increasing the scientific knowledge indispensable for the development of alternative methods. It is essential, for this purpose, that the Community continue and increase its efforts and take the measures necessary for the promotion of research and the development of new non-animal alternative methods, in particular within its Framework Programmes for research.\n(45)\nThe recognition by third countries of alternative methods developed in the Community should be encouraged. In order to achieve this objective, the Commission and the Member States should take all appropriate steps to facilitate acceptance of such methods by the OECD. The Commission should also endeavour, within the framework of European Community cooperation agreements, to obtain recognition of the results of safety tests carried out in the Community using alternative methods so as to ensure that the export of cosmetic products for which such methods have been used is not hindered and to prevent or avoid third countries requiring the repetition of such tests using animals.\n(46)\nTransparency is needed regarding the ingredients used in cosmetic products. Such transparency should be achieved by indication of the ingredients used in a cosmetic product on its packaging. Where for practical reasons it is impossible to indicate the ingredients on the packaging, such information should be enclosed so that the consumer has access to this information.\n(47)\nA glossary of common ingredient names should be compiled by the Commission to ensure uniform labelling and to facilitate identification of cosmetics ingredients. This glossary should not be intended to constitute a limitative list of substances used in cosmetic products.\n(48)\nIn order to inform consumers, cosmetic products should bear precise and easily understandable indications concerning their durability for use. Given that consumers should be informed of the date until which the cosmetic product will continue to fulfil its initial function and remain safe, it is important to know the date of minimum durability, i.e. the date by which it is best to use the product. Where the minimum durability is more than 30 months, the consumer should be informed of the period of time after opening that the cosmetic product may be used without any harm to the consumer. However, this requirement should not apply where the concept of the durability after opening is not relevant, that is to say for single-use products, products not at risk of deterioration or products which do not open.\n(49)\nA number of substances have been identified by the SCCS as likely to cause allergic reactions and it will be necessary to restrict their use and/or impose certain conditions concerning them. In order to ensure that consumers are adequately informed, the presence of these substances should be mentioned in the list of ingredients and consumers’ attention should be drawn to the presence of these ingredients. This information should improve the diagnosis of contact allergies among consumers and should enable them to avoid the use of cosmetic products which they do not tolerate. For substances which are likely to cause allergy to a significant part of the population, other restrictive measures such as a ban or a restriction of concentration should be considered.\n(50)\nIn the safety assessment of a cosmetic product it should be possible to take into account results of risk assessments that have been carried out in other relevant areas. The use of such data should be duly substantiated and justified.\n(51)\nThe consumer should be protected from misleading claims concerning efficacy and other characteristics of cosmetic products. In particular Directive 2005/29/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 May 2005 concerning unfair business-to-consumer commercial practices in the internal market (11) is applicable. Furthermore, the Commission, in cooperation with Member States, should define common criteria in relation to specific claims for cosmetic products.\n(52)\nIt should be possible to claim on a cosmetic product that no animal testing was carried out in relation to its development. The Commission, in consultation with the Member States, has developed guidelines to ensure that common criteria are applied in the use of claims and that an aligned understanding of the claims is reached, and in particular that such claims do not mislead the consumer. In developing such guidelines, the Commission has also taken into account the views of the many small and medium-sized enterprises which make up the majority of the ‘non-animal testing’ producers, relevant non-governmental organisations, and the need for consumers to be able to make practical distinctions between products on the basis of animal testing criteria.\n(53)\nIn addition to the labelled information, consumers should be given the possibility to request certain product-related information from the responsible person in order to make informed product choices.\n(54)\nEffective market surveillance is necessary in order to ensure that the provisions of this Regulation are respected. To this end, serious undesirable effects should be notified and competent authorities should have a possibility to request from the responsible person a list of cosmetic products containing substances which have raised serious doubts in terms of safety.\n(55)\nThis Regulation is without prejudice to the possibility for Member States to regulate, in compliance with Community law, the notification by health professionals or consumers of serious undesirable effects to the competent authorities of Member States.\n(56)\nThis Regulation is without prejudice to the possibility for Member States to regulate, in compliance with Community law, the establishment of economic operators in the area of cosmetic products.\n(57)\nIn case of non-compliance with this Regulation, a clear and efficient procedure for the withdrawal and recall of products may be necessary. This procedure should, where possible, build upon existing Community rules for unsafe goods.\n(58)\nIn order to address cosmetic products which, despite complying with the provisions of this Regulation, might endanger human health, a safeguard procedure should be introduced.\n(59)\nThe Commission should provide indications for the uniform interpretation and application of the concept of serious risks in order to facilitate the consistent implementation of this Regulation.\n(60)\nIn order to comply with principles of good administrative practices, any decision by a competent authority in the framework of market surveillance should be duly substantiated.\n(61)\nIn order to ensure effective in-market control, a high degree of administrative cooperation amongst the competent authorities is necessary. This concerns in particular mutual assistance in the verification of product information files located in another Member State.\n(62)\nThe Commission should be assisted by the SCCS, an independent risk assessment body.\n(63)\nThe measures necessary for the implementation of this Regulation should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission (12).\n(64)\nIn particular, power should be conferred on the Commission to adapt the Annexes to this Regulation to technical progress. Since those measures are of general scope and are designed to amend non-essential elements of this Regulation they must be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny provided for in Article 5a of Decision 1999/468/EC.\n(65)\nWhen, on imperative grounds of urgency, the normal time-limits for the regulatory procedure with scrutiny cannot be complied with, the Commission should be able to apply the urgency procedure provided for in Article 5a(6) of Decision 1999/468/EC for the adoption of certain measures relating to CMRs, nanomaterials and potential risks to human health.\n(66)\nMember States should lay down provisions on penalties applicable to infringements of the provisions of this Regulation and ensure that they are implemented. Those penalties should be effective, proportionate and dissuasive.\n(67)\nEconomic operators as well as Member States and the Commission need sufficient time to adapt to the changes introduced by this Regulation. Therefore it is appropriate to provide for a sufficient transitional period for that adaptation. However, in order to ensure a smooth transition, economic operators should be allowed to place on the market cosmetic products which comply with this Regulation before the expiry of that transitional period.\n(68)\nIn order to enhance the safety of cosmetic products and strengthen the market surveillance, cosmetic products placed on the market after the date of application of this Regulation should comply with its obligations regarding safety assessment, the product information file and notification, even if similar obligations have already been fulfilled under Directive 76/768/EEC.\n(69)\nDirective 76/768/EEC should be repealed. However, in order to ensure appropriate medical treatment in the event of difficulties and to ensure market surveillance, the information received pursuant to Article 7(3) and Article 7a(4) of Directive 76/768/EEC concerning cosmetic products should be kept by the competent authorities for a certain period of time and the information kept by the responsible person should remain available for the same period of time.\n(70)\nThis Regulation should be without prejudice to the obligations of the Member States relating to the time-limits for transposition into national law of the Directives set out in Part B of Annex IX.\n(71)\nSince the objective of this Regulation, namely the achievement of the internal market and a high level of protection of human health through the compliance of cosmetic products with the requirements laid down in this Regulation, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore, by reason of the scale of the action, be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve that objective,\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nCHAPTER I\nSCOPE, DEFINITIONS\nArticle 1\nScope and objective\nThis Regulation establishes rules to be complied with by any cosmetic product made available on the market, in order to ensure the functioning of the internal market and a high level of protection of human health.\nArticle 2\nDefinitions\n1.   For the purposes of this Regulation, the following definitions shall apply:\n(a)\n‘cosmetic product’ means any substance or mixture intended to be placed in contact with the external parts of the human body (epidermis, hair system, nails, lips and external genital organs) or with the teeth and the mucous membranes of the oral cavity with a view exclusively or mainly to cleaning them, perfuming them, changing their appearance, protecting them, keeping them in good condition or correcting body odours;\n(b)\n‘substance’ means a chemical element and its compounds in the natural state or obtained by any manufacturing process, including any additive necessary to preserve its stability and any impurity deriving from the process used but excluding any solvent which may be separated without affecting the stability of the substance or changing its composition;\n(c)\n‘mixture’ means a mixture or solution composed of two or more substances;\n(d)\n‘manufacturer’ means any natural or legal person who manufactures a cosmetic product or has such a product designed or manufactured, and markets that cosmetic product under his name or trademark;\n(e)\n‘distributor’ means any natural or legal person in the supply chain, other than the manufacturer or the importer, who makes a cosmetic product available on the Community market;\n(f)\n‘end user’ means either a consumer or professional using the cosmetic product;\n(g)\n‘making available on the market’ means any supply of a cosmetic product for distribution, consumption or use on the Community market in the course of a commercial activity, whether in return for payment or free of charge;\n(h)\n‘placing on the market’ means the first making available of a cosmetic product on the Community market;\n(i)\n‘importer’ means any natural or legal person established within the Community, who places a cosmetic product from a third country on the Community market;\n(j)\n‘harmonised standard’ means a standard adopted by one of the European standardisation bodies listed in Annex I to Directive 98/34/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 June 1998 laying down a procedure for the provision of information in the field of technical standards and regulations and of rules on information society services (13) on the basis of a request made by the Commission in accordance with Article 6 of that Directive;\n(k)\n‘nanomaterial’ means an insoluble or biopersistant and intentionally manufactured material with one or more external dimensions, or an internal structure, on the scale from 1 to 100 nm;\n(l)\n‘preservatives’ means substances which are exclusively or mainly intended to inhibit the development of micro-organisms in the cosmetic product;\n(m)\n‘colorants’ means substances which are exclusively or mainly intended to colour the cosmetic product, the body as a whole or certain parts thereof, by absorption or reflection of visible light; in addition, precursors of oxidative hair colorants shall be deemed colorants;\n(n)\n‘UV-filters’ means substances which are exclusively or mainly intended to protect the skin against certain UV radiation by absorbing, reflecting or scattering UV radiation;\n(o)\n‘undesirable effect’ means an adverse reaction for human health attributable to the normal or reasonably foreseeable use of a cosmetic product;\n(p)\n‘serious undesirable effect’ means an undesirable effect which results in temporary or permanent functional incapacity, disability, hospitalisation, congenital anomalies or an immediate vital risk or death;\n(q)\n‘withdrawal’ means any measure aimed at preventing the making available on the market of a cosmetic product in the supply chain;\n(r)\n‘recall’ means any measure aimed at achieving the return of a cosmetic product that has already been made available to the end user;\n(s)\n‘frame formulation’ means a formulation which lists the category or function of ingredients and their maximum concentration in the cosmetic product or gives relevant quantitative and qualitative information whenever a cosmetic product is not covered or only partially covered by such a formulation. The Commission shall provide indications for the establishment of the frame formulation and adapt them regularly to technical and scientific progress.\n2.   For the purposes of point (a) of paragraph 1, a substance or mixture intended to be ingested, inhaled, injected or implanted into the human body shall not be considered to be a cosmetic product.\n3.   In view of the various definitions of nanomaterials published by different bodies and the constant technical and scientific developments in the field of nanotechnologies, the Commission shall adjust and adapt point (k) of paragraph 1 to technical and scientific progress and to definitions subsequently agreed at international level. That measure, designed to amend non-essential elements of this Regulation, shall be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny referred to in Article 32(3).\nCHAPTER II\nSAFETY, RESPONSIBILITY, FREE MOVEMENT\nArticle 3\nSafety\nA cosmetic product made available on the market shall be safe for human health when used under normal or reasonably foreseeable conditions of use, taking account, in particular, of the following:\n(a)\npresentation including conformity with Directive 87/357/EEC;\n(b)\nlabelling;\n(c)\ninstructions for use and disposal;\n(d)\nany other indication or information provided by the responsible person defined in Article 4.\nThe provision of warnings shall not exempt persons defined in Articles 2 and 4 from compliance with the other requirements laid down in this Regulation.\nArticle 4\nResponsible person\n1.   Only cosmetic products for which a legal or natural person is designated within the Community as ‘responsible person’ shall be placed on the market.\n2.   For each cosmetic product placed on the market, the responsible person shall ensure compliance with the relevant obligations set out in this Regulation.\n3.   For a cosmetic product manufactured within the Community, and not subsequently exported and imported back into the Community, the manufacturer established within the Community shall be the responsible person.\nThe manufacturer may designate, by written mandate, a person established within the Community as the responsible person who shall accept in writing.\n4.   Where, for a cosmetic product manufactured within the Community, and not subsequently exported and imported back into the Community, the manufacturer is established outside the Community, he shall designate, by written mandate, a person established within the Community as the responsible person who shall accept in writing.\n5.   For an imported cosmetic product, each importer shall be the responsible person for the specific cosmetic product he places on the market.\nThe importer may, by written mandate, designate a person established within the Community as the responsible person who shall accept in writing.\n6.   The distributor shall be the responsible person where he places a cosmetic product on the market under his name or trademark or modifies a product already placed on the market in such a way that compliance with the applicable requirements may be affected.\nThe translation of information relating to a cosmetic product already placed on the market shall not be considered as a modification of that product of such a nature that compliance with the applicable requirements of this Regulation may be affected.\nArticle 5\nObligations of responsible persons\n1.   Responsible persons shall ensure compliance with Articles 3, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, Article 19(1),(2) and (5), as well as Articles 20, 21, 23 and 24.\n2.   Responsible persons who consider or have reason to believe that a cosmetic product which they have placed on the market is not in conformity with this Regulation shall immediately take the corrective measures necessary to bring that product into conformity, withdraw it or recall it, as appropriate.\nFurthermore, where the cosmetic product presents a risk to human health, responsible persons shall immediately inform the competent national authorities of the Member States in which they made the product available and of the Member State in which the product information file is readily accessible, giving details, in particular, of the non-compliance and of the corrective measures taken.\n3.   Responsible persons shall cooperate with these authorities, at the request of the latter, on any action to eliminate the risks posed by cosmetic products which they have made available on the market. In particular, responsible persons shall, further to a reasoned request from a competent national authority, provide it with all the information and documentation necessary to demonstrate the conformity of specific aspects of the product, in a language which can be easily understood by that authority.\nArticle 6\nObligations of distributors\n1.   In the context of their activities, when making a cosmetic product available on the market, distributors shall act with due care in relation to applicable requirements.\n2.   Before making a cosmetic product available on the market distributors shall verify that:\n—\nthe labelling information provided for in Article 19(1)(a), (e) and (g) and Article 19(3) and (4) is present,\n—\nthe language requirements provided for in Article 19(5) are fulfilled,\n—\nthe date of minimum durability specified, where applicable under Article 19(1), has not passed.\n3.   Where distributors consider or have reason to believe that:\n—\na cosmetic product is not in conformity with the requirements laid down in this Regulation, they shall not make the product available on the market until it has been brought into conformity with the applicable requirements,\n—\na cosmetic product which they have made available on the market is not in conformity with this Regulation, they shall make sure that the corrective measures necessary to bring that product into conformity, withdraw it or recall it, as appropriate, are taken.\nFurthermore, where the cosmetic product presents a risk to human health, distributors shall immediately inform the responsible person and the competent national authorities of the Member States in which they made the product available, giving details, in particular, of the non-compliance and of the corrective measures taken.\n4.   Distributors shall ensure that, while a product is under their responsibility, storage or transport conditions do not jeopardise its compliance with the requirements set out in this Regulation.\n5.   Distributors shall cooperate with competent authorities, at the request of the latter, on any action to eliminate the risks posed by products which they have made available on the market. In particular, distributors shall, further to a reasoned request from a competent national authority, provide it with all the information and documentation necessary to demonstrate the conformity of the product with the requirements listed under paragraph 2, in a language which can be easily understood by that authority.\nArticle 7\nIdentification within the supply chain\nAt the request of a competent authority:\n—\nresponsible persons shall identify the distributors to whom they supply the cosmetic product,\n—\nthe distributor shall identify the distributor or the responsible person from whom, and the distributors to whom, the cosmetic product was supplied.\nThis obligation shall apply for a period of three years following the date on which the batch of the cosmetic product was made available to the distributor.\nArticle 8\nGood manufacturing practice\n1.

citizens\nSUMMARY OF:\nRegulation (EC) No 1223/2009 on cosmetic products\nWHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?\nMakes cosmetics products sold in the EU safer by tightening safety requirements.\nSimplifies procedures for companies and regulatory authorities in the sector.\nUpdates the rules to take account of the latest technological developments, including the possible use of nanomaterials.\nMaintains the existing ban on animal testing.\nKEY POINTS\nExtra requirements for manufacturers in compiling the safety report they need to place a product on the market.\nNew concept of ‘responsible person’ for each product: businesses can only sell cosmetic products in the EU when a natural or legal person is designated as a ‘responsible person’;the responsible person must ensure the product meets all the relevant safety requirements under Regulation (EC) No 1223/2009.\nRed tape for manufacturers is reduced as they have to register their products only once, with the EU’s Cosmetic Products Notification Portal.\nNew requirement to report serious undesirable effects: responsible persons and distributors are required to report such effects to their national authorities;national authorities must then share this information — together with any they receive from other sources (users, health professionals) — with their counterparts in other EU Member States.\nPackaging must include a range of information, including the name and the address of the responsible person, the contents, precautions for use and the list of ingredients.\nNew rules for the use of nanomaterials.\nLists of substances which are prohibited, restricted or authorised for use in cosmetics.\nDistributors must check that labelling, including the use-by date, and language requirements are all in order.\nThe main points of the regulation are summarised in this infographic. The regulation repealed and replaced Directive 76/768/EEC.\nThe various annexes to the regulation have been amended many times. These changes have been incorporated into the consolidated version of the regulation.\nIn addition, since in some cases it is difficult to distinguish between medical devices and cosmetic products, Article 119 of Regulation (EU) 2017/745 (see summary) amends Regulation (EC) No 1223/2009 by making it possible to take an EU-wide decision on regulatory status of a product. Since 26 May 2021, the European Commission may, at the request of a Member State or on its own initiative, decide whether or not a specific product or group of products falls within the definition ‘cosmetic product’.\nFROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?\n              \nIt has applied since 11 July 2013.\nBACKGROUND\n              \nFor more information, see:\nCosmetics (European Commission).\nMAIN DOCUMENT\n            \nRegulation (EC) No 1223/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 30 November 2009 on cosmetic products (recast) (OJ L 342, 22.12.2009, pp. 59-209)\nSuccessive amendments to Regulation (EC) No 1223/2009 have been incorporated into the original text.
