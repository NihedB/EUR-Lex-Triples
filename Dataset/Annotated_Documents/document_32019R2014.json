{"celex_id": "32019R2014", "reference": "5.12.2019\nEN\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\nL 315/29\nCOMMISSION DELEGATED REGULATION (EU) 2019/2014\nof 11 March 2019\nsupplementing Regulation (EU) 2017/1369 of the European Parliament and of the Council with regard to energy labelling of household washing machines and household washer-dryers and repealing Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 1061/2010 and Commission Directive 96/60/EC\n(Text with EEA relevance)\nTHE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,\nHaving regard to Regulation (EU) 2017/1369 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 4 July 2017 setting a framework for energy labelling and repealing Directive 2010/30/EU (1), and in particular Article 11(5) and Article 16 thereof,\nWhereas:\n(1)\nRegulation (EU) 2017/1369 empowers the Commission to adopt delegated acts as regards the labelling or re-scaling of the labelling of product groups representing significant potential for energy savings and, where relevant, other resources.\n(2)\nProvisions on the energy labelling of household washing machines were established by Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 1061/2010 (2).\n(3)\nProvisions on the energy labelling of household washer-dryers were established by Commission Directive 96/60/EC (3).\n(4)\nThe Communication from the Commission COM(2016)773 final (4) (ecodesign working plan) established by the Commission in application of Article 16(1) of Directive 2009/125/EC (5) of the European parliament and of the Council sets out the working priorities under the ecodesign and energy labelling framework for the period 2016-2019. The ecodesign working plan identifies the energy-related product groups to be considered as priorities for the undertaking of preparatory studies and eventual adoption of implementing measures, as well as the review of Commission Regulation (EU) No 1015/2010 (6), Delegated Regulation (EU) No 1061/2010 and Directive 96/60/EC.\n(5)\nMeasures from the ecodesign working plan have an estimated potential to deliver a total in excess of 260 TWh of annual final energy savings in 2030, which is equivalent to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by approximately 100 million tonnes per year in 2030. Household washing machines and household washer-dryers are among the product groups listed in the working plan, with estimated annual electricity savings of 2,5 TWh, leading to GHG emission reductions of 0,8 MtCO2 eq/year, and estimated water savings of 711 million m3 in 2030.\n(6)\nHousehold washing machines and household washer-dryers are among the product groups mentioned in Article 11(5)(b) of Regulation (EU) 2017/1369 for which the Commission should adopt a delegated act to introduce an A to G rescaled label.\n(7)\nThe Commission has reviewed Delegated Regulation (EU) No 1061/2010, as required by its Article 7, and Directive 96/60/EC and analysed technical, environmental and economic aspects of as well as real-life user behaviour. The review was undertaken in close cooperation with stakeholders and interested parties from the Union and third countries. The results of the review were made public and presented to the Consultation Forum established by Article 14 of Regulation (EU) 2017/1369.\n(8)\nThe review concluded that there was a need for the introduction of revised energy labelling requirements for household washing machines and household washer-dryers, and that both could be established by the same energy labelling Regulation. The scope of this Regulation should thus comprise household washing machines and household washer-dryers.\n(9)\nNon-household washing machines and non-household washer-dryers have distinct characteristics and uses. They are subject to other regulatory work, in particular Directive 2006/42/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (7), and should not be included in the scope of this Regulation. This Regulation for household washing machines and household washer-dryers should apply to washing machines and washer-dryers with the same technical characteristics, regardless of the setting they are used in.\n(10)\nThe environmental aspects of household washing machines and household washer-dryers, identified as significant for the purposes of this Regulation, are energy and water consumption in the use phase, the generation of waste at the end of life, the emissions to air and water in the production phase (due to the extraction and processing of raw materials) and in the use phase (because of the consumption of electricity).\n(11)\nIt appears from the review that the electricity and water consumption of products subject to this Regulation can be further reduced by implementing energy label measures focusing on better differentiating between products to ensure incentives to suppliers to further improve the energy and resource efficiency of household washing machines and household washer-dryers, and by responding better to the expectations of consumers when using washing or complete washing and drying programmes, as regards their duration in particular.\n(12)\nThe energy labelling of household washing machines and household washer-dryers enable consumers to make informed choices towards more energy and resource efficient appliances. The understanding and relevance of the information provided on the label have been confirmed through a specific consumer survey in line with Article 14(2) of Regulation (EU) 2017/1369.\n(13)\nHousehold washing machines and household washer-dryers that are displayed at trade fairs should bear the energy label if the first unit of the model has already been placed on the market or is placed on the market on the trade fair.\n(14)\nThe relevant product parameters should be measured using reliable, accurate and reproducible methods. Those methods should take into account recognised state-of-the-art measurement methods including, where available, harmonised standards adopted by the European standardisation bodies, as listed in Annex I to Regulation (EU) No 1025/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council (8).\n(15)\nRecognising the growth of sales of energy-related products through web-stores and internet sales platforms, rather than directly from suppliers, it should be clarified that hosting service providers of web-stores and internet sales platforms should be responsible for displaying the label provided by the supplier in proximity to the price. They should inform the supplier of that obligation, but should not be responsible for the accuracy or content of the label and the product information sheet provided. However, in application of Article 14(1)(b) of Directive 2000/31/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (9) on electronic commerce, such internet hosting platforms should act expeditiously to remove or to disable access to information about the product in question if they are aware of the non-compliance (e.g. missing, incomplete or incorrect label or product information sheet) for example if informed by the market surveillance authority. A supplier selling directly to end-users via its own website is covered by dealers' distance selling obligations referred to in Article 5 of Regulation (EU) 2017/1369.\n(16)\nThe measures provided for in this Regulation were discussed by the Consultation Forum and with the Member States experts in accordance with Article 17 of Regulation (EU) 2017/1369.\n(17)\nDelegated Regulation (EU) No 1061/2010 and Directive 96/60/EC should be repealed,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nArticle 1\nSubject matter and scope\n1.
