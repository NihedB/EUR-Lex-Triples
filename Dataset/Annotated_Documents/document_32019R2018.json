Refrigerating appliances with a direct sales function are among the energy-related product groups to be considered as priorities for the undertaking of preparatory studies and eventual adoption of measure.\n(3)\nMeasures from the ecodesign working plan have an estimated potential to deliver in total in excess of 260 TWh of annual final energy savings in 2030, which is equivalent to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by approximately 100 million tonnes per year in 2030. Refrigerating appliances with a direct sales function is one of the product groups listed in the ecodesign working plan, with an estimated 48 TWh of annual final energy savings in 2030.\n(4)\nThe Commission carried out two preparatory studies covering the technical, environmental and economic characteristics of refrigerating appliances with a direct sales function typically used in the Union. The studies were carried out in close cooperation with stakeholders and interested parties from the Union and third countries. The results of these studies were made public and presented to the Consultation Forum established by Article 14 of Regulation (EU) 2017/1369.\n(5)\nThe preparatory studies concluded that there was a need to the introduce energy labelling requirements for refrigerating appliances with a direct sales function.\n(6)\nThe preparatory studies identified that energy consumption in the use phase is the most significant environmental aspect of refrigerating appliances with a direct sales function.\n(7)\nThe preparatory studies have shown that the electricity consumption of products subject to this Regulation can be further reduced significantly by an energy labelling measure focusing on refrigerating appliances with a direct sales function.\n(8)\nThis Regulation should apply to the following refrigerating appliances with a direct sales function: supermarket refrigerating (freezer or refrigerator) cabinets, beverage coolers, small ice-cream freezers, gelato-scooping cabinets and refrigerated vending machines.\n(9)\nMinibars and wine storage appliances with sales functions should not be considered refrigerating appliances with direct sales functions and therefore should be excluded from this Regulation, they are in the scope of the Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2019/2016 (4).\n(10)\nVertical static-air cabinets are professional refrigerating appliances and are defined in Commission Regulation (EU) 2015/1095 (5), and should therefore be excluded from this Regulation.\n(11)\nRefrigerating appliances with a direct sales function that are displayed at trade fairs should bear the energy label if the first unit of the model has already been placed on the market or is placed on the market at the trade fair.\n(12)\nThe relevant product parameters should be measured using reliable, accurate and reproducible methods. Those methods should take into account recognised state-of-the-art measurement methods including, where available, harmonised standards adopted by the European standardisation bodies, as listed in Annex I to Regulation (EU) No 1025/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council (6).\n(13)\nThe terminology and testing methods of this Regulation are consistent with the terminology and testing methods adopted in EN 16901, EN 16902, EN 50597 and EN ISO 23953-2.\n(14)\nRecognising the growth of sales of energy-related products through internet hosting platforms, rather than directly from suppliers' websites, it should be clarified that internet sales platforms should be responsible for enabling the displaying of the label provided by the supplier in proximity to the price. They should inform the dealer of that obligation, but should not be responsible for the accuracy or content of the label and the product information sheet provided. However, in application of Article 14(1)(b) of Directive 2000/31/EC of the Parliament and of the Council (7) on electronic commerce, such internet hosting platforms should act expeditiously to remove or to disable access to information about the product in question if they are aware of the non-compliance (e.g. missing, incomplete or incorrect label or product information sheet) for example if informed by the market surveillance authority. A supplier selling directly to end-users via its own website is covered by dealers' distance selling obligations referred to in Article 5 of Regulation (EU) 2017/1369.\n(15)\nThe measures provided for in this Regulation were discussed by the Consultation Forum and the Member States' experts in accordance with Articles 14 and 18 of Regulation (EU) 2017/1369.\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nArticle 1\nSubject matter and scope\n1.

These cover: energy efficiencyresource efficiencyinformation for installers and end-users;\nsets out the conformity assessment procedure, and in Annex III the measurement methods and calculations that must be followed.\nNational authorities must apply the verification procedures laid down in Annex IV when carrying out market surveillance checks.\nManufacturers, importers or their authorised representatives must not place on the market products capable of detecting when being tested and changing their performance accordingly to get a better result for any of the parameters being tested.\nAnnex V sets out indicative benchmarks based on the best-performing products and technologies available for refrigerating appliances with a direct sales function in terms of their energy efficiency index.\nThe Commission must review the regulation in the light of technological progress and to assess a number of aspects 4 years after its entry into force.\nWith this Regulation, refrigerating appliances with a direct sales function will be subject to ecodesign requirements for the first time.\nThe delegated regulation supplements Regulation (EU) 2017/1369 on energy labelling and sets out rules for suppliers, dealers and internet hosting platforms.\nSuppliers must ensure that: each refrigerating appliance with a direct sales function has a printed label in the format set out in Annex III;the information on the product information sheet, set out in Annex V, and the content of the technical documentation (Annex VI) are uploaded into the product database;visual advertisements for a particular model contain the energy efficiency class and range of classes available, in line with Annexes VII and VIII;technical promotional material, including on the internet, for a particular model describing its specific parameters includes the appliance’s energy efficiency class and the range of available classes according to Annex VII;dealers receive for each refrigerating appliance with a direct sales function an electronic label in Annex III format and an electronic product information sheet as set out in Annex V.\nDealers must ensure that: each refrigerating appliance with a direct sales function on sale, including at trade fairs, bears a clearly visible label provided by suppliers in line with Annex III;in the event of distance selling, the label and product information sheet comply with Annexes VII and VIII;visual advertisements, including on the internet, for a specific model contain the energy efficiency class and range of classes according to Annex VII;technical promotional material, including on the internet, for a particular model describing its specific parameters includes the appliance’s energy efficiency class and the range of available classes according to Annexes VII and VIII.\nInternet hosting platforms must ensure that: the electronic label and electronic product information sheet provided by the dealer are clearly displayed, according to Annex VIII, on all refrigeration appliances with a direct sales function sold directly through the site.\nNational authorities apply the verification procedure laid down in Annex IX when carrying out market surveillance checks.\nThe energy efficiency class is based on an index set out in Annex II.\nThe Commission must review the regulation in the light of technological progress 4 years after its entry into force.\nFROM WHEN DO THE REGULATIONS APPLY?\n              \nThey both apply from 1 March 2021.\nBACKGROUND\nDirective 2009/125/EC establishes a framework to set ecodesign requirements for energy-related products.
