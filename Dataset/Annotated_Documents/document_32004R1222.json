Commission Regulation (EC) No 264/2000 of 3 February 2000 on the implementation of Council Regulation (EC) No 2223/96 with respect to short-term public finance statistics (4), Regulation (EC) No 1221/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 10 June 2002 on quarterly non-financial accounts for general government (5) and Regulation (EC) No 501/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 10 March 2004 on quarterly financial accounts for general government (6) cover the compilation and transmission of quarterly data on government non-financial and financial accounts, but do not extend to quarterly government debt.\n(3)\nFor the sake of clarity, and given the specific role of Regulation (EC) No 3605/93 in the implementation of the excessive deficit procedure, the compilation and transmission of quarterly government debt data should be governed by an autonomous legal act.\n(4)\nQuarterly government debt should be defined in a way that ensures consistency with the definition of government debt outstanding at the end of the year, of Regulation (EC) No 3605/93. This consistency should be maintained in the event that the Council amends Regulation (EC) No 3605/93 or the Commission introduces new references to the European system of accounts (ESA 95) set up by Council Regulation (EC) No 2223/96 of 25 June 1996 on the European system of national and regional accounts in the European Community (7) into Regulation (EC) No 3605/93.\n(5)\nRegulations (EC) No 264/2000, No 1221/2002 and No 501/2004 state that quarterly data on non-financial and financial accounts of general government are to be transmitted three months after the end of the quarter to which they refer. This transmission lag is also appropriate for quarterly government debt data,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nArticle 1\nDefinitions\nFor the purposes of this Regulation:\n‘Government’ means the sector of general government as defined in the European system of national and regional accounts in the Community (hereinafter referred to as ESA 95), adopted by Regulation (EC) No 2223/96. The codes in brackets refer to ESA 95.\n‘Quarterly government debt’ means the total gross debt at nominal value outstanding at the end of each quarter of the sector of general government (S.13), with the exception of those liabilities the corresponding financial assets of which are held by the sector of general government (S.13).\nThe quarterly government debt is constituted by the liabilities of general government in the following categories: currency and deposits (AF.2); securities other than shares, excluding financial derivatives (AF.33) and loans (AF.4), as defined in ESA 95.\nThe nominal value of a liability outstanding at the end of each quarter is the face value.\nThe nominal value of an index-linked liability corresponds to its face value adjusted by the index-related change in the value of the principal accrued to the end of each quarter.\nLiabilities denominated in a foreign currency, or exchanged from one foreign currency through contractual agreements to one or more other foreign currencies shall be converted into the other foreign currencies at the rate agreed on in those contracts and shall be converted into the national currency on the basis of the representative market exchange rate prevailing on the last working day of each quarter.\nLiabilities denominated in the national currency and exchanged through contractual agreements to a foreign currency shall be converted into the foreign currency at the rate agreed on in those contracts and shall be converted into the national currency on the basis of the representative market exchange rate prevailing on the last working day of each quarter.\nLiabilities denominated in a foreign currency and exchanged through contractual agreements to the national currency shall be converted into the national currency at the rate agreed on in those contracts.\nArticle 2\nTimetable\n1.   Member States shall compile and transmit to the Commission data on the quarterly government debt at the latest three months after the end of the quarter to which the data refer.\nAny revision of data for previous quarters shall be transmitted at the same time.\n2.   The first transmission of the data on the quarterly government debt shall take place by 31 December 2004.\n3.   The Commission may grant a derogation, not exceeding one year, concerning the first transmission of quarterly data, insofar as national statistical systems require major change.\nArticle 3\nBack data\nBack-data relating to the first quarter of 2000 onwards shall be transmitted by 31 December 2004. Where necessary, such data may be provided using a best-estimate approach.\nArticle 4\nAmendments\n1.   If the Council decides to amend Regulation (EC) No 3605/93, in accordance with the rules on competence and procedure laid down in the Treaty, the Council shall simultaneously amend Article 1 of this Regulation, so that the definitions contained therein are kept consistent.\n2.   If the Commission introduces new references to ESA 95 into Article 1(5) of Regulation (EC) No 3605/93, in accordance with Article 7 thereof, the Commission shall simultaneously introduce the same new references into Article 1 of this Regulation, so that the definitions contained therein are kept consistent.\nArticle 5\nEntry in force\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on the 20th day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.\nDone at Luxembourg, 28 June 2004.\nFor the Council\nThe President\nM.

Previously, the data covered only annual government debt.\nKEY POINTS\n              \nEU countries must send to the European Commission data on their quarterly government debt at the latest within 3 months of the quarter ending.\nThe data cover the following general government liabilities:\ncurrency and deposits,\nsecurities, other than shares, excluding financial derivatives and loans.\nSpecific rules apply to liabilities, depending on whether they are index-linked or denominated in national or foreign currency.\nThe deadline for transmitting the first data, including back-dated data from 1 January 2000, was 31 December 2004.\nCroatia was required to send data for the first quarter of 2012 by 1 October 2013 and back-dated data for 1 January 2002 to 31 December 2011 by the end of December 2015.\nThe Commission may give an EU country up to a year to send the first data if major changes are necessary to its national statistical system.\nEU governments also provide the Commission with quarterly data on the following:\nshort-term public finance statistics* (Regulation (EC) No 264/2000)\nquarterly non-financial accounts for general government (Regulation (EC) No 1221/2002)\nquarterly financial accounts for general government, which do not include quarterly government debt (Regulation (EC) No 501/2004).\nFROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?\n              \nIt has applied since 22 July 2004.\nBACKGROUND\n              \nUp-to-date quarterly government data are essential to accurately follow and analyse economic and monetary trends. General government debt is one of the Maastricht Treaty convergence criteria used to monitor a country’s economic situation.\nUnder the excessive deficit procedure of the EU’s Stability and Growth Pact, euro countries must demonstrate sound public finances and meet 2 criteria. One of these is that public debt must not exceed 60% of gross domestic product.\nCouncil Regulation (EC) No 3605/93 on the application of the Protocol on the excessive deficit procedure defined government debt outstanding at the end of the year. It also set out the original timetable for providing the annual data to the Commission. It was repealed and replaced by Council Regulation (EC) No 479/2009. This required EU countries to report their actual and planned government deficits and debts to the Commission twice a year (by 1 April and 1 October).\nKEY TERMS\n              \nQuarterly government debt: total gross debt at nominal value outstanding at the end of each quarter. The term ‘government’ refers to central, state and local government and social security funds.\nShort-term public finance statistics: short-term statistics on general government resources and uses, covering:on the resource side: taxes on production and imports, andactual social contributions;on the use side: social benefits other than social transfers in kind.\nMAIN DOCUMENT\n            \nCouncil Regulation (EC) No 1222/2004 of 28 June 2004 concerning the compilation and transmission of data on the quarterly government debt (OJ L 233, 2.7.2004, pp. 1-2)\nSuccessive amendments to Regulation (EC) No 1222/2004  have been incorporated into the original document.
