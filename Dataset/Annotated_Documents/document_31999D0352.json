It also helps develop the EU’s anti-fraud policy.\nACTS\n                  \nCommission Decision 1999/352/EC, ECSC, Euratom of 28 April 1999 establishing the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF).\nSUMMARY\nWHAT DOES THIS DECISION DO?\n                     \nThe original decision (1999/352/EC, ECSC, Euratom) created OLAF in 1999. It defined OLAF’s tasks, responsibilities, structure and mode of operation. A subsequent revision in 2013 enabled it to work more efficiently and effectively, particularly with outside organisations.\nKEY POINTS\n                     \nFraud is a deliberate act of deception intended for personal gain or to cause a loss to another party. At EU level, this loss can result from a wrongful payment of funds from the EU budget or by failing to pass on revenue due to the EU budget, such as customs duties, agricultural duties and sugar levies.\nOLAF launches investigations:\nwithin the EU institutions and bodies to detect fraud, corruption, any other illegal activity affecting the EU’s financial interests and serious matters relating to the discharge of professional duties not affecting EU financial interests;\noutside the EU institutions and bodies to detect fraud or other irregular conduct by people or organisations. These may involve EU countries’ authorities (and occasionally those of non-EU countries).\nOLAF’s Director-General is appointed for 7 years (non-renewable).\nOLAF’s Supervisory Committee monitors its work, seeks to reinforce its independence and monitors the application of procedural guarantees.\nOLAF is subject to EU law on data protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data by Community institutions and bodies.\nOLAF is an administrative and investigative service. It can only recommend what action should be taken by EU or national authorities following its investigations.\nThe Hercule III programme helps fund many of the EU countries’ projects, helping them to fight criminal activity directed against the EU budget. Examples include the financing of the acquisition of scanners and other technical equipment in airports and ports, as well as of training activities.\nWHEN DOES THIS DECISION APPLY?\n                     \nFrom 28 April 1999.\nBACKGROUND\n                     \nDecision 1999/352/EC, ECSC, Euratom (and its subsequent amendments) relates to the establishment of OLAF. It is complemented by Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 883/2013, which defines OLAF’s role and remit, and an Interinstitutional Agreement, which specifically concerns investigations in the EU institutions.\nFor more information, see OLAF’s website.\nREFERENCES\nAct\nEntry into force\nDeadline for transposition in the Member States\nOfficial Journal\nCommission Decision 1999/352/EC, ECSC, Euratom\n28.4.1999\n-\nOJ L 136 of 31.5.1999, pp. 20-22\nAmending acts\nEntry into force\nDeadline for transposition in the Member States\nOfficial Journal\nCommission Decision 2013/478/EU\n1.10.2013\n-\nOJ L 257 of 28.9.2013, pp. 19-20\nCommission Decision (EU) 2015/512\n27.3.2015\n-\nOJ L 81 of 26.3.2015, p. 4-4\nRELATED ACTS\n                  \nRegulation (EU, Euratom) No 883/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 September 2013 concerning investigations conducted by the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) and repealing Regulation (EC) No 1073/1999 of the European Parliament and of the Council and Council Regulation (Euratom) No 1074/1999 (OJ L 248 of 18.9.2013, pp. 1-22).\nInterinstitutional Agreement of 25 May 1999 between the European Parliament, the Council of the European Union and the Commission of the European Communities concerning internal investigations by the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) (OJ L 136 of 31.5.1999, pp. 15-19).\nlast update 23.04.2015", "tags": ["fraud", "operation of the Institutions", "EU office or agency"], "subjects": ["Financial provisions", "Provisions governing the Institutions"], "split": "train", "reference_annotations": {}, "summary_annotations": {}}
