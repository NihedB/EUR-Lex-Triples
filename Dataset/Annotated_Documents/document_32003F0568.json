Any corruption in the private sector within a Member State is thus not just a domestic problem but also a transnational problem, most effectively tackled by means of a European Union joint action.(2) On 27 September 1996 the Council adopted the Act drawing up a Protocol to the Convention on the Protection of the European Communities' Financial Interests(3). The Protocol, which entered into force on 17 October 2002, contains definitions of and harmonised penalties for offences of corruption.(3) On 26 May 1997 the Council approved a Convention on the fight against corruption involving officials of the European Communities or officials of Member States of the European Union(4).(4) On 22 December 1998, the Council also adopted Joint Action 98/742/JHA on corruption in the private sector(5). In connection with the adoption of that Joint Action, the Council issued a statement to the effect that it agreed that the Joint Action represents the first step at European Union level towards combating such corruption, and that additional measures will be implemented at a later stage in the light of the outcome of the assessment which is to take place pursuant to Article 8(2) of the Joint Action. A report on Member States' transposition of that Joint Action into national law is not yet available.(5) On 13 June 2002 the Council adopted Framework Decision 2002/584/JHA on the European arrest warrant and the surrender procedures between the Member States(6), in which corruption is included in the list of offences falling within the scope of the European arrest warrant, in respect of which prior verification of double criminality is not required.(6) Under Article 29 of the Treaty on European Union, it is the Union's objective to provide citizens with a high level of safety within an area of freedom, security and justice, an objective to be achieved by preventing and combating crime, organised or otherwise, including corruption.(7) According to point 48 of the conclusions of the European Council meeting in Tampere on 15 and 16 October 1999, corruption is an area of particular relevance in establishing minimum rules on what constitutes a criminal offence in Member States and the penalties applicable.(8) An OECD Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions was approved at a negotiating conference on 21 November 1997, and the Council of Europe has also approved a Criminal Law Convention on Corruption, which opened for signature on 27 January 1999. That Convention is accompanied by an Agreement establishing the Group of States against Corruption (GRECO). Negotiations have also been opened for a UN Convention on combating corruption.(9) Member States attach particular importance to combating corruption in both the public and the private sector, in the belief that in both those sectors it poses a threat to a law-abiding society as well as distorting competition in relation to the purchase of goods or commercial services and impeding sound economic development. In that context the Member States which have not yet ratified the European Union Convention of 26 May 1997 and the Council of Europe Convention of 27 January 1999 will consider how to do so as soon as possible.(10) The aim of this Framework Decision is in particular to ensure that both active and passive corruption in the private sector are criminal offences in all Member States, that legal persons may also be held responsible for such offences, and that these offences incur effective, proportionate and dissuasive penalties,HAS ADOPTED THIS FRAMEWORK DECISION:Article 1DefinitionsFor the purposes of this Framework Decision:- \"legal person\" means any entity having such status under the applicable national law, except for States or other public bodies acting in the exercise of State authority and for public international organisations,- \"breach of duty\" shall be understood in accordance with national law.

Legal persons* may be held liable for such offences.\nIt repeals Joint Action 98/742/JHA.\nKEY POINTS\nInclusion of the concept of corruption in national criminal law\nEU countries are required to penalise acts intentionally carried out as part of business activities: corrupting a person: by promising, offering or giving directly or through an intermediary to a person who in any capacity directs or works for a private sector entity, an undue advantage of any kind, for that person or for a third party in order that that person should perform or refrain from performing any act in breach of that person’s duties*;demanding an undue advantage: a person requests or receives, directly or through an intermediary, an undue advantage of any kind, or accepts the promise of such an advantage, for him or herself or for a third party, while in any capacity directing or working for a private sector entity, in order to perform or refrain from performing any act in breach of one’s duties.\nThe above applies to business activities within profit and non-profit entities. At the time of adoption, EU countries were able to limit the scope to conduct which involves or could involve a distortion of competition in relation to the purchase of goods or commercial services. This limitation is not valid anymore. Limitations were valid for 5 years from 22 July 2005.\nEU countries had to declare to the Council how they were going to act at the time of the adoption of this decision. Before 22 July 2010, the Council had to review declarations made by EU countries in relation to limitations.\nLiability of legal and natural persons\nThe aim of this decision is to make not only natural persons, such as employees, but also legal persons, such as undertakings, liable.\nWith regard to the liability of natural persons, EU countries must ensure that the acts referred to are liable to a maximum penalty of at least 1 to 3 years’ imprisonment. For example, if in an EU country, the conduct is criminalised by up to one year of imprisonment or in another, up to two years of imprisonment, both cases satisfy the criteria set by the framework decision. EU countries can also apply higher legal thresholds for the maximum term of imprisonment.\nThe right to engage in business activities may be temporarily suspended. Instigation to commit one of the acts set out above or aiding or abetting such conduct must also be criminalised as an offence.\nLegal persons may be held liable for offences involving corruption if these are committed for their benefit by any natural person acting individually or who has a leading position within a legal person based on: a power of representation of the legal person;an authority to take decisions on behalf of the legal person;an authority to exercise control within the legal person.\nPenalties for legal persons may include criminal or non-criminal fines. Moreover, EU countries may consider exclusion from entitlement to public benefits or aid, temporary or permanent disqualification from the practice of commercial activities, etc.\nJurisdiction\nEach EU country has jurisdiction if the offence has been committed:\nwithin its territory;\nby one of its nationals;\nfor the benefit of a legal person that has its head office in the territory of that EU country.\nThe decision applies to Gibraltar.\nThis decision is affected by the judgment of the Court of Justice of the European Union in Case C-176/03 concerning the distribution of powers in criminal matters between the European Commission and the Council.\nFROM WHEN DOES THE DECISION APPLY?\n              \nEU countries had to take the necessary measures to comply with the rules of the decision by 22 July 2005.\nBACKGROUND\n              \nFor more information, see:\nCorruption (European Commission).\nKEY TERMS\n              \nActive corruption: giving bribes to a person to have them unlawfully accomplish an act within the exercise of their duties.\nPassive corruption: taking bribes.\nLegal persons: any entity having such status under the applicable national law, except for States or other public bodies acting in the exercise of State authority and for public international organisations.\nBreach of duty: must be understood in accordance with national law. The concept of breach of duty in national law must cover as a minimum any disloyal behaviour constituting a breach of a statutory duty, or a breach of professional regulations.\nMAIN DOCUMENT\n            \nCouncil Framework Decision 2003/568/JHA of 22 July 2003 on combating corruption in the private sector (OJ L 192, 31.7.2003, pp. 54-56)\nRELATED DOCUMENTS\n            \nReport from the Commission to the European Parliament and the Council assessing the extent to which the Member States have taken the necessary measures in order to comply with Council Framework Decision 2003/568/JHA of 22 July 2003 on combating corruption in the private sector (COM(2019) 355 final, 26.7.2019)\nlast update 18.02.2020", "tags": ["corruption", "penalty", "judicial cooperation in criminal matters in the EU", "private sector"], "subjects": ["Justice and home affairs"], "split": "train", "reference_annotations": {}, "summary_annotations": {}}
