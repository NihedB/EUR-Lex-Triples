In order to ensure that stockpiles consisting of or containing chemicals listed either in Annex A or Annex B and wastes, including products and articles upon becoming wastes, consisting of, containing or contaminated with a chemical listed in Annex A, B or C, are managed in a manner protective of human health and the environment, each Party shall:(a) develop appropriate strategies for identifying:(i) stockpiles consisting of or containing chemicals listed either in Annex A or Annex B; and(ii) products and articles in use and wastes consisting of, containing or contaminated with a chemical listed in Annex A, B or C;(b) identify, to the extent practicable, stockpiles consisting of or containing chemicals listed either in Annex A or Annex B on the basis of the strategies referred to in subparagraph (a);(c) manage stockpiles, as appropriate, in a safe, efficient and environmentally sound manner. Stockpiles of chemicals listed either in Annex A or Annex B, after they are no longer allowed to be used according to any specific exemption specified in Annex A or any specific exemption or acceptable purpose specified in Annex B, except stockpiles which are allowed to be exported according to paragraph 2 of Article 3, shall be deemed to be waste and shall be managed in accordance with subparagraph (d);(d) take appropriate measures so that such wastes, including products and articles upon becoming wastes, are:(i) handled, collected, transported and stored in an environmentally sound manner;(ii) disposed of in such a way that the persistent organic pollutant content is destroyed or irreversibly transformed so that they do not exhibit the characteristics of persistent organic pollutants or otherwise disposed of in an environmentally sound manner when destruction or irreversible transformation does not represent the environmentally preferable option or the persistent organic pollutant content is low, taking into account international rules, standards, and guidelines, including those that may be developed pursuant to paragraph 2, and relevant global and regional regimes governing the management of hazardous wastes;(iii) not permitted to be subjected to disposal operations that may lead to recovery, recycling, reclamation, direct reuse or alternative uses of persistent organic pollutants; and(iv) not transported across international boundaries without taking into account relevant international rules, standards and guidelines;(e) endeavour to develop appropriate strategies for identifying sites contaminated by chemicals listed in Annex A, B or C; if remediation of those sites is undertaken it shall be performed in an environmentally sound manner.2. The Conference of the Parties shall cooperate closely with the appropriate bodies of the Basel Convention on the Control of Trans-boundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and their Disposal to, inter alia:(a) establish levels of destruction and irreversible transformation necessary to ensure that the characteristics of persistent organic pollutants as specified in paragraph 1 of Annex D are not exhibited;(b) determine what they consider to be the methods that constitute environmentally sound disposal referred to above; and(c) work to establish, as appropriate, the concentration levels of the chemicals listed in Annexes A, B and C in order to define the low persistent organic pollutant content referred to in paragraph 1 (d)(ii).Article 7Implementation plans1. Each Party shall:(a) develop and endeavour to implement a plan for the implementation of its obligations under this Convention;(b) transmit its implementation plan to the Conference of the Parties within two years of the date on which this Convention enters into force for it; and(c) review and update, as appropriate, its implementation plan on a periodic basis and in a manner to be specified by a decision of the Conference of the Parties.2. The Parties shall, where appropriate, cooperate directly or through global, regional and sub-regional organisations, and consult their national stakeholders, including women's groups and groups involved in the health of children, in order to facilitate the development, implementation and updating of their implementation plans.3. The Parties shall endeavour to utilise and, where necessary, establish the means to integrate national implementation plans for persistent organic pollutants in their sustainable development strategies where appropriate.Article 8Listing of chemicals in Annexes A, B and C1. A Party may submit a proposal to the Secretariat for listing a chemical in Annexes A, B and/or C. The proposal shall contain the information specified in Annex D. In developing a proposal, a Party may be assisted by other Parties and/or by the Secretariat.2. The Secretariat shall verify whether the proposal contains the information specified in Annex D. If the Secretariat is satisfied that the proposal contains the information so specified, it shall forward the proposal to the Persistent Organic Pollutants Review Committee.3. The Committee shall examine the proposal and apply the screening criteria specified in Annex D in a flexible and transparent way, taking all information provided into account in an integrative and balanced manner.4. If the Committee decides that:(a) it is satisfied that the screening criteria have been fulfilled, it shall, through the Secretariat, make the proposal and the evaluation of the Committee available to all Parties and observers and invite them to submit the information specified in Annex E; or(b) it is not satisfied that the screening criteria have been fulfilled, it shall, through the Secretariat, inform all Parties and observers and make the proposal and the evaluation of the Committee available to all Parties and the proposal shall be set aside.5. Any Party may resubmit a proposal to the Committee that has been set aside by the Committee pursuant to paragraph 4. The resubmission may include any concerns of the Party as well as a justification for additional consideration by the Committee. If, following this procedure, the Committee again sets the proposal aside, the Party may challenge the decision of the Committee and the Conference of the Parties shall consider the matter at its next session. The Conference of the Parties may decide, based on the screening criteria in Annex D and taking into account the evaluation of the Committee and any additional information provided by any Party or observer, that the proposal should proceed.6. Where the Committee has decided that the screening criteria have been fulfilled, or the Conference of the Parties has decided that the proposal should proceed, the Committee shall further review the proposal, taking into account any relevant additional information received, and shall prepare a draft risk profile in accordance with Annex E. It shall, through the Secretariat, make that draft available to all Parties and observers, collect technical comments from them and, taking those comments into account, complete the risk profile.7. If, on the basis of the risk profile conducted in accordance with Annex E, the Committee decides:(a) that the chemical is likely as a result of its long-range environmental transport to lead to significant adverse human health and/or environmental effects such that global action is warranted, the proposal shall proceed. Lack of full scientific certainty shall not prevent the proposal from proceeding. The Committee shall, through the Secretariat, invite information from all Parties and observers relating to the considerations specified in Annex F. It shall then prepare a risk management evaluation that includes an analysis of possible control measures for the chemical in accordance with that Annex; or(b) that the proposal should not proceed, it shall, through the Secretariat, make the risk profile available to all Parties and observers and set the proposal aside.8. For any proposal set aside pursuant to paragraph 7(b), a Party may request the Conference of the Parties to consider instructing the Committee to invite additional information from the proposing Party and other Parties during a period not to exceed one year. After that period and on the basis of any information received, the Committee shall reconsider the proposal pursuant to paragraph 6 with a priority to be decided by the Conference of the Parties. If, following this procedure, the Committee again sets the proposal aside, the Party may challenge the decision of the Committee and the Conference of the Parties shall consider the matter at its next session. The Conference of the Parties may decide, based on the risk profile prepared in accordance with Annex E and taking into account the evaluation of the Committee and any additional information provided by any Party or observer, that the proposal should proceed. If the Conference of the Parties decides that the proposal shall proceed, the Committee shall then prepare the risk management evaluation.9. The Committee shall, based on the risk profile referred to in paragraph 6 and the risk management evaluation referred to in paragraph 7(a) or 8, recommend whether the chemical should be considered by the Conference of the Parties for listing in Annexes A, B and/or C. The Conference of the Parties, taking due account of the recommendations of the Committee, including any scientific uncertainty, shall decide, in a precautionary manner, whether to list the chemical, and specify its related control measures, in Annexes A, B and/or C.Article 9Information exchange1.

Each Party undertakes to provide, within its capabilities, financial support and incentives in respect of those national activities that are intended to achieve the objective of this Convention in accordance with its national plans, priorities and programmes.2. The developed country Parties shall provide new and additional financial resources to enable developing country Parties and Parties with economies in transition to meet the agreed full incremental costs of implementing measures which fulfil their obligations under this Convention as agreed between a recipient Party and an entity participating in the mechanism described in paragraph 6. Other Parties may also on a voluntary basis and in accordance with their capabilities provide such financial resources. Contributions from other sources should also be encouraged. The implementation of these commitments shall take into account the need for adequacy, predictability, the timely flow of funds and the importance of burden sharing among the contributing Parties.3. Developed country Parties, and other Parties in accordance with their capabilities and in accordance with their national plans, priorities and programmes, may also provide and developing country Parties and Parties with economies in transition avail themselves of financial resources to assist in their implementation of this Convention through other bilateral, regional and multilateral sources or channels.4. The extent to which the developing country Parties will effectively implement their commitments under this Convention will depend on the effective implementation by developed country Parties of their commitments under this Convention relating to financial resources, technical assistance and technology transfer. The fact that sustainable economic and social development and eradication of poverty are the first and overriding priorities of the developing country Parties will be taken fully into account, giving due consideration to the need for the protection of human health and the environment.5. The Parties shall take full account of the specific needs and special situation of the least developed countries and the small island developing states in their actions with regard to funding.6. A mechanism for the provision of adequate and sustainable financial resources to developing country Parties and Parties with economies in transition on a grant or concessional basis to assist in their implementation of the Convention is hereby defined. The mechanism shall function under the authority, as appropriate, and guidance of, and be accountable to the Conference of the Parties for the purposes of this Convention. Its operation shall be entrusted to one or more entities, including existing international entities, as may be decided upon by the Conference of the Parties. The mechanism may also include other entities providing multilateral, regional and bilateral financial and technical assistance. Contributions to the mechanism shall be additional to other financial transfers to developing country Parties and Parties with economies in transition as reflected in, and in accordance with, paragraph 2.7. Pursuant to the objectives of this Convention and paragraph 6, the Conference of the Parties shall at its first meeting adopt appropriate guidance to be provided to the mechanism and shall agree with the entity or entities participating in the financial mechanism upon arrangements to give effect thereto. The guidance shall address, inter alia:(a) the determination of the policy, strategy and programme priorities, as well as clear and detailed criteria and guidelines regarding eligibility for access to and utilisation of financial resources including monitoring and evaluation on a regular basis of such utilisation;(b) the provision by the entity or entities of regular reports to the Conference of the Parties on adequacy and sustainability of funding for activities relevant to the implementation of this Convention;(c) the promotion of multiple-source funding approaches, mechanisms and arrangements;(d) the modalities for the determination in a predictable and identifiable manner of the amount of funding necessary and available for the implementation of this Convention, keeping in mind that the phasing out of persistent organic pollutants might require sustained funding, and the conditions under which that amount shall be periodically reviewed; and(e) the modalities for the provision to interested Parties of assistance with needs assessment, information on available sources of funds and on funding patterns in order to facilitate co-ordination among them.8. The Conference of the Parties shall review, not later than its second meeting and thereafter on a regular basis, the effectiveness of the mechanism established under this Article, its ability to address the changing needs of the developing country Parties and Parties with economies in transition, the criteria and guidance referred to in paragraph 7, the level of funding as well as the effectiveness of the performance of the institutional entities entrusted to operate the financial mechanism. It shall, based on such review, take appropriate action, if necessary, to improve the effectiveness of the mechanism, including by means of recommendations and guidance on measures to ensure adequate and sustainable funding to meet the needs of the Parties.Article 14Interim financial arrangementsThe institutional structure of the Global Environment Facility, operated in accordance with the Instrument for the Establishment of the Restructured Global Environment Facility, shall, on an interim basis, be the principal entity entrusted with the operations of the financial mechanism referred to in Article 13, for the period between the date of entry into force of this Convention and the first meeting of the Conference of the Parties, or until such time as the Conference of the Parties decides which institutional structure will be designated in accordance with Article 13. The institutional structure of the Global Environment Facility should fulfill this function through operational measures related specifically to persistent organic pollutants taking into account that new arrangements for this area may be needed.Article 15Reporting1. Each Party shall report to the Conference of the Parties on the measures it has taken to implement the provisions of this Convention and on the effectiveness of such measures in meeting the objectives of the Convention.2. Each Party shall provide to the Secretariat:(a) statistical data on its total quantities of production, import and export of each of the chemicals listed in Annex A and Annex B or a reasonable estimate of such data; and(b) to the extent practicable, a list of the States from which it has imported each such substance and the States to which it has exported each such substance.3. Such reporting shall be at periodic intervals and in a format to be decided by the Conference of the Parties at its first meeting.Article 16Effectiveness evaluation1. Commencing four years after the date of entry into force of this Convention, and periodically thereafter at intervals to be decided by the Conference of the Parties, the Conference shall evaluate the effectiveness of this Convention.2. In order to facilitate such evaluation, the Conference of the Parties shall, at its first meeting, initiate the establishment of arrangements to provide itself with comparable monitoring data on the presence of the chemicals listed in Annexes A, B and C as well as their regional and global environmental transport. These arrangements:(a) should be implemented by the Parties on a regional basis when appropriate, in accordance with their technical and financial capabilities, using existing monitoring programmes and mechanisms to the extent possible and promoting harmonisation of approaches;(b) may be supplemented where necessary, taking into account the differences between regions and their capabilities to implement monitoring activities; and(c) shall include reports to the Conference of the Parties on the results of the monitoring activities on a regional and global basis at intervals to be specified by the Conference of the Parties.3.

A Party may, at any time, withdraw its name from the DDT Registry upon written notification to the Secretariat. The withdrawal shall take effect on the date specified in the notification.--------------------------------------------------ANNEX CUNINTENTIONAL PRODUCTIONPart I: Persistent organic pollutants subject to the requirements of Article 5This Annex applies to the following persistent organic pollutants when formed and released unintentionally from anthropogenic sources:Chemical |Polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PCDD/PCDF) Hexachlorobenzene (HCB) (CAS No: 118-74-1) Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB) |Part II: Source categoriesPolychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans, hexachlorobenzene and polychlorinated biphenyls are unintentionally formed and released from thermal processes involving organic matter and chlorine as a result of incomplete combustion or chemical reactions. The following industrial source categories have the potential for comparatively high formation and release of these chemicals to the environment:(a) waste incinerators, including co-incinerators of municipal, hazardous or medical waste or of sewage sludge;(b) cement kilns firing hazardous waste;(c) production of pulp using elemental chlorine or chemicals generating elemental chlorine for bleaching;(d) the following thermal processes in the metallurgical industry:(i) secondary copper production;(ii) sinter plants in the iron and steel industry;(iii) secondary aluminium production;(iv) secondary zinc production.Part III: Source categoriesPolychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans, hexachlorobenzene and polychlorinated biphenyls may also be unintentionally formed and released from the following source categories, including:(a) open burning of waste, including burning of landfill sites;(b) thermal processes in the metallurgical industry not mentioned in Part II;(c) residential combustion sources;(d) fossil fuel-fired utility and industrial boilers;(e) firing installations for wood and other biomass fuels;(f) specific chemical production processes releasing unintentionally formed persistent organic pollutants, especially production of chlorophenols and chloranil;(g) crematoria;(h) motor vehicles, particularly those burning leaded gasoline;(i) destruction of animal carcasses;(j) textile and leather dyeing (with chloranil) and finishing (with alkaline extraction);(k) shredder plants for the treatment of end of life vehicles;(l) smouldering of copper cables;(m) waste oil refineries.Part IV: Definitions1. For the purposes of this Annex:(a) \"polychlorinated biphenyls\" means aromatic compounds formed in such a manner that the hydrogen atoms on the biphenyl molecule (two benzene rings bonded together by a single carbon-carbon bond) may be replaced by up to ten chlorine atoms; and(b) \"polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins\" and \"polychlorinated dibenzofurans\" are tricyclic, aromatic compounds formed by two benzene rings connected by two oxygen atoms in polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and by one oxygen atom and one carbon-carbon bond in polychlorinated dibenzofurans and the hydrogen atoms of which may be replaced by up to eight chlorine atoms.2. In this Annex, the toxicity of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans is expressed using the concept of toxic equivalency which measures the relative dioxin-like toxic activity of different congeners of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans and coplanar polychlorinated biphenyls in comparison to 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin. The toxic equivalent factor values to be used for the purposes of this Convention shall be consistent with accepted international standards, commencing with the World Health Organization 1998 mammalian toxic equivalent factor values for polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans and coplanar polychlorinated biphenyls. Concentrations are expressed in toxic equivalents.Part V: General guidance on best available techniques and best environmental practicesThis Part provides general guidance to Parties on preventing or reducing releases of the chemicals listed in Part I.A. General prevention measures relating to both best available techniques and best environmental practicesPriority should be given to the consideration of approaches to prevent the formation and release of the chemicals listed in Part I. Useful measures could include:(a) the use of low-waste technology;(b) the use of less hazardous substances;(c) the promotion of the recovery and recycling of waste and of substances generated and used in a process;(d) replacement of feed materials which are persistent organic pollutants or where there is a direct link between the materials and releases of persistent organic pollutants from the source;(e) good housekeeping and preventive maintenance programmes;(f) improvements in waste management with the aim of the cessation of open and other uncontrolled burning of wastes, including the burning of landfill sites. When considering proposals to construct new waste disposal facilities, consideration should be given to alternatives such as activities to minimise the generation of municipal and medical waste, including resource recovery, reuse, recycling, waste separation and promoting products that generate less waste. Under this approach, public health concerns should be carefully considered;(g) minimisation of these chemicals as contaminants in products;(h) avoiding elemental chlorine or chemicals generating elemental chlorine for bleaching.B. Best available techniquesThe concept of best available techniques is not aimed at the prescription of any specific technique or technology, but at taking into account the technical characteristics of the installation concerned, its geographical location and the local environmental conditions. Appropriate control techniques to reduce releases of the chemicals listed in Part I are in general the same. In determining best available techniques, special consideration should be given, generally or in specific cases, to the following factors, bearing in mind the likely costs and benefits of a measure and consideration of precaution and prevention:a) General considerations:(i) the nature, effects and mass of the releases concerned: techniques may vary depending on source size;(ii) the commissioning dates for new or existing installations;(iii) the time needed to introduce the best available technique;(iv) the consumption and nature of raw materials used in the process and its energy efficiency;(v) the need to prevent or reduce to a minimum the overall impact of the releases to the environment and the risks to it;(vi) the need to prevent accidents and to minimize their consequences for the environment;(vii) the need to ensure occupational health and safety at workplaces;(viii) comparable processes, facilities or methods of operation which have been tried with success on an industrial scale;(ix) technological advances and changes in scientific knowledge and understanding.(b) General release reduction measures:When considering proposals to construct new facilities or significantly modify existing facilities using processes that release chemicals listed in this Annex, priority consideration should be given to alternative processes, techniques or practices that have similar usefulness but which avoid the formation and release of such chemicals. In cases where such facilities will be constructed or significantly modified, in addition to the prevention measures outlined in section A of Part V the following reduction measures could also be considered in determining best available techniques:(i) use of improved methods for flue-gas cleaning such as thermal or catalytic oxidation, dust precipitation, or adsorption;(ii) treatment of residuals, wastewater, wastes and sewage sludge by, for example, thermal treatment or rendering them inert or chemical processes that detoxify them;(iii) process changes that lead to the reduction or elimination of releases, such as moving to closed systems;(iv) modification of process designs to improve combustion and prevent formation of the chemicals listed in this Annex, through the control of parameters such as incineration temperature or residence time.C. Best environmental practicesThe Conference of the Parties may develop guidance with regard to best environmental practices.--------------------------------------------------ANNEX DINFORMATION REQUIREMENTS AND SCREENING CRITERIA1. A Party submitting a proposal to list a chemical in Annexes A, B and/or C shall identify the chemical in the manner described in subparagraph (a) and provide the information on the chemical, and its transformation products where relevant, relating to the screening criteria set out in subparagraphs (b) to (e):(a) chemical identity:(i) names, including trade name or names, commercial name or names and synonyms, Chemical Abstracts Service (CAS) Registry number, International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) name; and(ii) structure, including specification of isomers, where applicable, and the structure of the chemical class;(b) persistence:(i) evidence that the half-life of the chemical in water is greater than two months, or that its half‚Äêlife in soil is greater than six months, or that its half-life in sediment is greater than six months; or(ii) evidence that the chemical is otherwise sufficiently persistent to justify its consideration within the scope of this Convention;(c) bio-accumulation:(i) evidence that the bio-concentration factor or bio-accumulation factor in aquatic species for the chemical is greater than 5000 or, in the absence of such data, that the log Kow is greater than 5;(ii) evidence that a chemical presents other reasons for concern, such as high bio‚Äêaccumulation in other species, high toxicity or ecotoxicity; or(iii) monitoring data in biota indicating that the bio-accumulation potential of the chemical is sufficient to justify its consideration within the scope of this Convention;(d) potential for long-range environmental transport:(i) measured levels of the chemical in locations distant from the sources of its release that are of potential concern;(ii) monitoring data showing that long-range environmental transport of the chemical, with the potential for transfer to a receiving environment, may have occurred via air, water or migratory species; or(iii) environmental fate properties and/or model results that demonstrate that the chemical has a potential for long-range environmental transport through air, water or migratory species, with the potential for transfer to a receiving environment in locations distant from the sources of its release. For a chemical that migrates significantly through the air, its half-life in air should be greater than two days; and(e) adverse effects:(i) evidence of adverse effects to human health or to the environment that justifies consideration of the chemical within the scope of this Convention; or(ii) toxicity or ecotoxicity data that indicate the potential for damage to human health or to the environment.2. The proposing Party shall provide a statement of the reasons for concern including, where possible, a comparison of toxicity or ecotoxicity data with detected or predicted levels of a chemical resulting or anticipated from its long-range environmental transport, and a short statement indicating the need for global control.3. The proposing Party shall, to the extent possible and taking into account its capabilities, provide additional information to support the review of the proposal referred to in paragraph 6 of Article 8. In developing such a proposal, a Party may draw on technical expertise from any source.--------------------------------------------------ANNEX EINFORMATION REQUIREMENTS FOR THE RISK PROFILEThe purpose of the review is to evaluate whether the chemical is likely, as a result of its long-range environmental transport, to lead to significant adverse human health and/or environmental effects, such that global action is warranted. For this purpose, a risk profile shall be developed that further elaborates on, and evaluates, the information referred to in Annex D and includes, as far as possible, the following types of information:(a) sources, including as appropriate:(i) production data, including quantity and location;(ii) uses; and(iii) releases, such as discharges, losses and emissions;(b) hazard assessment for the endpoint or endpoints of concern, including a consideration of toxicological interactions involving multiple chemicals;(c) environmental fate, including data and information on the chemical and physical properties of a chemical as well as its persistence and how they are linked to its environmental transport, transfer within and between environmental compartments, degradation and transformation to other chemicals. A determination of the bio‚Äêconcentration factor or bio-accumulation factor, based on measured values, shall be available, except when monitoring data are judged to meet this need;(d) monitoring data;(e) exposure in local areas and, in particular, as a result of long‚Äêrange environmental transport, and including information regarding bio‚Äêavailability;(f) national and international risk evaluations, assessments or profiles and labelling information and hazard classifications, as available; and(g) status of the chemical under international conventions.--------------------------------------------------ANNEX FINFORMATION ON SOCIO-ECONOMIC CONSIDERATIONSAn evaluation should be undertaken regarding possible control measures for chemicals under consideration for inclusion in this Convention, encompassing the full range of options, including management and elimination. For this purpose, relevant information should be provided relating to socio-economic considerations associated with possible control measures to enable a decision to be taken by the Conference of the Parties. Such information should reflect due regard for the differing capabilities and conditions among the Parties and should include consideration of the following indicative list of items:(a) efficacy and efficiency of possible control measures in meeting risk reduction goals:(i) technical feasibility; and(ii) costs, including environmental and health costs;(b) alternatives (products and processes):(i) technical feasibility;(ii) costs, including environmental and health costs;(iii) efficacy;(iv) risk;(v) availability; and(vi) accessibility;(c) positive and/or negative impacts on society of implementing possible control measures:(i) health, including public, environmental and occupational health;(ii) agriculture, including aquaculture and forestry;(iii) biota (biodiversity);(iv) economic aspects;(v) movement towards sustainable development; and(vi) social costs;(d) waste and disposal implications (in particular, obsolete stocks of pesticides and clean-up of contaminated sites):(i) technical feasibility; and(ii) cost;(e) access to information and public education;(f) status of control and monitoring capacity; and(g) any national or regional control actions taken, including information on alternatives, and other relevant risk management information.--------------------------------------------------ANNEXDeclaration by the community in accordance with Article 25(3) of the ConventionThe Community declares that, in accordance with the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 175 thereof, it is competent for entering into international environmental agreements, and for implementing the obligations resulting therefrom, which contribute to the pursuit of the following objectives:- preserving, protecting and improving the quality of the environment,- protecting human health,- prudent and rational utilisation of natural resources,- promoting measures at international level to deal with regional or worldwide environmental problems.Moreover, the Community declares that it has already adopted legal instruments, binding on its Member States, covering matters governed by this Convention, and will submit and update, as appropriate, a list of those legal instruments to the Conference of the Parties in accordance with Article 15(1) of the Convention.The Community is responsible for the performance of those obligations resulting from the Convention which are covered by Community law in force.The exercise of Community competence is, by its nature, subject to continuous development.--------------------------------------------------", "summary": "Tackling threats posed by chemicals (Stockholm Convention)\nTackling threats posed by chemicals (Stockholm Convention)\nSUMMARY OF:\nStockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants\nDecision 2006/507/EC ‚Äî conclusion, on behalf of the European Community, of the Stockholm Convention\nWHAT IS THE AIM OF THE CONVENTION AND THE DECISION?\nThe global treaty aims to protect human health and the environment from the harmful effects of persistent organic pollutants* (POPs). It restricts, and ultimately eliminates, their intentional or unintentional production, use, trade, release and storage.\nThe Council decision gives the EU‚Äôs legal approval for the convention.\nKEY POINTS\n              \nThe convention requires signatories to:\ntackle intentional production and use of POPs by: eliminating the production, use, import and export of chemicals listed in Annex A;restricting the production and use of chemicals listed in Annex B;ensuring that chemicals listed in Annexes A and B are only imported for approved use and can be disposed of in an environmentally sound manner;keeping a publicly accessible register containing all the national exemptions to the general bans and restrictions listed in the 2 annexes;\naddress unintentional production and use of POPs by:\nadopting a detailed action plan, within 2 years of the convention coming into force, to minimise use of, and ultimately eliminate, chemicals listed in Annex C;\nreduce or eliminate stocks and waste by:\ndeveloping strategies to identify stockpiles containing chemicals in annexes A or B, and products and articles in use containing or contaminated by chemicals listed in all 3 (A, B and C) annexes;\nmanaging stockpiles in a safe, efficient and environmentally sound manner;\nensuring all waste is properly handled, collected, transported and stored;\ndisposing of waste so that all pollutants are either destroyed or cannot be reused or, failing that, in the most environmentally friendly way;\ndraw up implementation plans (updated as appropriate), within 2 years of the convention entering into force. These set out how they will honour their commitments, cooperate with partners, including global, national, regional and sub-regional organisations, and consult with national stakeholders;\nexchange relevant information, via the convention‚Äôs secretariat, on reducing or eliminating POPs and on possible viable alternatives;\npromote public information, awareness and education among decision makers and the public, especially women and children, and facilitate training for key personnel;\nencourage or carry out appropriate national and international research, development, monitoring and cooperation on POPs;\ngive timely and appropriate technical assistance, and if necessary financial support, to developing countries and economies in transition;\nallocate the necessary finance and incentives to achieve national commitments;\nreport to all other signatories (the Conference of the Parties ‚Äî see below) on the measures taken, and their impact, to implement convention commitments;\nprovide the convention secretariat periodically with: data, or a reasonable estimate, on the total quantities of production, import and export of each chemical in annexes A and B;a list of the countries from or to which each substance has been imported or exported.\nThe convention establishes:\nthe Conference of the Parties, which includes all the signatories. This: meets regularly and in extraordinary session when necessary;reviews the convention‚Äôs implementation continuously;may establish subgroups it considers necessary;cooperates with international organisations and intergovernmental and non-governmental bodies;establishes a Persistant Organic Pollutants Review Committee of government nominated experts;decides whether to accept a proposal for a chemical to be added to the lists in annexes A, B or C;assesses, for the first time 4 years after it enters into force, and periodically thereafter, the convention‚Äôs effectiveness;adopts measures to determine and handle cases of non-compliance and any proposed amendments to the convention;\na secretariat, whose administrative functions are carried out by the Executive Director of the United Nations Environment Programme.\nAny signatory may withdraw from the convention, 3 years after it has entered into force, by giving 1 year‚Äôs written notice.\nThe EU is meeting its convention commitments by adopting:\nimplementation plans (2007, 2014, 2019, a fourth is underway);\nRegulation (EU) 2019/1021 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 June 2019 on persistent organic pollutants (see summary).\nDATE OF ENTRY INTO FORCE\n              \nThe convention entered into force on 17 May 2004.\nBACKGROUND\nThe Protocol to the 1979 Convention on Long Range Transboundary Air Pollution on Persistent Organic Pollutants was the first legally binding treaty to reduce and eliminate POPs. It entered into force on 17 May 2004.\nThe Stockholm Convention initially covered 12 POPs. New chemicals have since been added and 22 are now listed in Annex A which prohibits their production or use, except where there are generic or specific exemptions. Annex B severely restricts the production and use of DDT, a pesticide deployed in many developing countries.\nThe convention was opened for signature in Stockholm on 23 May 2001. By May 2017, it had been ratified by 181 parties.\nFor more information, see: Persistent organic pollutants (POPs) (European Commission)The European Union and the Stockholm Convention ‚Äî leaflet (European Commission)Stockholm Convention (United Nations Environment Programme).\nKEY TERMS\n              \nPersistent organic pollutants: chemical substances, used in pesticides and industrial processes.
