The purpose of this Regulation is to establish a common  statistical classification of economic activities within the European Community in order to ensure  comparability between national and Community classifications and hence national and Community  statistics. 2.  This Regulation shall apply only to the use of classifications for statistical purposes. 3.  This Regulation does not per se oblige Member States to collect, publish or supply data and is  not concernedwith obligations as regards the degree of detail and typeof statistical units to be  used in statistical surveys and analyses. Article 21.  A common basis for statistical classifications of economic activities within the  European Community, hereinafter referred to as 'NACE Rev. 1`, is hereby established, comprising: - a first level consisting of headings identified by an alphabetical code (sections), - an intermediate level consisting of headings identified by a two-character alphabetical code  (subsections), - a second level consisting of headings identified by a two-digit numerical code (divisions), - a third level consisting of headings identified by a three-digit numerical code (groups), - a fourth level consisting of headings identified by a four-digit numerical code (classes). 2.  NACE Rev. 1 is annexed to this Regulation. Article 31.  NACE Rev. 1 shall be used by the Commission for all statistics classified by  economic activities. 2.  Member States' statistics classified by economic activities shall be compiled using NACE Rev. 1  or a national classification derived therefrom which complies with the following rules: (a)  the national classifications shall contain levels corresponding to those of NACE Rev. 1, in  the sense that each of the levels shall consist of either the same headings as the corresponding  NACE Rev. 1 level or headings constituting an exact breakdown thereof; (b)additional levels may be introduced; (c)each of the levels, except for the highest, shall aggregate exactly into the next higher level  of NACE Rev. 1; (d)the coding may be different. 3.  Member States shall forward to the Commission, for its approval prior to their publication, the  drafts defining or modifying their national classifications. The Commission shall check the  conformity of these drafts with paragraph 2 of this Article. The national classification approved  by the Commission shall be transmitted to the other Member States for information. Member States'  publications shall include a table of correlation between the national classifications and NACE  Rev. 1. 4.  Member States wishing to use a national classification derived from NACE Rev. 1 shall adopt as  soon as possible, and not later than 31 December 1992, the measures necessary to establish a  national classification pursuant to this Article. Article 4In addition to the provisions referred to in Article 3, inthe event of incompatibility  between certain NACE Rev. 1 positions and the national economic structure, the Commission may  authorize a Member State to use at a given level an aggregation of NACE Rev. 1 positions in a  specific sector. To obtain such an authorization, the Member State concerned must provide the Commission with all  the necessary information to consider its request. However, notwithstanding the provisions of Article 3 (2) (a), this authorization shall not entitle  the Member State concerned to subdivide the aggregated headings in a way different from NACE Rev.  1. The Commission shall, together with the Member State concerned, periodically review the application  of these provisions to verify whether they are still justified. Article 5The Commission shall take all the necessary measuresto ensure the implementation and  management of NACERev. 1. Article 6The Commission shall, at the request of a Member State or on its own initiative, and  after consulting the Committee provided for in Article 7, take the necessary steps to ensure  uniform application of NACE Rev. 1.

The main amendment was Regulation (EC) No 1893/2006 establishing NACE Revision 2, which currently applies.\nKEY POINTS\nThe regulation defines a 4-digit classification of economic activities, commonly known as NACE*. The regulation in its original form refers to NACE Revision 1. However, NACE Revision 2 has applied since 2008.\nNACE, which was first introduced in 1970, is consistent with the UN economic activities classification ISIC (International Standard Industrial Classification of All Economic Activities). This makes it possible to compare statistics across countries and in different fields.\nNACE’s alpha-numeric structure is hierarchical and its 4 levels, detailed in the regulation’s annex, are as follows: headings identified by an alphabetical code (sections), e.g. Section A: Agriculture, forestry and fishing;headings identified by a 2-digit numerical code (divisions), e.g. Division 01: Crop and animal production, hunting and related service activities and Division 02: Forestry and logging;headings identified by a 3-digit numerical code (groups), e.g. Group 01.2: Growing of perennial crops;headings identified by a 4-digit numerical code (classes), e.g. Class 01.21: Growing of grapes.\nIn 2009, the European Statistical System Committee replaced the Statistical Programme Committee. It is responsible for the implementation and management of NACE and for ensuring its uniform application across the EU. It comprises EU countries’ representatives and is chaired by the Commission.\nFROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?\n              \nRegulation (EEC) No 3037/90 has applied since 13 November 1990.\nWith the adoption of Regulation (EC) No 1893/2006 amending Regulation (EEC) No 3037/90, the NACE Revision 2 has applied since 1 January 2008 in all domains except short-term statistics and the labour-cost index to which it has applied since 1 January 2009.\nBACKGROUND\n              \nFor more information, see:\nNACE Rev. 2 — Statistical classification of economic activities — overview (Eurostat)\nNACE Rev. 2 — Statistical classification of economic activities — publication (Eurostat).\nKEY TERMS\n              \nNACE: abbreviation of the name of the EU’s classification of economic activities which is derived from the French Nomenclature statistique des activités économiques.\nMAIN DOCUMENT\n            \nRegulation (EC) No 1893/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 December 2006 establishing the statistical classification of economic activities NACE Revision 2 and amending Council Regulation (EEC) No 3037/90 as well as certain EC Regulations on specific statistical domains (OJ L 393, 30.12.2006, pp. 1–39)\nSuccessive amendments to Regulation (EC) No 1893/2006 have been incorporated into the original text.
