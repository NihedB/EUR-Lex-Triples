The Agreement applies to seafarers on board every seagoing ship, whether publicly or privately owned, which is registered in the territory of any Member State and is ordinarily engaged in commercial maritime operations. For the purpose of this Agreement a ship that is on the register of two States is deemed to be registered in the territory of the State whose flag it flies.2. In the event of doubt as to whether or not any ships are to be regarded as seagoing ships or engaged in commercial maritime operations for the purpose of the Agreement, the question shall be determined by the competent authority of the Member State. The organisations of shipowners and seafarers concerned should be consulted.Clause 2For the purpose of the Agreement:(a) the term \"hours of work\" means time during which a seafarer is required to do work on account of the ship;(b) the term \"hours of rest\" means time outside hours of work; this term does not include short breaks;(c) the term \"seafarer\" means any person who is employed or engaged in any capacity on board a seagoing ship to which the Agreement applies;(d) the term \"shipowner\" means the owner of the ship or any other organisation or person, such as the manager or bareboat charterer, who has assumed the responsibility for the operation of the ship from the shipowner and who on assuming such responsibility has agreed to take over all the attendant duties and responsibilities.Clause 3Within the limits set out in Clause 5, there shall be fixed either a maximum number of hours of work which shall not be exceeded in a given period of time, or a minimum number or hours of rest which shall be provided in a given period of time.Clause 4Without prejudice to Clause 5, the normal working hours' standard of seafarer is, in principle, based on an eight-hour day with one day of rest per week and rest on public holidays. Member States may have procedures to authorise or register a collective agreement which determines seafarers' normal working hours on a basis on less favourable than this standard.Clause 51. The limits on hours of work or rest shall be either:(a) maximum hours of work which shall not exceed(i) fourteen hours in any 24 hour period; and(ii) 72 hours in any seven-day period;or(b) minimum hours of rest which shall not be less than:(i) ten hours in any 24 hour period; and(ii) 72 hours in any seven-day period.2. Hours of rest may be divided into no more than two periods, one of which shall be at least six hours in length and the interval between consecutive periods of rest shall not exceed 14 hours.3. Musters, fire-fighting and lifeboat drills, and prescribed by national laws and regulations and by international instruments shall be conducted in a manner that minimises the disturbance of rest periods and does not induce fatigue.4. In respect of situations when a seafarer is on call, such as when a machinery space is unattended, the seafarer shall have an adequate compensatory rest period if the normal period of rest is disturbed by call-outs to work.5. With regard to paragraphs 3 and 4, where no collective agreement or arbitration award exists or if the competent authority determines that the provisions in the agreement or award are inadequate, it would be for the competent authority to determine such provisions to ensure that the seafarers concerned have sufficient rest.6. With due regard for the general principles of the protection of the health and safety of workers, Member States may have national laws, regulations or a procedure for the competent authority to authorise or register collective agreements permitting exceptions to the limits set out in paragraphs 1 and 2. Such exceptions shall, as far as possible, follow the standards set out but may take account of more frequent or longer leave periods, or the granting of compensatory leave for watchkeeping seafarers or seafarers working on board ship on short voyages.7. A table shall be posted, in an easily accessible place, with the shipboard working arrangements, which shall contain for every position at least:(a) the schedule of service at sea and service in port; and(b) the maximum hours of work or the minimum hours of rest required by the laws, regulations or collective agreements in force in the Member States.8. The table referred to in paragraph 7 shall be established in a standardised format in the working language or languages of the ship and in English.Clause 6No seafarer under 18 years of age shall work at night. For the purpose of this Clause, \"night\" means a period of at least nine consecutive hours, including the interval from midnight to five a.m. This provision need not be applied when the effective training of young seafarers between the ages of 16 and 18 in accordance with established programmes and schedules would be impaired.Clause 71. The master of a ship shall have the right to require a seafarer to perform any hours of work necessary for the immediate dafety of the ship, persons on board or cargo, or for the purpose of giving assistance to other ships or persons in distress at sea.2. In accordance with paragraph 1, the master may suspend the schedule of hours of work or hours of rest and require a seafarer to perform any hours of work necessary until the normal situation has been restored.3. As soon as practicable after the normal situation has been restored, the master shall ensure that any seafarer who have performed work in a scheduled rest period are provided with an adequate period of rest.Clause 81. Records of seafarers' daily hours of work or of their daily hours of rest shall be maintained to allow monitoring of compliance with the provisions set out in Clause 5. The seafarer shall receive a copy of the records pertaining to him or her which shall be endorsed by the master, or a person authorised by the master, and by the seafarer.2. Procedures shall be determined for keeping such records on board, including the intervals at which the information shall be recorded. The format of the records of the seafarers' hours of work or of their hours of rest shall be established taking into account any available international guidelines. The format shall be established in the language provided by Clause 5, paragraph 8.3. A copy of the relevant provisions of the national legislation pertaining to this Agreement and the relevant collective agreements shall be kept on board and be easily accessible to the crew.Clause 9The records referred to in Clause 8 shall be examined and endorsed at appropriate intervals, to monitor compliance with the provisions governing hours of work or hours of rest that give effect to this Agreement.Clause 101. When determining, approving or revising manning levels, it is necessary to take into account the need to avoid or minimise, as fas as practicable, excessive hours of work, to ensure sufficient rest and to limit fatigue.2. If the records or other evidence indicate infringement of provisions governing hours of work or hours of rest, measures, including if necessary the revision of the manning of the ship, shall be taken so as to avoid future infringements.3. All ships to which this Agreement applies shall be sufficiently, safely and efficiently manned, in accordance with the minimum safe manning document or an equivalent issued by the competent authority.Clause 11No person under 16 years of age shall work on a ship.Clause 12The shipowner shall provide the master with the necessary resources for the purpose of compliance with obligations under this Agreement, including those relating to the appropriate manning of the ship. The master shall take all necessary steps to ensure that the requirements on seafarers' hours of work and rest arising from this Agreement are complied with.Clause 131. All seafarers shall possess a certificate attesting to their fitness for the work or which they are to be employed at sea.The nature of the health assessment to be made and the particulars to be included in the medical certifcate shall be established after consultation with the shipowners and seafarers organisations concerned.All seafarers shall have regular health assessments. Watchkeepers suffering from health problems certified by a medical practitioner as being due to the fact that they perform night work shall be transferred, wherever possible, to day work to which they are suited.2. The health assessment referred to in paragraph 1 shall be free and comply with medical confidentiality. Such health assessments may be conducted within the national health system.Clause 14Shipowners shall provide information on watchkeepers and other night workers to the national competent authority if they so request.Clause 15Seafarers shall have safety and health protection appropriate to the nature of their work. Equivalent protection and prevention services or facilities with regard to the safety and health of seafarers working by day or by night shall be available.Clause 16Every seafarer shall be entitled to paid annual leave of at least four weeks, or a proportion thereof for periods of employment of less than one year, in accordance with the conditions for entitlement to, and granting of, such leave laid down by national legislation and or/practice.The minimum period of paid annual leave may not be replaced by an allowance in lieu, except where the employment relationship is terminated.Brussels, 30 Septembre 1998.Federation of Transport Workers' Unions in the European Union (FST)European Community Shipowners' Association (ECSA)", "summary": "Seafarers’ working time\nSeafarers’ working time\nSUMMARY OF:\nDirective 1999/63/EC — Agreement on the organisation of working time of seafarers\nWHAT IS THE AIM OF THE DIRECTIVE?\nIt puts into legislation the seafarers’* working time agreement reached between the European Community Shipowners’* Association and the Federation of Transport Workers’ Unions on 30 September 1998.\nIt takes account of the International Labour Organisation’s 2006 Maritime Labour Convention (MLC) in regard to seafarers’ hours of work.\nKEY POINTS\nEvery publicly or privately owned seagoing ship registered in a European Union (EU) Member State carrying out commercial maritime activities must respect the legislation.\nThe directive specifies a maximum number of working hours or a minimum amount of rest time over a given period.\nWorking hours: a standard working day is 8 hours, with 1 day off and rest on public holidays;maximum working hours must not exceed 14 hours in any 24-hour period or 72 hours over 7 days.\nRest periods: must not be less than 10 hours in any 24-hour period, or 77 hours over 7 days;may be divided into no more than two periods, one of which must be at least 6 hours;must occur within at least 14 hours of each other;must be disturbed as little as possible by safety exercises such as musters, and fire-fighting and lifeboat drills;must include adequate compensation for resting seafarers called out to work.\nRecords must be kept of seafarers’ daily work and rest hours.\nNo seafarer under 18 may work at night* except for specific duties or training.\nThe employment, engagement of or work by those under 18 is not allowed if it is likely to jeopardise their health and safety.\nShip masters have the right to require the crew to work if necessary to ensure the immediate safety of the vessel, the people on board, its cargo and others in distress.\nDetails of on-board working arrangements and the legislation’s provisions must be accessible and displayed.\nCrewing levels must avoid or minimise excessive working hours to ensure sufficient rest and limit fatigue.\nEvery seafarer: must have a health certificate proving they are medically fit to work at sea — the directive sets out the details for such certificates including issuing rules, validity and the nature of the health assessment.
