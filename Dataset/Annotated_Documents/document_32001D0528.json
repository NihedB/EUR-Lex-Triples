As regards the securities markets, the European Securities Committee (ESC) is attached directly to the Commission.\nACTS\nCommission Decision 2001/528/EC of 6 June 2001 establishing the European Securities Committee (Text with EEA relevance) [See amending acts].\nSUMMARY\nThe establishment of the supervisory and regulatory committees is designed to give practical impetus to the achievement of a single market in financial services in accordance with the framework spelt out in the Financial Services Action Plan (FSAP).\nCreation of the ESC\nThe ESC was set up in 2001 to help improve the regulation and supervision of securities markets. Its creation meets the needs of the four-level regulatory framework advocated in the report by the Committee of Wise Men, the Lamfalussy report in 2001. As an advisory body, it participates in preparing and applying the measures for implementing the framework principles laid down in the relevant directives and regulations. The Lamfalussy process was re-examined in 2007. As part of the re-examination of this process, it seemed necessary to enhance the action of these committees and to establish a strengthened legal framework.\nAs it oversees developments on securities markets, this advisory committee participates in drawing up the implementing measures for the framework principles. It is also responsible for assessing risks which represent a major factor in financial stability.\nRole of the ESC\nThe ESC is, first and foremost, a body for consultation and reflection. The committee is principally responsible for advising the Commission on policy issues and draft proposals which it could adopt in the field of securities.\nComposition of the ESC\nThe ESC is composed of high-level representatives of Member States and is chaired by a representative of the Commission. The committee may invite experts and observers to attend its meetings.\nContext\nThe interdependency of European Union financial systems and the disappearance of a distinction between bank-related activities, those related to securities and to insurance complicates monitoring both at national and European level. It is therefore essential to introduce a system to detect any cross-border and cross-sectoral risks rapidly so as to preserve financial stability.\nDecision 2009/77/EC repeals Decision 2001/527/EC.\nReferences\nAct\nEntry into force\nDeadline for transposition in the Member States\nOfficial Journal\nDecision 2001/528/EC\n7.6.2001\n-\nOJ L 191, 13.7.2001\nAmending act(s)\nEntry into force\nDeadline for transposition in the Member States\nOfficial Journal\nDecision 2004/8/EC\n13.4.2005\n-\nOJ L 3, 7.1.2004\nSee also\nFurther information can be obtained on the website of the Internal Market and Services Directorate-General: ESC\nLast updated: 08.04.2011", "tags": ["securities", "advisory committee (EU)"], "subjects": ["Free movement of capital", "Internal market - Principles", "Freedom of establishment"], "split": "train", "reference_annotations": {}, "summary_annotations": {"32001D0528_p1": {"text": "decision 2009/77/ec repeals decision 2001/527/ec.", "triples": [" decision 2009/77/ec,  repeals,  decision 2001/527/ec"]}}}
