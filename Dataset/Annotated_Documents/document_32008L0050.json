{"celex_id": "32008L0050", "reference": "11.6.2008\nEN\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\nL 152/1\nDIRECTIVE 2008/50/EC OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL\nof 21 May 2008\non ambient air quality and cleaner air for Europe\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 175 thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the Commission,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee (1),\nHaving regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions (2),\nActing in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty (3),\nWhereas:\n(1)\nThe Sixth Community Environment Action Programme adopted by Decision No 1600/2002/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 July 2002 (4) establishes the need to reduce pollution to levels which minimise harmful effects on human health, paying particular attention to sensitive populations, and the environment as a whole, to improve the monitoring and assessment of air quality including the deposition of pollutants and to provide information to the public.\n(2)\nIn order to protect human health and the environment as a whole, it is particularly important to combat emissions of pollutants at source and to identify and implement the most effective emission reduction measures at local, national and Community level. Therefore, emissions of harmful air pollutants should be avoided, prevented or reduced and appropriate objectives set for ambient air quality taking into account relevant World Health Organisation standards, guidelines and programmes.\n(3)\nCouncil Directive 96/62/EC of 27 September 1996 on ambient air quality assessment and management (5), Council Directive 1999/30/EC of 22 April 1999 relating to limit values for sulphur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide and oxides of nitrogen, particulate matter and lead in ambient air (6), Directive 2000/69/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 November 2000 relating to limit values for benzene and carbon monoxide in ambient air (7), Directive 2002/3/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 February 2002 relating to ozone in ambient air (8) and Council Decision 97/101/EC of 27 January 1997 establishing a reciprocal exchange of information and data from networks and individual stations measuring ambient air pollution within the Member States (9) need to be substantially revised in order to incorporate the latest health and scientific developments and the experience of the Member States. In the interests of clarity, simplification and administrative efficiency it is therefore appropriate that those five acts be replaced by a single Directive and, where appropriate, by implementing measures.\n(4)\nOnce sufficient experience has been gained in relation to the implementation of Directive 2004/107/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 December 2004 relating to arsenic, cadmium, mercury, nickel and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in ambient air (10) consideration may be given to the possibility of merging its provisions with those of this Directive.\n(5)\nA common approach to the assessment of ambient air quality should be followed according to common assessment criteria. When assessing ambient air quality, account should be taken of the size of populations and ecosystems exposed to air pollution. It is therefore appropriate to classify the territory of each Member State into zones or agglomerations reflecting the population density.\n(6)\nWhere possible modelling techniques should be applied to enable point data to be interpreted in terms of geographical distribution of concentration. This could serve as a basis for calculating the collective exposure of the population living in the area.\n(7)\nIn order to ensure that the information collected on air pollution is sufficiently representative and comparable across the Community, it is important that standardised measurement techniques and common criteria for the number and location of measuring stations are used for the assessment of ambient air quality. Techniques other than measurements can be used to assess ambient air quality and it is therefore necessary to define criteria for the use and required accuracy of such techniques.\n(8)\nDetailed measurements of fine particulate matter at rural background locations should be made in order to understand better the impacts of this pollutant and to develop appropriate policies. Such measurements should be made in a manner consistent with those of the cooperative programme for monitoring and evaluation of the long range transmission of air pollutants in Europe (EMEP) set up under the 1979 Convention on Long-range Transboundary Air Pollution approved by Council Decision 81/462/EEC of 11 June 1981 (11).\n(9)\nAir quality status should be maintained where it is already good, or improved. Where the objectives for ambient air quality laid down in this Directive are not met, Member States should take action in order to comply with the limit values and critical levels, and where possible, to attain the target values and long-term objectives.\n(10)\nThe risk posed by air pollution to vegetation and natural ecosystems is most important in places away from urban areas. The assessment of such risks and the compliance with critical levels for the protection of vegetation should therefore focus on places away from built-up areas.\n(11)\nFine particulate matter (PM2,5) is responsible for significant negative impacts on human health. Further, there is as yet no identifiable threshold below which PM2,5 would not pose a risk. As such, this pollutant should not be regulated in the same way as other air pollutants. The approach should aim at a general reduction of concentrations in the urban background to ensure that large sections of the population benefit from improved air quality. However, to ensure a minimum degree of health protection everywhere, that approach should be combined with a limit value, which is to be preceded in a first stage by a target value.\n(12)\nThe existing target values and long-term objectives of ensuring effective protection against harmful effects on human health and vegetation and ecosystems from exposure to ozone should remain unchanged. An alert threshold and an information threshold for ozone should be set for the protection of the general population and sensitive sections, respectively, from brief exposures to elevated ozone concentrations. Those thresholds should trigger the dissemination of information to the public on the risks of exposure and the implementation, if appropriate, of short-term measures to reduce ozone levels where the alert threshold is exceeded.\n(13)\nOzone is a transboundary pollutant formed in the atmosphere from the emission of primary pollutants addressed by Directive 2001/81/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 October 2001 on national emission ceilings for certain atmospheric pollutants (12). Progress towards the air quality targets and long term objectives for ozone set in this Directive should be determined by the targets and emission ceilings provided for in Directive 2001/81/EC and, if appropriate, by implementing air quality plans as provided for in this Directive.\n(14)\nFixed measurements should be mandatory in zones and agglomerations where the long-term objectives for ozone or the assessment thresholds for other pollutants are exceeded. Information from fixed measurements may be supplemented by modelling techniques and/or indicative measurements to enable point data to be interpreted in terms of geographical distribution of concentrations. The use of supplementary techniques of assessment should also allow for reduction of the required minimum number of fixed sampling points.\n(15)\nContributions from natural sources can be assessed but cannot be controlled. Therefore, where natural contributions to pollutants in ambient air can be determined with sufficient certainty, and where exceedances are due in whole or in part to these natural contributions, these may, under the conditions laid down in this Directive, be subtracted when assessing compliance with air quality limit values. Contributions to exceedances of particulate matter PM10 limit values attributable to winter-sanding or -salting of roads may also be subtracted when assessing compliance with air quality limit values provided that reasonable measures have been taken to lower concentrations.\n(16)\nFor zones and agglomerations where conditions are particularly difficult, it should be possible to postpone the deadline for compliance with the air quality limit values in cases where, notwithstanding the implementation of appropriate pollution abatement measures, acute compliance problems exist in specific zones and agglomerations. Any postponement for a given zone or agglomeration should be accompanied by a comprehensive plan to be assessed by the Commission to ensure compliance by the revised deadline. The availability of necessary Community measures reflecting the chosen ambition level in the Thematic Strategy on air pollution to reduce emissions at source will be important for an effective emission reduction by the timeframe established in this Directive for compliance with the limit values and should be taken into account when assessing requests to postpone deadlines for compliance.\n(17)\nThe necessary Community measures to reduce emissions at source, in particular measures to improve the effectiveness of Community legislation on industrial emissions, to limit the exhaust emissions of engines installed in heavy duty vehicles, to further reduce the Member Statesâ€™ permitted national emissions of key pollutants and the emissions associated with refuelling of petrol cars at service stations, and to address the sulphur content of fuels including marine fuels should be duly examined as a priority by all institutions involved.\n(18)\nAir quality plans should be developed for zones and agglomerations within which concentrations of pollutants in ambient air exceed the relevant air quality target values or limit values, plus any temporary margins of tolerance, where applicable. Air pollutants are emitted from many different sources and activities. To ensure coherence between different policies, such air quality plans should where feasible be consistent, and integrated with plans and programmes prepared pursuant to Directive 2001/80/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 October 2001 on the limitation of emissions of certain pollutants into the air from large combustion plants (13), Directive 2001/81/EC, and Directive 2002/49/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 June 2002 relating to the assessment and management of environmental noise (14). Full account will also be taken of the ambient air quality objectives provided for in this Directive, where permits are granted for industrial activities pursuant to Directive 2008/1/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 January 2008 concerning integrated pollution prevention and control (15).\n(19)\nAction plans should be drawn up indicating the measures to be taken in the short term where there is a risk of an exceedance of one or more alert thresholds in order to reduce that risk and to limit its duration. When the risk applies to one or more limit values or target values, Member States may, where appropriate, draw up such short-term action plans. In respect of ozone, such short-term action plans should take into account the provisions of Commission Decision 2004/279/EC of 19 March 2004 concerning guidance for implementation of Directive 2002/3/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council relating to ozone in ambient air (16).\n(20)\nMember States should consult with one another if, following significant pollution originating in another Member State, the level of a pollutant exceeds, or is likely to exceed, the relevant air quality objectives plus the margin of tolerance where applicable or, as the case may be, the alert threshold. The transboundary nature of specific pollutants, such as ozone and particulate matter, may require coordination between neighbouring Member States in drawing up and implementing air quality plans and short-term action plans and in informing the public. Where appropriate, Member States should pursue cooperation with third countries, with particular emphasis on the early involvement of candidate countries.\n(21)\nIt is necessary for the Member States and the Commission to collect, exchange and disseminate air quality information in order to understand better the impacts of air pollution and develop appropriate policies. Up-to-date information on concentrations of all regulated pollutants in ambient air should also be readily available to the public.\n(22)\nIn order to facilitate the handling and comparison of air quality information, data should be made available to the Commission in a standardised form.\n(23)\nIt is necessary to adapt procedures for data provision, assessment and reporting of air quality to enable electronic means and the Internet to be used as the main tools to make information available, and so that such procedures are compatible with Directive 2007/2/EC of the European Parliament and the Council of 14 March 2007 establishing an infrastructure for spatial information in the European Community (INSPIRE) (17).\n(24)\nIt is appropriate to provide for the possibility of adapting the criteria and techniques used for the assessment of the ambient air quality to scientific and technical progress and adapting thereto the information to be provided.\n(25)\nSince the objectives of this Directive cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States by reason of the transboundary nature of air pollutants and can therefore be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Directive does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives.\n(26)\nMember States should lay down rules on penalties applicable to infringements of the provisions of this Directive and ensure that they are implemented. The penalties should be effective, proportionate and dissuasive.\n(27)\nCertain provisions of the acts repealed by this Directive should remain in force in order to ensure the continuance of existing air quality limits for nitrogen dioxide until they are replaced from 1 January 2010, the continuance of air quality reporting provisions until new implementing measures are adopted, and the continuance of obligations relating to the preliminary assessments of air quality required under Directive 2004/107/EC.\n(28)\nThe obligation to transpose this Directive into national law should be confined to those provisions which represent a substantive change as compared with the earlier Directives.\n(29)\nIn accordance with point 34 of the Interinstitutional Agreement on better lawmaking (18), Member States are encouraged to draw up, for themselves and in the interest of the Community, their own tables illustrating, as far as possible, the correlation between the Directive and the transposition measures, and to make them public.\n(30)\nThis Directive respects the fundamental rights and observes the principles recognised in particular by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. In particular, this Directive seeks to promote the integration into the policies of the Union of a high level of environmental protection and the improvement of the quality of the environment in accordance with the principle of sustainable development as laid down in Article 37 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union.\n(31)\nThe measures necessary for the implementation of this Directive should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission (19).\n(32)\nThe Commission should be empowered to amend Annexes I to VI, Annexes VIII to X and Annex XV. Since those measures are of general scope and are designed to amend non-essential elements of this Directive, they must be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny provided for in Article 5a of Decision 1999/468/EC.\n(33)\nThe transposition clause requires Member States to ensure that the necessary urban background measurements are in place well in time to define the Average Exposure Indicator, in order to guarantee that the requirements related to the assessment of the National Exposure Reduction Target and to the calculation of the Average Exposure Indicator are met,\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:\nCHAPTER I\nGENERAL PROVISIONS\nArticle 1\nSubject matter\nThis Directive lays down measures aimed at the following:\n1.\ndefining and establishing objectives for

The upper and lower assessment thresholds specified in Section A of Annex II shall apply to sulphur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide and oxides of nitrogen, particulate matter (PM10 and PM2,5), lead, benzene and carbon monoxide.\nEach zone and agglomeration shall be classified in relation to those assessment thresholds.\n2.   The classification referred to in paragraph 1 shall be reviewed at least every five years in accordance with the procedure laid down in Section B of Annex II.\nHowever, classifications shall be reviewed more frequently in the event of significant changes in activities relevant to the ambient concentrations of sulphur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide or, where relevant, oxides of nitrogen, particulate matter (PM10, PM2,5), lead, benzene or carbon monoxide.\nArticle 6\nAssessment criteria\n1.   Member States shall assess ambient air quality with respect to the pollutants referred to in Article 5 in all their zones and agglomerations, in accordance with the criteria laid down in paragraphs 2, 3 and 4 of this Article and in accordance with the criteria laid down in Annex III.\n2.   In all zones and agglomerations where the level of pollutants referred to in paragraph 1 exceeds the upper assessment threshold established for those pollutants, fixed measurements shall be used to assess the ambient air quality. Those fixed measurements may be supplemented by modelling techniques and/or indicative measurements to provide adequate information on the spatial distribution of the ambient air quality.\n3.   In all zones and agglomerations where the level of pollutants referred to in paragraph 1 is below the upper assessment threshold established for those pollutants, a combination of fixed measurements and modelling techniques and/or indicative measurements may be used to assess the ambient air quality.\n4.   In all zones and agglomerations where the level of pollutants referred to in paragraph 1 is below the lower assessment threshold established for those pollutants, modelling techniques or objective-estimation techniques or both shall be sufficient for the assessment of the ambient air quality.\n5.   In addition to the assessments referred to in paragraphs 2, 3 and 4, measurements shall be made, at rural background locations away from significant sources of air pollution, for the purposes of providing, as a minimum, information on the total mass concentration and the chemical speciation concentrations of fine particulate matter (PM2,5) on an annual average basis and shall be conducted using the following criteria:\n(a)\none sampling point shall be installed every 100 000 km2;\n(b)\neach Member State shall set up at least one measuring station or may, by agreement with adjoining Member States, set up one or several common measuring stations, covering the relevant neighbouring zones, to achieve the necessary spatial resolution;\n(c)\nwhere appropriate, monitoring shall be coordinated with the monitoring strategy and measurement programme of the Cooperative Programme for Monitoring and Evaluation of the Long-range Transmission of Air Pollutants in Europe (EMEP);\n(d)\nSections A and C of Annex I shall apply in relation to the data quality objectives for mass concentration measurements of particulate matter and Annex IV shall apply in its entirety.\nMember States shall inform the Commission of the measurement methods used in the measurement of the chemical composition of fine particulate matter (PM2,5).\nArticle 7\nSampling points\n1.   The location of sampling points for the measurement of sulphur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide and oxides of nitrogen, particulate matter (PM10, PM2,5), lead, benzene and carbon monoxide in ambient air shall be determined using the criteria listed in Annex III.\n2.   In each zone or agglomeration where fixed measurements are the sole source of information for assessing air quality, the number of sampling points for each relevant pollutant shall not be less than the minimum number of sampling points specified in Section A of Annex V.\n3.   For zones and agglomerations within which information from fixed measurement sampling points is supplemented by information from modelling and/or indicative measurement, the total number of sampling points specified in Section A of Annex V may be reduced by up to 50 %, provided that the following conditions are met:\n(a)\nthe supplementary methods provide sufficient information for the assessment of air quality with regard to limit values or alert thresholds, as well as adequate information for the public;\n(b)\nthe number of sampling points to be installed and the spatial resolution of other techniques are sufficient for the concentration of the relevant pollutant to be established in accordance with the data quality objectives specified in Section A of Annex I and enable assessment results to meet the criteria specified in Section B of Annex I.\nThe results of modelling and/or indicative measurement shall be taken into account for the assessment of air quality with respect to the limit values.\n4.   The application in Member States of the criteria for selecting sampling points shall be monitored by the Commission so as to facilitate the harmonised application of those criteria throughout the European Union.\nArticle 8\nReference measurement methods\n1.   Member States shall apply the reference measurement methods and criteria specified in Section A and Section C of Annex VI.\n2.   Other measurement methods may be used subject to the conditions set out in Section B of Annex VI.\nSECTION 2\nAssessment of ambient air quality in relation to ozone\nArticle 9\nAssessment criteria\n1.   Where, in a zone or agglomeration, concentrations of ozone have exceeded the long-term objectives specified in Section C of Annex VII during any of the previous five years of measurement, fixed measurements shall be taken.\n2.   Where fewer than five years' data are available, Member States may, for the purposes of determining whether the long-term objectives referred to in paragraph 1 have been exceeded during those five years, combine the results from measurement campaigns of short duration carried out when and where levels are likely to be at their highest, with the results obtained from emission inventories and modelling.\nArticle 10\nSampling points\n1.   The siting of sampling points for the measurement of ozone shall be determined using the criteria set out in Annex VIII.\n2.   The sampling points for fixed measurements of ozone in each zone or agglomeration within which measurement is the sole source of information for assessing air quality shall not be less than the minimum number of sampling points specified in Section A of Annex IX.\n3.   For zones and agglomerations within which information from sampling points for fixed measurements is supplemented by information from modelling and/or indicative measurements, the number of sampling points specified in Section A of Annex IX may be reduced provided that the following conditions are met:\n(a)\nthe supplementary methods provide sufficient information for the assessment of air quality with regard to target values, long-term objectives, information and alert thresholds;\n(b)\nthe number of sampling points to be installed and the spatial resolution of other techniques are sufficient for the concentration of ozone to be established in accordance with the data quality objectives specified in Section A of Annex I and enable assessment results to meet the criteria specified in Section B of Annex I;\n(c)\nthe number of sampling points in each zone or agglomeration amounts to at least one sampling point per two million inhabitants or one sampling point per 50 000 km2, whichever produces the greater number of sampling points, but must not be less than one sampling point in each zone or agglomeration;\n(d)\nnitrogen dioxide is measured at all remaining sampling points except at rural background stations as referred to in Section A of Annex VIII.\nThe results of modelling and/or indicative measurement shall be taken into account for the assessment of air quality with respect to the target values.\n4.   Nitrogen dioxide shall be measured at a minimum of 50 % of the ozone sampling points required under Section A of Annex IX. That measurement shall be continuous except at rural background stations, as referred to in Section A of Annex VIII, where other measurement methods may be used.\n5.   In zones and agglomerations where, during each of the previous five years of measurement, concentrations are below the long-term objectives, the number of sampling points for fixed measurements shall be determined in accordance with Section B of Annex IX.\n6.   Each Member State shall ensure that at least one sampling point is installed and operated in its territory to supply data on concentrations of the ozone precursor substances listed in Annex X. Each Member State shall choose the number and siting of the stations at which ozone precursor substances are to be measured, taking into account the objectives and methods laid down in Annex X.\nArticle 11\nReference measurement methods\n1.   Member States shall apply the reference method for measurement of ozone, set out in point 8 of Section A of Annex VI. Other measuring methods may be used subject to the conditions set out in Section B of Annex VI.\n2.   Each Member State shall inform the Commission of the methods it uses to sample and measure VOC, as listed in Annex X.\nCHAPTER III\nAMBIENT AIR QUALITY MANAGEMENT\nArticle 12\nRequirements where levels are lower than the limit values\nIn zones and agglomerations where the levels of sulphur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, PM10, PM2,5, lead, benzene and carbon monoxide in ambient air are below the respective limit values specified in Annexes XI and XIV, Member States shall maintain the levels of those pollutants below the limit values and shall endeavour to preserve the best ambient air quality, compatible with sustainable development.\nArticle 13\nLimit values and alert thresholds for the protection of human health\n1.   Member States shall ensure that, throughout their zones and agglomerations, levels of sulphur dioxide, PM10, lead, and carbon monoxide in ambient air do not exceed the limit values laid down in Annex XI.\nIn respect of nitrogen dioxide and benzene, the limit values specified in Annex XI may not be exceeded from the dates specified therein.\nCompliance with these requirements shall be assessed in accordance with Annex III.\nThe margins of tolerance laid down in Annex XI shall apply in accordance with Article 22(3) and Article 23(1).\n2.   The alert thresholds for concentrations of sulphur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide in ambient air shall be those laid down in Section A of Annex XII.\nArticle 14\nCritical levels\n1.   Member States shall ensure compliance with the critical levels specified in Annex XIII as assessed in accordance with Section A of Annex III.\n2.   Where fixed measurements are the sole source of information for assessing air quality, the number of sampling points shall not be less than the minimum number specified in Section C of Annex V. Where that information is supplemented by indicative measurements or modelling, the minimum number of sampling points may be reduced by up to 50 % so long as the assessed concentrations of the relevant pollutant can be established in accordance with the data quality objectives specified in Section A of Annex I.\nArticle 15\nNational PM2,5 exposure reduction target for the protection of human health\n1.   Member States shall take all necessary measures not entailing disproportionate costs to reduce exposure to PM2,5 with a view to attaining the national exposure reduction target laid down in Section B of Annex XIV by the year specified therein.\n2.   Member States shall ensure that the average exposure indicator for the year 2015 established in accordance with Section A of Annex XIV does not exceed the exposure concentration obligation laid down in Section C of that Annex.\n3.   The average exposure indicator for PM2,5 shall be assessed in accordance with Section A of Annex XIV.\n4.   Each Member State shall, in accordance with Annex III, ensure that the distribution and the number of sampling points on which the average exposure indicator for PM2,5 is based reflect the general population exposure adequately. The number of sampling points shall be no less than that determined by application of Section B of Annex V.\nArticle 16\nPM2,5 target value and limit value for the protection of human health\n1.

Member States shall ensure that concentrations of PM2,5 in ambient air do not exceed the limit value laid down in Section E of Annex XIV throughout their zones and agglomerations as from the date specified therein. Compliance with this requirement shall be assessed in accordance with Annex III.\n3.   The margin of tolerance laid down in Section E of Annex XIV shall apply in accordance with Article 23(1).\nArticle 17\nRequirements in zones and agglomerations where ozone concentrations exceed the target values and long-term objectives\n1.   Member States shall take all necessary measures not entailing disproportionate costs to ensure that the target values and long-term objectives are attained.\n2.   For zones and agglomerations in which a target value is exceeded, Member States shall ensure that the programme prepared pursuant to Article 6 of Directive 2001/81/EC and, if appropriate, an air quality plan is implemented in order to attain the target values, save where not achievable through measures not entailing disproportionate costs, as from the date specified in Section B of Annex VII to this Directive.\n3.   For zones and agglomerations in which the levels of ozone in ambient air are higher than the long-term objectives but below, or equal to, the target values, Member States shall prepare and implement cost-effective measures with the aim of achieving the long-term objectives. Those measures shall, at least, be consistent with all the air quality plans and the programme referred to in paragraph 2.\nArticle 18\nRequirements in zones and agglomerations where ozone concentrations meet the long-term objectives\nIn zones and agglomerations in which ozone levels meet the long-term objectives, Member States shall, in so far as factors including the transboundary nature of ozone pollution and meteorological conditions permit, maintain those levels below the long-term objectives and shall preserve through proportionate measures the best ambient air quality compatible with sustainable development and a high level of environmental and human health protection.\nArticle 19\nMeasures required in the event of information or alert thresholds being exceeded\nWhere the information threshold specified in Annex XII or any of the alert thresholds laid down therein is exceeded, Member States shall take the necessary steps to inform the public by means of radio, television, newspapers or the Internet.\nMember States shall also forward to the Commission, on a provisional basis, information concerning the levels recorded and the duration of the periods during which the alert threshold or information threshold was exceeded.\nArticle 20\nContributions from natural sources\n1.   Member States shall transmit to the Commission, for a given year, lists of zones and agglomerations where exceedances of limit values for a given pollutant are attributable to natural sources. Member States shall provide information on concentrations and sources and the evidence demonstrating that the exceedances are attributable to natural sources.\n2.   Where the Commission has been informed of an exceedance attributable to natural sources in accordance with paragraph 1, that exceedance shall not be considered as an exceedance for the purposes of this Directive.\n3.   The Commission shall by 11 June 2010 publish guidelines for demonstration and subtraction of exceedances attributable to natural sources.\nArticle 21\nExceedances attributable to winter-sanding or -salting of roads\n1.   Member States may designate zones or agglomerations within which limit values for PM10 are exceeded in ambient air due to the re-suspension of particulates following winter-sanding or -salting of roads.\n2.   Member States shall send the Commission lists of any such zones or agglomerations together with information on concentrations and sources of PM10 therein.\n3.   When informing the Commission in accordance with Article 27, Member States shall provide the necessary evidence to demonstrate that any exceedances are due to re-suspended particulates and that reasonable measures have been taken to lower the concentrations.\n4.   Without prejudice to Article 20, in the case of zones and agglomerations referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article, Member States need to establish the air quality plan provided for in Article 23 only in so far as exceedances are attributable to PM10 sources other than winter-sanding or -salting of roads.\n5.   The Commission shall by 11 June 2010 publish guidelines for determination of contributions from the re-suspension of particulates following winter-sanding or -salting of roads.\nArticle 22\nPostponement of attainment deadlines and exemption from the obligation to apply certain limit values\n1.   Where, in a given zone or agglomeration, conformity with the limit values for nitrogen dioxide or benzene cannot be achieved by the deadlines specified in Annex XI, a Member State may postpone those deadlines by a maximum of five years for that particular zone or agglomeration, on condition that an air quality plan is established in accordance with Article 23 for the zone or agglomeration to which the postponement would apply; such air quality plan shall be supplemented by the information listed in Section B of Annex XV related to the pollutants concerned and shall demonstrate how conformity will be achieved with the limit values before the new deadline.\n2.   Where, in a given zone or agglomeration, conformity with the limit values for PM10 as specified in Annex XI cannot be achieved because of site-specific dispersion characteristics, adverse climatic conditions or transboundary contributions, a Member State shall be exempt from the obligation to apply those limit values until 11 June 2011 provided that the conditions laid down in paragraph 1 are fulfilled and that the Member State shows that all appropriate measures have been taken at national, regional and local level to meet the deadlines.\n3.   Where a Member State applies paragraphs 1 or 2, it shall ensure that the limit value for each pollutant is not exceeded by more than the maximum margin of tolerance specified in Annex XI for each of the pollutants concerned.\n4.   Member States shall notify the Commission where, in their view, paragraphs 1 or 2 are applicable, and shall communicate the air quality plan referred to in paragraph 1 including all relevant information necessary for the Commission to assess whether or not the relevant conditions are satisfied. In its assessment, the Commission shall take into account estimated effects on ambient air quality in the Member States, at present and in the future, of measures that have been taken by the Member States as well as estimated effects on ambient air quality of current Community measures and planned Community measures to be proposed by the Commission.\nWhere the Commission has raised no objections within nine months of receipt of that notification, the relevant conditions for the application of paragraphs 1 or 2 shall be deemed to be satisfied.\nIf objections are raised, the Commission may require Member States to adjust or provide new air quality plans.\nCHAPTER IV\nPLANS\nArticle 23\nAir quality plans\n1.   Where, in given zones or agglomerations, the levels of pollutants in ambient air exceed any limit value or target value, plus any relevant margin of tolerance in each case, Member States shall ensure that air quality plans are established for those zones and agglomerations in order to achieve the related limit value or target value specified in Annexes XI and XIV.\nIn the event of exceedances of those limit values for which the attainment deadline is already expired, the air quality plans shall set out appropriate measures, so that the exceedance period can be kept as short as possible. The air quality plans may additionally include specific measures aiming at the protection of sensitive population groups, including children.\nThose air quality plans shall incorporate at least the information listed in Section A of Annex XV and may include measures pursuant to Article 24. Those plans shall be communicated to the Commission without delay, but no later than two years after the end of the year the first exceedance was observed.\nWhere air quality plans must be prepared or implemented in respect of several pollutants, Member States shall, where appropriate, prepare and implement integrated air quality plans covering all pollutants concerned.\n2.   Member States shall, to the extent feasible, ensure consistency with other plans required under Directive 2001/80/EC, Directive 2001/81/EC or Directive 2002/49/EC in order to achieve the relevant environmental objectives.\nArticle 24\nShort-term action plans\n1.   Where, in a given zone or agglomeration, there is a risk that the levels of pollutants will exceed one or more of the alert thresholds specified in Annex XII, Member States shall draw up action plans indicating the measures to be taken in the short term in order to reduce the risk or duration of such an exceedance. Where this risk applies to one or more limit values or target values specified in Annexes VII, XI and XIV, Member States may, where appropriate, draw up such short-term action plans.\nHowever, where there is a risk that the alert threshold for ozone specified in Section B of Annex XII will be exceeded, Member States shall only draw up such short-term action plans when in their opinion there is a significant potential, taking into account national geographical, meteorological and economic conditions, to reduce the risk, duration or severity of such an exceedance. When drawing up such a short-term action plan Member States shall take account of Decision 2004/279/EC.\n2.   The short-term action plans referred to in paragraph 1 may, depending on the individual case, provide for effective measures to control and, where necessary, suspend activities which contribute to the risk of the respective limit values or target values or alert threshold being exceeded. Those action plans may include measures in relation to motor-vehicle traffic, construction works, ships at berth, and the use of industrial plants or products and domestic heating. Specific actions aiming at the protection of sensitive population groups, including children, may also be considered in the framework of those plans.\n3.   When Member States have drawn up a short-term action plan, they shall make available to the public and to appropriate organisations such as environmental organisations, consumer organisations, organisations representing the interests of sensitive population groups, other relevant health-care bodies and the relevant industrial federations both the results of their investigations on the feasibility and the content of specific short-term action plans as well as information on the implementation of these plans.\n4.   For the first time before 11 June 2010 and at regular intervals thereafter, the Commission shall publish examples of best practices for the drawing-up of short-term action plans, including examples of best practices for the protection of sensitive population groups, including children.\nArticle 25\nTransboundary air pollution\n1.   Where any alert threshold, limit value or target value plus any relevant margin of tolerance or long-term objective is exceeded due to significant transboundary transport of air pollutants or their precursors, the Member States concerned shall cooperate and, where appropriate, draw up joint activities, such as the preparation of joint or coordinated air quality plans pursuant to Article 23 in order to remove such exceedances through the application of appropriate but proportionate measures.\n2.   The Commission shall be invited to be present and to assist in any cooperation referred to in paragraph 1. Where appropriate, the Commission shall, taking into account the reports established pursuant to Article 9 of Directive 2001/81/EC, consider whether further action should be taken at Community level in order to reduce precursor emissions responsible for transboundary pollution.\n3.   Member States shall, if appropriate pursuant to Article 24, prepare and implement joint short-term action plans covering neighbouring zones in other Member States. Member States shall ensure that neighbouring zones in other Member States which have developed short-term action plans receive all appropriate information.\n4.   Where the information threshold or alert thresholds are exceeded in zones or agglomerations close to national borders, information shall be provided as soon as possible to the competent authorities in the neighbouring Member States concerned. That information shall also be made available to the public.\n5.   In drawing up plans as provided for in paragraphs 1 and 3 and in informing the public as referred to in paragraph 4, Member States shall, where appropriate, endeavour to pursue cooperation with third countries, and in particular with candidate countries.\nCHAPTER V\nINFORMATION AND REPORTING\nArticle 26\nPublic information\n1.   Member States shall ensure that the public as well as appropriate organisations such as environmental organisations, consumer organisations, organisations representing the interests of sensitive populations, other relevant health-care bodies and the relevant industrial federations are informed, adequately and in good time, of the following:\n(a)\nambient air quality in accordance with Annex XVI;\n(b)\nany postponement decisions pursuant to Article 22(1);\n(c)\nany exemptions pursuant to Article 22(2);\n(d)\nair quality plans as provided for in Article 22(1) and Article 23 and programmes referred to in Article 17(2).\nThe information shall be made available free of charge by means of any easily accessible media including the Internet or any other appropriate means of telecommunication, and shall take into account the provisions laid down in Directive 2007/2/EC.\n2.   Member States shall make available to the public annual reports for all pollutants covered by this Directive.\nThose reports shall summarise the levels exceeding limit values, target values, long-term objectives, information thresholds and alert thresholds, for the relevant averaging periods. That information shall be combined with a summary assessment of the effects of those exceedances. The reports may include, where appropriate, further information and assessments on forest protection as well as information on other pollutants for which monitoring provisions are specified in this Directive, such as, inter alia, selected non-regulated ozone precursor substances as listed in Section B of Annex X.\n3.   Member States shall inform the public of the competent authority or body designated in relation to the tasks referred to in Article 3.\nArticle 27\nTransmission of information and reporting\n1.   Member States shall ensure that information on ambient air quality is made available to the Commission within the required timescale as determined by the implementing measures referred to in Article 28(2).\n2.   In any event, for the specific purpose of assessing compliance with the limit values and critical levels and the attainment of target values, such information shall be made available to the Commission no later than nine months after the end of each year and shall include:\n(a)\nthe changes made in that year to the list and delimitation of zones and agglomerations established under Article 4;\n(b)\nthe list of zones and agglomerations in which the levels of one or more pollutants are higher than the limit values plus the margin of tolerance where applicable or higher than target values or critical levels; and for these zones and agglomerations:\n(i)\nlevels assessed and, if relevant, the dates and periods when such levels were observed;\n(ii)\nif appropriate, an assessment on contributions from natural sources and from re-suspension of particulates following winter-sanding or -salting of roads to the levels assessed, as declared to the Commission under Articles 20 and 21.\n3.   Paragraphs 1 and 2 shall apply to information collected as from the beginning of the second calendar year after the entry into force of the implementing measures referred to in Article 28(2).\nArticle 28\nImplementing measures\n1.   Measures designed to amend the non-essential elements of this Directive, namely Annexes I to VI, Annexes VIII to X and Annex XV, shall be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny referred to in Article 29(3).\nHowever, the amendments may not have the effect of directly or indirectly modifying either of the following:\n(a)\nthe limit values, exposure reduction targets, critical levels, target values, information or alert thresholds or long-term objectives specified in Annex VII and Annexes XI to XIV;\n(b)\nthe dates for compliance with any of the parameters referred to in point (a).\n2.   The Commission shall, in accordance with the regulatory procedure referred to in Article 29(2), determine the additional information to be made available by Member States pursuant to Article 27 as well as the timescales in which such information is to be communicated.\nThe Commission shall also identify ways of streamlining the way data are reported and the reciprocal exchange of information and data from networks and individual stations measuring ambient air pollution within the Member States, in accordance with the regulatory procedure referred to in Article 29(2).\n3.   The Commission shall draw up guidelines for the agreements on setting up common measuring stations as referred to in Article 6(5).\n4.   The Commission shall publish guidance on the demonstration of equivalence referred to in Section B of Annex VI.\nCHAPTER VI\nCOMMITTEE, TRANSITIONAL AND FINAL PROVISIONS\nArticle 29\nCommittee\n1.   The Commission shall be assisted by a committee, â€˜the Ambient Air Quality Committeeâ€™.\n2.   Where reference is made to this paragraph, Articles 5 and 7 of Decision 1999/468/EC shall apply, having regard to the provisions of Article 8 thereof.\nThe period laid down in Article 5(6) of Decision 1999/468/EC shall be set at three months.\n3.   Where reference is made to this paragraph, Article 5a(1) to (4) and Article 7 of Decision 1999/468/EC shall apply, having regard to the provisions of Article 8 thereof.\nArticle 30\nPenalties\nMember States shall lay down the rules on penalties applicable to infringements of the national provisions adopted pursuant to this Directive and shall take all measures necessary to ensure that they are implemented. The penalties provided for must be effective, proportionate and dissuasive.\nArticle 31\nRepeal and transitional provisions\n1.   Directives 96/62/EC, 1999/30/EC, 2000/69/EC and 2002/3/EC shall be repealed as from 11 June 2010, without prejudice to the obligations on the Member States relating to time-limits for transposition or application of those Directives.\nHowever, from 11 June 2008, the following shall apply:\n(a)\nin Directive 96/62/EC, paragraph 1 of Article 12 shall be replaced by the following:\nâ€˜1.   The detailed arrangements for forwarding the information to be provided under Article 11 shall be adopted in accordance with the procedure referred to in paragraph 3.â€™;\n(b)\nin Directive 1999/30/EC, Article 7(7), footnote 1 in point I of Annex VIII and point VI of Annex IX shall be deleted;\n(c)\nin Directive 2000/69/EC, Article 5(7) and point III in Annex VII shall be deleted;\n(d)\nin Directive 2002/3/EC, Article 9(5) and point II of Annex VIII shall be deleted.\n2.

References made to the repealed Directives shall be construed as being made to this Directive and should be read in accordance with the correlation table in Annex XVII.\n4.   Decision 97/101/EC shall be repealed with effect from the end of the second calendar year following the entry into force of the implementing measures referred to in Article 28(2) of this Directive.\nHowever, the third, fourth and fifth indents of Article 7 of Decision 97/101/EC shall be deleted with effect from 11 June 2008.\nArticle 32\nReview\n1.   In 2013 the Commission shall review the provisions related to PM2,5 and, as appropriate, other pollutants, and shall present a proposal to the European Parliament and the Council.\nAs regards PM2,5, the review shall be undertaken with a view to establishing a legally binding national exposure reduction obligation in order to replace the national exposure reduction target and to review the exposure concentration obligation laid down in Article 15, taking into account, inter alia, the following elements:\nâ€”\nlatest scientific information from WHO and other relevant organisations,\nâ€”\nair quality situations and reduction potentials in the Member States,\nâ€”\nthe revision of Directive 2001/81/EC,\nâ€”\nprogress made in implementing Community reduction measures for air pollutants,\n2.   The Commission shall take into account the feasibility of adopting a more ambitious limit value for PM2,5, shall review the indicative limit value of the second stage for PM2,5 and consider confirming or altering that value.\n3.   As part of the review, the Commission shall also prepare a report on the experience and on the necessity of monitoring of PM10 and PM2,5, taking into account technical progress in automatic measuring techniques. If appropriate, new reference methods for the measurement of PM10 and PM2,5 shall be proposed.\nArticle 33\nTransposition\n1.   Member States shall bring into force the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive before 11 June 2010. They shall forthwith communicate to the Commission the text of those measures.\nWhen Member States adopt these measures, they shall contain a reference to this Directive or shall be accompanied by such reference on the occasion of their official publication. The methods of making such reference shall be laid down by Member States.\n2.   However, Member States shall ensure that a sufficient number of urban background measurement stations of PM2,5 necessary for the calculation of the Average Exposure Indicator, in accordance with Section B of Annex V, is established at the latest by 1 January 2009, in order to comply with the timeframe and the conditions indicated in Section A of Annex XIV.\n3.

Data quality objectives for ambient air quality assessment\nSulphur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide and oxides of nitrogen and carbon monoxide\nBenzene\nParticulate matter (PM10/PM2,5) and lead\nOzone and related NO and NO2\nFixed measurements (1)\nUncertainty\n15 %\n25 %\n25 %\n15 %\nMinimum data capture\n90 %\n90 %\n90 %\n90 % during summer\n75 % during winter\nMinimum time coverage:\nâ€”\nurban background and traffic\nâ€”\n35 % (2)\nâ€”\nâ€”\nâ€”\nindustrial sites\nâ€”\n90 %\nâ€”\nâ€”\nIndicative measurements\nUncertainty\n25 %\n30 %\n50 %\n30 %\nMinimum data capture\n90 %\n90 %\n90 %\n90 %\nMinimum time coverage\n14 % (4)\n14 % (3)\n14 % (4)\n> 10 % during summer\nModelling uncertainty:\nHourly\n50 %\nâ€”\nâ€”\n50 %\nEight-hour averages\n50 %\nâ€”\nâ€”\n50 %\nDaily averages\n50 %\nâ€”\nnot yet defined\nâ€”\nAnnual averages\n30 %\n50 %\n50 %\nâ€”\nObjective estimation\nUncertainty\n75 %\n100 %\n100 %\n75 %\nThe uncertainty (expressed at a 95 % confidence level) of the assessment methods will be evaluated in accordance with the principles of the CEN Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement (ENV 13005-1999), the methodology of ISO 5725:1994 and the guidance provided in the CEN report â€˜Air Quality â€” Approach to Uncertainty Estimation for Ambient Air Reference Measurement Methodsâ€™ (CR 14377:2002E). The percentages for uncertainty in the above table are given for individual measurements averaged over the period considered by the limit value (or target value in the case of ozone), for a 95 % confidence interval. The uncertainty for the fixed measurements shall be interpreted as being applicable in the region of the appropriate limit value (or target value in the case of ozone).\nThe uncertainty for modelling is defined as the maximum deviation of the measured and calculated concentration levels for 90 % of individual monitoring points, over the period considered, by the limit value (or target value in the case of ozone), without taking into account the timing of the events. The uncertainty for modelling shall be interpreted as being applicable in the region of the appropriate limit value (or target value in the case of ozone). The fixed measurements that have to be selected for comparison with modelling results shall be representative of the scale covered by the model.\nThe uncertainty for objective estimation is defined as the maximum deviation of the measured and calculated concentration levels, over the period considered, by the limit value (or target value in the case of ozone), without taking into account the timing of the events.\nThe requirements for minimum data capture and time coverage do not include losses of data due to the regular calibration or the normal maintenance of the instrumentation.\nB.   Results of air quality assessment\nThe following information shall be compiled for zones or agglomerations within which sources other than measurement are employed to supplement information from measurement or as the sole means of air quality assessment:\nâ€”\na description of assessment activities carried out,\nâ€”\nthe specific methods used, with references to descriptions of the method,\nâ€”\nthe sources of data and information,\nâ€”\na description of results, including uncertainties and, in particular, the extent of any area or, if relevant, the length of road within the zone or agglomeration over which concentrations exceed any limit value, target value or long-term objective plus margin of tolerance, if applicable, and of any area within which concentrations exceed the upper assessment threshold or the lower assessment threshold,\nâ€”\nthe population potentially exposed to levels in excess of any limit value for protection of human health.\nC.   Quality assurance for ambient air quality assessment: data validation\n1.   To ensure accuracy of measurements and compliance with the data quality objectives laid down in Section A, the appropriate competent authorities and bodies designated pursuant to Article 3 shall ensure the following:\nâ€”\nthat all measurements undertaken in relation to the assessment of ambient air quality pursuant to Articles 6 and 9 are traceable in accordance with the requirements set out in Section 5.6.2.2 of the ISO/IEC 17025:2005,\nâ€”\nthat institutions operating networks and individual stations have an established quality assurance and quality control system which provides for regular maintenance to assure the accuracy of measuring devices,\nâ€”\nthat a quality assurance/quality control process is established for the process of data collection and reporting and that institutions appointed for this task actively participate in the related Community-wide quality assurance programmes,\nâ€”\nthat the national laboratories, when appointed by the appropriate competent authority or body designated pursuant to Article 3, that are taking part in Community-wide intercomparisons covering pollutants regulated in this Directive, are accredited according to EN/ISO 17025 by 2010 for the reference methods referred to in Annex VI. These laboratories shall be involved in the coordination on Member States territory of the Community wide quality assurance programmes to be organised by the Commission and shall also coordinate, on the national level, the appropriate realisation of reference methods and the demonstration of equivalence of non-reference methods.\n2.   All reported data under Article 27 shall be deemed to be valid except data flagged as provisional.\n(1)  Member States may apply random measurements instead of continuous measurements for benzene, lead and particulate matter if they can demonstrate to the Commission that the uncertainty, including the uncertainty due to random sampling, meets the quality objective of 25 % and the time coverage is still larger than the minimum time coverage for indicative measurements. Random sampling must be evenly distributed over the year in order to avoid skewing of results. The uncertainty due to random sampling may be determined by the procedure laid down in ISO 11222 (2002) â€˜Air Quality â€” Determination of the Uncertainty of the Time Average of Air Quality Measurementsâ€™. If random measurements are used to assess the requirements of the PM10 limit value, the 90,4 percentile (to be lower than or equal to 50 Âµg/m3) should be evaluated instead of the number of exceedances, which is highly influenced by data coverage.\n(2)  Distributed over the year to be representative of various conditions for climate and traffic.\n(3)  One day's measurement a week at random, evenly distributed over the year, or eight weeks evenly distributed over the year.\n(4)  One measurement a week at random, evenly distributed over the year, or eight weeks evenly distributed over the year.\nANNEX II\nDetermination of requirements for assessment of concentrations of sulphur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide and oxides of nitrogen, particulate matter (PM10 and PM2,5), lead, benzene and carbon monoxide in ambient air within a zone or agglomeration\nA.

An assessment threshold shall be deemed to have been exceeded if it has been exceeded during at least three separate years out of those previous five years.\nWhere fewer than five yearsâ€™ data are available, Member States may combine measurement campaigns of short duration during the period of the year and at locations likely to be typical of the highest pollution levels with results obtained from information from emission inventories and modelling to determine exceedances of the upper and lower assessment thresholds.\n(1)  The upper assessment threshold and the lower assessment threshold for PM2,5 do not apply to the measurements to assess compliance with the PM2,5 exposure reduction target for the protection of human health.\nANNEX III\nAssessment of ambient air quality and location of sampling points for the measurement of sulphur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide and oxides of nitrogen, particulate matter (PM10 and PM2,5), lead, benzene and carbon monoxide in ambient air\nA.   General\nAmbient air quality shall be assessed in all zones and agglomerations in accordance with the following criteria:\n1.   Ambient air quality shall be assessed at all locations except those listed in paragraph 2, in accordance with the criteria established by Sections B and C for the location of sampling points for fixed measurement. The principles established by Sections B and C shall also apply in so far as they are relevant in identifying the specific locations in which concentration of the relevant pollutants are established where ambient air quality is assessed by indicative measurement or modelling.\n2.   Compliance with the limit values directed at the protection of human health shall not be assessed at the following locations:\n(a)\nany locations situated within areas where members of the public do not have access and there is no fixed habitation;\n(b)\nin accordance with Article 2(1), on factory premises or at industrial installations to which all relevant provisions concerning health and safety at work apply;\n(c)\non the carriageway of roads; and on the central reservations of roads except where there is normally pedestrian access to the central reservation.\nB.   Macroscale siting of sampling points\n1.   Protection of human health\n(a)\nSampling points directed at the protection of human health shall be sited in such a way as to provide data on the following:\nâ€”\nthe areas within zones and agglomerations where the highest concentrations occur to which the population is likely to be directly or indirectly exposed for a period which is significant in relation to the averaging period of the limit value(s),\nâ€”\nlevels in other areas within the zones and agglomerations which are representative of the exposure of the general population,\n(b)\nSampling points shall in general be sited in such a way as to avoid measuring very small micro-environments in their immediate vicinity, which means that a sampling point must be sited in such a way that the air sampled is representative of air quality for a street segment no less than 100 m length at traffic-orientated sites and at least 250 m Ã— 250 m at industrial sites, where feasible;\n(c)\nUrban background locations shall be located so that their pollution level is influenced by the integrated contribution from all sources upwind of the station. The pollution level should not be dominated by a single source unless such a situation is typical for a larger urban area. Those sampling points shall, as a general rule, be representative for several square kilometres;\n(d)\nWhere the objective is to assess rural background levels, the sampling point shall not be influenced by agglomerations or industrial sites in its vicinity, i.e. sites closer than five kilometres;\n(e)\nWhere contributions from industrial sources are to be assessed, at least one sampling point shall be installed downwind of the source in the nearest residential area. Where the background concentration is not known, an additional sampling point shall be situated within the main wind direction;\n(f)\nSampling points shall, where possible, also be representative of similar locations not in their immediate vicinity;\n(g)\nAccount shall be taken of the need to locate sampling points on islands where that is necessary for the protection of human health.\n2.   Protection of vegetation and natural ecosystems\nSampling points targeted at the protection of vegetation and natural ecosystems shall be sited more than 20 km away from agglomerations or more than 5 km away from other built-up areas, industrial installations or motorways or major roads with traffic counts of more than 50 000 vehicles per day, which means that a sampling point must be sited in such a way that the air sampled is representative of air quality in a surrounding area of at least 1 000 km2. A Member State may provide for a sampling point to be sited at a lesser distance or to be representative of air quality in a less extended area, taking account of geographical conditions or of the opportunities to protect particularly vulnerable areas.\nAccount shall be taken of the need to assess air quality on islands.\nC.   Microscale siting of sampling points\nIn so far as is practicable, the following shall apply:\nâ€”\nthe flow around the inlet sampling probe shall be unrestricted (free in an arc of at least 270Â°) without any obstructions affecting the airflow in the vicinity of the sampler (normally some metres away from buildings, balconies, trees and other obstacles and at least 0,5 m from the nearest building in the case of sampling points representing air quality at the building line),\nâ€”\nin general, the inlet sampling point shall be between 1,5 m (the breathing zone) and 4 m above the ground. Higher positions (up to 8 m) may be necessary in some circumstances. Higher siting may also be appropriate if the station is representative of a large area,\nâ€”\nthe inlet probe shall not be positioned in the immediate vicinity of sources in order to avoid the direct intake of emissions unmixed with ambient air,\nâ€”\nthe sampler's exhaust outlet shall be positioned so that recirculation of exhaust air to the sampler inlet is avoided,\nâ€”\nfor all pollutants, traffic-orientated sampling probes shall be at least 25 m from the edge of major junctions and no more than 10 m from the kerbside.,\nThe following factors may also be taken into account:\nâ€”\ninterfering sources,\nâ€”\nsecurity,\nâ€”\naccess,\nâ€”\navailability of electrical power and telephone communications,\nâ€”\nvisibility of the site in relation to its surroundings,\nâ€”\nsafety of the public and operators,\nâ€”\nthe desirability of co-locating sampling points for different pollutants,\nâ€”\nplanning requirements.,\nD.   Documentation and review of site selection\nThe site-selection procedures shall be fully documented at the classification stage by such means as compass-point photographs of the surrounding area and a detailed map. Sites shall be reviewed at regular intervals with repeated documentation to ensure that selection criteria remain valid over time.\nANNEX IV\nMEASUREMENTS AT RURAL BACKGROUND LOCATIONS IRRESPECTIVE OF CONCENTRATION\nA.   Objectives\nThe main objectives of such measurements are to ensure that adequate information is made available on levels in the background. This information is essential to judge the enhanced levels in more polluted areas (such as urban background, industry related locations, traffic related locations), assess the possible contribution from long-range transport of air pollutants, support source apportionment analysis and for the understanding of specific pollutants such as particulate matter. It is also essential for the increased use of modelling also in urban areas.\nB.   Substances\nMeasurement of PM2,5 must include at least the total mass concentration and concentrations of appropriate compounds to characterise its chemical composition. At least the list of chemical species given below shall be included.\nSO4\n2â€“\nNa+\nNH4\n+\nCa2+\nelemental carbon (EC)\nNO3\nâ€“\nK+\nClâ€“\nMg2+\norganic carbon (OC)\nC.

Point sources\nFor the assessment of pollution in the vicinity of point sources, the number of sampling points for fixed measurement shall be calculated taking into account emission densities, the likely distribution patterns of ambient-air pollution and the potential exposure of the population.\nB.   Minimum number of sampling points for fixed measurement to assess compliance with the PM2,5 exposure reduction target for the protection of human health\nOne sampling point per million inhabitants summed over agglomerations and additional urban areas in excess of 100 000 inhabitants shall be operated for this purpose.

Minimum number of sampling points for fixed measurements to assess compliance with critical levels for the protection of vegetation in zones other than agglomerations\nIf maximum concentrations exceed the upper assessment threshold\nIf maximum concentrations are between upper and lower assessment threshold\n1 station every 20 000 km2\n1 station every 40 000 km2\nIn island zones the number of sampling points for fixed measurement should be calculated taking into account the likely distribution patterns of ambient-air pollution and the potential exposure of vegetation.\n(1)  For nitrogen dioxide, particulate matter, benzene and carbon monoxide: to include at least one urban background monitoring station and one traffic-orientated station provided this does not increase the number of sampling points. For these pollutants, the total number of urban-background stations and the total number of traffic oriented stations in a Member State required under Section A(1) shall not differ by more than a factor of 2. Sampling points with exceedances of the limit value for PM10 within the last three years shall be maintained, unless a relocation is necessary owing to special circumstances, in particular spatial development.\n(2)  Where PM2,5 and PM10 are measured in accordance with Article 8 at the same monitoring station, these shall count as two separate sampling points. The total number of PM2,5 and PM10 sampling points in a Member State required under Section A(1) shall not differ by more than a factor of 2, and the number of PM2,5 sampling points in the urban background of agglomerations and urban areas shall meet the requirements under Section B of Annex V.\nANNEX VI\nReference methods for assessment of concentrations of sulphur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide and oxides of nitrogen, particulate matter (PM10 and PM2,5), lead, benzene, carbon monoxide, and ozone\nA.

A Member State may use any other method which it can demonstrate gives results equivalent to any of the methods referred to in Section A or, in the case of particulate matter, any other method which the Member State concerned can demonstrate displays a consistent relationship to the reference method. In that event the results achieved by that method must be corrected to produce results equivalent to those that would have been achieved by using the reference method.\n2.   The Commission may require the Member States to prepare and submit a report on the demonstration of equivalence in accordance with paragraph 1.\n3.   When assessing the acceptability of the report mentioned in paragraph 2, the Commission will make reference to its guidance on the demonstration of equivalence (to be published). Where Member States have been using interim factors to approximate equivalence, the latter shall be confirmed and/or amended with reference to the Commission's guidance.\n4.   Member States should ensure that whenever appropriate, the correction is also applied retroactively to past measurement data in order to achieve better data comparability.\nC.   Standardisation\nFor gaseous pollutants the volume must be standardised at a temperature of 293 K and an atmospheric pressure of 101,3 kPa.

In particular, the Commission notes the importance attributed by the European Parliament and the Member States in Article 22(4) and recital 16 to Community measures for the abatement of air pollutant emissions at source.\nThe Commission recognises the need to reduce the emissions of harmful air pollutants if significant progress is to be delivered towards the objectives established in the Sixth Environmental Action Programme. The Commission's communication on a thematic strategy on air pollution sets out a significant number of possible Community measures. Significant progress on these and other measures has been made since the adoption of the strategy:\nâ€”\nthe Council and Parliament have already adopted new legislation limiting the exhaust emissions of light duty vehicles,\nâ€”\nthe Commission has adopted a proposal for new legislation to improve the effectiveness of Community industrial emissions legislation including intensive agricultural installations and measures to tackle smaller scale industrial combustion sources,\nâ€”\nthe Commission has adopted a proposal for new legislation limiting the exhaust emissions of engines installed in heavy duty vehicles,\nâ€”\nin 2008 the Commission foresees new legislative proposals that would:\nâ€”\nfurther reduce the Member Statesâ€™ permitted national emissions of key pollutants,\nâ€”\nreduce emissions associated with refuelling of petrol cars at service stations,\nâ€”\naddress the sulphur content of fuels including marine fuels,\nâ€”\npreparatory work is also underway to investigate the feasibility of:\nâ€”\nimproving the eco-design and reducing the emissions of domestic boilers and water heaters,\nâ€”\nreducing the solvent content of paints, varnishes and vehicle refinishing products,\nâ€”\nreducing the exhaust emissions of non-road mobile machinery and thereby maximise the benefit of lower sulphur non-road fuels already proposed by the Commission,\nâ€”\nThe Commission also continues to push for substantial emissions reductions from ships at the International Maritime Organisation and it is committed to bringing forward proposals for Community measures should the IMO fail to deliver sufficiently ambitious proposals as foreseen in 2008.\nThe Commission is, however, committed to the aims of its Better Regulation initiative and the need for proposals to be underpinned by a comprehensive assessment of the impacts and benefits. In this regard and in accordance with the Treaty establishing the European Community, the Commission will continue to evaluate the need to bring forward new legislative proposals but reserves its right to decide if and when it would be appropriate to present any such proposal.\nSTATEMENT BY THE NETHERLANDS\nThe Netherlands has always supported the development of ambitious and effective European policy on air quality and will continue to do so in the future. It is, therefore, happy with the compromise agreed by the Council and the European Parliament and compliments the Parliament, the Commission and the Presidency on the results achieved. The new Directive on ambient air quality marks significant progress for both the environment and public health.\nAs the Netherlands pointed out when the Common Position was drawn up, the air quality in our country is strongly influenced by transboundary developments and will therefore benefit enormously from an effective European approach. The Netherlandsâ€™ main concern has been that the Directive should contain a balanced package of European and national measures, as well as realistic time limits to achieve the air quality targets. Only then will Member States be able to achieve the ambitious targets that have been set.\nThe Netherlands is pleased with the Commission's statement that it will present Community measures in good time. Timely, EU-wide compliance with the air quality standards will depend on sound European policy tackling pollution at the source. The Netherlands would especially point to the lack of data and prevailing uncertainties about emissions and concentrations of fine particulates (PM2,5). It will of course make every effort to meet the objectives of the Directive by the target date. On the basis of the knowledge currently at our command, this will largely be feasible. The Dutch government is developing a National Air Quality Cooperation Programme to tackle locations where emission ceilings are persistently exceeded, so that, there too, air quality standards may be met by the target date.\nThe Netherlands is pleased that the Council and the European Parliament concluded their second reading in time for the Directive to take effect as of early 2008. This is essential for our own national programme, as well as actions in the countries around us. The Netherlands will work hard to ensure that the national cooperation programme and all local and regional measures are sufficient.", "summary": "Cleaner air for Europe\nCleaner air for Europe\nTo protect human health and the environment, the air we breathe should be as clean as possible. This means taking active measures to monitor the purity of ambient (or outside) air and removing any pollutants.\nACT\n                  \nDirective 2008/50/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 May 2008 on ambient air quality and cleaner air for Europe.\nSUMMARY\nWHAT DOES THE DIRECTIVE DO?\n                     \nIt establishes air quality objectives, including ambitious, cost-effective targets for improving human health and environmental quality up to 2020. It also specifies ways of assessing these and of taking any corrective action if the standards are not met. It provides for the public to be kept informed.\nKEY POINTS\n                     \nThis directive merges most of existing air quality legislation into a single directive, and includes the following key elements.\nThresholds, limit values and target values are set to assess each pollutant covered by the directive: sulphur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, particulate matter, lead, benzene and carbon monoxide.\nNational authorities designate specific bodies to carry out these tasks using data collected at selected sampling points.\nWhere pollution levels in any particular area are higher than the thresholds, air quality plans must be introduced to correct the situation.
