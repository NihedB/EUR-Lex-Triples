The requested authority shall inform the Joint Committee of the grounds for the refusal.\n4.   The provision of information may be refused where it would lead to the disclosure of a commercial, industrial or professional secret or of a commercial process, or of information whose disclosure would be contrary to public policy.\n5.   Paragraphs 2, 3 and 4 should on no account be interpreted as authorising the requested authority to refuse to supply information on the sole grounds that this information is held by a bank, other financial institution, nominee or person acting in an agency or fiduciary capacity or because it relates to ownership interests in a legal person.\n6.   The requested authority shall inform the requesting authority of the grounds for refusing a request for assistance.\nArticle 18\nFeedback\nWhere a competent authority provides information pursuant to Article 7 or 10, it may request the competent authority which receives the information to give feedback thereon.

The requested authority shall inform the applicant authority of the grounds for refusing a request for information.\nArticle 23\nExchange of information without prior request\nWhere a refund of taxes or duties relates to a person established or resident in another state in whose territory this Agreement applies, the state from which the refund is to be made may inform the state of establishment or residence of the pending refund.\nArticle 24\nPresence in administrative offices and participation in administrative enquiries\n1.

If the result of contestation is subsequently favourable to the debtor, the applicant authority shall be liable for reimbursing any sums recovered, together with any compensation due, in accordance with the laws in force in the state of the requested authority.\nIf a mutual agreement procedure has been initiated between the states of the applicant and requested authorities, and the outcome of the procedure may affect the claim in respect of which assistance has been requested, the recovery measures shall be suspended or stopped until that procedure has been terminated, unless it concerns a case of immediate urgency because of fraud or insolvency. If the recovery measures are suspended or stopped, the second subparagraph shall apply.\nArticle 32\nAmendment or withdrawal of the request for recovery assistance\n1.   The applicant authority shall inform the requested authority immediately of any subsequent amendment to its request for recovery or of the withdrawal of its request, indicating the reasons for amendment or withdrawal.\n2.   If the amendment of the request is caused by a decision of the competent body referred to in Article 31(1), the applicant authority shall communicate this decision together with a revised uniform instrument permitting enforcement in the state of the requested authority. The requested authority shall then proceed with further recovery measures on the basis of the revised instrument.\nRecovery or precautionary measures already taken on the basis of the original uniform instrument permitting enforcement in the state of the requested authority may be continued on the basis of the revised instrument, unless the amendment of the request is due to invalidity of the initial instrument permitting enforcement in the state of the applicant authority or the original uniform instrument permitting enforcement in the state of the requested authority.\nArticles 29 and 31 shall apply in relation to the revised instrument.\nArticle 33\nRequest for precautionary measures\n1.   At the request of the applicant authority, the requested authority shall take precautionary measures, if allowed by its national law and in accordance with its administrative practices, to ensure recovery where a claim or the instrument permitting enforcement in the state of the applicant authority is contested at the time when the request is made, or where the claim is not yet the subject of an instrument permitting enforcement in the state of the applicant authority, in so far as precautionary measures are possible in a similar situation under the law and administrative practices of the state of the applicant authority.\nThe document drawn up for permitting precautionary measures in the state of the applicant authority and relating to the claim for which mutual assistance is requested, if any, shall be attached to the request for precautionary measures in the state of the requested authority. This document shall not be subject to any act of recognition, supplementing or replacement in the state of the requested authority.\n2.   The request for precautionary measures may be accompanied by other documents relating to the claim.\nArticle 34\nRules governing the request for precautionary measures\nIn order to give effect to Article 33, Articles 27(2), 30(1) and (2), 31 and 32 shall apply mutatis mutandis.\nArticle 35\nLimits to the requested authority's obligations\n1.   The requested authority shall not be obliged to grant the assistance provided for in Articles 27 to 33 if recovery of the claim would, because of the situation of the debtor, create serious economic or social difficulties in the state of the requested authority, in so far as the laws, regulations and administrative practices in force in that state allow such exception for national claims.\n2.   The requested authority shall not be obliged to grant the assistance provided for in Articles 22 and 24 to 33 if the initial request for assistance pursuant to Article 22, 24, 25, 27 or 33 is made in respect of claims which are more than 5 years old, dating from the due date of the claim in the state of the applicant authority to the date of the initial request for assistance.\nHowever, in cases where the claim or the initial instrument permitting enforcement in the state of the applicant authority is contested, the 5-year period shall be deemed to begin from the moment when it is established in the state of the applicant authority that the claim or the instrument permitting enforcement may no longer be contested.\nMoreover, in cases where a postponement of the payment or instalment plan has been granted by the state of the applicant authority, the 5-year period shall be deemed to begin from the moment when the entire payment period has come to its end.\nHowever, in those cases the requested authority shall not be obliged to grant assistance in respect of claims which are more than 10 years old, dating from the due date of the claim in the state of the applicant authority.\n3.   A state shall not be obliged to grant assistance if the total amount of the claims covered by this Agreement, for which assistance is requested, is less than EUR 1 500.\n4.   The requested authority shall inform the applicant authority of the grounds for refusing a request for assistance.\nArticle 36\nQuestions on limitation\n1.   Questions concerning periods of limitation shall be governed solely by the laws in force in the state of the applicant authority.\n2.   In relation to the suspension, interruption or prolongation of periods of limitation, any steps taken in the recovery of claims by or on behalf of the requested authority in pursuance of a request for assistance which have the effect of suspending, interrupting or prolonging the period of limitation according to the laws in force in the state of the requested authority shall have the same effect in the state of the applicant authority, on condition that the corresponding effect is provided for under the law of the latter state.\nIf suspension, interruption or prolongation of the period of limitation is not possible under the laws in force in the state of the requested authority, any steps taken in the recovery of claims by or on behalf of the requested authority in pursuance of a request for assistance which, if they had been carried out by or on behalf of the applicant authority in its own state, would have had the effect of suspending, interrupting or prolonging the period of limitation according to the laws of that state shall be deemed to have been taken in the latter state, in so far as that effect is concerned.\nThe first and second subparagraphs shall not affect the right of the state of the applicant authority to take measures which have the effect of suspending, interrupting or prolonging the period of limitation in accordance with the laws in force in that state.\n3.   The applicant authority and the requested authority shall inform each other of any action which interrupts, suspends or prolongs the limitation period of the claim for which the recovery or precautionary measures were requested, or which may have this effect.\nArticle 37\nCosts\n1.   In addition to the amounts referred to in Article 30(5), the requested authority shall seek to recover from the person concerned and retain the costs linked to the recovery that it incurred, in accordance with the laws and regulations of its state.\n2.   The states shall renounce all claims on each other for the reimbursement of costs arising from any mutual assistance they grant each other pursuant to this Agreement.\nHowever, where recovery creates a specific problem, concerns a very large amount in costs or relates to organised crime, the applicant and requested authorities may agree reimbursement arrangements specific to the cases in question.\n3.   Notwithstanding paragraph 2, the state of the applicant authority shall be liable to the state of the requested authority for any costs and any losses incurred as a result of actions held to be unfounded, as far as either the substance of the claim or the validity of the instrument permitting enforcement and/or precautionary measures issued by the applicant authority are concerned.\nCHAPTER 4\nGeneral rules governing all types of recovery assistance requests\nArticle 38\nUse of languages\n1.   All requests for assistance, standard forms for notification and uniform instruments permitting enforcement in the state of the requested authority shall be sent in, or shall be accompanied by a translation into, the official language, or one of the official languages, of the state of the requested authority. The fact that certain parts thereof are written in a language other than the official language, or one of the official languages, of that state, shall not affect their validity or the validity of the procedure, in so far as that other language is one agreed between the states concerned.\n2.   The documents for which notification is requested pursuant to Article 25 may be sent to the requested authority in an official language of the state of the applicant authority.\n3.   Where a request is accompanied by documents other than those referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2, the requested authority may, where necessary, require from the applicant authority a translation of such documents into the official language, or one of the official languages of the state of the requested authority, or into any other language agreed between the states concerned.\nArticle 39\nStatistical data\nBy 30 June each year, the Parties shall communicate by electronic means to the Joint Committee a list of statistical data on the application of this Title.\nArticle 40\nStandard forms and means of communication\n1.

As far as possible, these forms shall also be used for any further communication with regard to the request.\nThe uniform instrument permitting enforcement in the state of the requested authority, the document permitting precautionary measures in the state of the applicant authority and the other documents referred to in Articles 29 and 33 shall also be sent by electronic means, unless this is impracticable for technical reasons.\nWhere appropriate, the standard forms may be accompanied by reports, statements and any other documents, or certified true copies or extracts thereof, which shall also be sent by electronic means, unless this is impracticable for technical reasons.\nStandard forms and communication by electronic means may also be used for the exchange of information pursuant to Article 23.\n2.   Paragraph 1 shall not apply to the information and documentation obtained through the presence of officials in administrative offices in another state or through participation in administrative enquiries in another state, in accordance with Article 24.\n3.   If communication is not made by electronic means or with use of standard forms, this shall not affect the validity of the information obtained or of the measures taken in the execution of a request for assistance.\n4.   The electronic communication network and the standard forms adopted for the implementation of this Agreement may also be used for recovery assistance regarding other claims than the claims referred to in Article 2(1)(b), if such recovery assistance is possible under other bilateral or multilateral legally binding instruments on administrative cooperation between the states.\n5.   As long and in so far as no detailed rules are adopted by the Joint Committee for the implementation of this Title, the competent authorities shall make use of the rules, including the standard forms, currently adopted for the implementation of Council Directive 2010/24/EU (5), whereby the term ‘Member State’ will be interpreted as including Norway.\nNotwithstanding the previous subparagraph, the state of the requested authority shall use the euro currency for the transfer of the recovered amounts to the state of the applicant authority, unless otherwise agreed between the states concerned. States where the official currency is not the euro shall agree with Norway on the currency for the transfer of the recovered amounts and notify the Joint Committee thereof.\nTITLE IV\nIMPLEMENTATION AND APPLICATION\nArticle 41\nJoint Committee\n1.

administrative cooperation in the field of value-added tax (VAT)\nSUMMARY OF:\nAgreement between the EU and Norway on administrative cooperation, combating fraud and recovery of claims in the field of VAT\nDecision (EU) 2017/2381 — signing, on behalf of the EU, of the Agreement between the EU and Norway on administrative cooperation, combating fraud and recovery of claims in the field of VAT\nDecision (EU) 2018/1089 — conclusion, on behalf of the EU, of the Agreement between the EU and Norway on administrative cooperation, combating fraud and recovery of claims in the field of VAT\nWHAT IS THE AIM OF THE AGREEMENT AND THE DECISIONS?\nThe agreement establishes administrative cooperation between the EU and Norway to: ensure compliance with value added tax (VAT) legislation in their 2 jurisdictions;protect each signatory’s VAT revenue.\nDecision (EU) 2017/2381 marks the signing and Decision (EU) 2018/1089 gives the EU’s formal approval to the agreement.\nKEY POINTS\n              \nThe agreement provides for:\ninformation-sharing to help the correct assessment and application of VAT, and to tackle fraud;\nrecovery of VAT claims, including any administrative penalties, fines, fees, surcharges, interest and costs linked to the claims.\nEU countries and Norway:\nestablish: an authority responsible for applying the agreement;2 central liaison offices: one for administrative cooperation, the other for helping recover VAT revenue;\ntreat information they receive as confidential, but may: disclose this to individuals and authorities applying VAT laws;use it to assess and enforce, including recovery and precautionary measures of other taxes and compulsory social security contributions, and apply administrative or criminal sanctions;\naccept other officials on their premises for information-sharing and to attend administrative enquiries as observers;\nagree to carry out simultaneous controls when these are considered more effective than individual ones;\nprovide the Joint Committee (see below for further details about the Committee) with annual statistical data by 30 June.\nCountries provide information, using a standard form and may ask for feedback:\non request from another authority, normally within 3 months, but one month if they already have it;\nspontaneously where: information they hold is essential for another to apply its tax system effectively;they believe VAT fraud has taken place, or is likely, in another country;there is a risk of tax loss in the other country;\nautomatically for categories determined by the Joint Committee.\nCountries may refuse to provide information if this would lead to:\nnew obligations on people liable for VAT;\ndisproportionate burdens on their administration;\ndisclosure of a commercial, industrial or professional secret or be contrary to public policy; or\nthe requesting authority has not exhausted its usual sources of information.\nCountries help each other to recover VAT claims by:\nproviding relevant information;\ncarrying out necessary administrative enquiries;\nallowing a partner’s officials to be present in their offices, administrative enquiries and court proceedings;\nnotifying addressees of all documents forwarded by another authority;\nrecovering a claim subject to an enforcement order or taking any necessary precautionary

economic or social difficulties in their jurisdiction;is more than 5 years old, or 10 years under certain conditions;is below €1,500.\nDisputes over a country’s initial claim and enforcement order are handled within its jurisdiction, those over the way another country complies with that request are handled by its legal system.\nThe agreement enables Norway to participate in Eurofisc, a network of tax administration anti-fraud experts.\nThe agreement creates a Joint Committee of representatives of the EU and Norway to ensure its proper functioning and implementation. This:\nmakes recommendations and adopts decisions;\ndecides on new categories for automatic information exchange;\nestablishes various practical arrangements;\ntakes decisions by unanimity;\nmeets at least once every 2 years;\nhandles any disputes on interpretation or application.\nThe agreement is valid indefinitely. It may be terminated 6 months after either party notifies in writing its intention to do so.\nDATE OF ENTRY INTO FORCE\n              \nThe agreement entered into force on 1 September 2018.\nBACKGROUND\nNorway is the first country with which the EU has a VAT cooperation agreement.
