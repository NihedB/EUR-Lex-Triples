An authorisation procedure should therefore be established at Community level.(6) The chemical composition of smoke is complex and depends among other things on the types of wood used, the method used for developing smoke, the water content of the wood and the temperature and oxygen concentration during smoke generation. Smoked foods in general give rise to health concerns, especially with respect to the possible presence of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Because smoke flavourings are produced from smoke which is subjected to fractionation and purification processes, the use of smoke flavourings is generally considered to be of less health concern than the traditional smoking process. However, the possibility of wider applications of smoke flavourings in comparison to conventional smoking has to be taken into account in safety assessments.(7) This Regulation covers smoke flavourings as defined in Directive 88/388/EEC. The production of these smoke flavourings starts with the condensation of smoke. The condensed smoke is normally separated by physical processes into a water-based primary smoke condensate, a water-insoluble high-density tar phase and a water-insoluble oily phase. The water-insoluble oily phase is a by-product and unsuitable for the production of smoke flavourings. The primary smoke condensates and fractions of the water-insoluble high-density tar phase, the \"primary tar fractions\", are purified to remove components of smoke which are most harmful to human health. They may then be suitable for use as such in or on foods or for the production of derived smoke flavourings made by further appropriate physical processing such as extraction procedures, distillation, concentration by evaporation, absorption or membrane separation and the addition of food ingredients, other flavourings, food additives or solvents, without prejudice to more specific Community legislation.(8) The Scientific Committee on Food concluded that because of the wide physical and chemical differences in smoke flavourings used for flavouring food, it is not possible to design a common approach to their safety assessment and, accordingly, toxicological evaluation should focus on the safety of individual smoke condensates. Following this advice, this Regulation should provide for the scientific evaluation of primary smoke condensates and primary tar fractions, hereinafter referred to as \"primary products\", in terms of the safety of their use as such and/or for the production of derived smoke flavourings intended for use in or on foods.(9) As regards conditions of production, this Regulation reflects the findings set out by the Scientific Committee on Food in its report on smoke flavourings of 25 June 1993(5), in which it specified various production conditions and the information necessary to evaluate smoke flavourings used or intended for use in or on foods. That report was based, in turn, on the report of the Council of Europe on health aspects of using smoke flavours as food ingredients(6). It also contains a non-exhaustive list of types of wood which may be regarded as an indicative list of woods suitable for the production of smoke flavourings.(10) Provision should be made for the establishment, on the basis of the safety assessment, of a list of primary products authorised for use as such in or on foods and/or for the production of smoke flavourings for use in or on foods within the Community. That list should clearly describe the primary products, specifying conditions of their uses and the dates from which the authorisations are valid.(11) In order to ensure harmonisation, safety assessments should be carried out by the European Food Safety Authority (\"the Authority\"), established by Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 28 January 2002 laying down the general principles and requirements of food law, establishing the European Food Safety Authority and laying down procedures in matters of food safety(7).(12) The safety assessment of a specific primary product should be followed by a risk-management decision as to whether the product should be entered on the Community list of authorised primary products. That decision should be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure so as to ensure close cooperation between the Commission and the Member States.(13) It is appropriate that the person (\"the applicant\") who intends to place on the market primary products or derived smoke flavourings should submit all the information necessary for the safety assessment. The applicant should also propose a validated method of sampling and detection for the primary products to be used for control of compliance with the provisions of this Regulation. If necessary, the Commission should adopt quality criteria for those analytical methods after having consulted the Authority for scientific and technical assistance.(14) Since many smoke flavourings are already on the market in the Member States, provision should be made to ensure that the transition to a Community authorisation procedure is smooth and does not disturb the existing smoke flavourings market. Sufficient time should be allowed for the applicant to make available to the Authority the information necessary for the safety assessment of these products. Therefore, a certain time period, hereinafter referred to as the \"first phase\", should be fixed during which the information for existing primary products should be submitted by the applicant to the Authority. Applications for authorisation of new primary products may also be submitted during the first phase. The Authority should evaluate without delay all applications for existing as well as new primary products for which sufficient information has been submitted during the first phase.(15) The Community positive list should be established by the Commission after the completion of the safety assessment of all primary products for which sufficient information was submitted during the first phase. In order to ensure fair and equal conditions for all applicants, this initial establishment of the list should be done in a single step. After the initial establishment of the list of authorised primary products, it should be possible for additional primary products to be added thereto by decision of the Commission, following the safety assessment by the Authority.(16) Whenever the evaluation by the Authority indicates that an existing smoke flavouring already on the market in the Member States constitutes a serious risk to human health, this product should be removed from the market without delay.(17) Articles 53 and 54 of Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 establish procedures for taking emergency measures in relation to food of Community origin or imported from a third country. They allow the Commission to adopt such measures in situations where food is likely to constitute a serious risk to human health, animal health or the environment and where such risk cannot be contained satisfactorily by measures taken by the Member State(s) concerned.(18) It is necessary that food business operators using primary products or derived smoke flavourings be required to establish procedures in accordance with which it is possible, at all stages of placing a primary product or derived smoke flavouring on the market, to verify whether it is authorised by this Regulation and whether the conditions of use are respected.(19) In order to ensure equal access of existing and new primary products to the market, an interim period should be established during which national measures continue to apply in the Member States.(20) Provision should be made for the Annexes to this Regulation to be adapted to scientific and technical progress.(21) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Regulation should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission(8),HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:Article 1Subject matter1.

Smoke is generated from the wood referred to in Article 5(1). Herbs, spices, twigs of juniper and twigs, needles and cones of picea may be added if they are free of residues of intentional or unintentional chemical treatment or if they comply with more specific Community legislation. The source material is subjected to controlled burning, dry distillation or treatment with superheated steam in a controlled oxygen environment with a maximum temperature of 600 °C.2. The smoke is condensed. Water and/or, without prejudice to other Community legislation, solvents may be added to achieve phase separation. Physical processes may be used for isolation, fractionation and/or purification to obtain the following phases:(a) a water-based \"primary smoke condensate\" mainly containing carboxylic acids, carbonylic and phenolic compounds, having a maximum content of:>TABLE>(b) a water-insoluble high-density tar phase which during the phase separation will precipitate, and which cannot be used as such for the production of smoke flavourings but only after appropriate physical processing to obtain fractions from this water-insoluble tar phase which are low in polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, already defined as \"primary tar fractions\", having a maximum content of:>TABLE>(c) a \"water-insoluble oily phase\".If no phase separation has occurred during or after the condensation, the smoke condensate obtained must be regarded as a water-insoluble high-density tar phase, and must be processed by appropriate physical processing to obtain primary tar fractions which stay within the specified limits.ANNEX IIInformation necessary for the scientific evaluation of primary productsThe information should be compiled in accordance with the guidelines referred to in Article 7(4) and should be submitted as described therein. Without prejudice to Article 8(2), the following information should be included in the application for authorisation referred to in Article 7:1. the type of wood used for the production of the primary product;2. detailed information on the production methods of the primary products and the further processing in the production of derived smoke flavourings;3. the qualitative and quantitative chemical composition of the primary product and the characterisation of the portion which has not been identified. Of major importance are the chemical specifications of the primary product and information on the stability and the degree of variability of the chemical composition. The portions which have not been identified, i.e. the amount of substances whose chemical structure is not known, should be as small as possible and should be characterised by appropriate analytical methods, e.g. chromatographic or spectrometric methods;4. a validated analytical method for sampling, identification and characterisation of the primary product;5. information on the intended use levels in or on specific foods or food categories;6. toxicological data following the advice of the Scientific Committee on Food given in its report on smoke flavourings of 25 June 1993 or its latest update.", "summary": "Smoke flavourings — safety assessment\nSmoke flavourings — safety assessment\nSUMMARY OF:\nRegulation (EC) No 2065/2003 — smoke flavourings for foods\nWHAT IS THE AIM OF THIS REGULATION?\n              \nIt sets EU-wide rules on authorising and using smoke flavourings in foods.\nKEY POINTS\n              \nThe regulation introduces a safety assessment and authorisation procedure for primary smoke condensates* and primary tar fractions* which can be used in and on foods and/or for the production of derived smoke flavourings*.\nThe primary products* for which no health concern is expressed during evaluation are then included in a list of authorised products under specific conditions of use.\nAuthorisations are granted for a period of 10 years after which they have to be renewed.
