{"celex_id": "32009R0662", "reference": "31.7.2009\nEN\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\nL 200/25\nREGULATION (EC) No 662/2009 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL\nof 13 July 2009\nestablishing a procedure for the negotiation and conclusion of agreements between Member States and third countries on particular matters concerning the law applicable to contractual and non-contractual obligations\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Articles 61(c), 65 and 67(5) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the Commission,\nActing in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty (1),\nWhereas:\n(1)\nTitle IV of Part Three of the Treaty provides the legal basis for the adoption of Community legislation in the field of judicial cooperation in civil matters.\n(2)\nJudicial cooperation in civil matters between Member States and third countries has traditionally been governed by agreements between Member States and third countries. Such agreements, of which there is a large number, often reflect special ties between a Member State and a third country and are intended to provide an adequate legal framework to meet specific needs of the parties concerned.\n(3)\nArticle 307 of the Treaty requires Member States to take all appropriate steps to eliminate any incompatibilities between the Community acquis and international agreements concluded between Member States and third countries. This may involve the need for the re-negotiation of such agreements.\n(4)\nIn order to provide an adequate legal framework to meet specific needs of a given Member State in its relations with a third country, there may also be a manifest need for the conclusion of new agreements with third countries relating to areas of civil justice that come within the purview of Title IV of Part Three of the Treaty.\n(5)\nIn its Opinion 1/03 of 7 February 2006 relating to the conclusion of the new Lugano Convention, the Court of Justice of the European Communities confirmed that the Community has acquired exclusive competence to conclude an international agreement like the Lugano Convention with third countries on matters affecting the rules laid down in Council Regulation (EC) No 44/2001 of 22 December 2000 on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters (2) (Brussels I).\n(6)\nIt is for the Community to conclude, pursuant to Article 300 of the Treaty, agreements between the Community and a third country on matters falling within the exclusive competence of the Community.\n(7)\nArticle 10 of the Treaty requires Member States to facilitate the achievement of the Community’s tasks and to abstain from any measure which could jeopardise the attainment of the objectives of the Treaty. This duty of loyal cooperation is of general application and does not depend on whether or not the Community competence is exclusive.\n(8)\nWith regard to agreements with third countries on specific civil justice issues falling within the exclusive competence of the Community, a coherent and transparent procedure should be established to authorise a Member State to amend an existing agreement or to negotiate and conclude a new agreement, in particular where the Community itself has not indicated its intention to exercise its external competence to conclude an agreement by way of an already existing mandate of negotiation or an envisaged mandate of negotiation. This procedure should be without prejudice to the exclusive competence of the Community and the provisions of Articles 300 and 307 of the Treaty. It should be regarded as an exceptional measure and should be limited in scope and in time.\n(9)\nThis Regulation should not apply if the Community has already concluded an agreement with the third country concerned on the same subject matter. Two agreements should be regarded as concerning the same subject matter only if, and to the extent that, they regulate in substance the same specific legal issues. Provisions simply stating a general intention to cooperate on such issues should not be regarded as concerning the same subject matter.\n(10)\nExceptionally, certain regional agreements between a few Member States and a few third countries, for example two or three, intended to address local situations and not open for accession to other States should also be covered by this Regulation.\n(11)\nIn order to ensure that an agreement envisaged by a Member State does not render Community law ineffective and does not undermine the proper functioning of the system established by that law, or undermine the Community’s external relations policy as decided by the Community, the Member State concerned should be required to notify the Commission of its intentions with a view to obtaining an authorisation to open or continue formal negotiations on an agreement as well as to conclude an agreement. Such notification should be given by letter or by electronic means. It should contain all relevant information and documentation enabling the Commission to assess the expected impact on Community law of the outcome of the negotiations.\n(12)\nIt should be assessed whether there is sufficient Community interest in concluding a bilateral agreement between the Community and the third country concerned or, where appropriate, in replacing an existing bilateral agreement between a Member State and a third country with a Community agreement. To that end, all Member States should be informed of any notification received by the Commission concerning an agreement envisaged by a Member State in order to allow them to demonstrate their interest in joining the initiative of the notifying Member State. If, from this exchange of information, a sufficient Community interest were to emerge, the Commission should consider proposing a negotiating mandate with a view to the conclusion of an agreement between the Community and the third country concerned.\n(13)\nIf the Commission requests additional information from a Member State in connection with its assessment as to whether that Member State should be authorised to open negotiations with a third country, such a request should not affect the time limits within which the Commission is to give a reasoned decision on the application of that Member State.\n(14)\nWhen authorising the opening of formal negotiations, the Commission should be able, if necessary, to propose negotiating guidelines or request the inclusion of particular clauses in the envisaged agreement. The Commission should be kept fully informed throughout the different stages of the negotiations as far as matters falling within the scope of this Regulation are concerned and should be allowed to participate as an observer in the negotiations as regards those matters.\n(15)\nWhen notifying the Commission of their intention to enter into negotiations with a third country, Member States should only be required to inform the Commission of elements which are of relevance for the assessment to be made by the Commission. The authorisation by the Commission and any possible negotiating guidelines or, as the case may be, the refusal by the Commission should concern only matters falling within the scope of this Regulation.\n(16)\nAll Member States should be informed of any notification to the Commission concerning envisaged or negotiated agreements and of any reasoned decision by the Commission under this Regulation. Such information should however fully comply with possible confidentiality requirements.\n(17)\nThe European Parliament, the Council and the Commission should ensure that any information identified as confidential is treated in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 30 May 2001 regarding public access to European Parliament, Council and Commission documents (3).\n(18)\nWhere the Commission, on the basis of its assessment, intends not to authorise the opening of formal negotiations or the conclusion of a negotiated agreement, it should, before giving its reasoned decision, give an opinion to the Member State concerned. In the case of refusal to authorise the conclusion of a negotiated agreement the opinion should also be submitted to the European Parliament and to the Council.\n(19)\nIn order to ensure that the negotiated agreement does not constitute an obstacle to the implementation of the Community’s external policy on judicial cooperation in civil and commercial matters, the agreement should provide either for its full or partial denunciation in the event of the conclusion of a subsequent agreement between the Community or the Community and its Member States, on the one hand, and the same third country, on the other hand, on the same subject matter, or for a direct replacement of the relevant provisions of the agreement by the provisions of such subsequent agreement.\n(20)\nProvision should be made for transitional measures to cover situations where, at the time of the entry into force of this Regulation, a Member State has already started the process of negotiating an agreement with a third country, or has completed the negotiations but has not yet expressed its consent to be bound by the agreement.\n(21)\nIn order to ensure that sufficient experience has been gained concerning the application of this Regulation, the Commission should submit a report on such application no earlier than eight years after the adoption of this Regulation. In that report, the Commission, exercising its prerogatives, should confirm the temporary nature of this Regulation or examine whether this Regulation should be replaced by a new Regulation covering the same subject matter or including also particular matters falling within the exclusive competence of the Community and governed by other Community instruments, as referred to in recital 5.\n(22)\nIf the report submitted by the Commission confirms the temporary nature of this Regulation, Member States should still be able, after the submission of the report, to notify the Commission of ongoing or already announced negotiations with a view to obtaining an authorisation to open formal negotiations.\n(23)\nIn accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve its objective.\n(24)\nIn accordance with Article 3 of the Protocol on the position of the United Kingdom and Ireland, annexed to the Treaty on European Union and to the Treaty establishing the European Community, the United Kingdom and Ireland have given notice of their wish to take part in the adoption and application of this Regulation.\n(25)\nIn accordance with Articles 1 and 2 of the Protocol on the position of Denmark, annexed to the Treaty on European Union and to the Treaty establishing the European Community, Denmark is not taking part in the adoption of this Regulation and is not bound by it or subject to its application,\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nArticle 1\nSubject matter and scope\n1.   This Regulation establishes a procedure to authorise a Member State to amend an existing agreement or to negotiate and conclude a new agreement with a third country, subject to the conditions laid down in this Regulation.\nThis procedure is without prejudice to the respective competencies of the Community and of the Member States.\n2.   This Regulation shall apply to agreements concerning particular matters falling, entirely or partly, within the scope of Regulation (EC) No 593/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 June 2008 on the law applicable to contractual obligations (Rome I) (4) and Regulation (EC) No 864/2007 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 July 2007 on the law applicable to non-contractual obligations (Rome II) (5).\n3.   This Regulation shall not apply if the Community has already concluded an agreement with the third country concerned on the same subject matter.\nArticle 2\nDefinitions\n1.   For the purposes of this Regulation, the term ‘agreement’ shall mean:\n(a)\na bilateral agreement between a Member State and a third country;\n(b)\na regional agreement between a limited number of Member States and of third countries neighbouring Member States which is intended to address local situations and which is not open for accession to other States.\n2.

The Member State may provide any other additional information.\nArticle 4\nAssessment by the Commission\n1.   Upon receipt of the notification referred to in Article 3, the Commission shall assess whether the Member State may open formal negotiations.\n2.   In making that assessment, the Commission shall first check whether any relevant negotiating mandate with a view to concluding a Community agreement with the third country concerned is specifically envisaged within the next 24 months. If this is not the case, the Commission shall assess whether all of the following conditions are met:\n(a)\nthe Member State concerned has provided information showing that it has a specific interest in concluding the agreement due to economic, geographic, cultural, historical, social or political ties between the Member State and the third country concerned;\n(b)\non the basis of the information provided by the Member State, the envisaged agreement appears not to render Community law ineffective and not to undermine the proper functioning of the system established by that law; and\n(c)\nthe envisaged agreement would not undermine the object and purpose of the Community’s external relations policy as decided by the Community.\n3.   If the information provided by the Member State is not sufficient for the purposes of the assessment, the Commission may request additional information.\nArticle 5\nAuthorisation to open formal negotiations\n1.

Before signing a negotiated agreement, the Member State concerned shall notify the outcome of the negotiations to the Commission and shall transmit to it the text of the agreement.\n2.   Upon receipt of that notification the Commission shall assess whether the negotiated agreement:\n(a)\nmeets the condition set out in Article 4(2)(b);\n(b)\nmeets the condition set out in Article 4(2)(c), in so far as there are new and exceptional circumstances in relation to that condition; and\n(c)\nfulfils the requirement under Article 5(2).\n3.

The procedure is subject to strict rules and has to be considered exceptional.\nKEY POINTS\n              \nScope: the regulation applies to agreements concerning particular matters falling, entirely or partly, within the scope of Regulation (EC) No 593/2008 on the law applicable to contractual obligations (Rome I) and Regulation (EC) No 864/2007 on the law applicable to non-contractual obligations (Rome II).\nNotification: where an EU country intends to enter into negotiations in order to amend an existing agreement or to conclude a new agreement falling within the scope of the regulation, it must notify the European Commission in writing of its intention as soon as possible before the envisaged opening of formal negotiations.\nConfidentiality: the Commission has to treat the information communicated by the EU country as confidential, if so requested.\nAssessment: the Commission must:\nfirstly, check that no relevant negotiating mandate for concluding an EU-level agreement with the non-EU country concerned is envisaged within the next 24 months;\nif not, verify that there is a genuine specific interest of the EU country for the agreement and that the envisaged agreement would not undermine the effectiveness of EU law and the object and purpose of the EU external relations policy; and\nif necessary, request further information.\nAuthorisation of negotiations: if the conditions are met, the Commission authorises the EU country to open formal negotiations on the agreement. The Commission may propose negotiating guidelines as well as the inclusion of particular clauses in the envisaged agreement.\nParticipation: the Commission may participate as an observer in the negotiations, and otherwise should be kept informed of progress and results.\nClauses in the agreement: where is is authorised, the agreement will in any case have to stipulate\nthat the agreement is fully or partially terminated in the event of a subsequent agreement between the EU and the same non-EU country on the same subject matter; and\nthat a subsequent agreement between the EU and the non-EU country on the same subject matter direct replace the relevant clauses of the agreement.\nAuthorisation of conclusion: before signing the agreement, the EU country must notify the outcome of the negotiations and submit the text of the agreement to the Commission, for authorisation of conclusion after verifying that the conditions are met.\nRefusal: the regulation sets out the procedure for and consequences of the Commission’s refusal to authorise negotiations or the conclusion of the agreement.\nReview and expiry\nThe regulation expires 3 years after the submission by the Commission — no earlier than 7 July 2017 — of a report on its application. In that report, the Commission must indicate whether it recommends that this regulation be replaced at its expiry by a new regulation.\nAny negotiation underway at the date of expiry may continue.\nFROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?\n              \nIt has applied since 20 August 2009.\nBACKGROUND\n              \nThis regulation should be seen in the context of the EU’s exclusive external competence for these areas of civil law. Before the adoption of the relevant internal EU Regulations (Rome I and Rome II), the EU countries themselves concluded agreements with non-EU countries in this area.\nAs part of the EU approach to judicial cooperation and agreements with non-EU countries in civil matters, this regulation comes along with Regulation (EC) No 664/2009 concerning jurisdiction, recognition and enforcement of judgments and decisions in matrimonial matters, parental responsibility and maintenance obligations which entered into force the same day and is based on a similar procedure.\nFor more information, see:\nCivil and commercial matters (European Commission).\nKEY TERMS\n              \nNon-contractual obligation: where a person who is responsible for loss sustained by another person outside the performance of a contract – e.g. due to a tort or by unjust enrichment – is required to compensate the loss.\nMAIN DOCUMENT\n            \nRegulation (EC) No 662/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 July 2009 establishing a procedure for the negotiation and conclusion of agreements between Member States and third countries on particular matters concerning the law applicable to contractual and non-contractual obligations (OJ L 200, 31.7.2009, pp. 25-30)\nSuccessive amendments to Regulation (EC) No 662/2009 have been incorporated into the original document.
