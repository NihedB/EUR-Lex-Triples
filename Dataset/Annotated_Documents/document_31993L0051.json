Member States shall ensure that the conditions laid down in paragraph 2 are met, when plants, plant products or other objects listed in Annex V, part A, section II of Directive 77/93/EEC, originating outside a protected zone established  for the said plants, plant products or other objects in respect of one or more harmful organisms pursuant to Article 2 (1) (h) of Directive 77/93/EEC, are moved through such zone for final destination outside the zone, and without a plant passport valid  for that zone.  2. The following conditions shall be met:  (a) the packaging used or, where appropriate, the vehicles transporting the plants, plant products or other objects referred to in paragraph 1, shall be clean and free from the relevant organisms referred to in paragraph 1, and of such a nature as to  ensure that there is no risk of harmful organisms spreading;  (b) immediately after packaging, the packaging or, where appropriate, the vehicles transporting the said plants, plant products or other objects shall be secured according to stringent plant health standards to ensure that there is no risk of harmful  organisms spreading in the relevant protected zone and that the identity will remain unchanged and to the satisfaction of the responsible official bodies referred to in Directive 77/93/EEC, and remain secured during transportation through the relevant  protected zone;  (c) the plants, plant products or other objects referred to in paragraph 1, shall be accompanied by a document which is normally used for trade purposes, indicating that the said products originate outside the relevant protected zone and have a  destination outside the relevant protected zone.  3. If during an official check, organized pursuant to Article 11 (7) of Directive 77/93/EEC, and carried out at a place within the relevant zone, it is found that the requirements laid down under Article 1 (2) are not met, the following official  measures shall be taken immediately, as appropriate, and without prejudice to the measures to be taken if the plants, plant products or other objects do not meet the conditions laid down by Directive 77/93/EEC:  - sealing of the packaging,  - transportation, under official control, of the plants, plant products or other objects to a destination outside the relevant protected zone.  Article 2  1. Member States shall lay down that less stringent conditions shall apply to those plants, plant products or other objects listed in Annex V, part A, section II of Directive 77/93/EEC originating in and moving within a protected zone  established for the said plants, plant products or other objects in respect of one or more harmful organisms.  2. For the purpose of paragraph 1 the following less stringent condition may apply:  the official examinations referred to in Article 6 (4) of the said Directive may be satisfied by the conditions laid down in the detailed rules for surveys in Commission Directive 92/70/EEC of 30 July 1992 for the purposes of the recognition of  protected zones in the Community (3).  Article 3  1. Member States shall bring into force the laws, regulations or administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive on the date referred to in Article 3 (1) of Council Directive 91/683/EEC (4). They shall forthwith inform the  Commission thereof.  When Member States adopt these provisions, these shall contain a reference to this Directive or shall be accompanied by such reference at the time of their official publication. The procedure for such reference shall be adopted by Member States.  2.

These organisms include insects, nematodes (a worm of the large phylum Nematoda, such as a roundworm or threadworm) and bacteria.\nThis directive allows EU countries to permit certain plants to be moved in or through protected zones without the need for a plant passport valid for the appropriate protected zone so long as specific conditions are met.\nKEY POINTS\nEU countries may request the designation of special protection from harmful organisms for all or part of their territory. A protected zone is defined in relation to a particular harmful organism.\nThe general rules state that plants, plant products or other objects (e.g. certain types of wood or soil) which are potential carriers of harmful organisms of relevance for certain protected zones must be accompanied by a plant passport valid for the appropriate zone when introduced into or moved within that zone.\nHowever, in respect of the movement through a protected zone of plants, plant products or other objects originating outside the zone, Directive 93/51/EEC lays down the following conditions: the packaging and the vehicles used to transport the plants must be clean and free from the relevant organisms and be of an appropriate type to ensure there is no risk of harmful organisms spreading;immediately after packaging and loading, the packaging or vehicle used must be secured so there is no risk of harmful organisms spreading in the protected zone; they must remain secured during transport;the plant materials must be accompanied by a document, normally used for trade purposes, indicating that the products originate outside the protected zone and have a destination outside the protected zone.\nWhere an official check takes place and it is found that the above conditions have not been met, the packaging is sealed and the plant materials are transported under official control outside the protected zone.\nSimilar conditions apply to plant materials originating in and moving within a given protected zone. However, the official checks may be satisfied by meeting the conditions laid down in the detailed rules for surveys undertaken for the purposes of identifying protected zones (Directive 92/70/EEC). These detailed surveys are carried out annually and involve taking samples of plants, plant products and the growing medium in the zones in question.\nFROM WHEN DOES THE DIRECTIVE APPLY?\n              \nIt has applied since 24 July 1993 and it had to become law in the EU countries by 1 June 1993 (the date referred to in Council Directive 91/683/EEC, an act which was subsequently repealed and replaced by Council Directive 2000/29/EC).\nBACKGROUND\n              \nFor more information, see:\nProtected zones\n                (European Commission).\nKEY TERMS\n              \nProtected zone: designated on the basis that there is danger that a particular harmful organism could become established due to favourable environmental conditions.\nMAIN DOCUMENT\n            \nCommission Directive 93/51/EEC of 24 June 1993 establishing rules for movements of certain plants, plant products or other objects through a protected zone, and for movements of such plants, plant products or other objects originating in and moving within such a protected zone (OJ L 205, 17.8.1993, pp. 24-25)\nRELATED DOCUMENTS\n            \nRegulation (EU) 2016/2031 of the European Parliament of the Council of 26 October 2016 on protective measures against pests of plants, amending Regulations (EU) No 228/2013, (EU) No 652/2014 and (EU) No 1143/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council and repealing Council Directives 69/464/EEC, 74/647/EEC, 93/85/EEC, 98/57/EC, 2000/29/EC, 2006/91/EC and 2007/33/EC (OJ L 317, 23.11.2016, pp. 4-104)\nCommission Regulation (EC) No 690/2008 of 4 July 2008 recognising protected zones exposed to particular plant health risks in the Community (Recast) (OJ L 193, 22.7.2008, pp. 1-6)\nSuccessive amendments to Directive 2000/29/EC have been incorporated into the original text.
