INTRODUCTION\nThe European Council endorsed the introduction of the European Partnerships as a means to realise the European perspective of the Western Balkan countries. The proposed revised partnership updates the second one, on the basis of the findings of the 2007 Commission Progress Report on Bosnia and Herzegovina. It identifies new and remaining priorities for action. The new priorities are adapted to the country's specific needs and stage of preparation and will be updated as necessary. Bosnia and Herzegovina is expected to develop a plan including a timetable and specific measures intended to address the European Partnership priorities. The partnership also provides guidance for financial assistance to the country.\n2.   PRINCIPLES\nThe Stabilisation and Association Process remains the framework for the European course of the Western Balkan countries, all the way to their future accession. The priorities identified for Bosnia and Herzegovina relate to its capacity to meet the criteria defined by the Copenhagen European Council of 1993 and the conditions set by the stabilisation and association process, notably the conditions defined by the Council in its conclusions of 29 April 1997 and 21 and 22 June 1999, the final declaration of the Zagreb Summit of 24 November 2000 and the Thessaloniki Agenda.\n3.   PRIORITIES\nThe priorities listed in this European Partnership have been selected on the basis that it is realistic to expect that Bosnia and Herzegovina can complete them or take them substantially forward over the next few years. A distinction is made between short-term priorities, which are expected to be accomplished within one to two years, and medium-term priorities, which are expected to be accomplished within three to four years. The priorities concern both legislation and its implementation.\nIn view of the need to set priorities, clearly there are other tasks for Bosnia and Herzegovina to complete which may become priorities in any future partnership, also taking into account future progress made by Bosnia and Herzegovina.\nAmong the short-term priorities, the key ones have been identified and grouped together at the beginning of the list.

The financing agreements serve as legal basis for the implementation of the concrete programmes. Accordingly, this Decision will have no financial implications. Bosnia and Herzegovina can have access to funding from multi-country and horizontal programmes.\n5.   CONDITIONALITY\nAssistance to the Western Balkan countries is conditional on progress on satisfying the Copenhagen criteria and on meeting the specific priorities of this European Partnership. Failure to respect these conditions could lead the Council to take appropriate measures on the basis of Article 21 of Regulation (EC) No 1085/2006 or, in the case of pre-2007 programmes, on the basis of Article 5 of Council Regulation (EC) No 2666/2000. The assistance is also subject to the conditions defined by the Council in its conclusions of 29 April 1997, in particular as regards the recipients' undertaking to carry out democratic, economic and institutional reforms. Specific conditions are also included in individual annual programmes. The financing decisions will be followed by a financing agreement signed with Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n6.   MONITORING\nImplementation of the European Partnership will be examined by the mechanisms established under the Stabilisation and Association Process, notably the annual reports presented by the Commission.\n(1)  OJ L 306, 7.12.2000, p. 1. Regulation as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2112/2005 (OJ L 344, 27.12.2005, p. 23).", "summary": "European Partnership with Bosnia and Herzegovina\nEuropean Partnership with Bosnia and Herzegovina\nThe European Partnership – an instrument of the Stabilisation and Association Process – is intended to provide additional, tailored support to the Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina in order to realise the country’s European perspective. Its aim is to identify priority areas where further efforts and reforms are required, calling in particular for Bosnia and Herzegovina to bring its legislation into line with that of the Community. It also provides a reference framework for Community aid.\nACT\nCouncil Decision 2008/211/EC of 18 February 2008 on the principles, priorities and conditions contained in the European Partnership with Bosnia and Herzegovina and repealing Decision 2006/55/EC.\nSUMMARY\nThe European Partnership with Bosnia and Herzegovina is the main instrument for assisting the authorities of Bosnia and Herzegovina in realising their country’s European perspective, confirmed at the Zagreb summit in 2000 and reinforced at the Thessaloniki summit in 2003.\nThe European Partnership with Bosnia and Herzegovina is an instrument of the Stabilisation and Association Process, which was introduced for the countries of the western Balkans concerned under the Thessaloniki agenda (2003). The European Partnerships are modelled on the accession partnerships with the candidate countries. The partnerships for the Western Balkan countries have Regulation (EC) No 533/2004 as their legal basis.\nOBJECTIVE\nThe objective of the European Partnership is to register in a single framework:\nthe priority areas for reform where efforts are required; these are identified according to the country’s requirements and relate to the adoption and implementation of legislation;\nguidelines for determining the various areas for the allocation of financial assistance in accordance with the priorities identified;\nthe principles and conditions governing implementation of the partnership.\nThe Council of the European Union adopts the European Partnership, and its subsequent amendments, by a qualified majority on the basis of a proposal from the Commission.\nThe current Partnership updates and adapts the previous Partnership, adopted in 2006. European Partnerships are flexible instruments designed to reflect the progress made by the countries concerned. They highlight the efforts still required in other areas as identified by the Commission’s evaluations.\nWith a view to achieving the objectives identified in the European Partnership, Bosnia and Herzegovina must adopt a national plan setting out procedures and a programme for implementing the priorities of the Partnership.\nImplementation of the Partnership is monitored within the framework of the Stabilisation and Association Process and its mechanisms, particularly through the Commission's annual progress report, which evaluates the progress made and the work that remains to be done.\nPRIORITIES\nThe European Partnership establishes priorities which are both realistic and attainable goals. In this regard, a distinction is made between short-term and medium-term priorities, which are expected to be achieved within one to two years and within three to four years respectively.\nThe main priorities identified for Bosnia and Herzegovina relate primarily to its capacity to meet:\nthe Copenhagen criteria defined in 1993;\nthe conditions set for the Stabilisation and Association Process (Council conclusions of 29 April 1997 and of 21 and 22 June 1999);\nthe 2000 Zagreb declaration; and\nthe Thessaloniki Agenda of 2003.\nThe short- and medium-term priorities are classified as follows:\nthe key priorities are short-term priorities. They entail the reform of the police forces; full cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY); reform of public broadcasting; implementation of the public-administration reform strategy adopted in 2006; reinforcement of administrative capacities in order to implement the Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA); settlement of bilateral issues; creation of an internal single economic space; correction of structural rigidities impeding the functioning of the labour market; and improvement of the functioning and viability of institutional structures; and respect of human rights and fundamental freedoms, including, if necessary, by reforming the constitutional framework;\nthe political criteria, which include democracy and the rule of law (constitution; governance, electoral legislation, public administration and service, the judicial system and anti-corruption policy), human rights and the protection of minorities (repeal of the death penalty in the constitution of the Republika Srpska; compliance with international standards and conventions, including those of the Council of Europe; access to justice; reform of the prison system; social inclusion; and the rights and protection of minorities, including the Roma), regional issues and international obligations;\nthe economic criteria, which include macroeconomic and financial stability, the acceleration and completion of privatisations, budgetary supervision mechanisms, the quality of public finances, the reconciliation of domestic claims, greater legal certainty for economic operators, better corporate governance and a better (legal, regulatory, tax, judicial, etc) environment for companies and business, and preparations for membership of the World Trade Organisation (WTO);\nEuropean standards relating to the Community acquis as regards the internal market, EU sectoral policies and the area of justice, freedom and security. Bosnia and Herzegovina must endeavour to bring its legislation into line with the Community acquis in these areas and ensure its implementation.\nThe Commission's assessments of developments in Bosnia and Herzegovina are based in particular on the priorities identified by the Partnership.\nFINANCIAL FRAMEWORK\nThe Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance (IPA) is the basis for financial assistance to Bosnia and Herzegovina in the period 2007-2013. In the period 2000-2006, this assistance totalled EUR 502.8 million (CARDS programme). Under the Multiannual Indicative Financial Framework for 2009‑2011, EUR 440.1 million in financial assistance for national programmes is expected to be provided under the IPA in the period 2007‑2011.\nThe European Partnership with Bosnia and Herzegovina serves as a reference point in this process for determining the different areas where funds are allocated (according to priorities). The programming documents provide the actual legal framework for the financial assistance.\nNonetheless, financial assistance is conditional upon recipient countries abiding by the essential elements which govern their relations with the EU, particularly the effective implementation of reforms. Under the European Partnership, Bosnia and Herzegovina is under an obligation to comply with the Copenhagen criteria and the priorities defined by the Partnership.\nApart from other donors, Bosnia and Herzegovina is also eligible for funding from the European Investment Bank (EIB), principally under its mandate for granting regional loans to the EU’s south-eastern neighbours. This mandate covers the candidate countries for EU accession and the countries of the Western Balkans. The financing provided by the EIB takes the form of grants and loans.\nReferences\nAct\nEntry into force\nDeadline for transposition in the Member States\nOfficial Journal\nDecision 2008/211/EC\n22.3.2008\n-\nOJ L 80 of 19.3.2008\nRELATED ACTS\nCommunication of from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament 5 March 2008 - Western Balkans: enhancing the European Perspective [COM(2008) 127 final – Not published in the Official Journal].\nCommunication from the Commission of 27 January 2006 – The Western Balkans on the road to the EU: consolidating stability and raising prosperity [COM(2006) 27 – Not published in the Official Journal].\nBILATERAL RELATIONS\nProposal for a Council and Commission Decision of 8 April 2008 concerning the conclusion of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement between the European Communities and their Member States, of the one part, and Bosnia and Herzegovina, of the other part [COM(2008) 182 final – Not published in the Official Journal].\nCouncil Decision of 16 June 2008 concerning the signing and conclusion of the Interim Agreement on trade and trade-related matters between the European Community, of the one part, and Bosnia and Herzegovina, of the other part [OJ L 169, 30.6.2008].\nCouncil Regulation (EC) No 594/2008 of 16 June 2008 on certain procedures for applying the Stabilisation and Association Agreement between the European Communities and their Member States, of the one part, and Bosnia and Herzegovina, of the other part, and for applying the Interim Agreement on trade and trade-related matters between the European Community, of the one part, and Bosnia and Herzegovina, of the other part [OJ L 169, 30.6.2008].\nFINANCIAL ASSISTANCE\nCouncil Regulation (EC) No 1085/2006 of 17 July 2006 establishing an Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance (IPA) [Official Journal L 210 of 31 July 2006].\nMultiannual Indicative Financial Framework (MIFF) for:\n2008‑2010 [COM(2006) 672 final – Not published in the Official Journal];\n2009‑2011 [COM(2007) 689 final – Not published in the Official Journal].\nMultiannual Indicative Planning Document 2007‑2009 for Bosnia and Herzegovina.\nEVALUATION\nReports for previous years are available on the website of the European Commission's Directorate-General for Enlargement.\nLast updated: 16.06.2010", "tags": ["aid policy", "structural policy", "cooperation policy", "democracy", "association agreement (EU)", "enlargement of the Union", "economic stabilisation", "cooperation agreement (EU)", "Bosnia and Herzegovina", "rule of law"], "subjects": ["Association Agreement", "Cooperation", "External relations"], "split": "train", "reference_annotations": {"32008D0211_p1": {"text": "(2)  Council decision 2006/55/ec of 30 January 2006 on the principles, priorities and conditions contained in the European Partnership with Bosnia and Herzegovina and repealing decision 2004/515/ec (OJ L 35, 7.2.2006, p. 19).", "triples": [" decision 2006/55/ec,  repealing,  decision 2004/515/ec"]}}, "summary_annotations": {"32008D0211_p1": {"text": "Council decision 2008/211/ec of 18 February 2008 on the principles, priorities and conditions contained in the European Partnership with Bosnia and Herzegovina and repealing decision 2006/55/ec.", "triples": [" decision 2008/211/ec,  repealing,  decision 2006/55/ec"]}}}
