Consequently, in order to establish comparable regional statistics, the territorial units should be defined in accordance with the NUTS classification.\n(4)\nIn accordance with the second paragraph of Article 175 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), the Commission is to submit a report to the European Parliament, the Council, the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions every three years on the progress made towards achieving economic, social and territorial cohesion. Annual regional data at NUTS 3 regional level is necessary for the preparation of those reports and for the regular monitoring of demographic developments and of possible future demographic challenges in the Union regions, including different types of regions such as border regions, metropolitan regions, rural regions and mountain and island regions. Since demographic ageing exhibits strong regional differences, Eurostat is required to prepare regional projections on a regular basis in order to complement the demographic picture of the NUTS 2 regions in the Union.\n(5)\nIn accordance with Article 159 TFEU, the Commission is to draw up a report each year on progress in achieving the objectives of Article 151 TFEU, including the demographic situation in the Union.\n(6)\nThe Commission in its Communication of 20 October 2009 entitled ‘Solidarity in health: reducing health inequalities in the EU’ supported the further development and collection of data, and the further development of health indicators, by age, sex, socioeconomic status and geographic dimensions.\n(7)\nThe Sustainable Development Strategy of the Union, launched by the European Council in Gothenburg in 2001 and renewed in June 2006, has as its objective the continuous improvement of the quality of life for current and future generations. The Commission (Eurostat) monitoring report, which is published every two years, provides an objective statistical picture of progress, based on a Union set of sustainable development indicators.\n(8)\nAnnual demographic statistics are fundamental for the study and definition of a wide range of policies, with particular regard to social and economic issues, at national and regional level. Statistics on population are an important denominator for a wide range of policy indicators.\n(9)\nThe strategic objective H.3. of Chapter IV of the Beijing Platform for Action (1995) provides a reference framework for the generation and dissemination of gender-disaggregated data and information for planning and policy evaluation reasons.\n(10)\nDemographic statistics constitute an essential component for the estimation of total population in the framework of the European System of Accounts. It is important to update and revise data when establishing statistics at European level.\n(11)\nIn order to ensure the quality, and in particular the comparability, of the data provided by the Member States, and in order for reliable overviews to be drawn up at Union level, the data used should be based on the same concepts, and should refer to the same reference date or period.\n(12)\nRegulation (EC) No 223/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council (3) provides a reference framework for European demographic statistics. In particular, it requires compliance with the principles of professional independence, impartiality, objectivity, reliability, statistical confidentiality and cost effectiveness.\n(13)\nThe information on demography should be consistent with the relevant information collected pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 862/2007 of the European Parliament and of the Council (4) and Regulation (EC) No 763/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council (5). To this end, scientifically-based and well-documented statistical estimation methods should be evaluated, and their use should be encouraged.\n(14)\nWhen developing, producing and disseminating European statistics, the national and European statistical authorities, and, where applicable, other relevant national and regional authorities, should take account of the principles set out in the European Statistics Code of Practice, as reviewed and updated by the European Statistical System Committee on 28 September 2011.\n(15)\nThis Regulation guarantees the right to respect for private and family life and to the protection of personal data, as set out in Articles 7 and 8 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union.\n(16)\nDirective 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (6) and Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council (7) apply with regard to the processing of personal data in the context of this Regulation.\n(17)\nSince the objective of this Regulation, namely the establishment of a common legal framework for the systematic production of European demographic statistics in the Member States, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States but can rather, by reason of the scale and effects of the action, be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 TEU. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary to achieve that objective.\n(18)\nIn order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of this Regulation, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission. Those powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council (8),\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nArticle 1\nSubject matter\nThis Regulation establishes a common legal framework for the development, production and dissemination of European statistics on population and vital events.\nArticle 2\nDefinitions\nFor the purpose of this Regulation, the following definitions apply:\n(a)\n‘national’ refers to the territory of a Member State within the meaning of Regulation (EC) No 1059/2003 applicable at the reference time;\n(b)\n‘regional’ means NUTS level 1, NUTS level 2 or NUTS level 3 within the meaning of Regulation (EC) No 1059/2003 applicable at the reference time; where this term is used in connection with countries that are not members of the Union, ‘regional’ means the statistical regions at level 1, 2 or 3, as agreed between those countries and the Commission (Eurostat), at the reference time;\n(c)\n‘usually resident population’ means all persons having their usual residence in a Member State at the reference time;\n(d)\n‘usual residence’ means the place where a person normally spends the daily period of rest, regardless of temporary absences for purposes of recreation, holidays, visits to friends and relatives, business, medical treatment or religious pilgrimage.

Since 1 November 2014, a qualified majority is defined as at least 55 % of the members of the Council, comprising at least 15 of them and representing countries comprising at least 65 % of the population of the EU (double majority).\n2.The long-term assessment of the sustainability of EU countries’ public finances is, among other things, conducted on the basis of Eurostat population projections; these, in turn, require timely, accurate, reliable and consistent time series on population, births and deaths, together with sound assumptions concerning the future development of fertility, life expectancy and migration flows.\n3.Progress of the EU’s sustainable development strategy is assessed via the Eurostat monitoring report which uses time series on old-age dependency ratios, fertility rates and life expectancy in the EU.\n4.Trends in achieving economic, social and territorial cohesion are assessed on the basis of regional demographic data.\nCommission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 205/2014 lays down uniform conditions for the implementation of Regulation (EU) No 1260/2013 as regards the breakdown (i.e. disaggregation) of data, deadlines and data revisions.\nFROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?\n              \nIt has applied since 30 December 2013.\nBACKGROUND\n              \nFor more information see:\n‘Population (demography, migration and projections)’ on Eurostat's website.\nACT\n            \nRegulation (EU) No 1260/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 November 2013 on European demographic statistics (OJ L 330, 10.12.2013, pp. 39-43)\nRELATED ACTS\n            \nCommission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 205/2014 of 4 March 2014 laying down uniformed conditions for the implementation of Regulation (EU) No 1260/2013 of the European Parliament and the Council on European demographic statistics, as regards breakdowns of data, deadlines and data revisions (OJ L 65, 5.3.2014, pp. 10-26)\nlast update 03.08.2016", "tags": ["statistical method", "mortality", "births", "population census", "EU statistics", "population statistics", "disclosure of information"], "subjects": ["Social provisions"], "split": "test", "reference_annotations": {"32013R1260_p1": {"text": "(3)  regulation 223/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 2009 on European statistics and repealing regulation 1101/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council on the transmission of data subject to statistical confidentiality to the Statistical Office of the European Communities, Council regulation 322/97 on Community Statistics, and Council decision 89/382/eec, Euratom establishing a Committee on the Statistical Programmes of the European Communities (OJ L 87, 31.3.2009, p. 164).", "triples": [" regulation 223/2009,  repealing,  regulation 1101/2008", " regulation 223/2009,  repealing,  regulation 322/97", " regulation 223/2009,  repealing,  decision 89/382/eec"]}, "32013R1260_p2": {"text": "(4)  regulation 862/2007 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 July 2007 on Community statistics on migration and international protection and repealing Council regulation 311/76 on the compilation of statistics on foreign workers (OJ L 199, 31.7.2007, p. 23).", "triples": [" regulation 862/2007,  repealing,  regulation 311/76"]}, "32013R1260_p3": {"text": "(9)  Commission regulation 1201/2009 of 30 November 2009 implementing regulation 763/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council on population and housing censuses as regards the technical specifications of the topics and of their breakdowns (OJ L 329, 15.12.2009, p. 29).", "triples": [" regulation 1201/2009,  implementing,  regulation 763/2008"]}}, "summary_annotations": {}}
