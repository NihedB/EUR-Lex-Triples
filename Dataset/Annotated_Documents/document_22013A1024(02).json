To return persons illegally residing on their territory to their countries of origin, in particular when these persons do not have valid identification documents, EU countries count on the cooperation of non-EU countries to identify, re-document and readmit them.\nEU readmission agreements provide a structured framework of cooperation between EU countries and non-EU countries by establishing rapid and effective procedures for identifying, re-documenting and returning persons originating from one of the parties, residing without authorisation in the territory of the other party.\nBy its decisions, the Council concludes the agreements on behalf of the EU.\nKEY POINTS\nReciprocity\nThese agreements operate on reciprocity. The same rules apply to EU citizens, to the citizens of the other party to the agreement and, under certain conditions, to third-country nationals, i.e. persons holding a nationality other than that of either signatory party or stateless persons illegally present in the non-EU country concerned.\nAs stipulated in Protocol 21 to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), the United Kingdom and Ireland may choose to opt in or out of these agreements on a case-by-case basis. However, under Protocol 22 to the TFEU, Denmark has opted out of participating in justice and home affairs cooperation (of which these readmission agreements are part), with the exception of measures that relate to the Schengen\nacquis.\nOwn nationals\nAll EU readmission agreements cover detailed procedures for the identification, re-documentation and readmission of nationals illegally present on the territory the other parties. Many of the agreements also apply, with differing conditions, to:\nminor unmarried children of such persons regardless of their place of birth or their nationality;\nspouses of such persons, holding another nationality;\nthose persons residing in the EU who no longer hold the nationality of the other party concerned.\nThird-country nationals and stateless persons\nEU readmission agreements also cover commitments and procedures for the readmission of those third country nationals that have illegally entered the territory of one party by transiting the territory of the other party. For example, one party would need to readmit a person who is not its citizen if that person:\nhas illegally and directly entered the territory of one party from the other party;\nholding, at the time of readmission application, a valid visa or residence permit for the country concerned.\nThis obligation will not apply if the person concerned:\nhas only been in airside transit via an international airport of the party concerned;\nhas been granted a visa or residence permit by one party unless: \nthey have also been issued a visa or residence permit by the other party that is valid for longer; or\nthe visa or permit was obtained using fake or forged documents; or\nthe conditions of the visa are not observed;\nhas the right to visa-free access to the territory of the party concerned.\nProcedures\nThe party wishing to return a person who is not in possession of valid identity documents presents a readmission application to the other party concerned containing the information (including name, date of birth, evidence of nationality) detailed in the specific agreement.\nApplications for third-country nationals and stateless persons are submitted to the competent authority of the country concerned within a specified period of time after the party became aware of the illegal situation of the person concerned.\nA response to a readmission application must be received within a specified period usually within a month. Under the accelerated procedure, responses are usually required within a week. Reasons must be given for a refusal.\nOnce the party has agreed to readmission, a travel document must be issued by the authorities of the party concerned, regardless of the will of the person.\nSome of the agreements also cover arrangements to be made in view of the return operation or regarding transit facilitation for returnees to other third countries (for example, the point of entry, possible escorts and other information relevant to the transfer).\nThe agreements also list various means of evidence to establish the nationality of a person and their illegal entry into the territory of the parties concerned.\nFROM WHEN DO THE AGREEMENTS AND DECISIONS APPLY?\nAct\nDate of application\nDate of entry into force\nAgreement with Turkey\n1.10.2014\nDecision concluding the
