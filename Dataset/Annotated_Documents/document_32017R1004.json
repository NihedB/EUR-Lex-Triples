{"celex_id": "32017R1004", "reference": "20.6.2017\nEN\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\nL 157/1\nREGULATION (EU) 2017/1004 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL\nof 17 May 2017\non the establishment of a Union framework for the collection, management and use of data in the fisheries sector and support for scientific advice regarding the common fisheries policy and repealing Council Regulation (EC) No 199/2008\n(recast)\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 43(2) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee (1),\nHaving regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions (2),\nActing in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure (3),\nWhereas:\n(1)\nA number of amendments are to be made to Council Regulation (EC) No 199/2008 (4). In the interests of clarity, that Regulation should be recast.\n(2)\nThe common fisheries policy has been reformed by Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council (5). The objectives of the common fisheries policy and the requirements for data collection in the fisheries sector are set out in Articles 2 and 25 of that Regulation. Furthermore, Regulation (EU) No 508/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council (6) has reformed the structure of financial support for Member States’ fisheries data collection activities.\n(3)\nIn line with the objectives of the common fisheries policy on the conservation, management and exploitation of living aquatic resources in non-Union waters, the Union must take part in the efforts undertaken to conserve fisheries resources, in particular in accordance with the provisions adopted in sustainable fisheries partnership agreements or by regional fisheries management organisations.\n(4)\nThis Regulation aims to establish rules on the collection, management and use of biological, environmental, technical and socioeconomic data concerning the fisheries sector.\n(5)\nThe data collection framework should contribute towards reaching the objectives of the common fisheries policy, which include the protection of the marine environment, the sustainable management of all commercially exploited species, and in particular the achievement of good environmental status in the marine environment by 2020, as set out in Article 1(1) of Directive 2008/56/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (7).\n(6)\nThe rules laid down in this Regulation as regards the collection, management and use of biological, environmental, technical and socioeconomic data should also apply to data concerning the fisheries sector, the collection of which is required under other Union legal acts, including, Regulations (EC) No 1921/2006 (8), (EC) No 295/2008 (9), (EC) No 762/2008 (10), (EC) No 216/2009 (11), (EC) No 217/2009 (12), (EC) No 218/2009 (13), (EU) No 1236/2010 (14), (EU) No 1343/2011 (15) and (EU) 2016/2336 of the European Parliament and of the Council (16), Directives 2000/60/EC (17), 2008/56/EC and 2009/147/EC (18) of the European Parliament and of the Council, Council Regulations (EC) No 2347/2002 (19), (EC) No 812/2004 (20), (EC) No 1967/2006 (21), (EC) No 1100/2007 (22) and (EC) No 1006/2008 (23), Council Directive 92/43/EEC (24), Council Decision 2010/717/EU (25) and Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2017/218 (26).\n(7)\nHowever, in order to avoid duplication, where the data concerning fisheries are collected and managed in accordance with the rules laid down in other Union legal acts, such as Council Regulation (EC) No 1224/2009 (27) and Regulation (EC) No 223/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council (28), this Regulation should only lay down the rules for the use and transmission of such data.\n(8)\nThe obligations concerning access to the data covered by this Regulation should be without prejudice to Member States’ obligations under Directive 2003/4/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (29), as well as under Regulation (EC) No 1367/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council (30).\n(9)\nIt should be ensured at all times and at all levels that, as regards data storage, process and exchange, the obligations on personal data protection laid down in Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (31) and Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council (32) are respected.\n(10)\nIn the interest of legal clarity, this Regulation should provide for a set of definitions.\n(11)\nThe definition of ‘marine regions’ should be based on scientific considerations.\n(12)\nThis Regulation should enable the Union and its Member States to achieve the objectives and principles set out in Articles 2 and 25 of Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013. To that end, a multiannual Union programme is needed to coordinate the data collection efforts of all Member States. It is appropriate to set out key requirements and criteria for the establishment of such a multiannual Union programme, as well as the consultations to be held before its adoption.\n(13)\nThe data needs of end-users of scientific data should be identified and it should be specified which data are to be collected under this Regulation. Those data should include ecosystem data relating to the impact of fisheries and data on the sustainability of aquaculture, as well as socioeconomic data on fisheries and aquaculture.\n(14)\nIn the interest of simplification and rationalisation, the data to be collected should be selected on the basis of needs clearly substantiated by end-users of scientific data, taking into account the scientific relevance and usefulness of those data.\n(15)\nThe data collected should allow the targets required for the implementation of the multiannual plans referred to in Article 9 of Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013, such as fishing mortality rates and spawning stock biomass, to be determined. They should also allow the gaps in the coverage of data relating to the fishing fleet to be closed and the number of data-deficient stocks in certain regions to be reduced.\n(16)\nIt is important to collect biological data on recreational fisheries where there is a potentially significant impact on the state of the stock, in order to enable ecosystem-based management and conservation as necessary for the operation of the common fisheries policy, as well as to improve stock assessment.\n(17)\nFor the purpose of maintaining, adjusting or withdrawing emergency measures and other measures based on the precautionary principle, additional information is usually required. Where possible, priority should therefore be given to the collection of data that are necessary for the assessment of measures imposed on the basis of the precautionary principle.\n(18)\nIn view of the evolution of the status of fisheries resources over time, it is necessary to build and maintain time-series of data in order to allow for an effective long-term scientific monitoring of those resources.\n(19)\nResearch surveys at sea are an important method for collecting biological data. In view of their importance in marine regions where stocks are shared, it is appropriate for a sufficient number of mandatory research surveys at sea to be carried out at Union level.\n(20)\nMember States should implement the multiannual Union programme at national level by setting out their main data collection activities in the form of a section of the operational programme referred to in point (p) of Article 18(1) of Regulation (EU) No 508/2014, supplemented by a work plan for data collection in accordance with Article 21 of that Regulation. Requirements concerning the contents of such work plans should be set out in this Regulation.\n(21)\nIt is appropriate to describe the steps Member States should follow and the aspects they should take into consideration when establishing the methodologies for data collection in their national work plans. With a view to ensuring effective and homogeneous implementation of this Regulation by Member States, it is also necessary to set out key requirements as regards national coordination arrangements, data collectors’ rights and the obligations of masters of fishing vessels.\n(22)\nThe Commission is required to approve the Member States’ operational programmes and the national work plans and any amendments thereto pursuant to Article 19(1) and Article 21(2) of Regulation (EU) No 508/2014. In accordance with Article 22 of that Regulation, the Commission may adopt implementing acts laying down rules on procedures, format and timetables for their approval.\n(23)\nIt is appropriate for the Commission to assess work plans after consultation of the Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries (STECF), in order to ensure that those plans comply with minimum requirements set out in this Regulation.\n(24)\nFor the purpose of verification of the implementation of data collection activities by the Member States, there is a need for reporting by the Member States to the Commission in a clearly defined, standardised format that reduces the administrative burden.\n(25)\nIt is necessary for Member States to cooperate among themselves, as well as with third countries, and coordinate their work plans with respect to the collection of data regarding the same marine region and regions covering relevant inland waters.\n(26)\nIn view of the objective of the common fisheries policy to give more responsibility to Member States and to better involve end-users of scientific data in data collection, regional coordination should be strengthened and expanded from one single meeting into a continuous process coordinated by regional coordination groups for each marine region. In this framework, Member States should aim to cooperate with relevant stakeholders including third countries.\n(27)\nThose regional coordination groups should be tasked to develop and implement procedures, methods, quality assurance and quality control for collecting and processing data with a view to enabling the reliability of scientific advice to be further improved.\n(28)\nThe regional coordination groups should also aim to develop and implement regional databases, and should start all the necessary preparatory steps in order to attain that goal.\n(29)\nIt is important to take full advantage of data for the sustainable management of fisheries and for the evaluation and monitoring of stocks and ecosystems, including data related to the landing obligation.\n(30)\nMember States should determine the way they collect data, but in order to be able to combine data on a regional level in a meaningful way, minimum requirements for data quality, coverage and compatibility should be agreed by Member States at regional level, taking into account the fact that in some regions basins are managed jointly with third countries. When there is general agreement on the methods at regional level, regional coordination groups should, on the basis of that agreement, submit a draft regional work plan for approval by the Commission.\n(31)\nUnion legislation should no longer determine the details of methodologies to be applied in collecting data. Provisions on particular methods of data collection should therefore be replaced by the description of the process by which they will be determined. That process should essentially include cooperation between Member States and data users in regional coordination groups, and validation by the Commission through the approval of work plans submitted by Member States.\n(32)\nThe data referred to in this Regulation should be put into national computerised databases so that they are accessible to the Commission and can be made available to end-users of scientific data and other interested parties. Data which do not allow for personal identification should be available without restrictions to any party with an interest in their analysis, including on the environmental aspects of fisheries management. For that purpose, interested parties other than end-users of scientific data should be deemed to include any individual or body expressing such an interest.\n(33)\nScientific advice to fisheries resources management requires the processing of detailed data in order to address the needs of fisheries managers. In that context, Member States should make available data needed for scientific analysis and should ensure that they have the technical capacity to do so.\n(34)\nIn accordance with point (e) of Article 25(2) of Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013, it is necessary to ensure the availability in a timely manner of the relevant data and respective methodologies to bodies with a research or management interest in the scientific analysis of data in the fisheries sector and to any interested parties, except in circumstances where protection and confidentiality are required under applicable Union law.\n(35)\nTo give full effect to point (e) of Article 25(2) of Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013, Member States should set up adequate processes and electronic technologies to ensure availability of data and cooperate with other Member States, the Commission and end-users of scientific data to develop compatible data storage and exchange systems, taking account of Directive 2007/2/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (33). Further dissemination of information should also be ensured both at national and Union level. In all cases, appropriate safeguards such as a higher level of aggregation or anonymisation of data should be put in place in case data include information relating to identified or identifiable natural persons, taking into consideration the purposes of processing, the nature of the data and the potential risks relating to the processing of personal data.\n(36)\nThere is a need to ensure that end-users of scientific data are provided with data in a timely manner and in a standardised format, with clear codification systems, as they need to provide timely advice to enable fisheries to be sustainable. Other interested parties should also be assured of receiving data within a certain deadline.\n(37)\nIn order to improve the reliability of scientific advice needed to conduct the common fisheries policy, the Member States and the Commission should coordinate and cooperate in the relevant international scientific bodies.\n(38)\nThe scientific community should be consulted on, and those working in the fishing industry and other interest groups should be kept informed of, the implementation of the data collection provisions. The appropriate bodies in which to gather the opinions required are STECF and the Advisory Councils established pursuant to Article 43 of Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013.\n(39)\nIn order to supplement certain non-essential elements of this Regulation, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union should be delegated to the Commission in respect of establishing a detailed list of data requirements for the purpose of data collection under this Regulation within the framework of the multiannual Union programme. It is of particular importance that the Commission carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level, and that those consultations be conducted in accordance with the principles laid down in the Interinstitutional Agreement of 13 April 2016 on Better Law-Making (34). In particular, to ensure equal participation in the preparation of delegated acts, the European Parliament and the Council receive all documents at the same time as Member States’ experts, and their experts systematically have access to meetings of Commission expert groups dealing with the preparation of delegated acts.\n(40)\nIn order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of this Regulation, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission in respect of the approval of draft regional work plans submitted by regional coordination groups, as well as in respect of procedures, cost-sharing arrangements for participation in research surveys at sea, the area of marine region for the purpose of data collection, and format and timetables for the submission and approval of such regional work plans. Those powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council (35).\n(41)\nIn order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of this Regulation, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission for the establishment, within the framework of the multiannual Union programme, of a list of mandatory research surveys at sea and thresholds below which it is not mandatory to collect data or carry out research surveys at sea. Those powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011.\n(42)\nIn order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of this Regulation, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission in respect of setting out the rules on procedures, format and timetables for the submission and approval of annual reports submitted by Member States to the Commission. Those powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011.\n(43)\nIn order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of this Regulation, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission in respect of laying down rules on procedures, formats, codes and timetables to be used to ensure the compatibility of data storage and exchange systems, and to establish safeguards, where appropriate, in the event that those systems include information relating to identified or identifiable natural persons. Those powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011.\n(44)\nSince the objective of this Regulation, namely to establish a Union framework for the collection, management and use of data in the fisheries sector, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States, but can rather, by reason of the scale or effects of the action, be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union. In accordance with the principle of proportionality as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve that objective.\n(45)\nRegulation (EC) No 199/2008 should be repealed. However, transitional measures should be provided for as regards national programmes already approved and as regards the multiannual Union programme currently in force,\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nCHAPTER I\nGENERAL PROVISIONS\nArticle 1\nSubject matter and scope\n1.   With a view to contributing to the objectives of the common fisheries policy set out in Article 2 of Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013, this Regulation establishes rules on the collection, management and use of biological, environmental, technical and socioeconomic data in the fisheries sector as provided for in Article 25 of Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013.\n2.

The Commission shall establish a multiannual Union programme for the collection and management of data referred to in Article 1(1), in accordance with the content and the criteria set out in Article 5.\nThe Commission shall adopt the part of the multiannual Union programme covering matters provided for in point (a) of Article 5(1) by means of delegated acts in accordance with Article 24.\nThe Commission shall adopt the part of the multiannual Union programme covering matters provided for in points (b) and (c) of Article 5(1) by means of implementing acts in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 25(2).\n2.   Before adopting the delegated and implementing acts provided for in paragraph 1 of this Article, the Commission shall consult the regional coordination groups referred to in Article 9, STECF and any other appropriate scientific bodies referred to in Article 26 of Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013.\nArticle 5\nContent and criteria for the establishment of the multiannual Union programme\n1.   The multiannual Union programme shall establish:\n(a)\na detailed list of the data requirements to achieve the objectives set out in Articles 2 and 25 of Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013;\n(b)\na list of mandatory research surveys at sea;\n(c)\nthresholds below which it is not mandatory for Member States to collect data based on their fishing and aquaculture activities or carry out research surveys at sea.\n2.   The data referred to in point (a) of paragraph 1 shall include:\n(a)\nbiological data on all stocks caught or by-caught in Union commercial and, where appropriate, recreational fisheries in and outside Union waters, including eels and salmon in relevant inland waters, as well as other diadromous fish species of commercial interest, to enable an ecosystem-based approach to fisheries management and conservation as necessary for the operation of the common fisheries policy;\n(b)\ndata to assess the impact of Union fisheries on the marine ecosystem in and outside Union waters, including data on by-catch of non-target species, in particular species protected under Union or international law, data on impacts of fisheries on marine habitats, including vulnerable marine areas, and data on impacts of fisheries on food webs;\n(c)\ndata on the activity of Union fishing vessels in and outside Union waters, including levels of fishing, and on effort and capacity of the Union fleet;\n(d)\nsocioeconomic data on fisheries to enable the socioeconomic performance of the Union fisheries sector to be assessed;\n(e)\nsocioeconomic data and sustainability data on marine aquaculture to enable the socioeconomic performance and the sustainability of the Union aquaculture sector, including its environmental impact, to be assessed;\n(f)\nsocioeconomic data on the fish processing sector to enable the socioeconomic performance of that sector to be assessed.\n3.   In addition, the data referred to in point (a) of paragraph 1 may include socioeconomic data and sustainability data on freshwater aquaculture to enable the socioeconomic performance and the sustainability of the Union aquaculture sector, including its environmental impact, to be assessed.\n4.   For the purpose of establishing the multiannual Union programme, the Commission shall take into account:\n(a)\nthe information needs for the management and efficient implementation of the common fisheries policy, with a view to reaching its objectives as set out in Article 2 of Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013. Such information shall also allow the targets required for the implementation of the multiannual plans referred to in Article 9 of that Regulation to be determined;\n(b)\nthe need for data that are relevant, comprehensive and reliable for the purpose of decisions on fisheries management and protection of ecosystems including vulnerable species and habitats;\n(c)\nthe need for and relevance of data for the sustainable development of aquaculture at Union level, taking account of the predominantly local character of its impacts;\n(d)\nthe need to support impact assessments of policy measures;\n(e)\ncosts and benefits, taking account of the most cost-effective solutions to achieve the objective of data collection;\n(f)\nthe need to avoid disruption of existing time-series;\n(g)\nthe need for simplification and to avoid duplication of data collection, in accordance with Article 1;\n(h)\nwhere relevant, the need for data to cover data-deficient fisheries;\n(i)\nregional specificities and regional agreements concluded in regional coordination groups;\n(j)\nthe international obligations of the Union and its Member States;\n(k)\nspatial and temporal coverage of the data collection activities.\n5.   The list of mandatory research surveys at sea referred to in point (b) of paragraph 1 shall be drawn up taking into account the following requirements:\n(a)\ninformation needs for the management of the common fisheries policy, with a view to reaching its objectives as set out in Article 2 of Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013;\n(b)\ninformation needs arising from internationally agreed coordination and harmonisation;\n(c)\ninformation needs for the evaluation of management plans;\n(d)\ninformation needs for the monitoring of ecosystems variables;\n(e)\ninformation needs for an adequate coverage of stock areas;\n(f)\nthe need to avoid duplication between research surveys at sea; and\n(g)\nthe need to avoid disruption of time-series.\n6.   For stocks that are subject to catch limits, the rules on participation by different Member States in the research surveys at sea referred to in point (b) of paragraph 1 shall be based upon the share of the relevant Member States in the total allowable catches that are available for the Union for the stocks concerned. For stocks that are not subject to catch limits, those rules shall be based upon the relative share of the relevant Member States in the total exploitation of the stock concerned.\n7.   For stocks that are subject to catch limits, the threshold referred to in point (c) of paragraph 1 shall be set on the basis of the share of the relevant Member State in the total allowable catches that are available for the Union for the stock concerned. For stocks that are not subject to catch limits, that threshold shall be set on the basis of the relative share of the relevant Member State in the total exploitation of the stock concerned. Regarding the aquaculture and the processing sector such thresholds shall be proportionate to the size of those sectors of a Member State.\nSECTION 2\nImplementation of the multiannual Union programme by the Member States\nArticle 6\nNational work plans\n1.   Without prejudice to their current data collection obligations under Union law, Member States shall collect data within the framework of an operational programme, as referred to in Article 18 of Regulation (EU) No 508/2014, and a work plan drawn up in accordance with the multiannual Union programme and pursuant to Article 21 of Regulation (EU) No 508/2014 (‘national work plan’).\n2.   When approving the national work plans in accordance with Article 21(2) of Regulation (EU) No 508/2014, the Commission shall take into account the evaluation conducted by STECF in accordance with Article 10 of this Regulation. If such evaluation indicates that a national work plan does not comply with this Article or does not ensure the scientific relevance of the data or sufficient quality of the proposed methods and procedures, the Commission shall immediately inform the Member State concerned and indicate amendments to that work plan that the Commission considers necessary. Subsequently, the Member State concerned shall submit a revised national work plan to the Commission.\n3.   National work plans shall contain a detailed description of the following:\n(a)\ndata to be collected in accordance with the multiannual Union programme;\n(b)\nthe temporal and spatial distribution and the frequency by which the data will be collected;\n(c)\nthe source of the data, the procedures and methods to collect and process the data into the data sets that will be provided to end-users of scientific data;\n(d)\nthe quality assurance and quality control framework to ensure adequate quality of the data in accordance with Article 14;\n(e)\nin what format and when data are to be made available to end-users of scientific data, taking into account the needs defined by the end-users of scientific data, where known;\n(f)\nthe international and regional cooperation and coordination arrangements, including bilateral and multilateral agreements concluded to achieve the objectives of this Regulation; and\n(g)\nhow the international obligations of the Union and its Member States have been taken into account.\n4.   In preparing its national work plan, each Member State shall, in the framework of the regional coordination groups referred to in Article 9, cooperate and coordinate its efforts with other Member States, in particular those in the same marine region, to ensure sufficient and efficient coverage and avoid duplication of data collection activities. In that process, Member States shall also aim to involve relevant stakeholders at the appropriate level. Where appropriate, such cooperation and coordination may also take place outside the framework of the regional coordination groups.\nArticle 7\nNational correspondents\n1.   Each Member State shall designate a national correspondent and shall inform the Commission thereof. The national correspondent shall serve as the focal point for exchange of information between the Commission and the Member State regarding the preparation and implementation of the national work plans.\n2.   Furthermore, the national correspondent shall, in particular, carry out the following tasks:\n(a)\ncoordinate the preparation of the annual report referred to in Article 11;\n(b)\nensure the transmission of information within the Member State; and\n(c)\ncoordinate attendance of relevant experts in expert group meetings organised by the Commission and participation in the relevant regional coordination groups referred to in Article 9.\n3.   If several bodies in a Member State are participating in the implementation of the national work plan, the national correspondent shall be responsible for the coordination of that work.\n4.   Each Member State shall ensure that its national correspondent has a sufficient mandate to represent its Member State in the regional coordination groups referred to in Article 9.\nArticle 8\nCooperation within the Union\nMember States shall cooperate and coordinate their actions to further improve the quality, timeliness and coverage of data enabling the reliability of data collection methods to be further improved, with a view to improving their data collection activities.\nArticle 9\nRegional coordination and cooperation\n1.   As provided for in Article 25 of Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013, Member States shall coordinate their data collection activities with other Member States in the same marine region and shall make every effort to coordinate their actions with third countries having sovereignty or jurisdiction over waters in the same marine region.\n2.   In order to facilitate regional coordination, regional coordination groups shall be established by the relevant Member States for each marine region.\n3.   Regional coordination groups shall aim at developing and implementing procedures, methods, quality assurance and quality control for collecting and processing data with a view to enabling the reliability of scientific advice to be further improved. For that purpose, regional coordination groups shall aim to develop and implement regional databases.\n4.   Regional coordination groups shall consist of experts appointed by Member States, including national correspondents, and the Commission.\n5.   Regional coordination groups shall draw up and agree on rules of procedures for their activities.\n6.   Regional coordination groups shall coordinate with each other and with the Commission, where issues affect several marine regions.\n7.   Representatives of relevant end-users of scientific data, including the appropriate scientific bodies as referred to in Article 26 of Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013, regional fisheries management organisations, Advisory Councils and third countries shall be invited to attend the meetings of the regional coordination groups as observers, where necessary.\n8.   Regional coordination groups may prepare draft regional work plans, which shall be compatible with this Regulation and with the multiannual Union programme. Those draft regional work plans may include procedures, methods, quality assurance and quality control for collecting and processing data as referred to in points (a) and (b) of paragraph 2 and in paragraph 5 of Article 5, regionally coordinated sampling strategies and conditions for delivery of data in regional databases. They may also contain cost-sharing arrangements for participation in research surveys at sea.\n9.   Where a draft regional work plan is prepared, the Member States concerned shall submit it to the Commission by 31 October of the year preceding the year from which the regional work plan is to apply, unless an existing plan still applies, in which case the Member States concerned shall notify the Commission thereof. The Commission may approve a draft regional work plan by means of an implementing act. Such implementing act shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 25(2). For that purpose, the Commission shall take into account, where relevant, the evaluation of STECF as referred to in Article 10. If such evaluation indicates that a draft regional work plan does not comply with this Article or does not ensure the scientific relevance of the data or sufficient quality of the proposed methods and procedures, the Commission shall immediately inform the Member States concerned and indicate amendments to that draft work plan that the Commission considers necessary. Subsequently, the Member States concerned shall submit a revised draft regional work plan to the Commission.\n10.   A regional work plan shall be considered to replace or supplement the relevant parts of the national work plans of each of the Member States concerned.\n11.   The Commission may adopt implementing acts laying down rules on procedures, cost-sharing arrangements for participation in research surveys at sea, the area of marine region for the purpose of data collection, and format and timetables for the submission and approval of regional work plans, as referred to in paragraph 8 of this Article. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 25(2).\nArticle 10\nEvaluation of work plans by STECF\nSTECF shall evaluate the national and draft regional work plans referred to in Articles 6 and 9. When doing so it shall take into account:\n(a)\nthe conformity of the work plans and any amendments thereto with Articles 6 and 9; and\n(b)\nthe scientific relevance of the data covered by the work plans for the purposes laid down in Article 1(1) and the quality of the proposed methods and procedures.\nArticle 11\nEvaluation and approval of the outcomes of the national work plans\n1.   Member States shall on an annual basis submit to the Commission a report on the implementation of their national work plans. The Commission may adopt implementing acts laying down rules on procedures, format and timetables for the submission and approval of annual reports. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 25(2).\n2.
