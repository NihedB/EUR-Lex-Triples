{"celex_id": "32009L0031", "reference": "5.6.2009\nEN\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\nL 140/114\nDIRECTIVE 2009/31/EC OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL\nof 23 April 2009\non the geological storage of carbon dioxide and amending Council Directive 85/337/EEC, European Parliament and Council Directives 2000/60/EC, 2001/80/EC, 2004/35/EC, 2006/12/EC, 2008/1/EC and Regulation (EC) No 1013/2006\n(Text with EEA relevance)\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 175(1) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the Commission,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee (1),\nAfter consulting the Committee of the Regions,\nActing in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty (2),\nWhereas:\n(1)\nThe ultimate objective of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, which was approved by Council Decision 94/69/EC of 15 December 1993 (3), is to stabilise greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system.\n(2)\nThe Sixth Community Environment Action Programme established by Decision No 1600/2002/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 July 2002 (4) identifies climate change as a priority for action. That programme recognises that the Community is committed to achieving an 8 % reduction in emissions of greenhouse gases by 2008 to 2012 compared to 1990 levels, and that, in the longer term, global emissions of greenhouse gases will need to be reduced by approximately 70 % compared to 1990 levels.\n(3)\nThe Commission Communication of 10 January 2007 entitled ‘Limiting global climate change to two degrees Celsius – The way ahead for 2020 and beyond’ clarifies that in the context of the envisaged global reduction of greenhouse gas emissions of 50 % by 2050, a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions of 30 % in the developed world by 2020 is required, rising to 60 %-80 % by 2050, that this reduction is technically feasible and the benefits far outweigh the costs, but that, to achieve it, all mitigation options must be harnessed.\n(4)\nCarbon dioxide capture and geological storage (CCS) is a bridging technology that will contribute to mitigating climate change. It consists of the capture of carbon dioxide (CO2) from industrial installations, its transport to a storage site and its injection into a suitable underground geological formation for the purposes of permanent storage. This technology should not serve as an incentive to increase the share of fossil fuel power plants. Its development should not lead to a reduction of efforts to support energy saving policies, renewable energies and other safe and sustainable low carbon technologies, both in research and financial terms.\n(5)\nPreliminary estimates, carried out with a view to assessing the impact of the Directive and referred to in the impact assessment of the Commission, indicate that seven million tonnes of CO2 could be stored by 2020, and up to 160 million tonnes by 2030, assuming a 20 % reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2020 and provided that CCS obtains private, national and Community support and proves to be an environmentally safe technology. The CO2 emissions avoided in 2030 could account for some 15 % of the reductions required in the Union.\n(6)\nThe Second European Climate Change Programme, which was established by the Commission Communication of 9 February 2005 entitled ‘Winning the Battle Against Global Climate Change’ to prepare and examine future climate policy in the Community, set up a Working Group on Carbon Capture and Geological Storage. The Working Group’s mandate was to explore CCS as a means of reducing climate change. The Working Group published a detailed report on the topic of regulation, which was adopted in June 2006. It stressed the need for the development of both policy and regulatory frameworks for CCS and urged the Commission to undertake further research into the subject.\n(7)\nThe Commission Communication of 10 January 2007 entitled ‘Sustainable power generation from fossil fuels: aiming for near-zero emissions from coal after 2020’ reiterated the need for a regulatory framework based on an integrated risk assessment for CO2 leakage, including site selection requirements designed to minimise the risk of leakage, monitoring and reporting regimes to verify storage and adequate remediation of any damage that may occur. The Communication set out an action plan for the Commission in this area during 2007, which required the development of a sound management framework for CCS, including the work on the regulatory framework, incentive framework, and support programmes, as well as external elements, for example technology cooperation with key countries on CCS.\n(8)\nThe European Council of March 2007 also urged the Member States and the Commission to work towards strengthening research and development and developing the necessary technical, economic and regulatory framework in order to remove existing legal barriers and to bring environmentally safe CCS to deployment with new fossil power plants, if possible by 2020.\n(9)\nThe European Council of March 2008 recalled that the objective of proposing a regulatory framework on CCS was to ensure that this novel technology would be deployed in an environmentally safe way.\n(10)\nThe European Council of June 2008 called on the Commission to bring forward as soon as possible a mechanism to incentivise Member State and private sector investments to ensure the construction and operation by 2015 of up to 12 CCS demonstration plants.\n(11)\nEach of the different components of CCS, namely capture, transport and storage of CO2, has been the object of pilot projects on a smaller scale than that required for their industrial application. These components still need to be integrated into a complete CCS process, technological costs need to be reduced and more and better scientific knowledge has to be gathered. It is therefore important that Community efforts on CCS demonstration within an integrated policy framework start as soon as possible, including, in particular, a legal framework for the environmentally safe application of CO2 storage, incentives, notably for further research and development, efforts by means of demonstration projects, and public awareness measures.\n(12)\nAt the international level, legal barriers to the geological storage of CO2 in geological formations under the seabed have been removed through the adoption of related risk management frameworks under the 1996 London Protocol to the 1972 Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping of Wastes and Other Matter (1996 London Protocol) and under the Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment of the North-East Atlantic (OSPAR Convention).\n(13)\nIn 2006, the Contracting Parties to the 1996 London Protocol adopted amendments to the Protocol. These amendments allow and regulate the storage of CO2 streams from CO2 capture processes in geological formations under the seabed.\n(14)\nThe Contracting Parties to the OSPAR Convention in 2007 adopted amendments to the Annexes to the Convention to allow the storage of CO2 in geological formations under the seabed, a Decision to ensure environmentally safe storage of CO2 streams in geological formations, and OSPAR Guidelines for Risk Assessment and Management of that activity. They also adopted a Decision to prohibit placement of CO2 into the water-column of the sea and on the seabed, because of the potential negative effects.\n(15)\nAt Community level, a number of legislative instruments are already in place to manage some of the environmental risks of CCS, in particular regarding capture and transport of CO2, and they should be used where possible.\n(16)\nDirective 2008/1/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 January 2008 concerning integrated pollution prevention and control (5) is suitable for regulating, in respect of certain industrial activities, the risks of CO2 capture to the environment and human health and, as a result, should be applied to the capture of CO2 streams for the purposes of geological storage from installations covered by that Directive.\n(17)\nCouncil Directive 85/337/EEC of 27 June 1985 on the assessment of the effects of certain public and private projects on the environment (6) should be applied to the capture and transport of CO2 streams for the purposes of geological storage. It should also apply to storage sites pursuant to this Directive.\n(18)\nThis Directive should apply to the geological storage of CO2 within the territory of the Member States, in their exclusive economic zones and on their continental shelves. The Directive should not apply to projects with a total intended storage below 100 kilotonnes, undertaken for research, development or testing of new products and processes. This threshold would also seem appropriate for the purposes of other relevant Community legislation. The storage of CO2 in storage complexes extending beyond the territorial scope of this Directive and the storage of CO2 in the water column should not be permitted.\n(19)\nMember States should retain the right to determine the areas within their territory from which storage sites may be selected. This includes the right of Member States not to allow any storage in parts or on the whole of their territory, or to give priority to any other use of the underground, such as exploration, production and storage of hydrocarbons or geothermal use of aquifers. In this context, Member States should in particular give due consideration to other energy-related options for the use of a potential storage site, including options which are strategic for the security of the Member State’s energy supply or for the development of renewable sources of energy. The selection of the appropriate storage site is crucial to ensure that the stored CO2 will be completely and permanently contained. Member States should, in selecting storage sites, take account of their geological characteristics, for example seismicity, in the most objective and effective way possible. A site should therefore only be selected as a storage site, if there is no significant risk of leakage, and if in any case no significant environmental or health impacts are likely to occur. This should be determined through a characterisation and assessment of a potential storage complex pursuant to specific requirements.\n(20)\nEnhanced Hydrocarbon Recovery (EHR) refers to the recovery of hydrocarbons in addition to those extracted by water injection or other means. EHR is not in itself included in the scope of this Directive. However, where EHR is combined with geological storage of CO2, the provisions of this Directive for the environmentally safe storage of CO2 should apply. In that case, the provisions of this Directive concerning leakage are not intended to apply to quantities of CO2 released from surface installations which do not exceed what is necessary in the normal process of extraction of hydrocarbons, and which do not compromise the security of the geological storage or adversely affect the surrounding environment. Such releases are covered by the inclusion of storage sites in Directive 2003/87/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 October 2003 establishing a scheme for greenhouse gas emission allowance trading within the Community (7), which requires surrender of emissions trading allowances for any leaked emissions.\n(21)\nMember States should make available to the public environmental information relating to geological storage of CO2 in accordance with applicable Community legislation.\n(22)\nMember States which intend to allow geological storage of CO2 in their territory should undertake an assessment of the storage capacity available within their territory. The Commission should organise an exchange of information and best practices between those Member States, in the context of the exchange of information provided for in this Directive.\n(23)\nMember States should determine in which cases exploration is required to generate the information necessary for the site selection. Exploration, that is activities intruding into the subsurface, should be made subject to a permit requirement. Member States do not need to set admission criteria for procedures for granting exploration permits, but where they do, they should at least ensure that the procedures for the granting of exploration permits are open to all entities possessing the necessary capacities. Member States should also ensure that the permits are granted on the basis of objective, published and non-discriminatory criteria. In order to protect and encourage exploration investments, exploration permits should be granted for a limited volume area and for a limited time during which the holder of the permit should have the sole right to explore the potential CO2 storage complex. Member States should ensure that no conflicting uses of the complex are permitted during this time. If no activities are carried out within a reasonable time, Member States should ensure that the exploration permit is withdrawn and can be granted to other entities.\n(24)\nStorage sites should not be operated without a storage permit. The storage permit should be the core instrument to ensure that the substantial requirements of this Directive are met and that geological storage therefore takes place in an environmentally safe way. In the granting of the storage permit, priority should be given to the holder of the exploration permit over competitors, as the former will generally have made substantial investments.\n(25)\nIn the early phase of the implementation of this Directive, to ensure consistency in implementation of the requirements of this Directive across the Community, all storage permit applications should be made available to the Commission after receipt. The draft storage permits should be transmitted to the Commission to enable it to issue an opinion on the draft permits within four months of their receipt. The national authorities should take this opinion into consideration when taking a decision on the permit and should justify any departure from the Commission’s opinion. The review at Community level should also help to enhance public confidence in CCS.\n(26)\nThe competent authority should review and where necessary update or withdraw the storage permit if, inter alia, it has been notified of leakages or significant irregularities, if the reports submitted by the operators or the inspections carried out show non-compliance with permit conditions or if it is made aware of any other failure by the operator to comply with the permit conditions. After the withdrawal of a permit, the competent authority should either issue a new permit or close the storage site. In the meantime, the competent authority should take over the responsibility for the storage site, including specific legal obligations. Costs incurred should be recovered from the former operator.\n(27)\nIt is necessary to impose on the composition of the CO2 stream constraints that are consistent with the primary purpose of geological storage, which is to isolate CO2 emissions from the atmosphere, and that are based on the risks that contamination may pose to the safety and security of the transport and storage network and to the environment and human health. To this end, the composition of the CO2 stream should be verified prior to injection and storage. The composition of the CO2 stream is the result of the processes at the capture installations. Following inclusion of capture installations in Directive 85/337/EEC, an environmental impact assessment has to be carried out in the capture permit process. Inclusion of capture installations in Directive 2008/1/EC further ensures that best available techniques to improve the composition of the CO2 stream have to be established and applied. In addition, in accordance with this Directive, the operator of the storage site should only accept and inject CO2 streams if an analysis of the composition, including corrosive substances, of the streams, and a risk assessment have been carried out, and if the risk assessment has shown that the contamination levels of the CO2 stream are in line with the composition criteria referred to in this Directive.\n(28)\nMonitoring is essential to assess whether injected CO2 is behaving as expected, whether any migration or leakage occurs, and whether any identified leakage is damaging the environment or human health. To that end, Member States should ensure that during the operational phase, the operator monitors the storage complex and the injection facilities on the basis of a monitoring plan designed pursuant to specific monitoring requirements. The plan should be submitted to and approved by the competent authority. In the case of geological storage under the seabed, monitoring should further be adapted to the specific conditions for the management of CCS in the marine environment.\n(29)\nThe operator should report, inter alia, the results of the monitoring to the competent authority at least once a year. In addition, Member States should establish a system of inspections to ensure that the storage site is operated in compliance with the requirements of this Directive.\n(30)\nProvisions are required concerning liability for damage to the local environment and the climate, resulting from any failure of permanent containment of CO2. Liability for environmental damage (damage to protected species and natural habitats, water and land) is regulated by Directive 2004/35/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 April 2004 on environmental liability with regard to the prevention and remedying of environmental damage (8), which should be applied to the operation of storage sites pursuant to this Directive. Liability for climate damage as a result of leakages is covered by the inclusion of storage sites in Directive 2003/87/EC, which requires surrender of emissions trading allowances for any leaked emissions. In addition, this Directive should establish the obligation on the operator of the storage site to take corrective measures in case of leakages or significant irregularities on the basis of a corrective measures plan submitted to and approved by the competent national authority. Where the operator fails to take the necessary corrective measures, these measures should be taken by the competent authority, which should recover the costs from the operator.\n(31)\nA storage site should be closed if the relevant conditions stated in the permit have been complied with, upon request from the operator after authorisation of the competent authority, or if the competent authority so decides after the withdrawal of a storage permit.\n(32)\nAfter a storage site has been closed, the operator should remain responsible for maintenance, monitoring and control, reporting, and corrective measures pursuant to the requirements of this Directive on the basis of a post-closure plan submitted to and approved by the competent authority as well as for all ensuing obligations under other relevant Community legislation until the responsibility for the storage site is transferred to the competent authority.\n(33)\nThe responsibility for the storage site, including specific legal obligations, should be transferred to the competent authority, if and when all available evidence indicates that the stored CO2 will be completely and permanently contained. To this end, the operator should submit a report to the competent authority for approval of the transfer. In the early phase of the implementation of this Directive, to ensure consistency in implementation of the requirements of this Directive across the Community, all reports should be made available to the Commission after receipt. The draft approval decisions should be transmitted to the Commission to enable it to issue an opinion on the draft approval decisions within four months of their receipt. The national authorities should take this opinion into consideration when taking a decision on the approval and should justify any departure from the Commission’s opinion. The review of draft approval decisions should, in the same way as the review of draft storage permits at Community level, also help to enhance public confidence in CCS.\n(34)\nLiabilities other than those covered by this Directive, Directive 2003/87/EC and Directive 2004/35/EC, in particular concerning the injection phase, the closure of the storage site and the period after transfer of legal obligations to the competent authority, should be dealt with at national level.\n(35)\nAfter the transfer of responsibility, monitoring should be reduced to a level which still allows for identification of leakages or significant irregularities, but should again be intensified if leakages or significant irregularities are identified. There should be no recovery of costs incurred by the competent authority from the former operator after the transfer of responsibility except in the case of fault on the part of the operator prior to the transfer of responsibility for the storage site.\n(36)\nFinancial provision should be made in order to ensure that closure and post-closure obligations, obligations arising from inclusion under Directive 2003/87/EC, and obligations under this Directive to take corrective measures in case of leakages or significant irregularities, can be met. Member States should ensure that financial provision, by way of financial security or any other equivalent, is made by the potential operator so that it is valid and effective before commencement of injection.\n(37)\nNational authorities may, after transfer of responsibility, have to bear costs, such as monitoring costs, associated with CO2 storage. A financial contribution should therefore be made available by the operator to the competent authority, before the transfer of responsibility takes place and on the basis of arrangements to be decided by Member States. This financial contribution should at least cover the anticipated cost of monitoring for a period of 30 years. The level of the financial contribution should be determined on the basis of guidelines to be adopted by the Commission to help ensure consistency in implementation of the requirements of this Directive across the Community.\n(38)\nAccess to CO2 transport networks and storage sites, irrespective of the geographical location of potential users within the Union, could become a condition for entry into or competitive operation within the internal electricity and heat market, depending on the relative prices of carbon and CCS. It is therefore appropriate to make arrangements for potential users to obtain such access. This should be done in a manner to be determined by each Member State, applying the objectives of fair, open and non-discriminatory access and taking into account, inter alia, the transport and storage capacity which is available or can reasonably be made available as well as the proportion of its CO2 reduction obligations pursuant to international legal instruments and to Community legislation intended to be met through CCS. Pipelines for CO2 transport should, where possible, be designed so as to facilitate access of CO2 streams meeting reasonable minimum composition thresholds. Member States should also establish dispute settlement mechanisms to enable expeditious settlement of disputes regarding access to transport networks and storage sites.\n(39)\nProvisions are required to ensure that, in cases of transboundary CO2 transport, transboundary storage sites or transboundary storage complexes, the competent authorities of the Member States concerned meet jointly the requirements of this Directive and of all other Community legislation.\n(40)\nThe competent authority should establish and maintain a register of the storage permits granted and of all closed storage sites and surrounding storage complexes, including maps of their spatial extent to be taken into consideration by the competent national authorities in relevant planning and permitting procedures. The register should also be reported to the Commission.\n(41)\nMember States should submit reports on the implementation of this Directive on the basis of questionnaires drawn up by the Commission pursuant to Council Directive 91/692/EEC of 23 December 1991 standardising and rationalising reports on the implementation of certain Directives relating to the environment (9).\n(42)\nMember States should lay down rules on penalties applicable to infringements of the national provisions adopted pursuant to this Directive. Those penalties should be effective, proportionate and dissuasive.\n(43)\nThe measures necessary for the implementation of this Directive should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission (10).\n(44)\nIn particular the Commission should be empowered to amend the Annexes. Since those measures are of general scope and are designed to amend non-essential elements of this Directive, they must be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny provided for in Article 5a of Decision 1999/468/EC.\n(45)\nDirective 85/337/EEC should be amended to cover capture and transport of CO2 streams for the purposes of geological storage as well as storage sites pursuant to this Directive. Directive 2004/35/EC should be amended to cover the operation of storage sites pursuant to this Directive. Directive 2008/1/EC should be amended to cover capture of CO2 streams for the purposes of geological storage from installations covered by that Directive.\n(46)\nThe adoption of this Directive should ensure a high level of protection of the environment and human health from the risks posed by the geological storage of CO2. For this reason, Directive 2006/12/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 5 April 2006 on waste (11) and Regulation (EC) No 1013/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 14 June 2006 on shipments of waste (12) should be amended so as to exclude CO2 captured and transported for the purposes of geological storage from the scope of application of those instruments. Directive 2000/60/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 October 2000 establishing a framework for Community action in the field of water policy (13) should also be amended to allow for injection of CO2 into saline aquifers for the purposes of geological storage. Any such injection is subject to the provisions of Community legislation on the protection of groundwater, and must be in accordance with Article 4(1)(b) of Directive 2000/60/EC and with Directive 2006/118/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 December 2006 on the protection of groundwater against pollution and deterioration (14).\n(47)\nThe transition to low-carbon power generation requires that, in the case of fossil fuel power generation, new investments be made in such a way as to facilitate substantial reductions in emissions. To this end, Directive 2001/80/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 October 2001 on the limitation of emissions of certain pollutants into the air from large combustion plants (15) should be amended to require that all combustion plants of a specified capacity, for which the original construction licence or the original operating licence is granted after the entry into force of this Directive, have suitable space on the installation site for the equipment necessary to capture and compress CO2 if suitable storage sites are available, and if CO2 transport and retrofitting for CO2 capture are technically and economically feasible. The economic feasibility of the transport and retrofitting should be assessed taking into account the anticipated costs of avoided CO2 for the particular local conditions in the case of retrofitting and the anticipated costs of CO2 allowances in the Community. The projections should be based on the latest evidence; a review of technical options and an analysis of uncertainties in the assessment processes should also be undertaken. The competent authority should determine whether these conditions are met on the basis of an assessment made by the operator and other available information, particularly concerning the protection of the environment and human health.\n(48)\nThe Commission should, by 30 June 2015, conduct a review of this Directive in the light of the experience gained in the early phase of its implementation and make proposals for its revision as appropriate.\n(49)\nSince the objective of this Directive, namely the establishment of a legal framework for the environmentally safe storage of CO2, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States acting individually, and can therefore, by reason of its scale and effects, be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Directive does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve that objective.\n(50)\nIn accordance with point 34 of the Interinstitutional agreement on better law-making (16), Member States are encouraged to draw up, for themselves and in the interest of the Community, their own tables, which will, as far as possible, illustrate the correlation between this Directive and the transposition measures and to make them public.\n(51)\nThe application of this Directive is without prejudice to Articles 87 and 88 of the Treaty,\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:\nCHAPTER 1\nSUBJECT MATTER, SCOPE AND DEFINITIONS\nArticle 1\nSubject matter and purpose\n1.   This Directive establishes a legal framework for the environmentally safe geological storage of carbon dioxide (CO2) to contribute to the fight against climate change.\n2.   The purpose of environmentally safe geological storage of CO2 is permanent containment of CO2 in such a way as to prevent and, where this is not possible, eliminate as far as possible negative effects and any risk to the environment and human health.\nArticle 2\nScope and prohibition\n1.

Member States shall retain the right to determine the areas from which storage sites may be selected pursuant to the requirements of this Directive. This includes the right of Member States not to allow for any storage in parts or in the whole of their territory.\n2.   Member States which intend to allow geological storage of CO2 in their territory shall undertake an assessment of the storage capacity available in parts or in the whole of their territory, including by allowing exploration pursuant to Article 5. The Commission may organise an exchange of information and best practices between those Member States, in the context of the exchange of information provided for in Article 27.\n3.   The suitability of a geological formation for use as a storage site shall be determined through a characterisation and assessment of the potential storage complex and surrounding area pursuant to the criteria specified in Annex I.\n4.   A geological formation shall only be selected as a storage site, if under the proposed conditions of use there is no significant risk of leakage, and if no significant environmental or health risks exist.\nArticle 5\nExploration permits\n1.   Where Member States determine that exploration is required to generate the information necessary for selection of storage sites pursuant to Article 4, they shall ensure that no such exploration takes place without an exploration permit.\nWhere appropriate, monitoring of injection tests may be included in the exploration permit.\n2.   Member States shall ensure that the procedures for the granting of exploration permits are open to all entities possessing the necessary capacities and that the permits are granted or refused on the basis of objective, published and non-discriminatory criteria.\n3.   The duration of a permit shall not exceed the period necessary to carry out the exploration for which it is granted. However, the Member States may extend the validity of the permit where the stipulated duration is insufficient to complete the exploration concerned and where the exploration has been performed in accordance with the permit. Exploration permits shall be granted in respect of a limited volume area.\n4.   The holder of an exploration permit shall have the sole right to explore the potential CO2 storage complex. Member States shall ensure that no conflicting uses of the complex are permitted during the period of validity of the permit.\nCHAPTER 3\nSTORAGE PERMITS\nArticle 6\nStorage permits\n1.   Member States shall ensure that no storage site is operated without a storage permit, that there shall be only one operator for each storage site, and that no conflicting uses are permitted on the site.\n2.

Where the competent authority is satisfied that the conditions referred to in points (a) to (d) of paragraph 1 are complied with, it shall adopt the final decision and notify that decision to the operator. The competent authority shall also notify the final decision to the Commission, and where it departs from the Commission opinion it shall state its reasons.\n6.   After the transfer of responsibility, routine inspections provided for in Article 15(3) shall cease and monitoring may be reduced to a level which allows for detection of leakages or significant irregularities. If any leakages or significant irregularities are detected, monitoring shall be intensified as required to assess the scale of the problem and the effectiveness of corrective measures.\n7.   In cases where there has been fault on the part of the operator, including cases of deficient data, concealment of relevant information, negligence, wilful deceit or a failure to exercise due diligence, the competent authority shall recover from the former operator the costs incurred after the transfer of responsibility has taken place. Without prejudice to Article 20, there shall be no further recovery of costs after the transfer of responsibility.\n8.   Where a storage site has been closed pursuant to Article 17(1)(c), transfer of responsibility shall be deemed to take place if and when all available evidence indicates that the stored CO2 will be completely and permanently contained, and after the site has been sealed and the injection facilities have been removed.\nArticle 19\nFinancial security\n1.   Member States shall ensure that proof that adequate provisions can be established, by way of financial security or any other equivalent, on the basis of arrangements to be decided by the Member States, is presented by the potential operator as part of the application for a storage permit. This is in order to ensure that all obligations arising under the permit issued pursuant to this Directive, including closure and post-closure requirements, as well as any obligations arising from inclusion of the storage site under Directive 2003/87/EC, can be met. This financial security shall be valid and effective before commencement of injection.\n2.   The financial security shall be periodically adjusted to take account of changes to the assessed risk of leakage and the estimated costs of all obligations arising under the permit issued pursuant to this Directive as well as any obligations arising from inclusion of the storage site under Directive 2003/87/EC.\n3.   The financial security or any other equivalent referred to in paragraph 1 shall remain valid and effective:\n(a)\nafter a storage site has been closed pursuant to points (a) or (b) of Article 17(1), until the responsibility for the storage site is transferred to the competent authority pursuant to Article 18(1) to (5);\n(b)\nafter the withdrawal of a storage permit pursuant to Article 11(3):\n(i)\nuntil a new storage permit has been issued;\n(ii)\nwhere the site is closed pursuant to Article 17(1)(c), until the transfer of responsibility pursuant to Article 18(8), provided the financial obligations referred to in Article 20 have been fulfilled.\nArticle 20\nFinancial mechanism\n1.   Member States shall ensure that the operator, on the basis of arrangements to be decided by the Member States, makes a financial contribution available to the competent authority before the transfer of responsibility pursuant to Article 18 has taken place. The contribution from the operator shall take into account those criteria referred to in Annex I and elements relating to the history of storing CO2 relevant to determining the post-transfer obligations, and cover at least the anticipated cost of monitoring for a period of 30 years. This financial contribution may be used to cover the costs borne by the competent authority after the transfer of responsibility to ensure that the CO2 is completely and permanently contained in geological storage sites after the transfer of responsibility.\n2.   The Commission may adopt guidelines for the estimation of the costs referred to in paragraph 1 to be developed in consultation with Member States with a view to ensuring transparency and predictability for operators.\nCHAPTER 5\nTHIRD-PARTY ACCESS\nArticle 21\nAccess to transport network and storage sites\n1.

Derogations from one or more of these criteria may be permitted by the competent authority provided the operator has demonstrated that the capacity of the characterisation and assessment to enable the determinations pursuant to Article 4 is not affected.\nStep 1:   Data collection\nSufficient data shall be accumulated to construct a volumetric and three-dimensional static (3-D)-earth model for the storage site and storage complex, including the caprock, and the surrounding area, including the hydraulically connected areas. This data shall cover at least the following intrinsic characteristics of the storage complex:\n(a)\ngeology and geophysics;\n(b)\nhydrogeology (in particular existence of ground water intended for consumption);\n(c)\nreservoir engineering (including volumetric calculations of pore volume for CO2 injection and ultimate storage capacity);\n(d)\ngeochemistry (dissolution rates, mineralisation rates);\n(e)\ngeomechanics (permeability, fracture pressure);\n(f)\nseismicity;\n(g)\npresence and condition of natural and man-made pathways, including wells and boreholes which could provide leakage pathways.\nThe following characteristics of the complex vicinity shall be documented:\n(h)\ndomains surrounding the storage complex that may be affected by the storage of CO2 in the storage site;\n(i)\npopulation distribution in the region overlying the storage site;\n(j)\nproximity to valuable natural resources (including in particular Natura 2000 areas pursuant to Council Directive 79/409/EEC of 2 April 1979 on the conservation of wild birds (1) and Council Directive 92/43/EEC of 21 May 1992 on the conservation of natural habitats and of wild fauna and flora (2), potable groundwater and hydrocarbons);\n(k)\nactivities around the storage complex and possible interactions with these activities (for example, exploration, production and storage of hydrocarbons, geothermal use of aquifers and use of underground water reserves);\n(l)\nproximity to the potential CO2 source(s) (including estimates of the total potential mass of CO2 economically available for storage) and adequate transport networks.\nStep 2:   Building the three-dimensional static geological earth model\nUsing the data collected in Step 1, a three-dimensional static geological earth model, or a set of such models, of the candidate storage complex, including the caprock and the hydraulically connected areas and fluids shall be built using computer reservoir simulators. The static geological earth model(s) shall characterise the complex in terms of:\n(a)\ngeological structure of the physical trap;\n(b)\ngeomechanical, geochemical and flow properties of the reservoir overburden (caprock, seals, porous and permeable horizons) and surrounding formations;\n(c)\nfracture system characterisation and presence of any human-made pathways;\n(d)\nareal and vertical extent of the storage complex;\n(e)\npore space volume (including porosity distribution);\n(f)\nbaseline fluid distribution;\n(g)\nany other relevant characteristics.\nThe uncertainty associated with each of the parameters used to build the model shall be assessed by developing a range of scenarios for each parameter and calculating the appropriate confidence limits. Any uncertainty associated with the model itself shall also be assessed.\nStep 3:   Characterisation of the storage dynamic behaviour, sensitivity characterisation, risk assessment\nThe characterisations and assessment shall be based on dynamic modelling, comprising a variety of time-step simulations of CO2 injection into the storage site using the three-dimensional static geological earth model(s) in the computerised storage complex simulator constructed under Step 2.\nStep 3.1: Characterisation of the storage dynamic behaviour\nAt least the following factors shall be considered:\n(a)\npossible injection rates and CO2 stream properties;\n(b)\nthe efficacy of coupled process modelling (that is, the way various single effects in the simulator(s) interact);\n(c)\nreactive processes (that is, the way reactions of the injected CO2 with in situ minerals feedback in the model);\n(d)\nthe reservoir simulator used (multiple simulations may be required in order to validate certain findings);\n(e)\nshort and long-term simulations (to establish CO2 fate and behaviour over decades and millennia, including the rate of dissolution of CO2 in water).\nThe dynamic modelling shall provide insight into:\n(f)\npressure and temperature of the storage formation as a function of injection rate and accumulative injection amount over time;\n(g)\nareal and vertical extent of CO2 vs time;\n(h)\nthe nature of CO2 flow in the reservoir, including phase behaviour;\n(i)\nCO2 trapping mechanisms and rates (including spill points and lateral and vertical seals);\n(j)\nsecondary containment systems in the overall storage complex;\n(k)\nstorage capacity and pressure gradients in the storage site;\n(l)\nthe risk of fracturing the storage formation(s) and caprock;\n(m)\nthe risk of CO2 entry into the caprock;\n(n)\nthe risk of leakage from the storage site (for example, through abandoned or inadequately sealed wells);\n(o)\nthe rate of migration (in open-ended reservoirs);\n(p)\nfracture sealing rates;\n(q)\nchanges in formation(s) fluid chemistry and subsequent reactions (for example, pH change, mineral formation) and inclusion of reactive modelling to assess affects;\n(r)\ndisplacement of formation fluids;\n(s)\nincreased seismicity and elevation at surface level.\nStep 3.2: Sensitivity characterisation\nMultiple simulations shall be undertaken to identify the sensitivity of the assessment to assumptions made about particular parameters. The simulations shall be based on altering parameters in the static geological earth model(s), and changing rate functions and assumptions in the dynamic modelling exercise. Any significant sensitivity shall be taken into account in the risk assessment.\nStep 3.3: Risk assessment\nThe risk assessment shall comprise, inter alia, the following:\n3.3.1.   Hazard characterisation\nHazard characterisation shall be undertaken by characterising the potential for leakage from the storage complex, as established through dynamic modelling and security characterisation described above. This shall include consideration of, inter alia:\n(a)\npotential leakage pathways;\n(b)\npotential magnitude of leakage events for identified leakage pathways (flux rates);\n(c)\ncritical parameters affecting potential leakage (for example maximum reservoir pressure, maximum injection rate, temperature, sensitivity to various assumptions in the static geological Earth model(s));\n(d)\nsecondary effects of storage of CO2, including displaced formation fluids and new substances created by the storing of CO2;\n(e)\nany other factors which could pose a hazard to human health or the environment (for example physical structures associated with the project).\nThe hazard characterisation shall cover the full range of potential operating conditions to test the security of the storage complex.\n3.3.2.   Exposure assessment — based on the characteristics of the environment and the distribution and activities of the human population above the storage complex, and the potential behaviour and fate of leaking CO2 from potential pathways identified under Step 3.3.1.\n3.3.3.   Effects assessment — based on the sensitivity of particular species, communities or habitats linked to potential leakage events identified under Step 3.3.1. Where relevant it shall include effects of exposure to elevated CO2 concentrations in the biosphere (including soils, marine sediments and benthic waters (asphyxiation; hypercapnia) and reduced pH in those environments as a consequence of leaking CO2). It shall also include an assessment of the effects of other substances that may be present in leaking CO2 streams (either impurities present in the injection stream or new substances formed through storage of CO2). These effects shall be considered at a range of temporal and spatial scales, and linked to a range of different magnitudes of leakage events.\n3.3.4.   Risk characterisation — this shall comprise an assessment of the safety and integrity of the site in the short and long term, including an assessment of the risk of leakage under the proposed conditions of use, and of the worst-case environment and health impacts. The risk characterisation shall be conducted based on the hazard, exposure and effects assessment. It shall include an assessment of the sources of uncertainty identified during the steps of characterisation and assessment of storage site and when feasible, a description of the possibilities to reduce uncertainty.\n(1)  OJ L 103, 25.4.1979, p. 1.\n(2)  OJ L 206, 22.7.1992, p. 7.\nANNEX II\nCRITERIA FOR ESTABLISHING AND UPDATING THE MONITORING PLAN REFERRED TO IN ARTICLE 13(2) AND FOR POST-CLOSURE MONITORING\n1.   Establishing and updating the monitoring plan\nThe monitoring plan referred to in Article 13(2) shall be established according to the risk assessment analysis carried out in Step 3 of Annex I, and updated with the purpose of meeting the monitoring requirements laid out in Article 13(1) according to the following criteria:\n1.1.   Establishing the plan\nThe monitoring plan shall provide details of the monitoring to be deployed at the main stages of the project, including baseline, operational and post-closure monitoring. The following shall be specified for each phase:\n(a)\nparameters monitored;\n(b)\nmonitoring technology employed and justification for technology choice;\n(c)\nmonitoring locations and spatial sampling rationale;\n(d)\nfrequency of application and temporal sampling rationale.\nThe parameters to be monitored are identified so as to fulfil the purposes of monitoring. However, the plan shall in any case include continuous or intermittent monitoring of the following items:\n(e)\nfugitive emissions of CO2 at the injection facility;\n(f)\nCO2 volumetric flow at injection wellheads;\n(g)\nCO2 pressure and temperature at injection wellheads (to determine mass flow);\n(h)\nchemical analysis of the injected material;\n(i)\nreservoir temperature and pressure (to determine CO2 phase behaviour and state).\nThe choice of monitoring technology shall be based on best practice available at the time of design. The following options shall be considered and used as appropriate:\n(j)\ntechnologies that can detect the presence, location and migration paths of CO2 in the subsurface and at surface;\n(k)\ntechnologies that provide information about pressure-volume behaviour and areal/vertical distribution of CO2-plume to refine numerical 3-D simulation to the 3-D-geological models of the storage formation established pursuant to Article 4 and Annex I;\n(l)\ntechnologies that can provide a wide areal spread in order to capture information on any previously undetected potential leakage pathways across the areal dimensions of the complete storage complex and beyond, in the event of significant irregularities or migration of CO2 out of the storage complex.\n1.2.   Updating the plan\nThe data collected from the monitoring shall be collated and interpreted. The observed results shall be compared with the behaviour predicted in dynamic simulation of the 3-D-pressure-volume and saturation behaviour undertaken in the context of the security characterisation pursuant to Article 4 and Annex I Step 3.\nWhere there is a significant deviation between the observed and the predicted behaviour, the 3-D model shall be recalibrated to reflect the observed behaviour. The recalibration shall be based on the data observations from the monitoring plan, and where necessary to provide confidence in the recalibration assumptions, additional data shall be obtained.\nSteps 2 and 3 of Annex I shall be repeated using the recalibrated 3-D model(s) so as to generate new hazard scenarios and flux rates and to revise and update the risk assessment.\nWhere new CO2 sources, pathways and flux rates or observed significant deviations from previous assessments are identified as a result of history matching and model recalibration, the monitoring plan shall be updated accordingly.\n2.   Post-closure monitoring\nPost-closure monitoring shall be based on the information collected and modelled during the implementation of the monitoring plan referred to in Article 13(2) and above in point 1.2 of this Annex. It shall serve in particular to provide information required for the determination of Article 18(1).", "summary": "Carbon dioxide capture and storage\nCarbon dioxide capture and storage\nThe geological storage of carbon dioxide (CO2) can prevent and minimise the harmful effects of climate change. This directive establishes rules to ensure this practice is done safely.\nACT\nDirective 2009/31/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 April 2009 on the geological storage of carbon dioxide and amending Council Directive 85/337/EEC, European Parliament and Council Directives 2000/60/EC, 2001/80/EC, 2004/35/EC, 2006/12/EC, 2008/1/EC and Regulation (EC) No 1013/2006.\nSUMMARY\nThe geological storage of carbon dioxide (CO2) can prevent and minimise the harmful effects of climate change. This directive establishes rules to ensure this practice is done safely.\nWHAT DOES THIS DIRECTIVE DO?\nThis directive, known as the Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) Directive, establishes a legal framework that helps tackle climate change through the environmentally safe geological storage of CO2.\nKEY POINTS\n—\nGeological CO2 storage sites must be environmentally safe. They cannot interfere with any bodies of water (because of potential negative effects of CO2 placed into water-columns) or present any health risks. Determining the suitability of these sites includes a rigorous process of data collection, computer static and dynamic modelling to make a 3D model of the candidate storage complex, sensitivity characterisation by applying various simulations on the 3D model and risk assessments using information gathered from the previous steps.\n—\nPermits are required to use geological storage sites. Permit applications, submitted to the competent authority of the EU country at hand, must include information such as the expected security of the storage site, the quantity of CO2 to be injected, the measures to prevent significant irregularities and a proposed monitoring plan. The Commission may issue a non-binding opinion on the draft storage permit to ensure consistency in the implementation of the requirements of the directive across the EU, therefore enhancing public confidence in CCS. Once issued, the competent authority reviews the permit 5 years after issue and every 10 years after that.\n—\nNo other waste or matter may be added to the CO2 storage sites for the purpose of waste disposal. CO2 monitoring results by site operators must be communicated to the competent authority once every year. Meanwhile, the monitoring plan must be updated by the site operator every 5 years and approved by the competent authority. In case of leakage, immediate action must be taken by the site operator (or by the competent authority if the site operator fails to do so) in line with the corrective measures plan approved by the competent authority as part of the storage permit.\n—\nStorage sites are closed if there is a substantiated request and conditions stated in the permit have been met by the site operator or if the competent authority decides to close the site after the withdrawal of the permit. Once closed, the operator remains responsible for the site until the conditions for transfer of responsibility are met (mainly the condition that the CO2 will be completely and permanently stored).\nWHEN DOES IT APPLY?\nFrom 25 June 2009.
