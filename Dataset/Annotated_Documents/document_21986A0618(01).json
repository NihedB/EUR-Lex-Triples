Except as may otherwise be provided in this Convention, decisions of the Commission shall be taken by a majority of the Contracting Parties, each Contracting Party having one vote. Two-thirds of the Contracting Parties shall constitue a quorum.\n4.   The Commission shall hold a regular meeting once every two years. A special meeting may be called at any time at the request of a majority of the Contracting Parties or by decision of the Council as constituted in Article V.\n5.   At its first meeting, and thereafter at each regular meeting, the Commission shall elect from among its members a chairman, a first vice-chairman and a second vice-chairman who shall not be re-elected for more than one term.\n6.   The meetings of the Commission and its subsidiary bodies shall be public unless the Commission otherwise decides.\n7.

In order to carry out the objectives of this Convention the Commission shall be responsible for the study of the populations of tuna and tuna-like fish (the Scombri-formes with the exception of the families Trichiuridae and Gempylidae and the genus Scomber) and such other species of fish exploited in tuna fishing in the Convention area as are not under investigation by another international fishery organization. Such study shall include research on the abundance, biometry and ecology of the fish; the oceanography of their environment; and the effects of natural human factors upon their abundance. The Commission, in carrying out these responsibilities, shall, in so far as feasible, utilize the technical and scientific services of, and information from, official agencies of the Contracting Parties and their political subdivisions and may, when desirable, utilize the available services and information of any public or private institution, organization or individual, and may undertake within the limits of its budget independent research to supplement the research work being done by governments, national institutions or other international organizations.\n2.   The carrying out of the provisions in paragraph 1 of this Article shall include:\n(a)\ncollecting and analyzing statistical information relating to the current conditions and trends of the tuna fishery resources of the Convention area;\n(b)\nstudying and appraising information concerning measures and methods to ensure maintenance of the populations of tuna and tuna-like fish in the Convention area at levels which will permit the maximum sustainable catch and which will ensure the effective exploitation of these fish in a manner consistent with this catch;\n(c)\nrecommending studies and investigations to the Contracting Parties;\n(d)\npublishing and otherwise disseminating reports of its findings and statistical, biological and other scientific information relative to the tuna fisheries of the Convention area.\nArticle V\n1.

In fact, the ICCAT Commission meets every year and is responsible for:\nstudying populations of tuna, tuna-like fish and elasmobranchs (as for instance sharks, skates, rays and sawfishes) that are oceanic, pelagic and highly migratory (ICCAT species), utilising where possible the technical and scientific services of official agencies of ICCAT Commission members;\ncollecting and analysing statistical information relating to the current conditions and trends of ICCAT species;\nstudying and appraising measures and methods to ensure populations of ICCAT species are maintained;\nrecommending studies and investigations to the Members of the Commission; and\npublishing its findings.\nThe ICCAT Council meets once in the interim between ICCAT Commission meetings. It is comprised of the ICCAT Chair and Vice-Chair and between 4 and 10 member representatives.\nThe ICCAT Commission appoints an Executive Secretary and may establish panels by species or geographic area.\nRecommendations\nOn the basis of scientific evidence, the ICCAT makes recommendations designed to:\nensure long-term conservation and sustainable use of ICCAT species by maintaining or restoring the abundance of the stocks at or above levels capable of producing maximum sustainable yield;\npromote the conservation of other species dependent on or associated with ICCAT species, to maintain or restore populations above levels at which their reproduction may become seriously threatened.\nObjections and disputes\nICCAT Commission members can present written objections to recommendations where:\nit is inconsistent with the convention or international law;\nit unjustifiably discriminates against the objecting member;\nthe member cannot practically comply; or\nthere are security constraints if the objecting member were to comply.\nParties to any dispute must consult each other to settle disputes by amicable means and as quickly as possible. If a dispute is not resolved, it can be submitted to final and binding arbitration by joint request. An annex lays out the procedures for resolving disputes.\nEnforcement\nMembers of the ICCAT Commission agree to do everything necessary to ensure the convention is enforced and must submit a statement of the action taken to achieve this every 2 years, or as required. ICCAT Commission members must:\nprovide any available statistical, biological and other scientific information on request;\nallow the ICCAT Commission to obtain voluntary information directly from companies and individuals;\ncollaborate with other members on suitable effective measures;\nset up a system of international enforcement for their areas of jurisdiction.\nFinancial arrangements\nEach ICCAT Commission member contributes to the budget an amount calculated in accordance with financial regulations adopted by the ICCAT Commission, based partly on the total round weight of catch and net weight of canned products, and the degree of economic development of members.\nCollaboration\nThe convention demands a working relationship between the ICCAT Commission and the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, and other international fisheries commissions and scientific organisations which might contribute to their work, with the possibility of participating (but not voting) in ICCAT Commission meetings.\nThe 2017 Regulation\nRegulation (EU) 2017/2107 sets out conservation and control rules for highly migratory fish managed by ICCAT (the species concerned are listed in an annex). The regulation includes detailed rules on specific measures for the following species within the ICCAT conventional area:\ntropical tunas,\nNorth Atlantic albacore,\nswordfish,\nblue marlin and white marlin,\nsharks,\nseabirds, and\nsea turtles.\nIt also includes rules concerning:\nauthorisations,\ncontrol of catches,\ntranshipment,\nscientific observer programmes,\ncontrol of non-EU fishing vessels in EU Member State ports, and\nenforcement.\nDATE OF ENTRY INTO FORCE\nThe convention entered into force on 21 March 1969.\nThe convention as amended by the protocol is open for signature by any United Nations member state or specialised agency. It enters into force when seven governments ratify, approve or adhere to it.\nThe regulation has applied since 3 December 2017.\nBACKGROUND\n              \nFor further information, see:\nRegional fisheries management organisations (European Commission)\nICCAT (website).\nMAIN DOCUMENTS\n            \nInternational Convention for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (OJ L 162, 18.6.1986, pp. 34–38).\nSuccessive amendments to the International Convention for Conservation of Atlantic Tunas have been incorporated into the original text.
