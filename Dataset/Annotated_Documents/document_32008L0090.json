{"celex_id": "32008L0090", "reference": "8.10.2008\nEN\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\nL 267/8\nCOUNCIL DIRECTIVE 2008/90/EC\nof 29 September 2008\non the marketing of fruit plant propagating material and fruit plants intended for fruit production\n(Recast version)\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 37 thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the Commission,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European Parliament (1),\nWhereas:\n(1)\nCouncil Directive 92/34/EEC of 28 April 1992 on the marketing of fruit plant propagating material and fruit plants intended for fruit production (2) has been substantially amended several times (3). Since further amendments are to be made, it should be recast in the interests of clarity.\n(2)\nFruit production occupies an important place in the agriculture of the Community.\n(3)\nSatisfactory results in the cultivation of fruit depend to a large extent on the quality and plant health of the material used for their propagation and of the fruit plants intended for fruit production.\n(4)\nHarmonised conditions at Community level ensure that purchasers throughout the Community receive propagating material and fruit plants which are healthy and of good quality.\n(5)\nIn so far as they relate to plant health, such harmonised conditions must be consistent with Council Directive 2000/29/EC of 8 May 2000 on protective measures against the introduction into the Community of organisms harmful to plants or plant products and against their spread within the Community (4).\n(6)\nIt is appropriate to establish Community rules for those genera and species of fruit plant which are of major economic importance in the Community, with a Community procedure for adding further genera and species later to the list of genera and species to which this Directive applies. The genera and species listed should be those which are widely grown in Member States and for whose propagating material and/or fruit plants there is a substantial market which covers more than one Member State.\n(7)\nWithout prejudice to the plant health provisions of Directive 2000/29/EC, it is not appropriate to apply the Community rules on the marketing of propagating material and fruit plants when it is shown that such products are intended for export to third countries, as the rules applicable there may be different from those contained in this Directive.\n(8)\nIn the interest of clarity the necessary definitions should be established. Those definitions should be based on technical and scientific progress and cover the term concerned in a complete and clear manner, in order to facilitate the harmonisation of the internal market taking into account all new opportunities of the market and all new processes used for the production of propagating material. Those definitions should be harmonised with those adopted for the marketing of other propagating material covered by Community legislation.\n(9)\nIt is desirable to establish plant health and quality standards for each genus and species of fruit plant based on international schemes which may include, inter alia, provisions for pathogen testing. It is appropriate to provide, therefore, for a system of harmonised rules for the different categories of propagating material and fruit plants to be marketed by reference to those international schemes, where available.\n(10)\nIt is consistent with current agricultural practice to require that propagating material and fruit plants are either officially examined or examined under official supervision as foreseen for other species covered by Community legislation.\n(11)\nGenetically modified propagating material and fruit plants should not be placed on the market and fruit varieties should not be officially registered unless all the appropriate measures have been taken to avoid any risk to human health or the environment as referred to in Directive 2001/18/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 March 2001 on the deliberate release into the environment of genetically modified organisms (5) and Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 September 2003 on genetically modified food and feed (6).\n(12)\nIt is desirable to ensure that genetic diversity is preserved and used in a sustainable way. Appropriate biodiversity conservation measures to guarantee the conservation of existing varieties should be taken in line with other relevant Community legislation.\n(13)\nIt is appropriate to establish conditions for the marketing of material intended for trials, scientific purposes or selection work if this material cannot fulfil the normal plant health and quality standards due to the particular use.\n(14)\nIn the first instance it is the responsibility of the suppliers of propagating material and/or fruit plants to ensure that their products fulfil the conditions laid down in this Directive. It is appropriate to define the role of the suppliers and the conditions to which they are to refer. Suppliers should be officially registered in order to create a transparent and economically valid process of certification of propagating material and fruit plants.\n(15)\nSuppliers marketing only to non-professional final consumers may be exempted from the obligation of registration.\n(16)\nIt is in the interests of the purchasers of propagating materials and fruit plants that the names of varieties be known and that their identity be safeguarded to permit the traceability of the system and to increase the confidence on the market.\n(17)\nThat objective can best be achieved either through common knowledge of the variety, in particular for old varieties, or through the availability of a description based on Community Plant Variety Office (CPVO) protocols or in their absence on other international or national rules.\n(18)\nIn order to ensure the identity and orderly marketing of propagating material and fruit plants, Community rules should be laid down concerning the separation of lots and marking. The labels should give the particulars needed both for official control and for the information of the user.\n(19)\nThe competent authorities of the Member States should, when carrying out controls and inspections, ensure that conditions with regard to propagating material or fruit plants and suppliers are fulfilled. The level, intensity and frequency of such inspections should be determined taking account of the category of material concerned.\n(20)\nCommunity control measures should be provided for to ensure uniform application in all the Member States of the standards laid down in this Directive.\n(21)\nRules should be established permitting, in the case of temporary supply difficulties due to natural disasters, such as fire and gales or unforeseen circumstances, the marketing of propagating material and fruit plants subject to requirements less stringent than those contained in this Directive for a limited period and subject to specific conditions.\n(22)\nIn accordance with the principle of proportionality, provision should be made to allow Member States to exempt small producers all of whose production and sales of propagating material and fruit plants is intended for final use by persons on the local market who are not professionally involved in plant production (local circulation) from the conditions on labelling and from the checks and official inspections.\n(23)\nMember States should be prohibited in the case of the genera and species referred to in Annex I from imposing new conditions or restrictions to the market other than those provided for in this Directive.\n(24)\nProvision should be made for authorising the marketing, within the Community, of propagating material and fruit plants produced in third countries, provided always that they afford the same guarantees as propagating material and fruit plants produced in the Community and complying with Community rules.\n(25)\nIn order to harmonise the technical methods of examination used in the Member States and to compare propagating material and fruit plants produced in the Community with those produced in third countries, comparative trials should be carried out to check compliance of such products with the requirements of this Directive.\n(26)\nIn order to avoid any disruption of trade, Member States should be allowed to authorise the marketing in their own territory of certified and CAC (Conformitas Agraria Communitatis) material taken from parent plants in existence and already certified or accepted as CAC material at the date of application of this Directive for a transitional period even if that material does not fulfil the new conditions.\n(27)\nThe measures necessary for the implementation of this Directive should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission (7).\n(28)\nThis Directive should be without prejudice to the obligations of the Member States relating to the time limits for transposition into national law and application of the Directives set out in Annex II, Part B,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:\nCHAPTER 1\nSCOPE AND DEFINITIONS\nArticle 1\nScope\n1.

marketing of fruit plant propagating material and fruit plants intended for fruit production\nWHAT IS THE AIM OF THE DIRECTIVE?\nIt updates and improves EU rules to ensure that purchasers receive propagating material* and fruit plants which are healthy and of good quality.\nIt improves and streamlines the system of rules in which businesses operate, reflecting scientific and technical progress and setting out clear conditions that have to be met to satisfy new consumer and industry needs.\nThe directive is a recast and replaces Council Directive 92/34/EEC.\nKEY POINTS\nScope\nIt applies to the marketing of fruit plant propagating material and fruit plants intended for fruit production within the EU.\nAnnex 1 provides a list of the genera and species (as well as their hybrids*) which are included.\nThe directive also applies to rootstocks* and other parts of plants of other genera or species (and hybrids) not listed in Annex 1, if material of genera or species listed in Annex I or their hybrids is grafted* or is to be grafted onto them.\nIt does not apply to propagating material or fruit plants intended for export to non-EU countries, provided they are identified as such and kept sufficiently isolated.\nThe directive covers:\nrequirements for propagating material and fruit plants — includes general requirements for being placed on the market and specific requirements for each genus and species mentioned in Annex 1;\nrequirements to be met by suppliers — including the rules for registration of suppliers and specific requirements related to the responsibility of suppliers in the production and reproduction process of all propagating material and fruit plants;\nvariety identification and labelling — propagating material and fruit plants must be marketed with a reference to the variety to which they belong. If the material does not belong to a variety, as may be the case for rootstocks, the species or interspecific hybrid must be mentioned;\nexemptions — small producers whose production and sales of propagating material and fruit plants is intended for final use by persons on the local market who are not professionally involved in plant production may be exempted from the labelling rules and checks and official inspections; propagating material and fruit plants produced in non-EU countries — until 31 December 2022 EU countries may assess if propagating material and fruit plants produced in a non-EU country is equivalent in all aspects to material produced in the EU;\ncontrol measures — covering: official inspections by EU countries — by a body officially appointed by the EU country and notified to the European Commission;EU monitoring — the Commission may inspect trials carried out by EU countries to check that material conforms with the directive’s requirements and conditions;checks — the Commission may organise on-the-spot checks;follow-up action — if a material is found not to meet the requirements, appropriate measures must be taken by the EU country including a ban on marketing of the materials.\nFROM WHEN DOES THE DIRECTIVE APPLY?\n              \nDirective 2008/90/EC revised and replaced Directive 92/34/EEC (and its subsequent amendments) and EU countries had to apply the new rules of Directive 2008/90/EC by 30 September 2012.\nBACKGROUND\nThe directive is the final step in establishing common EU rules for the marketing of propagating material.\nThe directive has been amended on 3 occasions including by Regulation (EU) No 652/2014 on EU spending on information about food and animal feed.\nFor more information, see: EU marketing requirements (European Commission).\nKEY TERMS\n              \nPropagating material: seeds, parts of plants and all plant material, including rootstocks, intended for the propagation and production of fruit plants.\nHybrid: plant obtained by grafting the upper part of one plant onto a rootstock of another plant to combine the best characteristics of the two plants.\nRootstock: a healthy root system and some portion of the stem which is used as the lower plant portion in grafting.\nGrafting: the process whereby the upper part of one plant is attached to the root system (rootstock) of another plant so that they appear to be a single plant.\nMAIN DOCUMENT\n            \nCouncil Directive 2008/90/EC of 29 September 2008 on the marketing of fruit plant propagating material and fruit plants intended for fruit production (Recast version) (OJ L 267, 8.10.2008, pp. 8-22)\nSuccessive amendments to Directive 2008/90/EC have been incorporated into the original document.
