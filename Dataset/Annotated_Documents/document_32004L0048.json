{"celex_id": "32004L0048", "reference": "30.4.2004\nEN\nOfficial Journal of the European Communities\nL 157/45\nDIRECTIVE 2004/48/EC OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL\nof 29 April 2004\non the enforcement of intellectual property rights\n(Text with EEA relevance)\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 95 thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the Commission,\nHaving regard to the Opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee (1),\nAfter consulting the Committee of the Regions,\nActing in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty (2),\nWhereas:\n(1)\nThe achievement of the Internal Market entails eliminating restrictions on freedom of movement and distortions of competition, while creating an environment conducive to innovation and investment. In this context, the protection of intellectual property is an essential element for the success of the Internal Market. The protection of intellectual property is important not only for promoting innovation and creativity, but also for developing employment and improving competitiveness.\n(2)\nThe protection of intellectual property should allow the inventor or creator to derive a legitimate profit from his invention or creation. It should also allow the widest possible dissemination of works, ideas and new know-how. At the same time, it should not hamper freedom of expression, the free movement of information, or the protection of personal data, including on the Internet.\n(3)\nHowever, without effective means of enforcing intellectual property rights, innovation and creativity are discouraged and investment diminished. It is therefore necessary to ensure that the substantive law on intellectual property, which is nowadays largely part of the acquis communautaire, is applied effectively in the Community. In this respect, the means of enforcing intellectual property rights are of paramount importance for the success of the Internal Market.\n(4)\nAt international level, all Member States, as well as the Community itself as regards matters within its competence, are bound by the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property (the \"TRIPS Agreement\"), approved, as part of the multilateral negotiations of the Uruguay Round, by Council Decision 94/800/EC (3) and concluded in the framework of the World Trade Organisation.\n(5)\nThe TRIPS Agreement contains, in particular, provisions on the means of enforcing intellectual property rights, which are common standards applicable at international level and implemented in all Member States. This Directive should not affect Member States' international obligations, including those under the TRIPS Agreement.\n(6)\nThere are also international conventions to which all Member States are parties and which also contain provisions on the means of enforcing intellectual property rights. These include, in particular, the Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property, the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works, and the Rome Convention for the Protection of Performers, Producers of Phonograms and Broadcasting Organisations.\n(7)\nIt emerges from the consultations held by the Commission on this question that, in the Member States, and despite the TRIPS Agreement, there are still major disparities as regards the means of enforcing intellectual property rights. For instance, the arrangements for applying provisional measures, which are used in particular to preserve evidence, the calculation of damages, or the arrangements for applying injunctions, vary widely from one Member State to another. In some Member States, there are no measures, procedures and remedies such as the right of information and the recall, at the infringer's expense, of the infringing goods placed on the market.\n(8)\nThe disparities between the systems of the Member States as regards the means of enforcing intellectual property rights are prejudicial to the proper functioning of the Internal Market and make it impossible to ensure that intellectual property rights enjoy an equivalent level of protection throughout the Community. This situation does not promote free movement within the Internal Market or create an environment conducive to healthy competition.\n(9)\nThe current disparities also lead to a weakening of the substantive law on intellectual property and to a fragmentation of the Internal Market in this field. This causes a loss of confidence in the Internal Market in business circles, with a consequent reduction in investment in innovation and creation. Infringements of intellectual property rights appear to be increasingly linked to organised crime. Increasing use of the Internet enables pirated products to be distributed instantly around the globe. Effective enforcement of the substantive law on intellectual property should be ensured by specific action at Community level. Approximation of the legislation of the Member States in this field is therefore an essential prerequisite for the proper functioning of the Internal Market.\n(10)\nThe objective of this Directive is to approximate legislative systems so as to ensure a high, equivalent and homogeneous level of protection in the Internal Market.\n(11)\nThis Directive does not aim to establish harmonised rules for judicial cooperation, jurisdiction, the recognition and enforcement of decisions in civil and commercial matters, or deal with applicable law. There are Community instruments which govern such matters in general terms and are, in principle, equally applicable to intellectual property.\n(12)\nThis Directive should not affect the application of the rules of competition, and in particular Articles 81 and 82 of the Treaty. The measures provided for in this Directive should not be used to restrict unduly competition in a manner contrary to the Treaty.\n(13)\nIt is necessary to define the scope of this Directive as widely as possible in order to encompass all the intellectual property rights covered by Community provisions in this field and/or by the national law of the Member State concerned. Nevertheless, that requirement does not affect the possibility, on the part of those Member States which so wish, to extend, for internal purposes, the provisions of this Directive to include acts involving unfair competition, including parasitic copies, or similar activities.\n(14)\nThe measures provided for in Articles 6(2), 8(1) and 9(2) need to be applied only in respect of acts carried out on a commercial scale. This is without prejudice to the possibility for Member States to apply those measures also in respect of other acts. Acts carried out on a commercial scale are those carried out for direct or indirect economic or commercial advantage; this would normally exclude acts carried out by end-consumers acting in good faith.\n(15)\nThis Directive should not affect substantive law on intellectual property, Directive 95/46/EC of 24 October 1995 of the European Parliament and of the Council on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data (4), Directive 1999/93/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 December 1999 on a Community framework for electronic signatures (5) and Directive 2000/31/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 8 June 2000 on certain legal aspects of information society services, in particular electronic commerce, in the Internal Market (6).\n(16)\nThe provisions of this Directive should be without prejudice to the particular provisions for the enforcement of rights and on exceptions in the domain of copyright and related rights set out in Community instruments and notably those found in Council Directive 91/250/EEC of 14 May 1991 on the legal protection of computer programs (7) or in Directive 2001/29/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 May 2001 on the harmonisation of certain aspects of copyright and related rights in the information society (8).\n(17)\nThe measures, procedures and remedies provided for in this Directive should be determined in each case in such a manner as to take due account of the specific characteristics of that case, including the specific features of each intellectual property right and, where appropriate, the intentional or unintentional character of the infringement.\n(18)\nThe persons entitled to request application of those measures, procedures and remedies should be not only the rightholders but also persons who have a direct interest and legal standing in so far as permitted by and in accordance with the applicable law, which may include professional organisations in charge of the management of those rights or for the defence of the collective and individual interests for which they are responsible.\n(19)\nSince copyright exists from the creation of a work and does not require formal registration, it is appropriate to adopt the rule laid down in Article 15 of the Berne Convention, which establishes the presumption whereby the author of a literary or artistic work is regarded as such if his name appears on the work. A similar presumption should be applied to the owners of related rights since it is often the holder of a related right, such as a phonogram producer, who will seek to defend rights and engage in fighting acts of piracy.\n(20)\nGiven that evidence is an element of paramount importance for establishing the infringement of intellectual property rights, it is appropriate to ensure that effective means of presenting, obtaining and preserving evidence are available. The procedures should have regard to the rights of the defence and provide the necessary guarantees, including the protection of confidential information. For infringements committed on a commercial scale it is also important that the courts may order access, where appropriate, to banking, financial or commercial documents under the control of the alleged infringer.\n(21)\nOther measures designed to ensure a high level of protection exist in certain Member States and should be made available in all the Member States. This is the case with the right of information, which allows precise information to be obtained on the origin of the infringing goods or services, the distribution channels and the identity of any third parties involved in the infringement.\n(22)\nIt is also essential to provide for provisional measures for the immediate termination of infringements, without awaiting a decision on the substance of the case, while observing the rights of the defence, ensuring the proportionality of the provisional measures as appropriate to the characteristics of the case in question and providing the guarantees needed to cover the costs and the injury caused to the defendant by an unjustified request. Such measures are particularly justified where any delay would cause irreparable harm to the holder of an intellectual property right.\n(23)\nWithout prejudice to any other measures, procedures and remedies available, rightholders should have the possibility of applying for an injunction against an intermediary whose services are being used by a third party to infringe the rightholder's industrial property right. The conditions and procedures relating to such injunctions should be left to the national law of the Member States. As far as infringements of copyright and related rights are concerned, a comprehensive level of harmonisation is already provided for in Directive 2001/29/EC. Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/29/EC should therefore not be affected by this Directive.\n(24)\nDepending on the particular case, and if justified by the circumstances, the measures, procedures and remedies to be provided for should include prohibitory measures aimed at preventing further infringements of intellectual property rights. Moreover there should be corrective measures, where appropriate at the expense of the infringer, such as the recall and definitive removal from the channels of commerce, or destruction, of the infringing goods and, in appropriate cases, of the materials and implements principally used in the creation or manufacture of these goods. These corrective measures should take account of the interests of third parties including, in particular, consumers and private parties acting in good faith.\n(25)\nWhere an infringement is committed unintentionally and without negligence and where the corrective measures or injunctions provided for by this Directive would be disproportionate, Member States should have the option of providing for the possibility, in appropriate cases, of pecuniary compensation being awarded to the injured party as an alternative measure. However, where the commercial use of counterfeit goods or the supply of services would constitute an infringement of law other than intellectual property law or would be likely to harm consumers, such use or supply should remain prohibited.\n(26)\nWith a view to compensating for the prejudice suffered as a result of an infringement committed by an infringer who engaged in an activity in the knowledge, or with reasonable grounds for knowing, that it would give rise to such an infringement, the amount of damages awarded to the rightholder should take account of all appropriate aspects, such as loss of earnings incurred by the rightholder, or unfair profits made by the infringer and, where appropriate, any moral prejudice caused to the rightholder. As an alternative, for example where it would be difficult to determine the amount of the actual prejudice suffered, the amount of the damages might be derived from elements such as the royalties or fees which would have been due if the infringer had requested authorisation to use the intellectual property right in question. The aim is not to introduce an obligation to provide for punitive damages but to allow for compensation based on an objective criterion while taking account of the expenses incurred by the rightholder, such as the costs of identification and research.\n(27)\nTo act as a supplementary deterrent to future infringers and to contribute to the awareness of the public at large, it is useful to publicise decisions in intellectual property infringement cases.\n(28)\nIn addition to the civil and administrative measures, procedures and remedies provided for under this Directive, criminal sanctions also constitute, in appropriate cases, a means of ensuring the enforcement of intellectual property rights.\n(29)\nIndustry should take an active part in the fight against piracy and counterfeiting. The development of codes of conduct in the circles directly affected is a supplementary means of bolstering the regulatory framework. The Member States, in collaboration with the Commission, should encourage the development of codes of conduct in general. Monitoring of the manufacture of optical discs, particularly by means of an identification code embedded in discs produced in the Community, helps to limit infringements of intellectual property rights in this sector, which suffers from piracy on a large scale. However, these technical protection measures should not be misused to protect markets and prevent parallel imports.\n(30)\nIn order to facilitate the uniform application of this Directive, it is appropriate to provide for systems of cooperation and the exchange of information between Member States, on the one hand, and between the Member States and the Commission on the other, in particular by creating a network of correspondents designated by the Member States and by providing regular reports assessing the application of this Directive and the effectiveness of the measures taken by the various national bodies.\n(31)\nSince, for the reasons already described, the objective of this Directive can best be achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality as set out in that Article, this Directive does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve that objective.\n(32)\nThis Directive respects the fundamental rights and observes the principles recognised in particular by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. In particular, this Directive seeks to ensure full respect for intellectual property, in accordance with Article 17(2) of that Charter,\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:\nCHAPTER I\nObjective and scope\nArticle 1\nSubject-matter\nThis Directive concerns the measures, procedures and remedies necessary to ensure the enforcement of intellectual property rights. For the purposes of this Directive, the term \"intellectual property rights\" includes industrial property rights.\nArticle 2\nScope\n1.   Without prejudice to the means which are or may be provided for in Community or national legislation, in so far as those means may be more favourable for rightholders, the measures, procedures and remedies provided for by this Directive shall apply, in accordance with Article 3, to any infringement of intellectual property rights as provided for by Community law and/or by the national law of the Member State concerned.\n2.   This Directive shall be without prejudice to the specific provisions on the enforcement of rights and on exceptions contained in Community legislation concerning copyright and rights related to copyright, notably those found in Directive 91/250/EEC and, in particular, Article 7 thereof or in Directive 2001/29/EC and, in particular, Articles 2 to 6 and Article 8 thereof.\n3.   This Directive shall not affect:\n(a)\nthe Community provisions governing the substantive law on intellectual property, Directive 95/46/EC, Directive 1999/93/EC or Directive 2000/31/EC, in general, and Articles 12 to 15 of Directive 2000/31/EC in particular;\n(b)\nMember States' international obligations and notably the TRIPS Agreement, including those relating to criminal procedures and penalties;\n(c)\nany national provisions in Member States relating to criminal procedures or penalties in respect of infringement of intellectual property rights.\nCHAPTER II\nMeasures, procedures and remedies\nSection 1\nGeneral provisions\nArticle 3\nGeneral obligation\n1.   Member States shall provide for the measures, procedures and remedies necessary to ensure the enforcement of the intellectual property rights covered by this Directive. Those measures, procedures and remedies shall be fair and equitable and shall not be unnecessarily complicated or costly, or entail unreasonable time-limits or unwarranted delays.\n2.   Those measures, procedures and remedies shall also be effective, proportionate and dissuasive and shall be applied in such a manner as to avoid the creation of barriers to legitimate trade and to provide for safeguards against their abuse.\nArticle 4\nPersons entitled to apply for the application of the measures, procedures and remedies\n1.   Member States shall recognise as persons entitled to seek application of the measures, procedures and remedies referred to in this Chapter:\n(a)\nthe holders of intellectual property rights, in accordance with the provisions of the applicable law,\n(b)\nall other persons authorised to use those rights, in particular licensees, in so far as permitted by and in accordance with the provisions of the applicable law,\n(c)\nintellectual property collective rights management bodies which are regularly recognised as having a right to represent holders of intellectual property rights, in so far as permitted by and in accordance with the provisions of the applicable law,\n(d)\nprofessional defence bodies which are regularly recognised as having a right to represent holders of intellectual property rights, in so far as permitted by and in accordance with the provisions of the applicable law.\nArticle 5\nPresumption of authorship or ownership\nFor the purposes of applying the measures, procedures and remedies provided for in this Directive,\n(a)\nfor the author of a literary or artistic work, in the absence of proof to the contrary, to be regarded as such, and consequently to be entitled to institute infringement proceedings, it shall be sufficient for his name to appear on the work in the usual manner;\n(b)\nthe provision under (a) shall apply mutatis mutandis to the holders of rights related to copyright with regard to their protected subject matter.\nSection 2\nEvidence\nArticle 6\nEvidence\n1.   Member States shall ensure that, on application by a party which has presented reasonably available evidence sufficient to support its claims, and has, in substantiating those claims, specified evidence which lies in the control of the opposing party, the competent judicial authorities may order that such evidence be presented by the opposing party, subject to the protection of confidential information. For the purposes of this paragraph, Member States may provide that a reasonable sample of a substantial number of copies of a work or any other protected object be considered by the competent judicial authorities to constitute reasonable evidence.\n2.   Under the same conditions, in the case of an infringement committed on a commercial scale Member States shall take such measures as are necessary to enable the competent judicial authorities to order, where appropriate, on application by a party, the communication of banking, financial or commercial documents under the control of the opposing party, subject to the protection of confidential information.\nArticle 7\nMeasures for preserving evidence\n1.   Member States shall ensure that, even before the commencement of proceedings on the merits of the case, the competent judicial authorities may, on application by a party who has presented reasonably available evidence to support his claims that his intellectual property right has been infringed or is about to be infringed, order prompt and effective provisional measures to preserve relevant evidence in respect of the alleged infringement, subject to the protection of confidential information. Such measures may include the detailed description, with or without the taking of samples, or the physical seizure of the infringing goods, and, in appropriate cases, the materials and implements used in the production and/or distribution of these goods and the documents relating thereto. Those measures shall be taken, if necessary without the other party having been heard, in particular where any delay is likely to cause irreparable harm to the rightholder or where there is a demonstrable risk of evidence being destroyed.\nWhere measures to preserve evidence are adopted without the other party having been heard, the parties affected shall be given notice, without delay after the execution of the measures at the latest. A review, including a right to be heard, shall take place upon request of the parties affected with a view to deciding, within a reasonable period after the notification of the measures, whether the measures shall be modified, revoked or confirmed.\n2.   Member States shall ensure that the measures to preserve evidence may be subject to the lodging by the applicant of adequate security or an equivalent assurance intended to ensure compensation for any prejudice suffered by the defendant as provided for in paragraph 4.\n3.   Member States shall ensure that the measures to preserve evidence are revoked or otherwise cease to have effect, upon request of the defendant, without prejudice to the damages which may be claimed, if the applicant does not institute, within a reasonable period, proceedings leading to a decision on the merits of the case before the competent judicial authority, the period to be determined by the judicial authority ordering the measures where the law of a Member State so permits or, in the absence of such determination, within a period not exceeding 20 working days or 31 calendar days, whichever is the longer.\n4.   Where the measures to preserve evidence are revoked, or where they lapse due to any act or omission by the applicant, or where it is subsequently found that there has been no infringement or threat of infringement of an intellectual property right, the judicial authorities shall have the authority to order the applicant, upon request of the defendant, to provide the defendant appropriate compensation for any injury caused by those measures.\n5.   Member States may take measures to protect witnesses' identity.\nSection 3\nRight of information\nArticle 8\nRight of information\n1.   Member States shall ensure that, in the context of proceedings concerning an infringement of an intellectual property right and in response to a justified and proportionate request of the claimant, the competent judicial authorities may order that information on the origin and distribution networks of the goods or services which infringe an intellectual property right be provided by the infringer and/or any other person who:\n(a)\nwas found in possession of the infringing goods on a commercial scale;\n(b)\nwas found to be using the infringing services on a commercial scale;\n(c)\nwas found to be providing on a commercial scale services used in infringing activities; or\n(d)\nwas indicated by the person referred to in point (a), (b) or (c) as being involved in the production, manufacture or distribution of the goods or the provision of the services.\n2.   The information referred to in paragraph 1 shall, as appropriate, comprise:\n(a)\nthe names and addresses of the producers, manufacturers, distributors, suppliers and other previous holders of the goods or services, as well as the intended wholesalers and retailers;\n(b)\ninformation on the quantities produced, manufactured, delivered, received or ordered, as well as the price obtained for the goods or services in question.\n3.   Paragraphs 1 and 2 shall apply without prejudice to other statutory provisions which:\n(a)\ngrant the rightholder rights to receive fuller information;\n(b)\ngovern the use in civil or criminal proceedings of the information communicated pursuant to this Article;\n(c)\ngovern responsibility for misuse of the right of information; or\n(d)\nafford an opportunity for refusing to provide information which would force the person referred to in paragraph 1 to admit to his own participation or that of his close relatives in an infringement of an intellectual property right; or\n(e)\ngovern the protection of confidentiality of information sources or the processing of personal data.\nSection 4\nProvisional and precautionary measures\nArticle 9\nProvisional and precautionary measures\n1.   Member States shall ensure that the judicial authorities may, at the request of the applicant:\n(a)\nissue against the alleged infringer an interlocutory injunction intended to prevent any imminent infringement of an intellectual property right, or to forbid, on a provisional basis and subject, where appropriate, to a recurring penalty payment where provided for by national law, the continuation of the alleged infringements of that right, or to make such continuation subject to the lodging of guarantees intended to ensure the compensation of the rightholder; an interlocutory injunction may also be issued, under the same conditions, against an intermediary whose services are being used by a third party to infringe an intellectual property right; injunctions against intermediaries whose services are used by a third party to infringe a copyright or a related right are covered by Directive 2001/29/EC;\n(b)\norder the seizure or delivery up of the goods suspected of infringing an intellectual property right so as to prevent their entry into or movement within the channels of commerce.\n2.   In the case of an infringement committed on a commercial scale, the Member States shall ensure that, if the injured party demonstrates circumstances likely to endanger the recovery of damages, the judicial authorities may order the precautionary seizure of the movable and immovable property of the alleged infringer, including the blocking of his bank accounts and other assets. To that end, the competent authorities may order the communication of bank, financial or commercial documents, or appropriate access to the relevant information.\n3.   The judicial authorities shall, in respect of the measures referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2, have the authority to require the applicant to provide any reasonably available evidence in order to satisfy themselves with a sufficient degree of certainty that the applicant is the rightholder and that the applicant's right is being infringed, or that such infringement is imminent.\n4.   Member States shall ensure that the provisional measures referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 may, in appropriate cases, be taken without the defendant having been heard, in particular where any delay would cause irreparable harm to the rightholder. In that event, the parties shall be so informed without delay after the execution of the measures at the latest.\nA review, including a right to be heard, shall take place upon request of the defendant with a view to deciding, within a reasonable time after notification of the measures, whether those measures shall be modified, revoked or confirmed.\n5.   Member States shall ensure that the provisional measures referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 are revoked or otherwise cease to have effect, upon request of the defendant, if the applicant does not institute, within a reasonable period, proceedings leading to a decision on the merits of the case before the competent judicial authority, the period to be determined by the judicial authority ordering the measures where the law of a Member State so permits or, in the absence of such determination, within a period not exceeding 20 working days or 31 calendar days, whichever is the longer.\n6.   The competent judicial authorities may make the provisional measures referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 subject to the lodging by the applicant of adequate security or an equivalent assurance intended to ensure compensation for any prejudice suffered by the defendant as provided for in paragraph 7.\n7.   Where the provisional measures are revoked or where they lapse due to any act or omission by the applicant, or where it is subsequently found that there has been no infringement or threat of infringement of an intellectual property right, the judicial authorities shall have the authority to order the applicant, upon request of the defendant, to provide the defendant appropriate compensation for any injury caused by those measures.\nSection 5\nMeasures resulting from a decision on the merits of the case\nArticle 10\nCorrective measures\n1.   Without prejudice to any damages due to the rightholder by reason of the infringement, and without compensation of any sort, Member States shall ensure that the competent judicial authorities may order, at the request of the applicant, that appropriate measures be taken with regard to goods that they have found to be infringing an intellectual property right and, in appropriate cases, with regard to materials and implements principally used in the creation or manufacture of those goods. Such measures shall include:\n(a)\nrecall from the channels of commerce,\n(b)\ndefinitive removal from the channels of commerce, or\n(c)\ndestruction.\n2.   The judicial authorities shall order that those measures be carried out at the expense of the infringer, unless particular reasons are invoked for not doing so.\n3.   In considering a request for corrective measures, the need for proportionality between the seriousness of the infringement and the remedies ordered as well as the interests of third parties shall be taken into account.\nArticle 11\nInjunctions\nMember States shall ensure that, where a judicial decision is taken finding an infringement of an intellectual property right, the judicial authorities may issue against the infringer an injunction aimed at prohibiting the continuation of the infringement. Where provided for by national law, non-compliance with an injunction shall, where appropriate, be subject to a recurring penalty payment, with a view to ensuring compliance. Member States shall also ensure that rightholders are in a position to apply for an injunction against intermediaries whose services are used by a third party to infringe an intellectual property right, without prejudice to Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/29/EC.\nArticle 12\nAlternative measures\nMember States may provide that, in appropriate cases and at the request of the person liable to be subject to the measures provided for in this Section, the competent judicial authorities may order pecuniary compensation to be paid to the injured party instead of applying the measures provided for in this Section if that person acted unintentionally and without negligence, if execution of the measures in question would cause him disproportionate harm and if pecuniary compensation to the injured party appears reasonably satisfactory.\nSection 6\nDamages and legal costs\nArticle 13\nDamages\n1.   Member States shall ensure that the competent judicial authorities, on application of the injured party, order the infringer who knowingly, or with reasonable grounds to know, engaged in an infringing activity, to pay the rightholder damages appropriate to the actual prejudice suffered by him as a result of the infringement.\nWhen the judicial authorities set the damages:\n(a)\nthey shall take into account all appropriate aspects, such as the negative economic consequences, including lost profits, which the injured party has suffered, any unfair profits made by the infringer and, in appropriate cases, elements other than economic factors, such as the moral prejudice caused to the rightholder by the infringement;\nor\n(b)\nas an alternative to (a), they may, in appropriate cases, set the damages as a lump sum on the basis of elements such as at least the amount of royalties or fees which would have been due if the infringer had requested authorisation to use the intellectual property right in question.\n2.   Where the infringer did not knowingly, or with reasonable grounds to know, engage in infringing activity, Member States may lay down that the judicial authorities may order the recovery of profits or the payment of damages, which may be pre-established.\nArticle 14\nLegal costs\nMember States shall ensure that reasonable and proportionate legal costs and other expenses incurred by the successful party shall, as a general rule, be borne by the unsuccessful party, unless equity does not allow this.\nSection 7\nPublicity measures\nArticle 15\nPublication of judicial decisions\nMember States shall ensure that, in legal proceedings instituted for infringement of an intellectual property right, the judicial authorities may order, at the request of the applicant and at the expense of the infringer, appropriate measures for the dissemination of the information concerning the decision, including displaying the decision and publishing it in full or in part. Member States may provide for other additional publicity measures which are appropriate to the particular circumstances, including prominent advertising.\nCHAPTER III\nSanctions by Member States\nArticle 16\nSanctions by Member States\nWithout prejudice to the civil and administrative measures, procedures and remedies laid down by this Directive, Member States may apply other appropriate sanctions in cases where intellectual property rights have been infringed.\nCHAPTER IV\nCodes of conduct and administrative cooperation\nArticle 17\nCodes of conduct\nMember States shall encourage:\n(a)\nthe development by trade or professional associations or organisations of codes of conduct at Community level aimed at contributing towards the enforcement of the intellectual property rights, particularly by recommending the use on optical discs of a code enabling the identification of the origin of their manufacture;\n(b)\nthe submission to the Commission of draft codes of conduct at national and Community level and of any evaluations of the application of these codes of conduct.\nArticle 18\nAssessment\n1.   Three years after the date laid down in Article 20(1), each Member State shall submit to the Commission a report on the implementation of this Directive.\nOn the basis of those reports, the Commission shall draw up a report on the application of this Directive, including an assessment of the effectiveness of the measures taken, as well as an evaluation of its impact on innovation and the development of the information society. That report shall then be transmitted to the European Parliament, the Council and the European Economic and Social Committee. It shall be accompanied, if necessary and in the light of developments in the Community legal order, by proposals for amendments to this Directive.\n2.   Member States shall provide the Commission with all the aid and assistance it may need when drawing up the report referred to in the second subparagraph of paragraph 1.\nArticle 19\nExchange of information and correspondents\nFor the purpose of promoting cooperation, including the exchange of information, among Member States and between Member States and the Commission, each Member State shall designate one or more national correspondents for any question relating to the implementation of the measures provided for by this Directive. It shall communicate the details of the national correspondent(s) to the other Member States and to the Commission.\nCHAPTER V\nFinal provisions\nArticle 20\nImplementation\n1.   Member States shall bring into force the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive by ... (9). They shall forthwith inform the Commission thereof.\nWhen Member States adopt these measures, they shall contain a reference to this Directive or shall be accompanied by such reference on the occasion of their official publication. The methods of making such reference shall be laid down by Member States.\n2.   Member States shall communicate to the Commission the texts of the provisions of national law which they adopt in the field governed by this Directive.\nArticle 21\nEntry into force\nThis Directive shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nArticle 22\nAddressees\nThis Directive is addressed to the Member States.\nDone at Strasbourg, 29.4.2004.\nFor the European Parliament\nThe President\nP.

In particular, it published a Guidance Communication clarifying the rules set out in this directive where there have been differing interpretations in EU countries. The measures follow an 10-point action plan for enforcing IPR in the EU set out by the Commission in 2014.\nKEY POINTS\nObjectives\nThe directive’s main objective is to ensure that the same tools are available throughout the EU for creators and innovators to be able to exercise their intellectual property rights. However, in addition to tackling counterfeiting and piracy, it also helps to achieve other objectives which include:\npromoting innovation and business competitiveness — punishing counterfeiting and piracy effectively, can help ensure confidence in the single market;\nsafeguarding employment in Europe — damage suffered by businesses as a result of counterfeiting and piracy is reflected in the number of jobs offered;\nensuring consumer protection — consumers are deliberately cheated as to the quality they are entitled to expect from a product posing risks to both health (e.g. counterfeit medicines or cosmetics) and safety (e.g. counterfeit toys or electrical appliances) and do not in principle benefit from a guarantee, after-sales service or effective remedy in the event of damage;\nensuring the maintenance of public order — counterfeiting and piracy infringe labour legislation (clandestine labour), tax legislation (loss of government revenue), health legislation and legislation on product safety.\nScope\nThe directive applies to any infringement of IPRs provided for by EU law and/or by the national law of the EU country concerned.\nThis directive does not affect:\nthe EU rules on the enforcement of rights concerning and related to copyright;\nEU rules governing the substantive law on intellectual property (that is, law defining rights and obligations in relation to intellectual property);\nEU countries’ international obligations and notably the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (known as the ‘TRIPS Agreement’);\nany national rules in EU countries relating to criminal procedures or penalties for infringing IPRs.\nGeneral obligation\nEU countries should set up the measures, procedures and remedies needed to ensure the enforcement IPRs and take appropriate action against those responsible for counterfeiting and piracy.\nThose measures, procedures and remedies should be effective, proportionate and dissuasive, but avoid creating barriers to legitimate trade and offer safeguards against their abuse.\nApplication for protection\nA request to apply intellectual property protection measures may be submitted by:\nthe holders of IPRs,\nall other persons authorised to use those rights (e.g. licensees) and bodies representing holders of intellectual property rights (intellectual property collective rights-management bodies and professional defence bodies) in accordance with the applicable law.\nRight of information\nAt the request of the claimant, a court may order information to be provided on the origin of the goods or services that are thought to infringe an IPR and on the networks for their distribution or supply, by the infringer or any other person, if that person:\nwas found in possession of the infringing goods on a commercial scale;\nwas found to be using the infringing services on a commercial scale;\nwas found to be providing on a commercial scale services used in infringing activities;\nwas indicated as being involved in the production, manufacture or distribution of the infringing goods or services.\nRules on obtaining and preserving the evidence\nAt the request of the applicant, a court may order the opposing party to present evidence which lies in its control, subject to the protection of confidential information. The court may also issue measures allowing relevant evidence to be preserved in respect of the alleged infringement.\nProvisional and precautionary measures\nAt the request of the applicant, a court may issue an interlocutory injunction* intended to:\nprevent any impending infringement of an IPR;\nforbid, on a provisional basis, the continuation of the alleged infringements of an IPR;\nmake the continuation of the alleged infringement subject to the lodging of guarantees intended to ensure that the right holder is compensated.\nIn certain cases, the judicial authorities may authorise the precautionary seizure of the movable and immovable property of the alleged infringer, including the blocking of his/her bank accounts and other assets.\nMeasures resulting from a decision on the case\nAt the request of the applicant, a court may order corrective measures allowing the recall or removal of the infringing goods from the market or their destruction.\nA court may also issue a permanent injunction preventing the infringement from continuing or award damages to the injured party.\nFROM WHEN DOES THE DIRECTIVE APPLY?\n              \nIt has applied since 20 May 2004 and had to become law in the EU countries by 29 April 2006.\nBACKGROUND\nEnforcement of Intellectual Property Rights (European Commission).\nKEY TERMS\n              \nInterlocutory injunction: also known as interim injunctions, these are temporary court orders requiring or preventing a party from doing certain acts pending the final ruling on the case.\nMAIN DOCUMENT\n            \nDirective 2004/48/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on the enforcement of intellectual property rights (OJ L 157, 30.4.2004, pp. 45-86).
