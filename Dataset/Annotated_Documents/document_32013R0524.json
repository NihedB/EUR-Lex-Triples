{"celex_id": "32013R0524", "reference": "18.6.2013\nEN\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\nL 165/1\nREGULATION (EU) No 524/2013 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL\nof 21 May 2013\non online dispute resolution for consumer disputes and amending Regulation (EC) No 2006/2004 and Directive 2009/22/EC (Regulation on consumer ODR)\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 114 thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee (1),\nActing in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure (2),\nWhereas:\n(1)\nArticle 169(1) and point (a) of Article 169(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) provide that the Union is to contribute to the attainment of a high level of consumer protection through measures adopted pursuant to Article 114 TFEU. Article 38 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union provides that Union policies are to ensure a high level of consumer protection.\n(2)\nIn accordance with Article 26(2) TFEU, the internal market is to comprise an area without internal frontiers in which the free movement of goods and services is ensured. In order for consumers to have confidence in and benefit from the digital dimension of the internal market, it is necessary that they have access to simple, efficient, fast and low-cost ways of resolving disputes which arise from the sale of goods or the supply of services online. This is particularly important when consumers shop cross-border.\n(3)\nIn its Communication of 13 April 2011 entitled ‘Single Market Act — Twelve levers to boost growth and strengthen confidence — “Working together to create new growth” ’, the Commission identified legislation on alternative dispute resolution (ADR) which includes an electronic commerce dimension as one of the twelve levers to boost growth and strengthen confidence in the Single Market.\n(4)\nFragmentation of the internal market impedes efforts to boost competitiveness and growth. Furthermore, the uneven availability, quality and awareness of simple, efficient, fast and low-cost means of resolving disputes arising from the sale of goods or provision of services across the Union constitutes a barrier within the internal market which undermines consumers’ and traders’ confidence in shopping and selling across borders.\n(5)\nIn its conclusions of 24-25 March and 23 October 2011, the European Council invited the European Parliament and the Council to adopt, by the end of 2012, a first set of priority measures to bring a new impetus to the Single Market.\n(6)\nThe internal market is a reality for consumers in their daily lives, when they travel, make purchases and make payments. Consumers are key players in the internal market and should therefore be at its heart. The digital dimension of the internal market is becoming vital for both consumers and traders. Consumers increasingly make purchases online and an increasing number of traders sell online. Consumers and traders should feel confident in carrying out transactions online so it is essential to dismantle existing barriers and to boost consumer confidence. The availability of reliable and efficient online dispute resolution (ODR) could greatly help achieve this goal.\n(7)\nBeing able to seek easy and low-cost dispute resolution can boost consumers’ and traders’ confidence in the digital Single Market. Consumers and traders, however, still face barriers to finding out-of-court solutions in particular to their disputes arising from cross-border online transactions. Thus, such disputes currently are often left unresolved.\n(8)\nODR offers a simple, efficient, fast and low-cost out-of-court solution to disputes arising from online transactions. However, there is currently a lack of mechanisms which allow consumers and traders to resolve such disputes through electronic means; this leads to consumer detriment, acts as a barrier, in particular, to cross-border online transactions, and creates an uneven playing field for traders, and thus hampers the overall development of online commerce.\n(9)\nThis Regulation should apply to the out-of-court resolution of disputes initiated by consumers resident in the Union against traders established in the Union which are covered by Directive 2013/11/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 May 2013 on alternative dispute resolution for consumer disputes (Directive on consumer ADR) (3).\n(10)\nIn order to ensure that the ODR platform can also be used for ADR procedures which allow traders to submit complaints against consumers, this Regulation should also apply to the out-of-court resolution of disputes initiated by traders against consumers where the relevant ADR procedures are offered by ADR entities listed in accordance with Article 20(2) of Directive 2013/11/EU. The application of this Regulation to such disputes should not impose any obligation on Member States to ensure that the ADR entities offer such procedures.\n(11)\nAlthough in particular consumers and traders carrying out cross-border online transactions will benefit from the ODR platform, this Regulation should also apply to domestic online transactions in order to allow for a true level playing field in the area of online commerce.\n(12)\nThis Regulation should be without prejudice to Directive 2008/52/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 May 2008 on certain aspects of mediation in civil and commercial matters (4).\n(13)\nThe definition of ‘consumer’ should cover natural persons who are acting outside their trade, business, craft or profession. However, if the contract is concluded for purposes partly within and partly outside the person’s trade (dual purpose contracts) and the trade purpose is so limited as not to be predominant in the overall context of the supply, that person should also be considered as a consumer.\n(14)\nThe definition of ‘online sales or service contract’ should cover a sales or service contract where the trader, or the trader’s intermediary, has offered goods or services through a website or by other electronic means and the consumer has ordered those goods or services on that website or by other electronic means. This should also cover cases where the consumer has accessed the website or other information society service through a mobile electronic device such as a mobile telephone.\n(15)\nThis Regulation should not apply to disputes between consumers and traders that arise from sales or service contracts concluded offline and to disputes between traders.\n(16)\nThis Regulation should be considered in conjunction with Directive 2013/11/EU which requires Member States to ensure that all disputes between consumers resident and traders established in the Union which arise from the sale of goods or provisions of services can be submitted to an ADR entity.\n(17)\nBefore submitting their complaint to an ADR entity through the ODR platform, consumers should be encouraged by Member States to contact the trader by any appropriate means, with the aim of resolving the dispute amicably.\n(18)\nThis Regulation aims to create an ODR platform at Union level. The ODR platform should take the form of an interactive website offering a single point of entry to consumers and traders seeking to resolve disputes out-of-court which have arisen from online transactions. The ODR platform should provide general information regarding the out-of-court resolution of contractual disputes between traders and consumers arising from online sales and service contracts. It should allow consumers and traders to submit complaints by filling in an electronic complaint form available in all the official languages of the institutions of the Union and to attach relevant documents. It should transmit complaints to an ADR entity competent to deal with the dispute concerned. The ODR platform should offer, free of charge, an electronic case management tool which enables ADR entities to conduct the dispute resolution procedure with the parties through the ODR platform. ADR entities should not be obliged to use the case management tool.\n(19)\nThe Commission should be responsible for the development, operation and maintenance of the ODR platform and provide all technical facilities necessary for the functioning of the platform. The ODR platform should offer an electronic translation function which enables the parties and the ADR entity to have the information which is exchanged through the ODR platform and is necessary for the resolution of the dispute translated, where appropriate. That function should be capable of dealing with all necessary translations and should be supported by human intervention, if necessary. The Commission should also provide, on the ODR platform, information for complainants about the possibility of requesting assistance from the ODR contact points.\n(20)\nThe ODR platform should enable the secure interchange of data with ADR entities and respect the underlying principles of the European Interoperability Framework adopted pursuant to Decision 2004/387/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 April 2004 on interoperable delivery of pan-European eGovernment services to public administrations, businesses and citizens (IDABC) (5).\n(21)\nThe ODR platform should be made accessible, in particular, through the ‘Your Europe portal’ established in accordance with Annex II to Decision 2004/387/EC, which provides access to pan-European, multilingual online information and interactive services to businesses and citizens in the Union. The ODR platform should be given prominence on the ‘Your Europe portal’.\n(22)\nAn ODR platform at Union level should build on existing ADR entities in the Member States and respect the legal traditions of the Member States. ADR entities to which a complaint has been transmitted through the ODR platform should therefore apply their own procedural rules, including rules on cost. However, this Regulation intends to establish some common rules applicable to those procedures that will safeguard their effectiveness. This should include rules ensuring that such dispute resolution does not require the physical presence of the parties or their representatives before the ADR entity, unless its procedural rules provide for that possibility and the parties agree.\n(23)\nEnsuring that all ADR entities listed in accordance with Article 20(2) of Directive 2013/11/EU are registered with the ODR platform should allow for full coverage in online out-of-court resolution for disputes arising from online sales or service contracts.\n(24)\nThis Regulation should not prevent the functioning of any existing dispute resolution entity operating online or of any ODR mechanism within the Union. It should not prevent dispute resolution entities or mechanisms from dealing with online disputes which have been submitted directly to them.\n(25)\nODR contact points hosting at least two ODR advisors should be designated in each Member State. The ODR contact points should support the parties involved in a dispute submitted through the ODR platform without being obliged to translate documents relating to that dispute. Member States should have the possibility to confer the responsibility for the ODR contact points on their centres of the European Consumer Centres Network. Member States should make use of that possibility in order to allow ODR contact points to fully benefit from the experience of the centres of the European Consumer Centres Network in facilitating the settlement of disputes between consumers and traders. The Commission should establish a network of ODR contact points to facilitate their cooperation and work and provide, in cooperation with Member States, appropriate training for ODR contact points.\n(26)\nThe right to an effective remedy and the right to a fair trial are fundamental rights laid down in Article 47 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. ODR is not intended to and cannot be designed to replace court procedures, nor should it deprive consumers or traders of their rights to seek redress before the courts. This Regulation should not, therefore, prevent parties from exercising their right of access to the judicial system.\n(27)\nThe processing of information under this Regulation should be subject to strict guarantees of confidentiality and should comply with the rules on the protection of personal data laid down in Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data (6) and in Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 December 2000 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data by the Community institutions and bodies and on the free movement of such data (7). Those rules should apply to the processing of personal data carried out under this Regulation by the various actors of the ODR platform, whether they act alone or jointly with other such actors.\n(28)\nData subjects should be informed about, and give their consent to, the processing of their personal data in the ODR platform, and should be informed about their rights with regard to that processing, by means of a comprehensive privacy notice to be made publicly available by the Commission and explaining, in clear and simple language, the processing operations performed under the responsibility of the various actors of the platform, in accordance with Articles 11 and 12 of Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 and with national legislation adopted pursuant to Articles 10 and 11 of Directive 95/46/EC.\n(29)\nThis Regulation should be without prejudice to provisions on confidentiality in national legislation relating to ADR.\n(30)\nIn order to ensure broad consumer awareness of the existence of the ODR platform, traders established within the Union engaging in online sales or service contracts should provide, on their websites, an electronic link to the ODR platform. Traders should also provide their email address so that consumers have a first point of contact. A significant proportion of online sales and service contracts are concluded using online marketplaces, which bring together or facilitate online transactions between consumers and traders. Online marketplaces are online platforms which allow traders to make their products and services available to consumers. Such online marketplaces should therefore have the same obligation to provide an electronic link to the ODR platform. This obligation should be without prejudice to Article 13 of Directive 2013/11/EU concerning the requirement that traders inform consumers about the ADR procedures by which those traders are covered and about whether or not they commit to use ADR procedures to resolve disputes with consumers. Furthermore, that obligation should be without prejudice to point (t) of Article 6(1) and to Article 8 of Directive 2011/83/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 October 2011 on consumer rights (8). Point (t) of Article 6(1) of Directive 2011/83/EU stipulates for consumer contracts concluded at a distance or off premises, that the trader is to inform the consumer about the possibility of having recourse to an out-of-court complaint and redress mechanism to which the trader is subject, and the methods for having access to it, before the consumer is bound by the contract. For the same consumer awareness reasons, Member States should encourage consumer associations and business associations to provide an electronic link to the website of the ODR platform.\n(31)\nIn order to take into account the criteria by which the ADR entities define their respective scopes of application the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 TFEU should be delegated to the Commission to adapt the information which a complainant is to provide in the electronic complaint form made available on the ODR platform. It is of particular importance that the Commission carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level. The Commission, when preparing and drawing up delegated acts, should ensure a simultaneous, timely and appropriate transmission of relevant documents to the European Parliament and to the Council.\n(32)\nIn order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of this Regulation implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission in respect of the functioning of the ODR platform, the modalities for the submission of a complaint and cooperation within the network of ODR contact points. Those powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 February 2011 laying down the rules and general principles concerning mechanisms for control by Member States of the Commission’s exercise of implementing powers (9). The advisory procedure should be used for the adoption of implementing acts relating to the electronic complaint form given its purely technical nature. The examination procedure should be used for the adoption of the rules concerning the modalities of cooperation between the ODR advisors of the network of ODR contact points.\n(33)\nIn the application of this Regulation, the Commission should consult, where appropriate, the European Data Protection Supervisor.\n(34)\nSince the objective of this Regulation, namely to set up a European ODR platform for online disputes governed by common rules, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore, by reason of its scale and effects, be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve that objective.\n(35)\nThis Regulation respects fundamental rights and observes the principles recognised in particular by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union and specifically Articles 7, 8, 38 and 47 thereof.\n(36)\nThe European Data Protection Supervisor was consulted in accordance with Article 28(2) of Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 and delivered an opinion on 12 January 2012 (10),\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nCHAPTER I\nGENERAL PROVISIONS\nArticle 1\nSubject matter\nThe purpose of this Regulation is, through the achievement of a high level of consumer protection, to contribute to the proper functioning of the internal market, and in particular of its digital dimension by providing a European ODR platform (‘ODR platform’) facilitating the independent, impartial, transparent, effective, fast and fair out-of-court resolution of disputes between consumers and traders online.\nArticle 2\nScope\n1.   This Regulation shall apply to the out-of-court resolution of disputes concerning contractual obligations stemming from online sales or service contracts between a consumer resident in the Union and a trader established in the Union through the intervention of an ADR entity listed in accordance with Article 20(2) of Directive 2013/11/EU and which involves the use of the ODR platform.\n2.   This Regulation shall apply to the out-of-court resolution of disputes referred to in paragraph 1, which are initiated by a trader against a consumer, in so far as the legislation of the Member State where the consumer is habitually resident allows for such disputes to be resolved through the intervention of an ADR entity.\n3.   Member States shall inform the Commission about whether or not their legislation allows for disputes referred to in paragraph 1, which are initiated by a trader against a consumer, to be resolved through the intervention of an ADR entity. Competent authorities shall, when they notify the list referred to in Article 20(2) of Directive 2013/11/EU, inform the Commission about which ADR entities deal with such disputes.\n4.   The application of this Regulation to disputes referred to in paragraph 1, which are initiated by a trader against a consumer, shall not impose any obligation on Member States to ensure that ADR entities offer procedures for the out-of-court resolution of such disputes.\nArticle 3\nRelationship with other Union legal acts\nThis Regulation shall be without prejudice to Directive 2008/52/EC.\nArticle 4\nDefinitions\n1.

The Commission shall develop the ODR platform (and be responsible for its operation, including all the translation functions necessary for the purpose of this Regulation, its maintenance, funding and data security. The ODR platform shall be user-friendly. The development, operation and maintenance of the ODR platform shall ensure that the privacy of its users is respected from the design stage (‘privacy by design’) and that the ODR platform is accessible and usable by all, including vulnerable users (‘design for all’), as far as possible.\n2.   The ODR platform shall be a single point of entry for consumers and traders seeking the out-of-court resolution of disputes covered by this Regulation. It shall be an interactive website which can be accessed electronically and free of charge in all the official languages of the institutions of the Union.\n3.   The Commission shall make the ODR platform accessible, as appropriate, through its websites which provide information to citizens and businesses in the Union and, in particular, through the ‘Your Europe portal’ established in accordance with Decision 2004/387/EC.\n4.

The Member States may confer responsibility for the ODR contact points on their centres of the European Consumer Centres Network, on consumer associations or on any other body. Each ODR contact point shall host at least two ODR advisors.\n2.   The ODR contact points shall provide support to the resolution of disputes relating to complaints submitted through the ODR platform by fulfilling the following functions:\n(a)\nif requested, facilitating communication between the parties and the competent ADR entity, which may include, in particular:\n(i)\nassisting with the submission of the complaint and, where appropriate, relevant documentation;\n(ii)\nproviding the parties and ADR entities with general information on consumer rights in relation to sales and service contracts which apply in the Member State of the ODR contact point which hosts the ODR advisor concerned;\n(iii)\nproviding information on the functioning of the ODR platform;\n(iv)\nproviding the parties with explanations on the procedural rules applied by the ADR entities identified;\n(v)\ninforming the complainant party of other means of redress when a dispute cannot be resolved through the ODR platform;\n(b)\nsubmitting, based on the practical experience gained from the performance of their functions, every two years an activity report to the Commission and to the Member States.\n3.   The ODR contact point shall not be obliged to perform the functions listed in paragraph 2 in the case of disputes where the parties are habitually resident in the same Member State.\n4.   Notwithstanding paragraph 3, the Member States may decide, taking into account national circumstances, that the ODR contact point performs one or more functions listed in paragraph 2 in the case of disputes where the parties are habitually resident in the same Member State.\n5.   The Commission shall establish a network of contact points (‘ODR contact points network’) which shall enable cooperation between contact points and contribute to the performance of the functions listed in paragraph 2.\n6.   The Commission shall at least twice a year convene a meeting of members of the ODR contact points network in order to permit an exchange of best practice, and a discussion of any recurring problems encountered in the operation of the ODR platform.\n7.   The Commission shall adopt the rules concerning the modalities of the cooperation between the ODR contact points through implementing acts. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 16(3).\nArticle 8\nSubmission of a complaint\n1.   In order to submit a complaint to the ODR platform the complainant party shall fill in the electronic complaint form. The complaint form shall be user-friendly and easily accessible on the ODR platform.\n2.   The information to be submitted by the complainant party shall be sufficient to determine the competent ADR entity. That information is listed in the Annex to this Regulation. The complainant party may attach documents in support of the complaint.\n3.   In order to take into account the criteria by which the ADR entities, that are listed in accordance with Article 20(2) of Directive 2013/11/EU and that deal with disputes covered by this Regulation, define their respective scopes of application, the Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 17 of this Regulation to adapt the information listed in the Annex to this Regulation.\n4.   The Commission shall lay down the rules concerning the modalities for the electronic complaint form by means of implementing acts. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the advisory procedure referred to in Article 16(2).\n5.   Only data which are accurate, relevant and not excessive in relation to the purposes for which they are collected shall be processed through the electronic complaint form and its attachments.\nArticle 9\nProcessing and transmission of a complaint\n1.   A complaint submitted to the ODR platform shall be processed if all the necessary sections of the electronic complaint form have been completed.\n2.   If the complaint form has not been fully completed, the complainant party shall be informed that the complaint cannot be processed further, unless the missing information is provided.\n3.   Upon receipt of a fully completed complaint form, the ODR platform shall, in an easily understandable way and without delay, transmit to the respondent party, in one of the official languages of the institutions of the Union chosen by that party, the complaint together with the following data:\n(a)\ninformation that the parties have to agree on an ADR entity in order for the complaint to be transmitted to it, and that, if no agreement is reached by the parties or no competent ADR entity is identified, the complaint will not be processed further;\n(b)\ninformation about the ADR entity or entities which are competent to deal with the complaint, if any are referred to in the electronic complaint form or are identified by the ODR platform on the basis of the information provided in that form;\n(c)\nin the event that the respondent party is a trader, an invitation to state within 10 calendar days:\n—\nwhether the trader commits to, or is obliged to use, a specific ADR entity to resolve disputes with consumers, and\n—\nunless the trader is obliged to use a specific ADR entity, whether the trader is willing to use any ADR entity or entities from those referred to in point (b);\n(d)\nin the event that the respondent party is a consumer and the trader is obliged to use a specific ADR entity, an invitation to agree within 10 calendar days on that ADR entity or, in the event that the trader is not obliged to use a specific ADR entity, an invitation to select one or more ADR entities from those referred to in point (b);\n(e)\nthe name and contact details of the ODR contact point in the Member State where the respondent party is established or resident, as well as a brief description of the functions referred to in point (a) of Article 7(2).\n4.   Upon receipt from the respondent party of the information referred to in point (c) or point (d) of paragraph 3, the ODR platform shall in an easily understandable way and without delay communicate to the complainant party, in one of the official languages of the institutions of the Union chosen by that party, the following information:\n(a)\nthe information referred to in point (a) of paragraph 3;\n(b)\nin the event that the complainant party is a consumer, the information about the ADR entity or entities stated by the trader in accordance with point (c) of paragraph 3 and an invitation to agree within 10 calendar days on an ADR entity;\n(c)\nin the event that the complainant party is a trader and the trader is not obliged to use a specific ADR entity, the information about the ADR entity or entities stated by the consumer in accordance with point (d) of paragraph 3 and an invitation to agree within 10 calendar days on an ADR entity;\n(d)\nthe name and contact details of the ODR contact point in the Member State where the complainant party is established or resident, as well as a brief description of the functions referred to in point (a) of Article 7(2).\n5.   The information referred to in point (b) of paragraph 3 and in points (b) and (c) of paragraph 4 shall include a description of the following characteristics of each ADR entity:\n(a)\nthe name, contact details and website address of the ADR entity;\n(b)\nthe fees for the ADR procedure, if applicable;\n(c)\nthe language or languages in which the ADR procedure can be conducted;\n(d)\nthe average length of the ADR procedure;\n(e)\nthe binding or non-binding nature of the outcome of the ADR procedure;\n(f)\nthe grounds on which the ADR entity may refuse to deal with a given dispute in accordance with Article 5(4) of Directive 2013/11/EU.\n6.   The ODR platform shall automatically and without delay transmit the complaint to the ADR entity that the parties have agreed to use in accordance with paragraphs 3 and 4.\n7.   The ADR entity to which the complaint has been transmitted shall without delay inform the parties about whether it agrees or refuses to deal with the dispute in accordance with Article 5(4) of Directive 2013/11/EU.

These bodies — some of which operate online — offer a neutral party such as an ombudsman or mediator. Their job is to propose or impose a solution or to bring the parties together so they can find a solution.\nThe entire procedure can be handled quickly online, so most disputes should be settled within 90 days.\nODR platform\nThe European Commission will develop, operate and maintain the ODR platform. It will be launched in January 2016 and will be:\nan interactive and user-friendly website;\nopen to any customer or trader in the EU;\navailable in all EU official languages;\nfree of charge.\nThe platform has several functions. These include offering an electronic complaint form, informing the respondent party about the complaint, identifying national mediation bodies and electronic case management.\nEach EU country must designate one ODR contact point, hosting at least two ODR advisers. The Commission will also set up a network of ODR contact points.\nOnce the electronic complaint form has been submitted to the ODR platform, the platform will quickly contact and seek a response from the respondent party. It will also transmit the complaint to the mediation body that the parties agree to use. If the mediation body agrees to deal with the dispute, it will strive to resolve the dispute quickly and inform the ODR platform of the results of the procedure.\nAlternative dispute resolution\nThe ODR platform can be accessed through the Your Europe portal. It will also be connected to all the national mediation bodies that have been set up and notified to the European Commission, in line with the EU alternative dispute resolution (ADR) directive.\nThe ODR regulation and ADR directive were both adopted in May 2013.\nThe ODR platform is accessible to consumers and traders since 15 February 2016.\nFROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?\n              \nIt has applied since 9 January 2016.\nBACKGROUND\n              \nFor more information, see:\nAlternative and Online Dispute Resolution (ADR/ODR) on the European Commission’s website\nConsumer dispute resolution on the Your Europe website.\nMAIN DOCUMENT\n            \nRegulation (EU) No 524/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 May 2013 on online dispute resolution for consumer disputes and amending Regulation (EC) No 2006/2004 and Directive 2009/22/EC (Regulation on consumer ODR) (OJ L 165, 18.6.2013, pp. 1–12)\nRELATED DOCUMENTS\n            \nDirective 2013/11/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 May 2013 on alternative dispute resolution for consumer disputes and amending Regulation (EC) No 2006/2004 and Directive 2009/22/EC (Directive on consumer ADR) (OJ L 165, 18.6.2013, pp. 63–79)\nCommission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2015/1051 of 1 July 2015 on the modalities for the exercise of the functions of the online dispute resolution platform, on the modalities of the electronic complaint form and on the modalities of the cooperation between contact points provided for in Regulation (EU) No 524/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council on online dispute resolution for consumer disputes (OJ L 171, 2.7.2015, pp. 1–4)\nlast update 30.08.2016", "tags": ["provision of services", "consumer protection", "single market", "alternative dispute resolution", "purchase", "electronic commerce", "trade dispute", "Internet site"], "subjects": ["Consumer protection"], "split": "test", "reference_annotations": {"32013R0524_p1": {"text": "regulation 524/2013 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL---of 21 May 2013---on online dispute resolution for consumer disputes and amending regulation 2006/2004 and directive 2009/22/ec (Regulation on consumer ODR)", "triples": [" regulation 524/2013,  amending,  regulation 2006/2004", " regulation 524/2013,  amending,  directive 2009/22/ec"]}}, "summary_annotations": {"32013R0524_p1": {"text": "regulation 524/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 May 2013 on online dispute resolution for consumer disputes and amending regulation 2006/2004 and directive 2009/22/ec (Regulation on consumer ODR) (OJ L 165, 18.6.2013, pp. 1–12)", "triples": [" regulation 524/2013,  amending,  regulation 2006/2004", " regulation 524/2013,  amending,  directive 2009/22/ec"]}, "32013R0524_p2": {"text": "directive 2013/11/eu of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 May 2013 on alternative dispute resolution for consumer disputes and amending regulation 2006/2004 and directive 2009/22/ec (Directive on consumer ADR) (OJ L 165, 18.6.2013, pp. 63–79)", "triples": [" directive 2013/11/eu,  amending,  regulation 2006/2004", " directive 2013/11/eu,  amending,  directive 2009/22/ec"]}}}
