{"celex_id": "32020R2093", "reference": "22.12.2020\nEN\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\nLI 433/11\nCOUNCIL REGULATION (EU, Euratom) 2020/2093\nof 17 December 2020\nlaying down the multiannual financial framework for the years 2021 to 2027\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 312 thereof,\nHaving regard to the Treaty establishing the European Atomic Energy Community, and in particular Article 106a thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European Commission,\nHaving regard to the consent of the European Parliament (1),\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,\nAfter consulting the European Economic and Social Committee,\nAfter consulting the Committee of the Regions,\nActing in accordance with a special legislative procedure,\nWhereas:\n(1)\nTaking into account the need for an adequate level of predictability for preparing and implementing medium-term investments, the duration of the multiannual financial framework (MFF) should be set at seven years starting on 1 January 2021.\n(2)\nThe economic impact of the COVID-19 crisis requires the Union to provide a long-term financial framework paving the way to a fair and inclusive transition to a green and digital future, supporting the Union’s longer-term strategic autonomy and making it resilient to shocks in the future.\n(3)\nThe annual ceilings for commitment appropriations by category of expenditure and the annual ceilings for payment appropriations established by this Regulation are to respect the applicable ceilings for commitments and own resources, which are set in accordance with the Council decision on the system of own resources of the European Union in force that has been adopted in accordance with the third paragraph of Article 311 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) (the ‘Own Resources Decision’).\n(4)\nWhere it is necessary to mobilise the guarantees given under the general budget of the Union for financial assistance to Member States authorised in accordance with Article 220(1) of Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2018/1046 of the European Parliament and of the Council (2) (the ‘Financial Regulation’), the necessary amount should be mobilised over and above the ceilings for commitment and payment appropriations of the MFF, while respecting the own resources ceiling.\n(5)\nThe MFF should not take account of budget items financed by assigned revenue within the meaning of the Financial Regulation.\n(6)\nThe MFF should be laid down in 2018 prices. The rules for annual technical adjustments to the MFF to recalculate the ceilings and margins available should also be laid down.\n(7)\nRules should be laid down for other situations that might require the MFF to be adjusted. Such adjustments might be related to the delayed adoption of new rules or programmes under shared management, to measures linked to sound economic governance or to measures adopted under the Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on a general regime of conditionality for the protection of the Union budget. Rules should also be laid down for a mechanism for programme-specific adjustment.\n(8)\nSpecific and maximum possible flexibility should be implemented to allow the Union to fulfil its obligations in compliance with Article 323 TFEU.\n(9)\nThe following thematic special instruments are necessary to allow the Union to react to specified unforeseen circumstances or consequences and thereby allow the budgetary procedure to run smoothly: the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund, the Solidarity and Emergency Aid Reserve and the Brexit Adjustment Reserve. The Solidarity and Emergency Aid Reserve is not aimed at addressing the consequences of market related crises affecting the agricultural production or distribution.\n(10)\nThe following non-thematic special instruments are necessary to further enhance flexibility: the Single Margin Instrument and the Flexibility Instrument. The Single Margin Instrument should enable shifting margins available below the ceilings for commitment and payment appropriationsrespectively between financial years and, for commitment appropriations, between MFF headings, without exceeding the total amounts of the MFF ceilings for commitment and payment appropriations for the entire period of the MFF. The Flexibility Instrument should allow the financing of specific unforeseen expenditure for a given financial year.\n(11)\nSpecific provision should be made for the possibility to enter commitment and corresponding payment appropriations into the budget over and above the ceilings set out in the MFF where it is necessary to use special instruments.\n(12)\nIt is necessary to provide for a revision of the MFF in the event of revision of the Treaties with budgetary implications, of the reunification of Cyprus or of the enlargement of the Union, as well as in the light of the implementation of the budget.\n(13)\nThis Regulation might also need to be revised in relation to unforeseen circumstances that cannot be dealt with within the limits set out in the MFF. It is therefore necessary to provide for the revision of the MFF in such cases.\n(14)\nSpecific rules are also necessary for dealing with large-scale projects the lifetime of which extends well beyond the period set for the MFF. It is necessary to establish maximum amounts for the contributions from the general budget of the Union to those projects, thereby ensuring that they do not have any impact on other projects financed from that budget.\n(15)\nIt is necessary to lay down general rules on interinstitutional cooperation in the budgetary procedure, while respecting the budgetary powers of the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission (the ‘Institutions’) as laid down in the Treaties as well as transparency requirements.\n(16)\nThe Commission should present a proposal for a new multiannual financial framework before 1 July 2025, to enable the institutions to adopt it sufficiently in advance of the start of the subsequent multiannual financial framework. In accordance with Article 312(4) TFEU, the ceilings corresponding to the last year of the MFF set out in this Regulation are to continue to apply in the event that a new multiannual financial framework is not adopted before the end of the term of the MFF laid down in this Regulation,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nCHAPTER 1\nGENERAL PROVISIONS\nArticle 1\nMultiannual financial framework\nThis Regulation lays down the multiannual financial framework for the years 2021 to 2027 (MFF).\nArticle 2\nCompliance with the ceilings of the MFF\n1.   The European Parliament, the Council and the Commission (the ‘Institutions’) shall, during each budgetary procedure and when implementing the budget for the year concerned, comply with the annual expenditure ceilings set out in Annex I (the ‘MFF ceilings’).\nThe sub-ceiling for heading 3 as set out in Annex I is established without prejudice to the flexibility between the two pillars of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). The adjusted ceiling to be applied to pillar I of the CAP following the transfers between the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development and direct payments shall be laid down in the relevant legal act and the MFF shall be adjusted accordingly under the technical adjustment provided for in Article 4 of this Regulation.\n2.   Where it is necessary to use the resources from the special instruments provided for in Articles 8, 9, 10 and 12, commitment and corresponding payment appropriations shall be entered in the budget over and above the relevant MFF ceilings.\nWhere it is necessary to use the resources from the Single Margin Instrument as laid down in Article 11, commitment and corresponding payment appropriations shall be entered in the budget over and above the relevant MFF ceilings for a given year.\n3.   Where it is necessary to mobilise a guarantee for financial assistance to Member States authorised in accordance with Article 220(1) of the Financial Regulation, the necessary amount shall be mobilised over and above the MFF ceilings.\nArticle 3\nRespect of own resources ceiling\n1.   For each of the years covered by the MFF, the total appropriations for payments required, after annual adjustment and taking account of any other adjustments and revisions as well as the application of Article 2(2) and (3), shall not be such as to produce a call-in rate for own resources that exceeds the own resources ceiling set out in the Council decision on the system of own resources of the European Union in force that has been adopted in accordance with the third paragraph of Article 311 TFEU (the ‘Own Resources Decision’).\n2.   Where necessary, the MFF ceilings shall be lowered in order to ensure compliance with the own resources ceiling set out in the Own Resources Decision.\nCHAPTER 2\nADJUSTMENTS TO THE MFF\nArticle 4\nTechnical adjustments\n1.

The Commission shall make the technical adjustments referred to in paragraph 1 on the basis of a fixed deflator of 2 % per year.\n3.   The Commission shall communicate the results of the technical adjustments referred to in paragraph 1 and the underlying economic forecasts to the European Parliament and to the Council.\n4.   Without prejudice to Articles 6 and 7, no further technical adjustments shall be made in respect of the year concerned, either during the year or as ex post corrections during subsequent years.\nArticle 5\nProgramme-specific adjustment\n1.   An amount equivalent to the revenue from fines imposed under Council Regulations (EC) No 1/2003 (3) and (EC) No 139/2004 (4) by Union institutions, which is entered in the budget of the year n-1 in accordance with Article 107 of the Financial Regulation, after deduction of the amount for the year n-1 referred to in Article 141(1) of the Agreement on the withdrawal of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland from the European Union and the European Atomic Energy Community (5), shall be available for an additional allocation of:\n(a)\ncommitment appropriations for year n+1, starting for the year 2022 and ending in 2027, to the programmes listed in Annex II, in accordance with percentages set out for those programmes in the column ‘Distribution key’ of the table in Annex II; and\n(b)\npayment appropriations for year n+1, starting for the year 2022 and ending in 2027.\nThe total amount of additional allocations for the period 2022 to 2027 for commitment and payment appropriations respectively shall be EUR 11 000 million (in 2018 prices). For each of the years 2022 to 2026, the annual amount of additional allocations for commitment and payment appropriations respectively shall be at least EUR 1 500 million (in 2018 prices) and shall not exceed EUR 2 000 million (in 2018 prices).\nThe total amount of additional allocations for commitment appropriations for the programmes in the period 2022 to 2027 is set out in the column ‘Total additional allocation of commitment appropriations under Article 5’ of the table in Annex II.\n2.   The ceilings for commitment appropriations of the relevant headings for year n+1, starting for the year 2022 and ending in 2027, shall be adjusted upwards with the amounts corresponding to the additional allocations set out in paragraph 1, in accordance with the percentages set out for those headings in the column ‘Distribution key’ of the table in Annex II. The ceiling for payment appropriations for year n+1, starting for the year 2022 and ending in 2027, shall be automatically adjusted upwards with the amounts corresponding to the additional allocations set out in paragraph 1.\nArticle 6\nAdjustments related to measures linked to sound economic governance or to a general regime of conditionality for the protection of the Union budget\n1.   In the case of the lifting of a suspension of budgetary commitments concerning Union funds in accordance with the relevant basic acts in the context of measures linked to sound economic governance or to measures adopted under the Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on a general regime of conditionality for the protection of the Union budget, the amounts corresponding to the suspended commitments shall be transferred to the following years and the corresponding MFF ceilings shall be adjusted accordingly.\n2.   The Commission shall communicate the result of any adjustments under paragraph 1 to the European Parliament and to the Council.\n3.   Suspended commitments of year n may not be entered in the general budget of the Union beyond year n+2.\nArticle 7\nAdjustment following new rules or programmes under shared management\n1.

The Solidarity and Emergency Aid Reserve shall not exceed a maximum annual amount of EUR 1 200 million (in 2018 prices). Any portion of the annual amount not used in year n may be used up to year n+1. The portion of the annual amount stemming from the previous year shall be drawn on first. Any portion of the annual amount from year n which is not used in year n+1 shall lapse.\n3.   The appropriations for the Solidarity and Emergency Aid Reserve shall be entered in the general budget of the Union as a provision.\n4.   On 1 October of each year, at least one quarter of the annual amount referred to in paragraph 2 shall remain available in order to cover needs arising until the end of that year.\nWithout prejudice to the first subparagraph, the following maximum percentages of the overall amount available until 1 September of each year may be mobilised:\n—\n50 % for assistance under point (a) of paragraph 1; the amount resulting from that calculation shall be reduced by any amount mobilised in the previous year in application of paragraph 5,\n—\n35 % for assistance to third countries under point (b) of paragraph 1,\n—\n15 % for assistance within the Union under point (b) of paragraph 1.\nWithout prejudice to the first subparagraph, as of 1 September of each year, the remaining part of the amount available may be used for any assistance referred to in the second subparagraph to cover needs arising until the end of that year.\n5.   In exceptional cases and if the remaining financial resources available in the Solidarity and Emergency Aid Reserve are not sufficient to cover the amounts considered necessary for assistance under point (a) of paragraph 1 in the year of occurrence of a disaster as referred to in that point, the Commission may propose that the difference be financed through the annual amounts available for the Solidarity and Emergency Aid Reserve in the following year, up to a maximum amount of EUR 400 million (in 2018 prices).\nArticle 10\nBrexit Adjustment Reserve\n1.

Any proposal for a revision of the MFF in accordance with paragraph 1 shall examine the scope for reallocating expenditure between the programmes covered by the heading concerned by the revision, with particular reference to any expected underutilisation of appropriations.\n4.   Any revision of the MFF in accordance with paragraph 1 shall take into account the scope for offsetting any raising of the ceiling for one heading by the lowering of the ceiling for another heading.\n5.   Any revision of the MFF in accordance with paragraph 1 shall maintain an appropriate relationship between commitment and payment appropriations.\nArticle 14\nRevision related to implementation\nWhen notifying the European Parliament and the Council of the results of the technical adjustments to the MFF, the Commission shall, where appropriate, submit any proposal to revise the total appropriations for payments which it considers necessary, in the light of implementation, to ensure a sound management of the yearly payment ceilings, and in particular their orderly progression in relation to the appropriations for commitments.\nArticle 15\nRevision in the event of a revision of the Treaties\nIn the event of a revision of the Treaties with budgetary implications, the MFF shall be revised accordingly.\nArticle 16\nRevision in the event of enlargement of the Union\nIn the event of an accession or accessions to the Union, the MFF shall be revised to take account of the expenditure requirements resulting therefrom.\nArticle 17\nRevision in the event of the reunification of Cyprus\nIn the event of the reunification of Cyprus, the MFF shall be revised to take account of the comprehensive settlement of the Cyprus problem and the additional financial needs resulting from the reunification.\nCHAPTER 5\nCONTRIBUTION TO THE FINANCING OF LARGE-SCALE PROJECTS\nArticle 18\nContribution to the financing of large-scale projects\n1.

Annual budgets adopted during that period must comply with this overall framework.\nKEY POINTS\n              \nThe multiannual financial framework (MFF) regulation sets, for the 2021-2027 period, annual maximum amounts (‘MFF ceilings’) for EU expenditure as a whole and for the main categories of expenditure reflecting major policy areas (‘MFF headings’).\nThe MFF regulation is adopted under a special legislative procedure, with the Council acting unanimously after obtaining the consent of the European Parliament.\nThe three main EU budgetary institutions (European Parliament, Council and European Commission) must ensure that expenditure in the EU’s annual budgets complies with the MFF ceilings.\nFor the 2021-2027 period, the MFF sets a maximum level of spending of €1,074 billion (all amounts in 2018 prices), covering seven major areas, broken down as follows.\nSingle market, innovation and digital: €132.8 billion.\nCohesion, resilience and values: €377.8 billion.\nNatural resources and environment: €356.4 billion.\nMigration and border management: €22.7 billion.\nSecurity and defence: €13.2 billion.\nNeighbourhood and the world: €98.4 billion.\nEuropean public administration: €73.1 billion.\nIn particular, the MFF also earmarks maximum levels of commitments payments over the period to two large-scale projects:\nEU space programme (€13.202 billion),\nInternational Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) (€5 billion).\nThe MFF also sets out maximum amounts that may be spent in addition to the MFF ceilings for emergency response or unforeseen needs, making use of ‘special instruments’, as follows:\nEuropean Globalisation Adjustment Fund (€186 million annually);\nSolidarity and Emergency Aid Reserve (€1.2 billion annually);\nBrexit adjustment reserve for areas and sectors worst affected by the United Kingdom leaving the EU (€5 billion over the period);\nSingle Margin Instrument allowing the shifting of margins available between financial years and in some cases also between MFF headings;\nFlexibility Instrument to cover unforeseen expenditure that cannot be financed within the MFF ceilings (€915 million annually).\nVarious adjustments are made to the MFF’s ceilings during its lifetime. These are:\nannual technical adjustments in current prices when the Commission is drafting the following year’s draft annual budget;\nprogramme-specific adjustments whereby an extra amount, equivalent to the annual income the EU receives from fines it levies for breaking EU rules, will be allocated to specific EU programmes/policies — this totals €11 billion between 2022 and 2027.\nOther adjustments to the MFF may be:\nre-entering budgetary commitments that have been suspended to ensure sound economic governance or to protect the EU budget — once the suspension is lifted, the amounts may be used in a following year;\nre-programming over time of budgetary commitments and payments related to new rules or programmes adopted after 1 January 2021.\nThe MFF may be revised — in accordance with the same special legislative procedure for its adoption — due to:\nunforeseen circumstances;\nrevision of the EU’s treaties with budgetary consequences;\ncountries becoming new EU members;\nthe reunification of Cyprus.\nThe European Parliament, Council and Commission must take measures to facilitate the annual budgetary procedure, cooperate in good faith and work in a coherent manner under the Interinstitutional Agreement on budgetary discipline, cooperation and sound financial management (see summary).\nThe MFF requires the Commission to present a proposal for a new MFF before 1 July 2025.\nFROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?\n              \nIt has applied since 1 January 2021.\nBACKGROUND\n              \nThe MFF’s €1,074.3 billion and the exceptional and temporary additional €750 billion of the European Union Recovery Instrument Regulation (EU) 2020/2094 (see summary) provide an unprecedented €1.8 trillion to support the EU’s recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic with a special focus on modernising the EU’s economy and the transition to a green and digital future.\nThe start of the new MFF coincides with changes to the EU’s own-resources system of financing EU expenditure, Decision (EU, Euratom) 2020/2053 (see summary).\nMAIN DOCUMENT\n            \nCouncil Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2020/2093 of 17 December 2020 laying down the
