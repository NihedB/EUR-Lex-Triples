whereas the purpose of the Convention is to protect endangered species of fauna and flora through controls on international trade in specimens of those species;(2) Whereas, in order to improve the protection of species of wild fauna and flora which are threatened by trade or likely to be so threatened, Regulation (EEC) No 3626/82 must be replaced by a Regulation taking account of the scientific knowledge acquired since its adoption and the current structure of trade; whereas, moreover, the abolition of controls at internal borders resulting from the Single Market necessitates the adoption of stricter trade control measures at the Community's external borders, with documents and goods being checked at the customs office at the border where they are introduced;(3) Whereas the provisions of this Regulation do not prejudice any stricter measures which may be taken or maintained by Member States, in compliance with the Treaty, in particular with regard to the holding of specimens of species covered by this Regulation;(4) Whereas it is necessary to lay down objective criteria for the inclusion of species of wild fauna and flora in the Annexes to this Regulation;(5) Whereas the implementation of this Regulation necessitates the application of common conditions for the issue, use and presentation of documents relating to authorization of the introduction into the Community and the export or re-export from the Community of specimens of the species covered by this Regulation; whereas it is necessary to lay down specific provisions relating to the transit of specimens through the Community;(6) Whereas it is for a management authority of the Member State of destination, assisted by the scientific authority of that Member State and, where appropriate, taking into account any opinion of the Scientific Review Group, to decide on the requests for introduction of specimens into the Community;(7) Whereas it is necessary to supplement the provisions on re-export with a consultation procedure, in order to limit the risk of infringement;(8) Whereas, in order to guarantee effective protection of species of wild fauna and flora, additional restrictions may be imposed on the introduction of specimens into, and the export thereof from, the Community; whereas, with regard to live specimens, these restrictions may be supplemented by restrictions at Community level on the holding or movement of such specimens within the Community;(9) Whereas it is necessary to lay down specific provisions applicable to captive-born and bred, or artificially propagated specimens, to specimens which are personal or household effects, and to non-commercial loans, donations or exchanges between registered scientists and scientific institutions;(10) Whereas there is a need, in order to ensure the broadest possible protection for species covered by this Regulation, to lay down provisions for controlling trade and movement of specimens within the Community, and the conditions for housing specimens; whereas the certificates issued under this Regulation, which contribute to controlling these activities, must be governed by common rules on their issue, validity and use;(11) Whereas measures should be taken to minimize the adverse effects on live specimens of transport to their destination, from or within the Community;(12) Whereas, to ensure effective controls and to facilitate customs procedures, customs offices should be designated, with trained personnel responsible for carrying out the necessary formalities and corresponding checks where specimens are introduced into the Community, in order to assign them a customs-approved treatment or use within the meaning of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 of 12 October 1992 establishing the Community Customs Code (5), or where they are exported or re-exported from the Community; whereas there should also be facilities guaranteeing that live specimens are adequately housed and cared for;(13) Whereas the implementation of this Regulation also calls for the designation of management and scientific authorities by the Member States;(14) Whereas informing the public and making them aware of the provisions of this Regulation, particularly at border crossing points, is likely to encourage compliance with these provisions;(15) Whereas, in order to ensure effective enforcement of this Regulation, Member States should closely monitor compliance with its provisions and, to that end, cooperate closely between themselves and with the Commission; whereas this requires the communication of information relating to the implementation of this Regulation;(16) Whereas the monitoring of levels of trade in the species of wild fauna and flora covered by this Regulation is of crucial importance for assessing the effects of trade on the conservation status of species; whereas detailed annual reports should be drawn up in a common format;(17) Whereas, in order to guarantee compliance with this Regulation, it is important that Member States impose sanctions for infringements in a manner which is both sufficient and appropriate to the nature and gravity of the infringement;(18) Whereas it is essential to lay down a Community procedure enabling the implementing provisions and amendments to the Annexes of this Regulation to be adopted within a suitable period; whereas a Committee must be set up to permit close and effective cooperation between the Member States and the Commission in this field;(19) Whereas the multitude of biological and ecological aspects to be considered in the implementation of this Regulation requires the setting up of a Scientific Review Group, whose opinions will be forwarded by the Commission to the Committee and the management bodies of the Member States, to assist them in making their decisions,HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:Article 1 ObjectThe object of this Regulation is to protect species of wild fauna and flora and to guarantee their conservation by regulating trade therein in accordance with the following Articles.This Regulation shall apply in compliance with the objectives, principles and provisions of the Convention defined in Article 2.Article 2 DefinitionsFor the purposes of this Regulation:(a) 'Committee` shall mean the Committee on Trade in Wild Fauna and Flora, established under Article 18;(b) 'Convention` shall mean the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (Cites);(c) 'country of origin` shall mean the country in which a specimen was taken from the wild, captive-bred or artificially propagated;(d) 'import notification` shall mean the notification given by the importer or his agent or representative, at the time of the introduction into the Community of a specimen of a species included in Annexes C or D, on a form prescribed by the Commission in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 18;(e) 'introduction from the sea` shall mean the introduction into the Community of any specimen which was taken in, and is being introduced directly from, the marine environment not under the jurisdiction of any State, including the air-space above the sea and the sea-bed and subsoil beneath the sea;(f) 'issuance` shall mean the completion of all procedures involved in preparing and validating a permit or certificate and its delivery to the applicant;(g) 'management authority` shall mean a national administrative authority designated, in the case of a Member State, in accordance with Article 13(1)(a) or, in the case of a third country party to the Convention, in accordance with Article IX of the Convention;(h) 'Member State of destination` shall mean the Member State of destination mentioned in the document used to export or re-export a specimen;

The prohibitions referred to in paragraph 1 shall also apply to specimens of the species listed in Annex B except where it can be proved to the satisfaction of the competent authority of the Member State concerned that such specimens were acquired and, if they originated outside the Community, were introduced into it, in accordance with the legislation in force for the conservation of wild fauna and flora.6. The competent authorities of the Member States shall have discretion to sell any specimen of the species listed in Annexes B to D they have confiscated under this Regulation, provided that it is not thus returned directly to the person or entity from whom it was confiscated or who was party to the offence. Such specimens may then be treated for all purposes as if they had been legally acquired.Article 9 Movement of live specimens1. Any movement within the Community of a live specimen of a species listed in Annex A from the location indicated in the import permit or in any certificate issued in compliance with this Regulation shall require prior authorization from a management authority of the Member State in which the specimen is located. In other cases of movement, the person responsible for moving the specimen must be able, where applicable, to provide proof of the legal origin of the specimen.2. Such authorization shall:(a) be granted only when the competent scientific authority of such Member State or, where the movement is to another Member State, the competent scientific authority of the latter, is satisfied that the intended accommodation for a live specimen at the place of destination is adequately equipped to conserve and care for it properly;(b) be confirmed by issuance of a certificate; and(c) where applicable, be immediately communicated to a management authority of the Member State in which the specimen is to be located.3. However, no such authorization shall be required if a live animal must be moved for the purpose of urgent veterinary treatment and is returned directly to its authorized location.4. Where a live specimen of a species listed in Annex B is moved within the Community, the holder of the specimen may relinquish it only after ensuring that the intended recipient is adequately informed of the accommodation, equipment and practices required to ensure the specimen will be properly cared for.5. When any live specimens are transported into, from or within the Community or are held during any period of transit or transhipment, they shall be prepared, moved and cared for in a manner such as to minimize the risk of injury, damage to health or cruel treatment and, in the case of animals, in conformity with Community legislation on the protection of animals during transport.6. Under the procedure laid down in Article 18, the Commission may establish restrictions on the holding or movement of live specimens of species in relation to which restrictions on introduction into the Community have been established in accordance with Article 4 (6).Article 10 Certificates to be issuedOn receiving an application, together with all the requisite supporting documents, from the person concerned and provided that all the conditions governing their issuance have been fulfilled, a management authority of a Member State may issue a certificate for the purposes referred to in Article 5 (2) (b), 5 (3) and (4), Article 8 (3) and Article 9 (2) (b).Article 11 Validity of and special conditions for permits and certificates1. Without prejudice to stricter measures which the Member States may adopt or maintain, permits and certificates issued by the competent authorities of the Member States in accordance with this Regulation shall be valid throughout the Community.2. (a) However, any such permit or certificate, as well as any permit or certificate issued on the basis of it, shall be deemed void if a competent authority or the Commission, in consultation with the competent authority which issued the permit or certificate, establishes that it was issued on the false premise that the conditions for its issuance were met.(b) Specimens situated in the territory of a Member State and covered by such documents shall be seized by the competent authorities of that Member State and may be confiscated.3. Any permit or certificate issued in accordance with this Regulation may stipulate conditions and requirements imposed by the issuing authority to ensure compliance with the provisions thereof. Where such conditions or requirements need to be incorporated in the design of permits or certificates, Member States shall inform the Commission thereof.4.

In accordance with those regulations, Member States apply rules on the import and export of endangered species of animals and plants, and products derived from them.\nKEY POINTS\nTrade controls\nThe import of specimens of endangered species into the EU requires a permit issued by an authority of the Member State of destination or an import notification.\nExport from the EU requires an export permit or a re-export certificate issued by an authority of the Member State in which the specimens are located.\nCategories of species are outlined in Annexes A to D to the regulation, which provide different degrees of protection depending on how much the species are endangered.\nTrade in species listed in Annex A, such as the cheetah or certain cactus species, is prohibited, while movement of live animals from this category within the EU requires prior authorisation.\nSpecimens of a species listed in Annexes B and C, such as the cobra or most species of orchids, can be traded if they have been legally obtained and the volume of trade does not harm the wild populations. Movement of live animals from these categories is subject to rules on certification and adequate housing and care.\nFurther restrictions may be imposed in specific circumstances, and Member States may have their own tougher rules.\nSpecial rules apply to specimens born and bred in captivity or that are the result of artificial reproduction, part of personal affects or destined for scientific institutions.\nOrganisation and communication\nMember States must: designate customs offices to carry out the checks;designate the management and scientific authorities responsible for implementation;monitor compliance and penalise infringements;draw up reports and exchange information on implementation and any permit rejections.\nIn February 2016, the European Commission adopted an action plan against wildlife trafficking, to complement and support the implementation of the wildlife trade regulations. The action plan is due to be revised in 2022.\nFROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?\n              \nIt has applied since 1 June 1997.\nBACKGROUND\n              \nFor more information, see:\nThe European Union and trade in wild fauna and flora (European Commission).\nMAIN DOCUMENT\n            \nCouncil Regulation (EC) No 338/97 of 9 December 1996 on the protection of species of wild fauna and flora by regulating trade therein (OJ L 61, 3.3.1997, pp. 1-69)\nSuccessive amendments to Regulation (EC) No 338/97 have been incorporated into the basic text.
