COTIF 1980 was subsequently amended by the Vilnius Protocol of 3 June 1999 (now COTIF 1999).\nThe Convention concerning International Carriage by Rail (COTIF) is OTIF’s basic text. It governs the running of the organisation, as well as its objectives, attributions, relations with its member countries and its activities in general.\nThe aim of OTIF is to promote, improve and facilitate international rail traffic, in particular by:\nestablishing and developing systems of uniform law in regard to: the international carriage of passengers and goods in international rail traffic;the use of wagons as means of transport in international rail traffic;the use of infrastructure in international rail traffic;the carriage of dangerous goods in international rail traffic;\ncontributing to removing certain obstacles to the crossing of frontiers in international rail traffic;\ncontributing to interoperability and technical harmonisation in the rail sector;\nestablishing a uniform procedure for the technical admission of railway material intended for use in international traffic;\nmonitoring the application of all the rules and recommendations established by OTIF.\nIn line with Article 3(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, the EU has exclusive competence to legislate on various rail transport matters which are covered by COTIF. The accession of the EU to COTIF is therefore essential to enable the EU to exercise its competence in international rail relations where this internal competence has been established. For this reason, EU countries meeting in the Council agree an EU position prior to the EU’s participation in COTIF meetings. EU accession to COTIF also safeguards legal security for other OTIF members entering into rail relations with EU countries, since the latter may no longer enjoy rights or assume obligations individually with respect to non-EU countries on matters where the EU as a whole is competent.\nEU accession to COTIF facilitates the development of a uniform legal system applicable to the international carriage of passengers and freight by rail across the countries which are members of OTIF. Accession is not only a legal obligation for the EU; it is also in the interest of the promotion of rail transport worldwide.\nOTIF headquarters are based in Bern, Switzerland and the running of the organisation is ensured by:\nthe Secretary General,\nthe General Assembly,\nthe Administrative Committee,\nthe Revision Committee,\nthe Committee of Experts for the Carriage of Dangerous Goods,\nthe Committee of Technical Experts, and\nthe Rail Facilitation Committee.\nOTIF currently has 49 member countries from Europe, the Middle East, Asia and North Africa, and 1 associate member country (Jordan).\nDATE OF ENTRY INTO FORCE\n              \nThe agreement entered into force on 1 July 2011 and the EU acceded to this convention, as a regional economic integration organisation.\nBACKGROUND\n              \nFor more information, see:\nAbout OTIF (OTIF).\nMAIN DOCUMENTS\n            \nCouncil Decision 2013/103/EU of 16 June 2011 on the signing and conclusion of
