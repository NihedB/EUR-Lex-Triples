The nature and the extent of the requirements referred to in Article 79 of the Treaty and set out in Regulation (Euratom) No 3227/76 should therefore be brought up to date in the light of developments, particularly in the fields of nuclear and information technology.\n(3)\nBelgium, Denmark, Germany, Greece, Spain, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Austria, Portugal, Finland, Sweden and the European Atomic Energy Community have concluded Agreement 78/164/Euratom (2) with the International Atomic Energy Agency in implementation of Article III(1) and (4) of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. Agreement 78/164/Euratom entered into force on 21 February 1977 and was supplemented by Additional Protocol 1999/188/Euratom (3), which entered into force on 30 April 2004.\n(4)\nAgreement 78/164/Euratom contains a particular undertaking entered into by the Community concerning the application of safeguards on source and special fissile materials in the territories of the Member States which have no nuclear weapons of their own and which are parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons.\n(5)\nThe procedures stipulated by Agreement 78/164/Euratom are the result of wide-ranging international negotiations with the International Atomic Energy Agency on the application of Article III(1) and (4) of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. These procedures were approved by the Board of Governors of that Agency.\n(6)\nThe Community, the United Kingdom and the International Atomic Energy Agency are parties to an Agreement for the application of safeguards in the United Kingdom in connection with the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (4). That Agreement entered into force on 14 August 1978, and was supplemented by an Additional Protocol which entered into force on 30 April 2004.\n(7)\nThe Community, France and the International Atomic Energy Agency are parties to an Agreement for the application of safeguards in France (5). That Agreement entered into force on 12 September 1981, and was supplemented by an Additional Protocol which entered into force on 30 April 2004.\n(8)\nIn the territories of France and the United Kingdom some installations or parts thereof as well as certain materials are liable to be involved in the production cycle for defence needs. Special safeguard procedures should therefore be applied to take account of these circumstances.\n(9)\nThe European Council at its meeting in Lisbon on 23 and 24 March 2000 stressed the need to foster the development of state-of-the-art information technology and other telecom networks as well as the content for those networks.\n(10)\nIn response to Additional Protocol 1999/188/Euratom, Member States should be required to communicate certain information to the Commission including a general description of sites, advance notification of the processing of waste and reports on changes of location of certain conditioned waste.\n(11)\nGuidelines adopted for the application of this Regulation should fully respect the Community commitments in this field, in particular those resulting from Additional Protocol 1999/188/Euratom and the Additional Protocols to the Agreement for the application of safeguards in the United Kingdom in connection with the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and to the corresponding Agreement for France.\n(12)\nThe provisions on security added to the Commission rules of procedure (6) by Commission Decision 2001/844/EC, ECSC, Euratom (7) should apply to information, knowledge and documents acquired by the parties without prejudice to Council Regulation No 3 of 31 July 1958 implementing Article 24 of the Treaty establishing the European Atomic Energy Community (8).\n(13)\nIn the interests of clarity, Regulation (Euratom) No 3227/76 should be replaced by this Regulation,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nCHAPTER I\nSCOPE AND DEFINITIONS\nArticle 1\nScope\nThis Regulation shall apply to any person or undertaking setting up or operating an installation for the production, separation, reprocessing, storage or other use of source material or special fissile material.\nIt shall not apply to holders of end products used for non-nuclear purposes which incorporate nuclear materials that are in practice irrecoverable.\nArticle 2\nDefinitions\nFor the purposes of this Regulation, the following definitions shall apply:\n1.\n‘non-nuclear-weapon Member States’ means Belgium, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Germany, Estonia, Greece, Spain, Ireland, Italy, Cyprus, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Hungary, Malta, the Netherlands, Austria, Poland, Portugal, Slovenia, Slovakia, Finland and Sweden;\n2.\n‘nuclear-weapon Member States’ means France and the United Kingdom;\n3.\n‘third country’ means any State which is not a member of the European Atomic Energy Community;\n4.\n‘nuclear materials’ means ores, source materials or special fissile materials as defined in Article 197 of the Treaty;\n5.\n‘waste’ means nuclear material in concentrations or chemical forms considered as irrecoverable for practical or economic reasons and which may be disposed of;\n6.\n‘retained waste’ means waste, generated from processing or from an operational accident, measured or estimated on the basis of measurements, which has been transferred to a specific location within the material balance area from which it can be retrieved;\n7.\n‘conditioned waste’ means waste, measured or estimated on the basis of measurements, which has been conditioned in such a way (for example, in glass, cement, concrete or bitumen) that it is not suitable for further nuclear use;\n8.\n‘discards to the environment’ means waste, measured or estimated on the basis of measurements, which has been irrevocably discarded to the environment as the result of a planned discharge;\n9.\n‘categories’ (of nuclear material) are natural uranium, depleted uranium, uranium enriched in uranium-235 or uranium-233, thorium, plutonium, and any other material which the Council may determine, acting by a qualified majority on a proposal from the Commission;\n10.\n‘item’ means an identifiable unit such as a fuel assembly or a fuel pin;\n11.\n‘batch’ means a portion of nuclear material handled as a unit for accounting purposes at a key measurement point and for which the composition and quantity are defined by a single set of specifications or measurements.

It is understood that the Guidelines will not create any legal rights or obligations and that the Regulation will remain the binding instrument which will prevail in case of any divergence between the Regulation and the Guidelines.\n2.\nIt is understood that by following the Guidelines the operators would ensure that they are in compliance with the provisions of the Regulation addressed by the Guidelines.\n3.\nThe Commission will follow the developments in the field of safeguards and monitor the application of the Regulation. On this basis, the Commission may, as appropriate, modify the Guidelines. Prior to the adoption of any modification, the Commission will undertake to consult stakeholders and Member States. In adopting such modifications the Commission will take account of the positions expressed in such consultations.\n4.\nIt is understood that the Working Party on Atomic Questions, in a suitable composition, will be the forum for the consultation of Member States.", "summary": "Safeguarding nuclear materials\nSafeguarding nuclear materials\nSUMMARY OF:\nRegulation (Euratom) No 302/2005 on the application of Euratom safeguards\nWHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?\n              \nThe regulation reviews and sets out revised rules safeguarding nuclear materials, especially in light of the EU's enlargement and developments in nuclear and information technology. These rules aim to guarantee that nuclear materials are not diverted to purposes other than those for which they were originally declared.\nKEY POINTS\nScope\nThe regulation applies to any person or business setting up or operating an installation for the production, separation, reprocessing, storage or other use of source material or special fissile material. It does not apply to issues arising from end products used for non-nuclear purposes.\nThe regulation repeals Commission Regulation (Euratom) No 3227/76, Commission Regulation (Euratom) No 220/90 and Commission Regulation (Euratom) No 2130/93.\nDeclaration of technical characteristics\nIn response to Additional Protocol 1999/188/Euratom, the basic technical characteristics of new installations must be communicated to the European Commission at least 200 days before the first consignment of nuclear material is due to be received, based on the questionnaire in Annex I.\nFor every new installation with an inventory or annual throughput of an ‘effective kilogramme’ (equivalent to a kilo of plutonium), the declaration must include information on the owner, operator, purpose, location, type, capacity and expected commissioning date, to be submitted at least 200 days before construction begins. Information on any modifications must be supplied within 30 days of the modifications being completed.\nProgramme of activities\nThe Commission must be kept informed of the annual programme of activities concerning operations, arrivals of materials and waste-processing, and operators must give at least 40 days before taking a physical inventory.\nNuclear safeguards\nUsers of nuclear material must keep a system of records and to make declarations about the nuclear material they hold and process to the European Commission.\nThe Commission verifies these declarations for correctness and completeness to re-assure citizens, supplier states, and the international community that the nuclear material is used only for peaceful purposes.\nThe nuclear safeguarding rules include:\nmaterial balance areas and the selection of key measurement points (these are methods used to determine the flow and stocks of nuclear materials);\nchanges in basic technical characteristics which require advance notice;\nprocedures for keeping records of nuclear materials and drawing up reports;\nprocedures for taking physical inventories for accounting purposes as part of safeguarding;\nagreed containment and surveillance;\narrangements for taking samples for safeguard purposes.\nAccounting for nuclear materials\nA system of accounting for nuclear materials stored or used at an installation must be established to ensure close supervision. Recommendation 2009/120/Euratom describes the reference characteristics of an operator’s nuclear material accountancy and control (NMAC) system. Those responsible for installations must submit regular reports to the Commission, including accounting reports, material balance reports describing changes in materials, inventory change reports and an annual summary of physical inventories.\nReporting and verification\nUsers and holders of nuclear material (uranium, plutonium, and thorium) in the EU have to keep records documenting flows, processes, and stocks. Every month they must declare all flows of nuclear materials in and out of their installation to the European Commission. Once a year they must inventory all stocks of nuclear material they hold.\nTransfers between EU countries\nOperators must give advance notification to the Commission if any source materials or special fissile materials (at least one effective kilogram, and excluding materials found in waste) are:\nexported to, or imported from, a non-EU country;\nshipped between a non-nuclear-weapon EU country and a nuclear-weapon EU country (i.e. the United Kingdom or France).\nWaste\nThe Commission must receive advance notification of most operations concerning the treatment of waste, including the location of conditioned waste (embedded in cement) containing certain nuclear materials such as highly enriched uranium.\nEU countries with nuclear weapons (France and the United Kingdom)\nThe regulation does not apply to installations or nuclear materials which have been assigned to meet defence needs in these two EU countries.\nFROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?\n              \nIt has applied since 20 March 2005. Amendments relating to Croatia joining the EU have applied since 1 July 2013.\nBACKGROUND\n              \nThe Euratom Treaty Articles 77, 78, 79 and 81 (in Chapter 7 of the Treaty) deal with nuclear safeguards.\nSee also:\nNuclear energy (European Commission)\nNuclear energy: Safeguards to avoid misuse (European Commission)\nSafeguards and verification (International Atomic Energy Agency)\nTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) (United Nations).\nMAIN DOCUMENT\n            \nCommission Regulation (Euratom) No 302/2005 of 8 February 2005 on the application of Euratom safeguards — Council/Commission statement (OJ L 54, 28.2.2005, pp. 1-71)\nSuccessive amendments to Regulation (Euratom) No 302/2005 have been incorporated into the original text.
