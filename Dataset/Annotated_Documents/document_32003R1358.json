Passenger unit (Article 3(2), (4) and (5))One passenger unit is equivalent to either one passenger or 100 kilograms of freight and mail.For the purpose of drawing up the list of Community airports(see-1-) as referred to in Article 3(2) and for the transitional period referred to in Article 3(4) and (5), the calculation of thresholds using \"passenger units\" has to take into account at Community airports(see-1-), the total passengers carried(see-16-) plus the total direct transit passengers(see-18-) (counted once) plus the total freight and mail loaded and unloaded(see-17-).4. Commercial air service (Article 1 and tables A1, B1, C1)An air transport flight or series of flights for the public transport of passengers and/or freight and mail, for remuneration or for hire.The air service may be either scheduled(-5-) or non-scheduled(-6-).5. Scheduled air service (Tables A1 and B1)A commercial air service(see-4-) operated according to a published timetable, or with such a regular frequency that it constitutes an easily recognisable systematic series of flights.Includes extra section flights occasioned by overflow traffic from scheduled flights.6. Non-scheduled air service (Tables A1 and B1)A commercial air service(see-4-) other than scheduled air service(see-5-).7. Passenger air service (Tables A1 and B1)Scheduled(see-5-) or non-scheduled air service(see-6-) performed by aircraft carrying one or more revenue passengers and any flights listed in published timetables as open to passengers.Includes flights carrying both revenue passengers and revenue freight and mail.8.

DEFINITIONS AND VARIABLES OF INTEREST FOR TABLE A1 (FLIGHT STAGE)10. Flight stage (Table A1)The operation of an aircraft from take-off to its next landing.11. Passengers on board (Table A1)All passengers on board of the aircraft upon landing at the reporting airport or at taking off from the reporting airport.All revenue and non revenue passengers on board an aircraft during a flight stage(see-10-).Includes direct transit passengers(see-18-) (counted at arrivals and departures).12. Freight and mail on board (Table A1)All freight and mail on board of the aircraft upon landing at the reporting airport or at taking off from the reporting airport.All freight and mail on board an aircraft during a flight stage(see-10-).Includes direct transit freight and mail (counted at arrivals and departures).Includes express services and diplomatic bags.Excludes passenger baggage.13. Commercial air flight (Table A1)An air transport flight performed for the public transport of passengers and/or freight and mail, for remuneration and for hire.In table A1, the commercial air flights are aggregated to calculate the other \"indicator fields\" (\"Passengers on board(see-11-)\", \"Freight and mail on board(see-12-)\" and \"Passenger seats available(see-14-)\").14. Passenger seats available (Table A1)The total number of passenger seats available for sale on an aircraft operating a flight stage(see-10-) between a pair of airports.On a flight stage(-10-), the total number of revenue passengers should not exceed the total number of passenger seats available for sale.Includes seats which are already sold on a flight stage i.e. including those occupied by direct transit passengers(see-18-).Excludes seats not actually available for the carriage of passengers because of maximum gross weight limitations.If information on this basis is not available, then one of the following estimates should be provided in order of preference (from more to less adequate):1. the specific aircraft configuration expressed in number of passenger seats available in the aircraft (identified by aircraft registration number),2. the average aircraft configuration expressed in average number of passenger seats available for the type of aircraft for the airline,3. the average aircraft configuration expressed in average number of passenger seats available for the type of aircraft.III. DEFINITIONS AND VARIABLES OF INTEREST FOR TABLE B1 (ON FLIGHT ORIGIN AND DESTINATION) AND TABLE C1 (AIRPORTS)15. On flight origin and destination (Table B1)Traffic on a commercial air service(see-4-) identified by a unique flight number subdivided by airport pairs in accordance with point of embarkation and point of disembarkation on that flight.For passengers, freight or mail where the airport of embarkation is not known, the aircraft origin should be deemed to be the point of embarkation; similarly, if the airport of disembarkation is not known, the aircraft destination should be deemed to be the point of disembarkation.16. Passengers carried (Tables B1 and C1)All passengers on a particular flight (with one flight number) counted once only and not repeatedly on each individual stage of that flight.All revenue and non revenue passengers whose journey begins or terminates at the reporting airport and transfer passengers joining or leaving the flight at the reporting airport.Excludes direct transit passengers(see-18-).17. Freight and mail loaded or unloaded (Tables B1 and C1)All freight and mail loaded onto or unloaded from an aircraft.Includes express services and diplomatic bags.Excludes passenger baggage.Excludes direct transit freight and mail.18. Direct transit passengers (Table C1)Passengers who, after a short stop, continue their journey on the same aircraft on a flight having the same flight number as the flight on which they arrive.In total airport statistics as well as for the calculation of the passenger units(see-3-), passengers in direct transit are counted once only.Passengers who change aircraft because of technical problems but continue on a flight with the same flight number are counted as direct transit passengers.On some flights with intermediate stops, the flight number changes at an airport to designate the change between an inbound and outbound flight. An example is a flight from Barcelona to Hamburg where the flight continues to Frankfurt before returning to Barcelona. Where passengers for an intermediate destination continue their journey on the same aircraft in such circumstances, they should be counted as direct transit passengers.19. Total commercial aircraft movements (Table C1)All take-offs and landings for flights performed for remuneration and for hire.Includes commercial air services(-4-) as well as all commercial general aviation operations.20. Total aircraft movements (Table C1)All take-offs and landings of aircraft.Includes total commercial aircraft movements(-19-) as well as non-commercial general aviation operations.Excludes State flights(-2-).Excludes Touch and goes, overshoots and unsuccessful approaches.\"", "summary": "Statistics in respect of the carriage of passengers, freight and mail by air\nStatistics in respect of the carriage of passengers, freight and mail by air\nSUMMARY OF:\nRegulation (EC) No 437/2003 on collecting statistics about air passengers, freight and mail\nRegulation (EC) No 1358/2003 implementing and amending Regulation (EC) No 437/2003\nWHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATIONS?\n              \nIn order to formulate the EU’s aviation policy, it needs to have comparable, consistent, synchronised and regular statistical data on the scale and development of the carriage of passengers, freight and mail by air within the EU. Regulation (EC) No 437/2003, therefore, aims to establish a solid statistical base for this purpose.\nIt is complemented by Implementing Regulation (EC) No 1358/2003 which contains important methodological information, such as airport categories on which reporting obligations are based, further definitions and coding guidelines.\nKEY POINTS\n              \nThe objective of Regulation (EC) No 437/2003 is to collect reliable, regular, up-to-date, harmonised and comparable information on the carriage of passengers, freight and mail by air. Collecting common data on a comparable or harmonised basis makes it possible to provide an integrated system supplying reliable, consistent and prompt information.\nEach EU country must collect statistical data on:\npassengers;\nfreight and mail;\nflights;\npassenger seats available;\naircraft movements.\nEach EU country must also collect all the specified data for all EU airports in its territory with more than150,000 passengers per year. Less-detailed statistics must be collected for airports with between 15,000 and 150,000 passengers, while airports with fewer than 15,000 passengers do not have to report.\nWhere possible, the collection of data must be based on available sources so as to minimise the burden on respondents. Where an EU country calls upon a respondent to provide information, the respondent is obliged to give true and complete information within the given deadline.\nThe collection of data must be based on complete returns unless other standards of accuracy are established by the European Commission. EU countries must transmit the results of the data processing, including data declared confidential, to Eurostat.\nAt the request of the Commission, EU countries must communicate all information concerning the methods used in the collection of data, as well as any substantive changes to those methods.\nRegulation (EC) No 1358/2003 establishes the list of EU airports (apart from those having only occasional commercial traffic).\nIt contains very important methodological information — such as categories of airports — based on which the reporting obligations are set up, as well as additional definitions and codification guidelines.\nFROM WHEN DO THE REGULATIONS APPLY?\n              \nRegulation (EC) No 437/2003 has applied since 31 March 2003.\nRegulation (EC) No 1358/2003 has applied since 21 August 2003.\nBACKGROUND\n              \nFor more information, see:\nReference Manual on Air Transport Statistics (Eurostat)\nEurostat transport database (Eurostat)\nAir transport statistics (Eurostat).\nMAIN DOCUMENTS\n            \nRegulation (EC) No 437/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 February 2003 on statistical returns in respect of the carriage of passengers, freight and mail by air (OJ L 66, 11.3.2003, pp. 1-8)\nSuccessive amendments to Regulation (EC) No 437/2003 have been incorporated into the basic text.

DEFINITIONS AND VARIABLES OF GENERAL INTEREST1. Community airport (Articles 1 and 3)A defined area on land or water in a Member State subject to the provisions of the treaty, which is intended to be used either wholly or in part for the arrival, departure and surface movement of aircraft and open for commercial air services(see -4-).2. State flight (Article 1 and table C1)Any flight performed by aircraft for military, customs, police or other law enforcement services of a State.Any flight declared as a \"State flight\" by State authorities.The expression \"except for flights by States aircraft\" in Article 1 should be interpreted as \"except for State flights\".3. Passenger unit (Article 3(2), (4) and (5))One passenger unit is equivalent to either one passenger or 100 kilograms of freight and mail.For the purpose of drawing up the list of Community airports(see-1-) as referred to in Article 3(2) and for the transitional period referred to in Article 3(4) and (5), the calculation of thresholds using \"passenger units\" has to take into account at Community airports(see-1-), the total passengers carried(see-16-) plus the total direct transit passengers(see-18-) (counted once) plus the total freight and mail loaded and unloaded(see-17-).4. Commercial air service (Article 1 and tables A1, B1, C1)An air transport flight or series of flights for the public transport of passengers and/or freight and mail, for remuneration or for hire.The air service may be either scheduled(-5-) or non-scheduled(-6-).5. Scheduled air service (Tables A1 and B1)A commercial air service(see-4-) operated according to a published timetable, or with such a regular frequency that it constitutes an easily recognisable systematic series of flights.Includes extra section flights occasioned by overflow traffic from scheduled flights.6. Non-scheduled air service (Tables A1 and B1)A commercial air service(see-4-) other than scheduled air service(see-5-).7. Passenger air service (Tables A1 and B1)Scheduled(see-5-) or non-scheduled air service(see-6-) performed by aircraft carrying one or more revenue passengers and any flights listed in published timetables as open to passengers.Includes flights carrying both revenue passengers and revenue freight and mail.8. All-freight and mail air service (Tables A1 and B1)Scheduled(see-5-) or non-scheduled air service(see-6-) performed by aircraft carrying revenue loads other than revenue passengers, i.e. freight and mail.Excludes flights carrying one or more revenue passengers and flights listed in published timetables as open to passengers.9. Airline (Commercial air transport operator) (Tables A1, B1 and C1)An air transport undertaking with a valid operating licence for operating commercial air flights(see-13-).Where airlines have joint-venture or other contractual arrangements requiring two or more of them to assume separate responsibility for the offer and sale of air transport products for a flight or combination of flights, the airline actually operating the flight shall be reported.II. DEFINITIONS AND VARIABLES OF INTEREST FOR TABLE A1 (FLIGHT STAGE)10. Flight stage (Table A1)The operation of an aircraft from take-off to its next landing.11. Passengers on board (Table A1)All passengers on board of the aircraft upon landing at the reporting airport or at taking off from the reporting airport.All revenue and non revenue passengers on board an aircraft during a flight stage(see-10-).Includes direct transit passengers(see-18-) (counted at arrivals and departures).12. Freight and mail on board (Table A1)All freight and mail on board of the aircraft upon landing at the reporting airport or at taking off from the reporting airport.All freight and mail on board an aircraft during a flight stage(see-10-).Includes direct transit freight and mail (counted at arrivals and departures).Includes express services and diplomatic bags.Excludes passenger baggage.13. Commercial air flight (Table A1)An air transport flight performed for the public transport of passengers and/or freight and mail, for remuneration and for hire.In table A1, the commercial air flights are aggregated to calculate the other \"indicator fields\" (\"Passengers on board(see-11-)\", \"Freight and mail on board(see-12-)\" and \"Passenger seats available(see-14-)\").14. Passenger seats available (Table A1)The total number of passenger seats available for sale on an aircraft operating a flight stage(see-10-) between a pair of airports.On a flight stage(-10-), the total number of revenue passengers should not exceed the total number of passenger seats available for sale.Includes seats which are already sold on a flight stage i.e. including those occupied by direct transit passengers(see-18-).Excludes seats not actually available for the carriage of passengers because of maximum gross weight limitations.If information on this basis is not available, then one of the following estimates should be provided in order of preference (from more to less adequate):1. the specific aircraft configuration expressed in number of passenger seats available in the aircraft (identified by aircraft registration number),2. the average aircraft configuration expressed in average number of passenger seats available for the type of aircraft for the airline,3. the average aircraft configuration expressed in average number of passenger seats available for the type of aircraft.III. DEFINITIONS AND VARIABLES OF INTEREST FOR TABLE B1 (ON FLIGHT ORIGIN AND DESTINATION) AND TABLE C1 (AIRPORTS)15. On flight origin and destination (Table B1)Traffic on a commercial air service(see-4-) identified by a unique flight number subdivided by airport pairs in accordance with point of embarkation and point of disembarkation on that flight.For passengers, freight or mail where the airport of embarkation is not known, the aircraft origin should be deemed to be the point of embarkation; similarly, if the airport of disembarkation is not known, the aircraft destination should be deemed to be the point of disembarkation.16. Passengers carried (Tables B1 and C1)All passengers on a particular flight (with one flight number) counted once only and not repeatedly on each individual stage of that flight.All revenue and non revenue passengers whose journey begins or terminates at the reporting airport and transfer passengers joining or leaving the flight at the reporting airport.Excludes direct transit passengers(see-18-).17. Freight and mail loaded or unloaded (Tables B1 and C1)All freight and mail loaded onto or unloaded from an aircraft.Includes express services and diplomatic bags.Excludes passenger baggage.Excludes direct transit freight and mail.18. Direct transit passengers (Table C1)Passengers who, after a short stop, continue their journey on the same aircraft on a flight having the same flight number as the flight on which they arrive.In total airport statistics as well as for the calculation of the passenger units(see-3-), passengers in direct transit are counted once only.Passengers who change aircraft because of technical problems but continue on a flight with the same flight number are counted as direct transit passengers.On some flights with intermediate stops, the flight number changes at an airport to designate the change between an inbound and outbound flight. An example is a flight from Barcelona to Hamburg where the flight continues to Frankfurt before returning to Barcelona. Where passengers for an intermediate destination continue their journey on the same aircraft in such circumstances, they should be counted as direct transit passengers.19. Total commercial aircraft movements (Table C1)All take-offs and landings for flights performed for remuneration and for hire.Includes commercial air services(-4-) as well as all commercial general aviation operations.20. Total aircraft movements (Table C1)All take-offs and landings of aircraft.Includes total commercial aircraft movements(-19-) as well as non-commercial general aviation operations.Excludes State flights(-2-).Excludes Touch and goes, overshoots and unsuccessful approaches.\"", "triples": [" regulation 1358/2003,  implementing,  regulation 437/2003"]}}, "summary_annotations": {"32003R1358_p1": {"text": "regulation 1358/2003 implementing and amending regulation 437/2003", "triples": [" regulation 1358/2003,  implementing,  regulation 437/2003", " regulation 1358/2003,  amending,  regulation 437/2003"]}, "32003R1358_p2": {"text": "Commission regulation 1358/2003 of 31 July 2003 implementing regulation 437/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council on statistical returns in respect of the carriage of passengers, freight and mail by air and amending Annexes I and II thereto (OJ L 194, 1.8.2003, pp. 9-33)", "triples": [" regulation 1358/2003,  implementing,  regulation 437/2003"]}}}
