{"celex_id": "32019R1149", "reference": "11.7.2019\nEN\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\nL 186/21\nREGULATION (EU) 2019/1149 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL\nof 20 June 2019\nestablishing a European Labour Authority, amending Regulations (EC) No 883/2004, (EU) No 492/2011, and (EU) 2016/589 and repealing Decision (EU) 2016/344\n(Text with relevance for the EEA and for Switzerland)\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Articles 46 and 48 thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee (1),\nHaving regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions (2),\nActing in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure (3),\nWhereas:\n(1)\nThe freedom of movement for workers, the freedom of establishment and the freedom to provide services are fundamental principles of the internal market of the Union, enshrined in the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU).\n(2)\nPursuant to Article 3 of the Treaty on European Union (TEU), the Union is to work for a highly competitive social market economy, aiming at full employment and social progress, and to promote social justice and protection, equality between women and men, solidarity between generations and combatting discrimination. Pursuant to Article 9 TFEU, the Union, in defining and implementing its policies and activities, is to take into account requirements linked to the promotion of a high level of employment, the guarantee of adequate social protection, the fight against social exclusion, and the promotion of a high level of education, training and the protection of human health.\n(3)\nThe European Pillar of Social Rights was the subject of a joint proclamation by the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission at the Social Summit for Fair Jobs and Growth, in Gothenburg on 17 November 2017. That Summit emphasised the need to put people first in order to further develop the social dimension of the Union, and to promote convergence through efforts at all levels, as confirmed in the conclusions of the European Council following its meeting on 14 and 15 December 2017.\n(4)\nIn their Joint Declaration on the EU’s legislative priorities for 2018 to 2019, the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission committed themselves to taking action to reinforce the social dimension of the Union, by working on improving the coordination of social security systems, by protecting workers from health risks in the workplace, by ensuring fair treatment for all in the Union labour market through modernised rules on posting of workers, and by further improving cross-border enforcement of Union law.\n(5)\nIn order to protect the rights of mobile workers and to foster fair competition between companies, in particular small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), it is crucial to improve the cross-border enforcement of Union law in the area of labour mobility and to tackle abuse.\n(6)\nA European Labour Authority (the ‘Authority’) should be established in order to help strengthen fairness and trust in the internal market. The Authority’s objectives should be clearly defined, with a strong focus on a limited number of tasks, in order to ensure that the means available are used as efficiently as possible in areas where the Authority can provide the greatest added value. To that end, the Authority should assist the Member States and the Commission in strengthening the access to information, should support compliance and cooperation between the Member States in the consistent, efficient and effective application and enforcement of the Union law related to labour mobility across the Union, and the coordination of social security systems within the Union, and should mediate and facilitate solutions in the case of disputes.\n(7)\nImproving access to information for individuals and employers, in particular SMEs, about their rights and obligations in the areas of labour mobility, the free movement of services and social security coordination, is essential to allowing them to benefit from the full potential of the internal market.\n(8)\nThe Authority should carry out its activities in the areas of labour mobility across the Union and social security coordination, including the freedom of movement for workers, the posting of workers, and highly mobile services. It should also enhance cooperation between Member States in tackling undeclared work, and other situations that put at risk the proper functioning of the internal market, such as letter-box entities and bogus self-employment, without prejudice to the competence of Member States to decide on national measures. Where the Authority, in the course of carrying out its activities, becomes aware of suspected irregularities in areas of Union law, such as breaches of working conditions or health and safety rules, or labour exploitation, it should be able to report them to, and cooperate on those matters with, the national authorities of the Member States concerned and, where appropriate, the Commission and other competent Union bodies.\n(9)\nThe scope of activities of the Authority should cover specific Union legal acts listed in this Regulation, including amendments thereto. That list should be extended in the case of further Union legal acts being adopted in the field of labour mobility across the Union.\n(10)\nThe Authority should proactively contribute to Union and national efforts in the area of labour mobility across the Union and social security coordination, by carrying out its tasks in full cooperation with the Union institutions and bodies and the Member States, while avoiding any duplication of work and promoting synergy and complementarity.\n(11)\nThe Authority should contribute to facilitating the application and enforcement of Union law within the scope of this Regulation, and to supporting the enforcement of those provisions implemented through universally applicable collective agreements in accordance with the practices of Member States. To that end, the Authority should set up a single Union website for the purpose of accessing all relevant Union websites, and national websites established in accordance with Directive 2014/67/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council (4) and Directive 2014/54/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council (5). Without prejudice to the tasks and activities of the Administrative Commission for the Coordination of Social Security Systems established by Regulation (EC) No 883/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council (6) (the ‘Administrative Commission’), the Authority should also assist in the coordination of social security systems.\n(12)\nIn certain instances, sector-specific Union law has been adopted in order to respond to specific needs in particular sectors, such as in the area of international transport, including road, rail, maritime transport, inland waterways and aviation. Within the scope of this Regulation, the Authority should also deal with the cross-border labour mobility and social security aspects of the application of such sector-specific Union law. The scope of the Authority’s activities, in particular whether its activities should be extended to further Union legal acts that cover sector-specific needs in the area of international transport, should be subject to periodic evaluation and, if appropriate, review.\n(13)\nThe Authority’s activities should cover individuals who are subject to the Union law within the scope of this Regulation, including workers, self-employed persons and jobseekers. Such individuals should include citizens of the Union and third-country nationals who are legally resident in the Union, such as posted workers, intra-corporate transferees or long-term residents, as well as their family members, in accordance with Union law regulating their mobility within the Union.\n(14)\nThe establishment of the Authority should not create new rights or obligations for individuals or employers, including economic operators or not-for-profit organisations as the activities of the Authority should envisage such individuals and employers to the extent that they are covered by the Union law within the scope of this Regulation. Increased cooperation in the area of enforcement should neither place an excessive administrative burden on mobile workers or employers, in particular SMEs, nor discourage labour mobility.\n(15)\nTo ensure that individuals and employers are able to reap the benefits of a fair and effective internal market, the Authority should support Member States in promoting opportunities for labour mobility or the provision of services and recruitment anywhere within the Union, including opportunities for access to cross-border mobility services, such as the cross-border matching of jobs, traineeships and apprenticeships and mobility schemes such as ‘Your first EURES job’ or ErasmusPRO. The Authority should also contribute to improving transparency of information, including on rights and obligations provided for in Union law, and access to services to individuals and employers, in cooperation with other Union information services, such as Your Europe Advice, and taking full advantage and ensuring consistency with the Your Europe portal, which is to form the backbone of the single digital gateway established by Regulation (EU) 2018/1724 of the European Parliament and of the Council (7).\n(16)\nTo that end, the Authority should cooperate in other relevant Union initiatives and networks, in particular in the European Network of Public Employment Services, the European Enterprise Network, the Border Focal Point SOLVIT, and the Senior Labour Inspectors’ Committee, as well as in relevant national services such as the bodies to promote equal treatment and to support Union workers and members of their family that are designated by Member States pursuant to Directive 2014/54/EU. The Authority should replace the Commission in managing the European Coordination Office of the European network of employment services (EURES), established by Regulation (EU) 2016/589 of the European Parliament and of the Council (8), including establishing user needs and business requirements for the effectiveness of the EURES portal and related information technology (IT) services, but excluding the provision of IT and the operation and development of IT infrastructure, which will continue to be ensured by the Commission.\n(17)\nWith a view to ensuring the fair, simple and effective application and enforcement of Union law, the Authority should support cooperation and the timely exchange of information between Member States. Together with other staff, National Liaison Officers working within the Authority should support Member States’ compliance with cooperation obligations, speed up exchanges between them through procedures dedicated to reducing delays, and ensure links with other national liaison offices, bodies, and contact points established under Union law. The Authority should encourage the use of innovative approaches to effective and efficient cross-border cooperation, including electronic data exchange tools such as the Electronic Exchange of Social Security Information (EESSI) system and the Internal Market Information (IMI) system, and should contribute to further digitalising procedures and improving IT tools used for message exchange between national authorities.\n(18)\nTo increase Member States’ capacity to ensure protection of persons exercising their right to free movement and tackle irregularities with a cross-border dimension in relation to Union law within the scope of this Regulation, the Authority should support the national authorities in carrying out concerted and joint inspections, including by facilitating the implementation of inspections in accordance with Article 10 of Directive 2014/67/EU. Those inspections should take place at the request of Member States or upon their agreement to the Authority’s suggestion. The Authority should provide strategic, logistical, and technical support to Member States participating in the concerted or joint inspections in full respect of the confidentiality requirements. Inspections should be carried out in agreement with the Member States concerned and should take place within the legal framework of national law or practice of the Member States in which they take place. Member States should follow up on the outcomes of the concerted and joint inspections according to national law or practice.\n(19)\nConcerted and joint inspections should not replace or undermine national competences. National authorities should also be fully associated in the process of such inspections and should have full authority. Where trade unions are in charge of inspections at national level, concerted and joint inspections should take place following the agreement of, and in cooperation with, the relevant social partners.\n(20)\nIn order to keep track of emerging trends, challenges, or loopholes in the areas of labour mobility and social security coordination, the Authority should develop, in cooperation with Member States and, where appropriate, the social partners, an analytical and risk assessment capacity. This should involve carrying out labour market analyses and studies, as well as peer reviews. The Authority should monitor potential imbalances in terms of skills and cross-border labour flows, including their possible impact on territorial cohesion. The Authority should also support the risk assessment referred to in Article 10 of Directive 2014/67/EU. The Authority should ensure synergies and complementarity with Union agencies, services or networks. This should include seeking input from SOLVIT and similar services on sector-specific challenges and recurring problems concerning labour mobility within the scope of this Regulation. The Authority should also facilitate and streamline data collection activities provided for by Union law within the scope of this Regulation. This does not entail the creation of new reporting obligations for Member States.\n(21)\nTo strengthen the capacity of national authorities in the areas of labour mobility and social security coordination and improve consistency in the application of Union law within the scope of this Regulation, the Authority should provide operational assistance to national authorities, including developing practical guidelines, establishing training and peer learning programmes, including for labour inspectorates to address challenges such as bogus self-employment and abuses of posting, promoting mutual assistance projects, facilitating staff exchanges such as those referred to in Article 8 of Directive 2014/67/EU, and supporting Member States in organising awareness-raising campaigns informing individuals and employers of their rights and obligations. The Authority should promote the exchange, dissemination and uptake of good practices and knowledge, and promote mutual understanding of different national systems and practices.\n(22)\nThe Authority should develop synergies between its task to ensure fair labour mobility and tackling undeclared work. For the purposes of this Regulation, ‘tackling’ undeclared work means preventing, deterring and combating undeclared work as well as promoting the declaration thereof. Building on the knowledge and the working methods of the European Platform to enhance cooperation in tackling undeclared work, established by Decision (EU) 2016/344 of the European Parliament and the Council (9), the Authority should set up, with the involvement of the social partners, a permanent working group also named Platform to enhance cooperation in tackling undeclared work. The Authority should ensure a smooth transition of the existing activities of the platform established by Decision (EU) 2016/344 to the working group within the Authority.\n(23)\nThe Authority should have a mediation role. Member States should be able to refer disputed individual cases to the Authority for mediation after failing to solve them by means of direct contact and dialogue. Mediation should only concern disputes between Member States, while individuals and employers facing difficulties with exercising their Union rights should continue to have at their disposal the national and Union services dedicated to dealing with such cases, such as the SOLVIT network, to which the Authority should refer such cases. The SOLVIT network should also be able to refer to the Authority for its consideration cases in which the problem cannot be solved due to differences between national administrations. The Authority should carry out its mediation role without prejudice to the competence of the Court of Justice of the European Union (the ‘Court of Justice’) concerning the interpretation of Union law and without prejudice to the competence of the Administrative Commission.\n(24)\nThe European Interoperability Framework (EIF) offers principles and recommendations on how to improve governance of interoperability activities and public services delivery, establish cross-organisational and cross-border relationships, streamline processes supporting end-to-end digital exchanges, and ensure that both existing and new legislation support interoperability principles. The European Interoperability Reference Architecture (EIRA) is a generic structure, comprising principles and guidelines applying to the implementation of interoperability solutions, referred to in Decision (EU) 2015/2240 of the European Parliament and of the Council (10). Both the EIF and the EIRA should guide and support the Authority when considering interoperability matters.\n(25)\nThe Authority should aim to provide better access to online information and services for Union and national stakeholders and facilitate the exchange of information between them. Therefore, the use of digital tools should be encouraged by the Authority, whenever possible. Besides IT systems and websites, digital tools such as online platforms and databases play an increasingly central role in the cross-border labour mobility market. Thus, such tools are useful to provide easy access to relevant online information and facilitate exchange of information for Union and national stakeholders regarding their cross-border activities.\n(26)\nThe Authority should strive for websites and mobile applications established for the implementation of the tasks laid down in this Regulation to be in accordance with relevant accessibility requirements of the Union. Directive (EU) 2016/2102 of the European Parliament and of the Council (11) requires Member States to ensure that their public bodies’ websites are accessible in accordance with the principles that they are perceivable, operable, understandable and robust and that they comply with the requirements of that Directive. That Directive does not apply to websites or mobile applications of Union institutions, bodies, offices and agencies. However, the Authority should endeavour to comply with the principles set out in that Directive.\n(27)\nThe Authority should be governed and operated in line with the principles of the Joint Statement of the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission on decentralised agencies of 19 July 2012.\n(28)\nThe principle of equality is a fundamental principle of Union law. It requires that equality between women and men is ensured in all areas, including employment, work and pay. All parties should aim to achieve a balanced representation between women and men on the Management Board and the Stakeholder Group. That aim should also be pursued by the Management Board with regard to its Chairperson and Deputy Chairpersons taken together.\n(29)\nThe Member States and the Commission should be represented on a Management Board, in order to ensure the effective functioning of the Authority. The European Parliament as well as cross-industry social partner organisations at Union level, with an equal representation of trade union and employer organisations and with adequate representation of SMEs, may also nominate representatives to the Management Board. The composition of the Management Board, including the selection of its Chair and Deputy-Chair, should respect the principles of gender balance, experience and qualification. In view of the effective and efficient functioning of the Authority, the Management Board, in particular, should adopt an annual work programme, carry out its functions relating to the Authority’s budget, adopt the financial rules applicable to the Authority, appoint an Executive Director, and establish procedures for taking decisions relating to the operational tasks of the Authority by the Executive Director. Representatives from third countries that apply the Union rules within the scope of this Regulation, should be able to participate in the meetings of the Management Board as observers.\n(30)\nIn exceptional cases, where necessary to maintain the maximum level of confidentiality, the independent expert appointed by the European Parliament and the representatives of cross-industry social partner organisations at Union level should not participate in deliberations of the Management Board. Such provision should be clearly specified in the rules of procedure of the Management Board and limited to sensitive information regarding individual cases, to ensure that the effective participation of the expert and the representatives in the work of the Management Board is not unduly limited.\n(31)\nAn Executive Director should be appointed to ensure the overall administrative management of the Authority and the implementation of the tasks assigned to the Authority. Other staff members may deputise for the Executive Director where this is deemed to be necessary in order to ensure the day-to-day management of the Authority, in accordance with the internal rules of the Authority, without creating additional managerial positions.\n(32)\nWithout prejudice to the powers of the Commission, the Management Board and the Executive Director should be independent in the performance of their duties and act in the public interest.\n(33)\nThe Authority should directly rely on the expertise of relevant stakeholders in the areas under the scope of this Regulation through a dedicated Stakeholder Group. The members should be representatives of the Union-level social partners, including recognised Union sectoral social partners representing sectors particularly concerned with labour mobility issues. The Stakeholder Group should receive prior briefing and be able to submit their opinions to the Authority, upon request or on their own initiative. In carrying out its activities, the Stakeholder Group will take due account of the opinions and draw on the expertise of the Advisory Committee for the Coordination of Social Security Systems established by Regulation (EC) No 883/2004 and the Advisory Committee on the Free Movement of Workers established pursuant to Regulation (EU) No 492/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council (12).\n(34)\nTo guarantee its full autonomy and independence, the Authority should be granted an autonomous budget, with revenue coming from the general budget of the Union, any voluntary financial contribution from the Member States and any contribution from third countries participating in the work of the Authority. In exceptional and duly justified cases it should also be in the position to receive delegation agreements or ad hoc grants, and to charge for publications and any service provided by the Authority.\n(35)\nThe translation services required for the Authority’s functioning should be provided by the Translation Centre of the Bodies of the European Union (Translation Centre). The Authority should work together with the Translation Centre to establish indicators for quality, timeliness and confidentiality, to identify clearly the Authority’s needs and priorities, and create transparent and objective procedures for the translation process.\n(36)\nProcessing of personal data carried out in the context of this Regulation should be conducted in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (13) or (EU) 2018/1725 (14) of the European Parliament and of the Council, as applicable. This includes putting in place appropriate technical and organisational measures to comply with the obligations imposed by those Regulations, in particular measures relating to the lawfulness of the processing, the security of the processing activities, the provision of information and the rights of data subjects.\n(37)\nIn order to ensure the transparent operation of the Authority, Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council (15) should apply to the Authority. The activities of the Authority should be subject to the scrutiny of the European Ombudsman in accordance with Article 228 TFEU.\n(38)\nRegulation (EU, Euratom) No 883/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council (16) should apply to the Authority, which should accede to the Interinstitutional Agreement of 25 May 1999 between the European Parliament, the Council of the European Union and the Commission of the European Communities concerning internal investigations by the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF).\n(39)\nThe Authority’s host Member State should provide the best possible conditions to ensure the proper functioning of the Authority.\n(40)\nIn order to ensure open and transparent employment conditions and the equal treatment of staff, the Staff Regulations of Officials of the European Union and the Conditions of Employment of Other Servants of the Union, laid down in Council Regulation (EEC, Euratom, ECSC) No 259/68 (17) (referred to as the ‘Staff Regulations’ and the ‘Conditions of Employment’, respectively), should apply to the staff and to the Executive Director of the Authority, including the rules of professional secrecy or other equivalent duties of confidentiality.\n(41)\nWithin the framework of their respective competences, the Authority should cooperate with agencies of the Union, in particular those established in the area of employment and social policy, building on their expertise and maximising synergies: the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions (Eurofound), the European Centre for the Development of Vocational Training (Cedefop), the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work (EU-OSHA), and the European Training Foundation (ETF), as well as, as regards the fight against organised crime and trafficking in human beings, with the European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Cooperation (Europol) and European Union Agency for Criminal Justice Cooperation (Eurojust). Such cooperation should ensure coordination, promote synergies and avoid any duplication in their activities.\n(42)\nIn the field of social security coordination, the Authority and the Administrative Commission should cooperate closely with the aim of achieving synergies and avoiding any duplication.\n(43)\nIn order to bring an operational dimension to the activities of existing bodies in the areas within the scope of this Regulation, the Authority should carry out the tasks of the Technical Committee on the Free Movement of Workers established pursuant to Regulation (EU) No 492/2011, the Committee of Experts on Posting of Workers set up by Commission Decision 2009/17/EC (18), including the exchange of information on administrative cooperation, the assistance in questions on implementation as well as cross-border enforcement, and the platform established by Decision (EU) 2016/344. Once the Authority is operational, those bodies should cease to exist. The Management Board may decide to set up dedicated working groups or expert panels.\n(44)\nThe Advisory Committee for the Coordination of Social Security Systems and the Advisory Committee on the Free Movement of Workers provide a forum for the consultation of social partners and government representatives at national level. The Authority should contribute to their work and may participate in their meetings.\n(45)\nIn order to reflect the new institutional set-up, Regulations (EC) No 883/2004, (EU) No 492/2011, and (EU) 2016/589 should be amended, and Decision (EU) 2016/344 should be repealed once the Authority is operational.\n(46)\nThe Authority should respect the diversity of national industrial relations systems as well as the autonomy of the social partners as explicitly recognised by the TFEU. Taking part in the activities of the Authority is without prejudice to the Member States’ competences, obligations and responsibilities under, inter alia, relevant and applicable International Labour Organisation (ILO) conventions, such as Convention No 81 concerning Labour Inspection in Industry and Commerce, and to the Member States’ powers to regulate, mediate or monitor national industrial relations, in particular on the exercise of the right to collective bargaining and to take collective action.\n(47)\nSince the objectives of this Regulation, namely to contribute, within its scope, to ensuring fair labour mobility across the Union and to assist Member States and the Commission in the coordination of social security systems within the Union cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States acting in an uncoordinated manner, but can rather, by reason of the cross-border nature of those activities and the need for increased cooperation between Member States, be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 TEU. In accordance with the principle of proportionality as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives.\n(48)\nThis Regulation respects the fundamental rights and observes the principles endorsed, in particular, by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, as recognised in Article 6 TEU,\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nCHAPTER I\nPRINCIPLES\nArticle 1\nEstablishment, subject matter and scope\n1.   This Regulation establishes the European Labour Authority (the ‘Authority’).\n2.   The Authority shall assist Member States and the Commission in their effective application and enforcement of Union law related to labour mobility across the Union and the coordination of social security systems within the Union. The Authority shall act within the scope of the Union acts listed in paragraph 4, including all directives, regulations, and decisions based on those acts, and of any further legally binding Union act which confers tasks on the Authority.\n3.   This Regulation shall not in any way affect the exercise of fundamental rights as recognised in the Member States and at Union level, including the right or freedom to strike or to take other action covered by the specific industrial relations systems in Member States in accordance with national law or practice. Nor does it affect the right to negotiate, conclude and enforce collective agreements, or to take collective action in accordance with national law or practice.\n4.   The scope of activities of the Authority shall cover the following Union acts, including all future amendments to these acts:\n(a)\nDirective 96/71/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (19);\n(b)\nDirective 2014/67/EU;\n(c)\nRegulation (EC) No 883/2004 and Regulation(EC) No 987/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council (20), including the provisions of Council Regulations (EEC) No 1408/71 (21) and (EEC) No 574/72 (22) insofar as they are still applicable, Regulation (EU) No 1231/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council (23) and Council Regulation (EC) No 859/2003 (24) extending the provisions of Regulations (EEC) No 1408/71 and (EEC) No 574/72 to nationals of third countries who are not already covered by these Regulations solely on the grounds of their nationality;\n(d)\nRegulation (EU) No 492/2011;\n(e)\nDirective 2014/54/EU;\n(f)\nRegulation (EU) 2016/589;\n(g)\nRegulation (EC) No 561/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council (25);\n(h)\nDirective 2006/22/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (26);\n(i)\nRegulation (EC) No 1071/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council (27).\n5.   The scope of activities of the Authority shall cover the provisions of this Regulation related to the cooperation between Member States in order to tackle undeclared work.\n6.   This Regulation shall respect the competences of Member States with regard to the application and enforcement of Union law listed in paragraph 4.\nIt shall not affect the rights or obligations of individuals or employers granted by Union law or national law or practice, nor the rights and obligations of national authorities deriving thereof, as well as the autonomy of the social partners as recognised by the TFEU.\nThis Regulation shall be without prejudice to existing bilateral agreements and administrative cooperation arrangements between Member States, in particular those related to concerted and joint inspections.\nArticle 2\nObjectives\nThe objectives of the Authority shall be to contribute to ensuring fair labour mobility across the Union and assist Member States and the Commission in the coordination of social security systems within the Union. To that end, and within the scope pursuant to Article 1, the Authority shall:\n(a)\nfacilitate access to information on rights and obligations regarding labour mobility across the Union as well as to relevant services;\n(b)\nfacilitate and enhance cooperation between Member States in the enforcement of relevant Union law across the Union, including facilitating concerted and joint inspections;\n(c)\nmediate and facilitate a solution in cases of cross-border disputes between Member States; and\n(d)\nsupport cooperation between Member States in tackling undeclared work.\nArticle 3\nLegal status\n1.   The Authority shall be a Union body with legal personality.\n2.   In each Member State, the Authority shall enjoy the most extensive legal capacity accorded to legal persons under their national law. It may, in particular, acquire and dispose of movable and immovable property and be a party to legal proceedings.\nCHAPTER II\nTASKS OF THE AUTHORITY\nArticle 4\nTasks of the Authority\nIn order to achieve its objectives, the Authority shall carry out the following tasks:\n(a)\nfacilitate access to information and coordinate EURES in accordance with Articles 5 and 6;\n(b)\nfacilitate cooperation and the exchange of information between Member States with a view to the consistent, efficient and effective application and enforcement of relevant Union law, in accordance with Article 7;\n(c)\ncoordinate and support concerted and joint inspections, in accordance with Articles 8 and 9;\n(d)\ncarry out analyses and risk assessment on issues of cross-border labour mobility, in accordance with Article 10;\n(e)\nsupport Member States with capacity building regarding the effective application and enforcement of relevant Union law, in accordance with Article 11;\n(f)\nsupport Member States in tackling undeclared work, in accordance with Article 12;\n(g)\nmediate disputes between Member States on the application of relevant Union law, in accordance with Article 13.\nArticle 5\nInformation on labour mobility\nThe Authority shall improve the availability, quality and accessibility of information of a general nature offered to individuals, employers and social partner organisations regarding rights and obligations deriving from the Union acts listed in Article 1(4) to facilitate labour mobility across the Union. To that end, the Authority shall:\n(a)\ncontribute to the provision of relevant information on the rights and obligations of individuals in cross-border labour mobility situations, including through a single Union-wide website acting as a single portal for accessing information sources and services at Union and national level in all official languages of the Union established by Regulation (EU) 2018/1724;\n(b)\nsupport Member States in the application of Regulation (EU) 2016/589;\n(c)\nsupport Member States in complying with the obligations on the access to and dissemination of information relating to the free movement of workers, in particular as laid down in Article 6 of Directive 2014/54/EU and in Article 22 of Regulation (EU) 2016/589, to social security coordination as laid down in Article 76(4) and (5) of Regulation (EC) No 883/2004, and to the posting of workers as laid down in Article 5 of Directive 2014/67/EU, including by means of reference to national information sources such as the single official national websites;\n(d)\nsupport Member States in improving the accuracy, completeness and user-friendliness of relevant national information sources and services, in accordance with the quality criteria laid down in Regulation (EU) 2018/1724;\n(e)\nsupport Member States in streamlining the provision of information and services to individuals and employers pertaining to cross-border mobility on a voluntary basis;\n(f)\nfacilitate cooperation between the competent bodies designated in accordance with Directive 2014/54/EU to provide information, guidance and assistance to individuals and employers in the area of labour mobility within the internal market.\nArticle 6\nCoordination of EURES\nIn order to support Member States in providing services to individuals and employers through EURES, such as cross-border matching of job, traineeship, and apprenticeship vacancies with CVs, and thus facilitating labour mobility across the Union, the Authority shall manage the European Coordination Office of EURES, established under Article 7 of Regulation (EU) 2016/589.\nThe European Coordination Office shall, under the management of the Authority, fulfil its responsibilities in accordance with Article 8 of Regulation (EU) 2016/589, except for the technical operation and development of the EURES portal and related IT services, which shall continue to be managed by the Commission. The Authority, under the responsibility of the Executive Director as set out in point (n) of Article 22(4) of this Regulation, shall ensure that this activity fully complies with the requirements of the applicable data protection legislation, including the requirement to appoint a Data Protection Officer, in accordance with Article 36 of this Regulation.\nArticle 7\nCooperation and exchange of information between Member States\n1.
