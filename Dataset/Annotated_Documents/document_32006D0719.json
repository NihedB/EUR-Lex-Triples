The HCCH has to date adopted a substantial number of conventions in different fields of private international law.\n(2)\nSince the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam, the Community has competence to adopt measures in the field of judicial cooperation in civil matters having cross-border implications insofar as necessary for the proper functioning of the internal market. The Community has exerted this competence by adopting a number of instruments, many of which coincide, partially or fully, with the areas of work of the HCCH.\n(3)\nIt is essential that the Community be granted a status that corresponds to its new role as a major international player in the field of civil judicial cooperation and that it be able to exercise its external competence by participating as a full member in the negotiations of conventions by the HCCH in areas of its competence.\n(4)\nBy decision of 28 November 2002, the Council authorised the Commission to negotiate the conditions and modalities of Community accession to the HCCH.\n(5)\nBy a joint letter from the Commission and the Presidency to the HCCH of 19 December 2002, the Community applied to become a member of the HCCH, and requested the opening of negotiations.\n(6)\nIn April 2004, a Special Commission on General Affairs and Policy of the HCCH expressed the unanimous view that, as a matter of principle, the Community should become a Member of the HCCH and determined certain criteria and procedures for the modalities of its membership.\n(7)\nIn June 2005, the Diplomatic Conference of the HCCH adopted by consensus the amendments to the Statute of the HCCH (Statute) necessary to allow the accession of a Regional Economic Integration Organisation and the Members of the HCCH were subsequently invited to cast their votes on the amendments, if possible within a period of nine months.\n(8)\nThe amendments to the Statute will enter into force three months after the Secretary General of the HCCH has informed the Members that the required two-thirds majority for amending the Statute has been reached. Shortly after the entry into force, an extraordinary meeting of the Council on General Affairs and Policy will formally decide upon the Community's accession to the HCCH.\n(9)\nThe outcome of the negotiations on the revision of the Statute is satisfactory, taking into account the interests of the Community.\n(10)\nArticle 2A of the revised Statute entitles the Community, as a Regional Economic Integration Organisation, to become a Member of the HCCH.\n(11)\nThe Community should accede to the HCCH.\n(12)\nIn accordance with Article 3 of the Protocol on the position of the United Kingdom and Ireland annexed to the Treaty on the European Union and the Treaty establishing the European Community, the United Kingdom and Ireland are taking part in the adoption of this Decision.\n(13)\nIn accordance with Articles 1 and 2 of the Protocol on the position of Denmark annexed to the Treaty on the European Union and the Treaty establishing the European Community, Denmark does not take part in the adoption of this Decision and is not bound by it or subject to its application,\nHAS DECIDED AS FOLLOWS:\nSole Article\n1.   The Community shall accede to the Hague Conference on Private International Law (HCCH) by means of the declaration of acceptance of the Statute of the HCCH (Statute), as set out in Annex I to this Decision, as soon as the HCCH has taken the formal decision to admit the Community as a Member.\n2.   The Community shall also deposit a declaration of competence specifying the matters in respect of which competence has been transferred to it by its Member States, as set out in Annex II to this Decision, and a declaration on certain matters concerning the HCCH, as set out in Annex III to this Decision.\n3.   The President of the Council is hereby authorised to carry out such procedures as may be necessary to give effect to paragraphs 1 and 2.\n4.   The text of the Statute is attached to this Decision as Annex IV.\n5.   For the purpose of this Decision the term ‘Member State’ shall mean Member States with the exception of Denmark.\nDone at Luxembourg, 5 October 2006.\nFor the Council\nThe President\nK. RAJAMÄKI\n(1)  Not yet published on the Official Journal.\nANNEX I\nInstrument of accession to the Hague Conference on Private International Law\nMr J.H.A. VAN LOON\nSecretary-General\nHague Conference on Private International Law\nScheveningseweg 6\n2517 THE HAGUE\nNetherlands\nDear Sir,\nI have the honour to inform you that the European Community has decided to accede to the Hague Conference on Private International Law. I therefore ask you to accept this instrument, by which the European Community accepts the Statute of the Hague Conference on Private International Law in accordance with Article 2A thereof. I enclose a declaration by the European Community specifying the matters in respect of which competence has been transferred to it by its Member States and a declaration on certain matters concerning the Hague Conference on Private International Law.\nThe European Community formally and without reservation accepts the obligations arising from its membership of the Hague Conference on Private International Law, as set out in the Statute, and formally undertakes to fulfil the obligations upon it at the time of its accession.\nI have the honour to be, Sir, yours faithfully,\nPresident of the Council of the European Union\nANNEX II\nDeclaration of competence of the European Community specifying the matters in respect of which competence has been transferred to it by its Member States\n1.\nThis Declaration is given pursuant to Article 2A(3) of the Statute of the Hague Conference on Private International Law and specifies the matters in respect of which competence has been transferred to the European Community by its Member States.\n2.\nThe European Community has internal competence to adopt general and specific measures relating to private international law in various fields in its Member States. In respect of matters within the purview of the HCCH, the European Community notably has competence under Title IV of the EC Treaty to adopt measures in the field of judicial cooperation in civil matters having cross-border implications insofar as necessary for the proper functioning of the internal market (Articles 61(c) and 65 EC Treaty). Such measures include:\n(a)\nimproving and simplifying the system for cross-border service of judicial and extrajudicial documents; cooperation in the taking of evidence; the recognition and enforcement of decisions in civil and commercial cases, including decisions in extrajudicial cases;\n(b)\npromoting the compatibility of the rules applicable in the Member States concerning the conflict of laws and of jurisdiction;\n(c)\neliminating obstacles to the good functioning of civil proceedings, if necessary by promoting the compatibility of the rules on civil procedure applicable in the Member States.\n3.\nIn areas which do not fall within its exclusive competence, the European Community shall take action, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, only if and insofar as the objectives of the proposed action cannot be sufficiently achieved by Member States and can therefore, by reason of the scale or effects of the proposed action, be better achieved by the European Community. Any action by the European Community shall not go beyond what is necessary to achieve the objectives.\n4.\nFurthermore, the European Community has competence in other fields which can be subject to conventions of the HCCH, as in the field of the internal market (Article 95 EC Treaty) or consumer protection (Article 153 EC Treaty).\n5.\nThe European Community has made use of its competence by adopting a number of instruments under Article 61(c) of the EC Treaty, such as:\n—\nCouncil Regulation (EC) No 1346/2000 of 29 May 2000 on insolvency proceedings,\n—\nCouncil Regulation (EC) No 1348/2000 of 29 May 2000 on the service in the Member States of judicial and extrajudicial documents in civil or commercial matters,\n—\nCouncil Regulation (EC) No 44/2001 of 22 December 2000 on jurisdiction, recognition and enforcement in civil and commercial matters,\n—\nCouncil Regulation (EC) No 1206/2001 of 28 May 2001 on cooperation between the courts of the Member States in the taking of evidence in civil or commercial matters,\n—\nCouncil Directive 2003/8/EC of 27 January 2003 to improve access to justice in cross-border disputes by establishing minimum common rules relating to legal aid for such disputes,\n—\nCouncil Regulation (EC) No 2201/2003 of 27 November 2003 concerning jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgements in matrimonial matters and the matters of parental responsibility, repealing Regulation (EC) No 1347/2000, and\n—\nRegulation (EC) No 805/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 April 2004 creating a European Enforcement Order for uncontested claims.\nProvisions on private international law can also be found in other Community legislation, notably in the area of consumer protection, insurance, financial services and intellectual property. Thus, the Community Directives affected by the Hague Convention on the Law Applicable to Certain Rights of Securities held with an Intermediary were adopted on the basis of Article 95 of the EC Treaty.\n6.\nEven if there is no explicit reference to external competence in the EC Treaty, it results from the jurisprudence of the Court of Justice of the European Communities that the provisions of the EC Treaty referred to above constitute legal bases not only for internal acts of the Community, but also for the conclusion of international agreements by the Community. The Community may conclude international agreements whenever the internal competence has already been used in order to adopt measures for implementing common policies, as listed above, or if international agreement is necessary to obtain one of the European Community's objectives (1). The Community's external competence is exclusive to the extent to which an international agreement affects internal Community rules or alters their scope (2). Where this is the case, it is not for the Member States but for the Community to enter into external undertakings with third States or International Organisations. An international agreement can fall entirely or only to some extent within exclusive Community competence.\n7.\nCommunity instruments are normally binding for all Member States. Concerning Title IV of the EC Treaty which comprises the legal basis for judicial cooperation in civil matters, a special regime applies to Denmark, Ireland and the United Kingdom. Measures taken under Title IV of the EC Treaty are not binding upon or applicable in Denmark. Ireland and the United Kingdom take part in legal instruments adopted under Title IV of the EC Treaty if they notify the Council to that effect. Ireland and the United Kingdom have decided to opt in on all measures listed at point 5 above.\n8.\nThe extent of competence which the Member States have transferred to the European Community pursuant to the EC Treaty is, by its nature, liable to continuous development. The European Community and its Member States will ensure that any change in the Community's competences will be promptly notified to the Secretary-General of the HCCH as stipulated in Article 2A(4) of the Statute.\n(1)  Opinion 1/76 of the Court of Justice, ECR 1977, p. 741; Opinion 2/91, ECR 1993, p.

Denmark.\nANNEX III\nDeclaration by the Community on certain matters concerning the Hague Conference on Private International law\nThe European Community endeavours to examine whether it is in its interest to join existing Hague Conventions in respect of which there is Community competence. Where this interest exists, the European Community, in cooperation with the HCCH, will make every effort to overcome the difficulties resulting from the absence of a clause providing for the accession of a Regional Economic Integration Organisation to those Conventions.\nThe European Community further endeavours to make it possible for representatives of the Permanent Bureau of the HCCH to take part in meetings of experts organised by the Commission of the European Communities where matters of interest to the HCCH are being discussed.\nANNEX IV\nSTATUTE OF THE HAGUE CONFERENCE ON PRIVATE INTERNATIONAL LAW\nThe Governments of the countries hereinafter specified:\nthe Federal Republic of Germany, Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Spain, Finland, France, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, Norway, the Netherlands, Portugal, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, Sweden and Switzerland;\nIn view of the permanent character of the Hague Conference on Private International Law;\nDesiring to stress that character;\nHaving, to that end, deemed it desirable to provide the Conference with a Statute;\nHave agreed upon the following provisions:\nArticle 1\nThe purpose of the Hague Conference is to work for the progressive unification of the rules of private international law.\nArticle 2\nMembers of the Hague Conference on Private International Law are the States which have already participated in one or more Sessions of the Conference and which accept the present Statute.\nAny other State, the participation of which is from a juridical point of view of importance for the work of the Conference, may become a Member.

The admission shall become effective upon the acceptance of the Statute by the Regional Economic Integration Organisation concerned.\n2.   To be eligible to apply for membership of the Conference, a Regional Economic Integration Organisation must be one constituted solely by sovereign States to which its Member States have transferred competence over a range of matters within the purview of the Conference, including the authority to make decisions binding on its Member States in respect of those matters.\n3.   Each Regional Economic Integration Organisation applying for membership shall, at the time of such application, submit a declaration of competence specifying the matters in respect of which competence has been transferred to it by its Member States.\n4.   Each Member Organisation and its Member States shall ensure that any change regarding the competence of the Member Organisation or in its membership shall be notified to the Secretary General, who shall circulate such information to the other Members of the Conference.\n5.

Whenever the Member Organisation exercises its right to vote its Member States shall not exercise theirs, and conversely.\n9.   ‘Regional Economic Integration Organisation’ means an international organisation that is constituted solely by sovereign States, and to which its Member States have transferred competence over a range of matters, including the authority to make decisions binding on its Member States in respect of those matters.\nArticle 3\n1.

This decision is not binding on Denmark, which has an opt-out from the area of freedom, security and justice and participates in its own right.\nThe EU deposited a declaration of competence (Annex II), specifying what it has been transferred competence for by the EU countries (except Denmark). These are measures in the field of judicial cooperation in civil matters that have cross-border implications and are necessary for the good functioning of the internal market. Furthermore, the EU has external competences — some of which are exclusive — as clarified by the case-law of the Court of Justice of the European Union. Conventions of the HCCH, for example in the fields of the jurisdiction, recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters, can fall within these competences.\nIn another declaration (Annex III), the EU undertook to examine whether it is in its best interest to join existing Hague conventions where it has competence.\nFROM WHEN DOES THE DECISION APPLY?\n              \nThe EU has been a member of the HCCH since 3 April 2007.\nBACKGROUND\nOn 28 November 2002, the Council authorised the European Commission to negotiate the conditions and modalities of accession to the HCCH.\nThe statute of the HCCH had to be amended to allow the EU — a regional economic integration organisation — to accede. In June 2005, the diplomatic conference of the HCCH adopted the necessary amendments by consensus.\nFollowing the successful negotiations with the HCCH, the Commission tabled a proposal for this Council decision on the accession of the European Community (now the European Union) to the HCCH. The European Parliament gave its assent in September 2006.\n82 countries plus the EU are members of the HCCH.\nKEY TERMS\n              \nHague Conference on Private International Law: an international intergovernmental organisation working for the progressive unification of the rules of private international law in the participating countries. It prepares multilateral legal instruments (including non-binding instruments) and provides the necessary follow-up.\nPrivate international law: also known as conflict of laws, it is a set of rules of procedural law that determines which legal system governs and which law of which country applies to a given legal dispute. These rules apply when a legal dispute has an international element, such as a contract agreed by parties located in different states.\nMAIN DOCUMENT\n            \nCouncil Decision 2006/719/EC of 5 October 2006 on the accession of the Community to the Hague Conference on Private International Law (OJ L 297, 26.10.2006, pp. 1-14)\nlast update 04.12.2017", "tags": ["international organisation", "European Community", "private international law", "the EU's international role"], "subjects": ["Justice and home affairs"], "split": "train", "reference_annotations": {"32006D0719_p1": {"text": "Council regulation 2201/2003 of 27 November 2003 concerning jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgements in matrimonial matters and the matters of parental responsibility, repealing regulation 1347/2000, and", "triples": [" regulation 2201/2003,  repealing,  regulation 1347/2000"]}}, "summary_annotations": {}}
