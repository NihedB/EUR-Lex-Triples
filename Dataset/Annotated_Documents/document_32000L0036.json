However, the use of such names should comply with the provisions of Directive 79/112/EEC and, in particular, with Article 5 thereof.(12) The development of the internal market since the adoption of Directive 73/241/EEC enables \"plain chocolate\" to be treated on the same basis as \"chocolate\".(13) The derogation provided for in Directive 73/241/EEC allowing the United Kingdom and Ireland to authorise the use on their territory of the name \"milk chocolate\" to designate \"milk chocolate with high milk content\" should be maintained; however, the English name \"milk chocolate with high milk content\" should be replaced with the name \"family milk chocolate\".(14) Pursuant to the principle of proportionality, this Directive restricts itself to what is necessary in order to achieve the objectives of the Treaty, in accordance with the third paragraph of Article 5 thereof.(15) Cocoa, cocoa butter and a series of other vegetable fats used in the manufacture of chocolate are mainly produced in developing countries. It is in the interests of people living in developing countries that agreements of as long a duration as possible should be concluded. The Commission should therefore consider how the Community can support this in the case of cocoa butter and other vegetable fats (for example by promoting \"fair trade\").(16) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Directive should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission(6).(17) To avoid creating new barriers to free circulation, Member States should refrain from adopting, for the products in question, national provisions not provided for by this Directive,HAVE ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:Article 1This Directive shall apply to the cocoa and chocolate products intended for human consumption, as defined in Annex I.Article 21. The vegetable fats other than cocoa butter as defined in Annex II and listed therein may be added to those chocolate products defined in Annex I(A)(3), (4), (5), (6), (8) and (9). That addition may not exceed 5 % of the finished product, after deduction of the total weight of any other edible matter used in accordance with Annex I(B), without reducing the minimum content of cocoa butter or total dry cocoa solids.2. Chocolate products which, pursuant to paragraph 1, contain vegetable fats other than cocoa butter may be marketed in all of the Member States, provided that their labelling, as provided for in Article 3, is supplemented by a conspicuous and clearly legible statement: \"contains vegetable fats in addition to cocoa butter\".

Where the products defined in Annex I(A)(3), (4), (5), (6), (7) and (10) are sold in assortments, the sales names may be replaced by \"assorted chocolates\" or \"assorted filled chocolates\" or similar names. In that case, there may be a single list of ingredients for all the products in the assortment.3. The labelling of the cocoa and chocolate products defined in Annex I(A)(2)(c), (2)(d), (3), (4), (5), (8) and (9) must indicate the total dry cocoa solids content by including the words: \"cocoa solids:... % minimum\".4. For the products referred to in Annex I(A)(2)(b) and (2)(d) (second part of the sentence), the labelling must indicate the cocoa butter content.5. The sales names \"chocolate\", \"milk chocolate\" and \"couverture chocolate\" specified in Annex I may be supplemented by information or descriptions relating to quality criteria provided that the products contain:- in the case of chocolate, not less than 43 % total dry cocoa solids, including not less than 26 % cocoa butter,- in the case of milk chocolate, not less than 30 % total dry cocoa solids and not less than 18 % dry milk solids obtained by partly or wholly dehydrating whole milk, semi- or full-skimmed milk, cream, or from partly or wholly dehydrated cream, butter or milk fat, including not less than 4,5 % milk fat,- in the case of couverture chocolate, not less than 16 % of dry non-fat cocoa solids.Article 4For the products defined in Annex I, Member States shall not adopt national provisions not provided for by this Directive.Article 51.

The Commission shall be assisted by the Standing Committee on Foodstuffs, set up by Council Decision 69/414/EEC(7), hereinafter referred to as \"the Committee\".2.

These rules concern composition, sales names, labelling and presentation.\nACT\nDirective 2000/36/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 June 2000 relating to cocoa and chocolate products intended for human consumption [See amending act(s)].\nSUMMARY\nThis Directive harmonises the labelling of cocoa and chocolate products, and establishes definitions for these products in order to enable consumers to make informed choices. It applies without prejudice to the general provisions relating to the labelling of foodstuffs.\nProducts concerned\nThis Directive applies to cocoa and chocolate products intended for human consumption as specified in Annex I to the Directive.\nComposition\nThis Directive adopts the composition of cocoa and chocolate products. In particular, for certain products it determines the minimum percentage of cocoa butter which can be used. It also determines the possibility to use a quantity of vegetable fats which does not exceed 5 % of the end product. The vegetables fats (other than cocoa butter) which can be used are listed in Annex II to the Directive.\nLabelling\nOnly products manufactured according to the compositional rules laid down by this Directive may be marketed under one of the following names (see Annex I to the Directive):\ncocoa butter;\ncocoa powder, cocoa;\nfat-reduced cocoa powder, fat-reduced cocoa;\npowdered chocolate;\npowdered drinking chocolate, sweetened cocoa, sweetened cocoa powder (possibly supplemented by the term fat-reduced);\nchocolate (possibly supplemented by the terms vermicelli or flakes, couverture, and gianduja);\nmilk, cream or skimmed milk chocolate (possibly supplemented by the terms vermicelli or flakes, couverture and gianduja);\nfamily milk chocolate;\nwhite chocolate;\nfilled chocolate;\nchocolate a la taza;\nchocolate familiar a la taza;\nchocolates or pralines.\nThe labelling of cocoa and chocolate products may include additional information. For example, the labelling of chocolate products containing vegetable fats other than cocoa butter must bear the statement contains vegetable fat in addition to cocoa butter in the same field of vision as the list of ingredients, clearly separated from that list.\nThe labelling of powdered chocolate, of sweetened cocoas, as well as of chocolate, milk chocolate, family milk chocolate, chocolate a la taza and chocolate familiar a la taza must indicate the total dry cocoa solids content. In addition, the labelling of non-fat and reduced-fat cocoas and powdered chocolate must indicate the cocoa butter content.\nREFERENCES\nAct\nEntry into force\nDeadline for implementation in the Member States\nOfficial Journal\nDirective 2000/36/EC\n3.8.2000\n-\nOJ L 197 of 3.8.2000\nAmending act(s)\nEntry into force\nDeadline for implementation in the Member States\nOfficial Journal\nRegulation (EC) No 1137/2008\n11.12.2008\n-\nOJ L 311 of 21.11.2000\nThe successive amendments and corrections to Directive 2000/36/EC have been incorporated into the original text.
