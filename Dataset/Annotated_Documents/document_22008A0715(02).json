The financial year of the Organisation shall be the same as the coffee year.Article 20Determination of the Administrative Budget and assessment of contributions1. During the second half of each financial year, the Council shall approve the Administrative Budget of the Organisation for the following financial year and shall assess the contribution of each Member to that Budget. A draft Administrative Budget shall be prepared by the Executive Director under the supervision of the Finance and Administration Committee in accordance with the provisions of Article 18.2. The contribution of each Member to the Administrative Budget for each financial year shall be in the proportion which the number of its votes at the time the Administrative Budget for that financial year is approved bears to the total votes of all the Members. However, if there is any change in the distribution of votes among Members in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 6. of Article 12 at the beginning of the financial year for which contributions are assessed, such contributions shall be correspondingly adjusted for that year. In determining contributions, the votes of each Member shall be calculated without regard to the suspension of the voting rights of any Member or any redistribution of votes resulting there from.3. The initial contribution of any Member joining the Organisation after the entry into force of this Agreement as provided for in Article 42 shall be assessed by the Council on the basis of the number of votes to be held by it and the period remaining in the current financial year, but the assessments made upon other Members for the current financial year shall not be altered.Article 21Payment of contributions1. Contributions to the Administrative Budget for each financial year shall be payable in freely convertible currency and shall become due on the first day of that financial year.2. If any Member fails to pay its full contribution to the Administrative Budget within six months of the date on which the contribution is due, its voting rights and its right to participate in meetings of specialised committees shall be suspended until its contribution has been paid in full. However, unless the Council so decides, such Member shall not be deprived of any of its other rights nor relieved of any of its obligations under this Agreement.3. Any Member whose voting rights have been suspended under the provisions of paragraph 2 of this Article shall nevertheless remain responsible for the payment of its contribution.Article 22Liabilities1. The Organisation, functioning as specified in paragraph 3 of Article 6, shall not have power to incur any obligation outside the scope of this Agreement, and shall not be taken to have been authorised by the Members to do so; in particular, it shall not have the capacity to borrow money. In exercising its capacity to contract, the Organisation shall incorporate in its contracts the terms of this Article in such a way as to bring them to the notice of the other parties entering into contracts with the Organisation, but any failure to incorporate such terms shall not invalidate such a contract or render it ultra vires.2. A Member’s liability is limited to the extent of its obligations regarding contributions specifically provided for in this Agreement. Third parties dealing with the Organisation shall be deemed to have notice of the provisions of this Agreement regarding the liabilities of Members.Article 23Audit and publication of accountsAs soon as possible and not later than six months after the close of each financial year, an independently audited statement of the Organisation’s assets, liabilities, income and expenditure during that financial year shall be prepared. This statement shall be presented to the Council for approval at its earliest forthcoming session.CHAPTER IXPROMOTION AND MARKET DEVELOPMENTArticle 24Removal of obstacles to trade and consumption1. Members recognise the importance of the sustainable development of the coffee sector and of the removal of current obstacles and avoidance of new obstacles which may hinder trade and consumption, while recognising at the same time the right of Members to regulate, and to introduce new regulations, in order to meet national health and environmental policy objectives, consistent with their commitments and obligations under international agreements, including those related to international trade.2. Members recognise that there are at present in effect measures which may to a greater or lesser extent hinder the increase in consumption of coffee, in particular:(a) import arrangements applicable to coffee, including preferential and other tariffs, quotas, operations of government monopolies and official purchasing agencies, and other administrative rules and commercial practices;(b) export arrangements as regards direct or indirect subsidies and other administrative rules and commercial practices; and(c) internal trade conditions and domestic and regional legal and administrative provisions which may affect consumption.3. Having regard to the objectives stated above and to the provisions of paragraph 4 of this Article, Members shall endeavour to pursue tariff reductions on coffee or to take other action to remove obstacles to increased consumption.4. Taking into account their mutual interest, Members undertake to seek ways and means by which the obstacles to increased trade and consumption referred to in paragraph 2 of this Article may be progressively reduced and eventually, wherever possible, eliminated, or by which the effects of such obstacles may be substantially diminished.5. Taking into account any commitments undertaken under the provisions of paragraph 4 of this Article, Members shall inform the Council annually of all measures adopted with a view to implementing the provisions of this Article.6. The Executive Director shall prepare periodically a survey of the obstacles to consumption to be reviewed by the Council.7.

A Committee on Promotion and Market Development shall be established. The Council shall determine its composition and mandate.Article 26Measures related to processed coffeeMembers recognise the need of developing countries to broaden the base of their economies through, inter alia, industrialisation and the export of manufactured products, including the processing of coffee and the export of processed coffee, as referred to in subparagraphs (d), (e), (f) and (g) of paragraph 1 of Article 2. In this connection, Members should avoid the adoption of governmental measures which could cause disruption to the coffee sector of other Members.Article 27Mixtures and substitutes1. Members shall not maintain any regulations requiring the mixing, processing or using of other products with coffee for commercial resale as coffee. Members shall endeavour to prohibit the sale and advertisement of products under the name of coffee if such products contain less than the equivalent of 95 % green coffee as the basic raw material.2. The Executive Director shall submit to the Council a periodic report on compliance with the provisions of this Article.CHAPTER XPROJECT ACTIVITIES OF THE ORGANISATIONArticle 28Development and funding of projects1.

The Council may require Members to furnish such information as it considers necessary for its operations, including regular statistical reports on coffee production, production trends, exports, imports and re-exports, distribution, consumption, stocks, prices and taxation, but no information shall be published which might serve to identify the operations of persons or companies producing, processing or marketing coffee. Members, in so far as is possible, shall furnish information requested in as detailed, timely and accurate a manner as is practicable.3. The Council shall establish a system of indicator prices and shall provide for the publication of a daily composite indicator price which should reflect actual market conditions.4.

The Member may also inform the Council of its difficulty and request technical assistance.5. If it is found that technical assistance is needed in the matter, or if a Member has not furnished, for two consecutive years, the statistical information required under paragraph 2. of this Article and has not sought the assistance of the Council or has not explained the reasons for non-compliance, the Council may take initiatives likely to lead such a Member to furnish the required information.Article 33Certificates of Origin1.
