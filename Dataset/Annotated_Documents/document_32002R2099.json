These committees were governed by the rules set out in Council Decision 87/373/EEC of 13 July 1987 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission(6).(2) By its Resolution of 8 June 1993 on a common policy on safe seas(7), the Council approved in principle the establishment of a Committee on Safe Seas and the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (COSS) and called on the Commission to present a proposal to set up such a committee.(3) The role of COSS is to centralise the tasks of the committees set up under the Community legislation on maritime safety, the prevention of pollution from ships and the protection of shipboard living and working conditions and to assist and advise the Commission on all matters of maritime safety and prevention or reduction of pollution of the environment by shipping activities.(4) In keeping with the Resolution of 8 June 1993, a Committee on Safe Seas and the Prevention of Pollution from Ships should be set up and assigned the tasks previously devolved to the committees established under the aforesaid legislation. All new Community legislation adopted in the field of maritime safety should stipulate recourse to the Committee thereby set up.(5) Decision 87/373/EEC has been replaced by Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission(8), the provisions of which should therefore be applied to COSS. The purpose of the latter decision is to define the Committee procedures applicable and ensure more comprehensive information to the European Parliament and the public on the work of the committees.(6) The measures required to implement the aforesaid legislation should be adopted in accordance with Decision 1999/468/EC.(7) The aforesaid legislation should also be amended to substitute COSS for the Committee set up by Directive 93/75/EEC or, where appropriate, for the ad hoc committee established under any particular act. This Regulation should in particular amend the relevant provisions of Council Regulations (EEC) No 613/91 of 4 March 1991 on the transfer of ships from one register to another within the Community(9), (EC) No 2978/94 of 21 November 1994 on the implementation of IMO Resolution A.747(18) on the application of tonnage measurement of ballast spaces in segregated ballast oil tankers(10), (EC) No 3051/95 of 8 December 1995 on the safety management of roll-on/roll-off passenger ferries (ro-ro ferries)(11) and Regulation (EC) No 417/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 February 2002 on the accelerated phasing-in of double hull or equivalent design requirements for single hull oil tankers and repealing Council Regulation (EC) No 2978/94(12), in order to insert a reference to COSS and to stipulate the regulatory procedure laid down in Article 5 of Decision 1999/468/EC.(8) Moreover, the aforesaid legislation is based on the application of rules resulting from international instruments in force at the date of adoption of the Community act in question, or at the date specified by the latter. As a consequence, Member States cannot apply the subsequent amendments to these international instruments until the Community Directives or Regulations have been amended. This has major disadvantages owing to the difficulty of ensuring that the date of entry into force of the amendment at international level coincides with that of the Regulation integrating this amendment into Community law, not least the delayed application within the Community of the most recent and most stringent international safety standards.(9) However, it is necessary to draw a distinction between the provisions of a Community act making reference, for the purposes of their application, to an international instrument and Community provisions reproducing an international instrument in full or in part. In the latter case, the most recent amendments to the international instruments cannot in any case be rendered applicable until the Community provisions concerned have been amended.(10) Member States should therefore be permitted to apply the most recent provisions of international instruments, with the exception of those explicitly incorporated in a Community act. This can be done by stating that the international convention applicable for the purposes of the Directive or Regulation concerned is that \"in its up-to-date version\", without mentioning the date.(11) For reasons of transparency, the relevant amendments to international instruments that are integrated in Community maritime legislation should be made public in the Community through their publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.(12) A specific conformity checking procedure should, however, be set up to enable the Commission, after consulting COSS, to take whatever measures may be necessary to exclude the risk of amendments to the international instruments being incompatible with the aforesaid legislation or Community policy on maritime safety, the prevention of pollution from ships and the protection of shipboard living and working conditions in force or with the objectives pursued by that legislation. Such a procedure should also prevent international amendments from lowering the standard of maritime safety achieved in the Community.(13) The conformity checking procedure will only be fully effective if the planned measures are adopted as speedily as possible, but at all events before the expiry of the deadline for the entry into force of the international amendment. Consequently, the time available to the Council to act on the proposed measures in accordance with Article 5(6) of Decision 1999/468/EC should be one month,HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:Article 1PurposeThe purpose of this Regulation is to improve the implementation of the Community legislation referred to in Article 2(2) on maritime safety, the prevention of pollution from ships and shipboard living and working conditions:(a) by centralising the tasks of the committees set up under Community maritime legislation and replaced by this Regulation by establishing a single Committee on Safe Seas and the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, to be known as COSS;(b) by accelerating the update of, and facilitating subsequent amendments to, Community maritime legislation in the light of developments in the international instruments referred to in Article 2(1).Article 2DefinitionsFor the purposes of this Regulation:1. \"international instruments\" shall mean the conventions, protocols, resolutions, codes, compendia of rules, circulars, standards and provisions adopted by an international conference, the International Maritime Organisation (IMO), the International Labour Organisation (ILO) or the parties to a memorandum of understanding referred to in the provisions of the Community maritime legislation in force;2. \"Community maritime legislation\" shall mean the Community acts in force listed below:(a) Council Regulation (EEC) No 613/91;(b) Council Directive 93/75/EEC;(c) Council Regulation (EC) No 2978/94;(d) Council Directive 94/57/EC of 22 November 1994 on common rules and standards for ship inspection and survey organisations and for the relevant activities of maritime administrations(13);(e) Council Directive 95/21/EC of 19 June 1995 on port State control(14);(f) Council Regulation (EC) No 3051/95;(g) Council Directive 96/98/EC of 20 December 1996 on marine equipment(15);(h) Council Directive 97/70/EC of 11 December 1997 setting up a harmonised safety regime for fishing vessels of 24 metres in length and over(16);(i) Council Directive 98/18/EC of 17 March 1998 on safety rules and standards for passenger ships(17);(j) Council Directive 98/41/EC of 18 June 1998 on the registration of persons sailing on board passenger ships operating to or from ports of the Member States of the Community(18);(k) Council Directive 1999/35/EC of 29 April 1999 on a system of mandatory surveys for the safe operation of regular ro-ro ferry and high speed passenger craft services(19);(l) Directive 2000/59/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 November 2000 on port reception facilities for ship-generated waste and cargo residues(20);(m) Directive 2001/25/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 4 April 2001 on the minimum level of training of seafarers(21);(n) Directive 2001/96/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 4 December 2001 establishing harmonised requirements and procedures for the safe loading and unloading of bulk carriers(22);(o) Regulation (EC) No 417/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council.Article 3Establishment of a Committee1.

It assists and advises the European Commission on the implementation of EU law on maritime safety, pollution prevention and onboard living and working conditions for crew.\nACT\n                  \nRegulation (EC) No 2099/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 5 November 2002 establishing a Committee on Safe Seas and the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (COSS) and amending the Regulations on maritime safety and the prevention of pollution from ships\nSUMMARY\nWHAT DOES THIS REGULATION DO?\n                     \nIt sets up the COSS Committee comprising representatives of the EU Member States and chaired by the Commission. Its role is to assist in the timely updating and amending of EU maritime legislation. It centralises the work previously done by a number of committees set up under different EU laws in the field.\nKEY POINTS\nScope\nThe COSS's work deals with wide-ranging aspects covered by EU maritime legislation such as:\nport reception facilities: (where ships can deposit their waste or residues from their cargo) in order to reduce discharges into the sea and thus prevent marine pollution;\nmarine equipment: safety of products - but also services - supplied for the building, conversion and maintenance of ships (seagoing and inland) and maritime structures, like oil platforms;\npassenger ships , safety of ferries and cruise ships and onboard living conditions;\nminimum levels of training of seafarers.\nInternational rules\nMany developments in EU maritime law are driven by changes agreed in international organisations, such as the International Maritime Organisation or the International Labour Organisation.\nConformity checking procedure\nTo ensure that there is no conflict between EU maritime law and agreements reached at international level, EU countries and the Commission cooperate and coordinate to define a common EU position.\nThere is a conformity checking procedure which allows the COSS to examine any amendments to a convention or resolution adopted at international level which would have the effect of lowering EU standards. An emergency meeting of the COSS may be called at the initiative of the Commission or at the request of an EU country to examine the amendments involved and to issue an opinion on appropriate EU measures.\nAs a precaution, the Commission can also, where appropriate, ask EU countries to suspend or delay any plans to accept or apply the international amendment concerned.\nCOSS's powers\nThe work of the COSS accelerates and simplifies the incorporation of international rules into EU legislation by allowing amendments to these rules to apply directly, subject to a prior conformity check.\nRegulation (EU) No 182/2011 lays down the rules and principles concerning the European Commission’s implementing powers (comitology). By means of the COSS, EU countries control the Commission's exercise of the implementing powers delegated to it by the various directives and regulations adopted in the field of EU maritime law.\nWHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?\n                     \nFrom 19 December 2002.\nFor further information, see the European Commission's Directorate-General for Mobility and Transport website.\nREFERENCES\nAct\nDate of entry into force\nDeadline for transposition in the Member States\nOfficial Journal\nRegulation (EC) 2099/2002\n19.12.2002\n19.12.2002\nOJ L 324, 29.11.2002, pp. 1-5\nlast update 15.03.2015", "tags": ["International Maritime Organisation", "prevention of pollution", "pollution from ships", "transport of dangerous goods", "maritime surveillance", "vessel", "maritime safety"], "subjects": ["Transport", "Environment"], "split": "train", "reference_annotations": {"32002R2099_p1": {"text": "regulation 2099/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Councilof 5 November 2002establishing a Committee on Safe Seas and the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (COSS) and amending the Regulations on maritime safety and the prevention of pollution from shipsTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 80(2) thereof,Having regard to the proposal from the Commission(1),Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee(2),Having regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions(3),Acting in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 251 of the Treaty(4),Whereas:(1) The measures implementing the existing Regulations and Directives in the field of maritime safety were adopted by a regulatory procedure involving the Committee set up by Council directive 93/75/eec of 13 September 1993 concerning minimum requirements for vessels bound for or leaving Community ports and carrying dangerous or polluting goods(5) and, in certain cases, an ad hoc committee.
