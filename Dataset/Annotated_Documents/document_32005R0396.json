{"celex_id": "32005R0396", "reference": "16.3.2005\nEN\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\nL 70/1\nREGULATION (EC) NO 396/2005 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL\nof 23 February 2005\non maximum residue levels of pesticides in or on food and feed of plant and animal origin and amending Council Directive 91/414/EEC\n(Text with EEA relevance)\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Articles 37 and 152(4)(b) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the Commission,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee (1),\nHaving consulted the Committee of the Regions,\nActing in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty (2),\nWhereas:\n(1)\nCouncil Directive 76/895/EEC of 23 November 1976 relating to the fixing of maximum levels for pesticide residues in and on fruit and vegetables (3), Council Directive 86/362/EEC of 24 July 1986 on the fixing of maximum levels for pesticide residues in and on cereals (4), Council Directive 86/363/EEC of 24 July 1986 on the fixing of maximum levels for pesticide residues in and on foodstuffs of animal origin (5), and Council Directive 90/642/EEC of 27 November 1990 on the fixing of maximum levels for pesticide residues in and on products of plant origin, including fruit and vegetables (6), have been substantially amended several times. In the interests of clarity and simplicity, those Directives should be repealed and replaced by a single act.\n(2)\nThis Regulation directly concerns public health and is relevant to the functioning of the internal market. Differences in national maximum residue levels for pesticides can pose barriers to trade in products included in Annex I to the Treaty and products derived therefrom between Member States and trade between third countries and the Community. Accordingly, in the interest of free movement of goods, equal competition conditions among the Member States, as well as a high level of consumer protection, it is appropriate that maximum residue levels (MRLs) for products of plant and animal origin be set at Community level, taking into account good agricultural practice.\n(3)\nA Regulation establishing MRLs does not require transposition into national law in the Member States. It is therefore the most appropriate legal instrument with which to set MRLs for pesticides in products of plant and animal origin, as its precise requirements are to be applied at the same time and in the same manner throughout the Community and accordingly permit a more efficient use of national resources.\n(4)\nThe production and consumption of plant and animal products play a very important role in the Community. The yield from plant production is continually being affected by harmful organisms. It is essential to protect plants and plant products against such organisms in order to prevent a reduction in yield or damage to them, and ensure both the quality of the products harvested and high agricultural productivity. To this end, different methods are available, including non-chemical methods, practices such as using resistant varieties, crop rotation, mechanical weeding, biological control and chemical methods such as the use of plant protection products.\n(5)\nOne of the most common methods of protecting plants and plant products from the effects of harmful organisms is the use of active substances in plant protection products. However, a possible consequence of their use may be the presence of residues in the treated products, in animals feeding on those products and in honey produced by bees exposed to those substances. According to Council Directive 91/414/EEC of 15 July 1991 concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market (7), public health should be given priority over the interests of crop protection, thus it is necessary to ensure that such residues should not be present at levels presenting an unacceptable risk to humans and, where relevant, to animals. MRLs should be set at the lowest achievable level consistent with good agricultural practice for each pesticide with a view to protecting vulnerable groups such as children and the unborn.\n(6)\nIt is also important to carry out further work to develop a methodology to take into account cumulative and synergistic effects. In view of human exposure to combinations of active substances and their cumulative and possible aggregate and synergistic effects on human health, MRLs should be set after consultation of the European Food Safety Authority established by Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 28 January 2002 laying down the general principles and requirements of food law, establishing the European Food Safety Authority and laying down procedures in matters of food safety (8) (hereinafter the Authority).\n(7)\nDirective 91/414/EEC provides that Member States, when issuing authorisations, are to prescribe that plant protection products be used properly. Proper use includes the application of the principles of good agricultural practice as well as the principles of integrated control. Where the MRLs arising from an authorised use of a pesticide under Directive 91/414/EEC present a risk to the consumer, such use should be revised to decrease the levels of pesticide residues. The Community should encourage the use of methods or products favouring a reduction in risk, and the use of amounts of pesticides at levels consistent with efficient pest control.\n(8)\nA number of active substances are banned under Council Directive 79/117/EEC of 21 December 1978 prohibiting the placing on the market and use of plant protection products containing certain active substances  (9). At the same time, many other active substances are not currently authorised under Directive 91/414/EEC. The residues of active substances in products of plant and animal origin arising from unauthorised use or from environmental contamination or from use in third countries should be carefully controlled and monitored.\n(9)\nThe basic rules with regard to food and feed law are laid down in Regulation (EC) No 178/2002.\n(10)\nIn addition to those basic rules, more specific rules are needed to ensure the effective functioning of the internal market and trade with third countries in relation to fresh, processed and/or composite plant and animal products intended for human consumption or animal feed in which pesticide residues may be present, whilst providing the basis for securing a high level of protection for human and animal health and the interests of consumers. Such rules should include the establishment of specific MRLs for each pesticide in food and feed products and the quality of the data underlying these MRLs.\n(11)\nNotwithstanding the fact that the principles of the general food law laid down in Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 apply only to feed for food-producing animals, in view of the difficulty of segregating products to be used as feed intended for animals which are not destined for food production and in order to facilitate the control and the enforcement of the provisions of this Regulation, it is appropriate to apply them also to feed which is not intended for food-producing animals. However, this Regulation should not be an obstacle to the tests which are necessary in order to assess pesticides.\n(12)\nDirective 91/414/EEC lays down basic rules with respect to the use and placing on the market of plant protection products. In particular the use of those products should have no harmful effects on humans or on animals. Pesticide residues resulting from uses of plant protection products may have harmful effects on the health of consumers. It is therefore appropriate that rules for MRLs for products intended for human consumption be defined that are linked to the authorisation for use of plant protection products as defined under Directive 91/414/EEC. Similarly that Directive needs to be adapted in order to take into account the Community procedure for the establishment of MRLs under this Regulation. Pursuant to that Directive, a Member State may be designated as rapporteur for the evaluation of an active substance. It is appropriate to use the expertise in that Member State for the purposes of this Regulation.\n(13)\nIt is appropriate that specific rules concerning the control of pesticide residues be introduced to complement the general Community provisions on the control of food and feed.\n(14)\nWhilst considering MRLs of pesticides, it should also be recognised that few consumers are aware of the risks arising from pesticides. It would be valuable to fully explain such risks to the public.\n(15)\nMember States should look into the possibility of publishing the names of companies whose products contain higher pesticide residues than the maximum permitted levels.\n(16)\nSpecific rules for animal feed including marketing, storage of feed and feeding of animals are provided for in Directive 2002/32/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 7 May 2002 on undesirable substances in animal feed (10). For certain products it is not possible to determine whether they will be transformed into food or animal feed. Therefore the pesticide residues in such products should be safe both for human and, where relevant, for animal consumption. Accordingly it is appropriate that the rules set out in this Regulation also apply to those products in addition to the specific rules for animal nutrition.\n(17)\nIt is necessary to define at Community level certain terms used for the setting, control and reporting on controls of MRLs for products of plant and animal origin. It is important that the Member States apply proper sanctions in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 882/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on official controls performed to ensure the verification of compliance with feed and food law, animal health and animal welfare rules  (11).\n(18)\nDirective 76/895/EEC provides that Member States may authorise higher levels of MRLs than are currently authorised at Community level. That possibility should cease to exist as, in view of the internal market, it could create obstacles to intra-Community trade.\n(19)\nThe determination of MRLs for pesticides requires lengthy technical consideration and includes an assessment of potential risks to consumers. Therefore, MRLs cannot be set immediately for the residues of pesticides currently regulated by Directive 76/895/EEC or for pesticides for which Community MRLs have not yet been set.\n(20)\nIt is appropriate that the minimum data requirements to be used when considering the setting of MRLs for pesticides be laid down at Community level.\n(21)\nIn exceptional circumstances and in particular for unauthorised pesticides that may be present in the environment, it is appropriate to permit the use of monitoring data in setting MRLs.\n(22)\nMRLs for pesticides should be continually monitored and should be changed to take account of new information and data. MRLs should be set at the lower level of analytical determination where authorised uses of plant protection products do not result in detectable levels of pesticide residues. Where uses of pesticides are not authorised at Community level, MRLs should be set at an appropriately low level to protect the consumer from the intake of unauthorised or excessive levels of pesticides residues. In order to facilitate control of residues of pesticides, a default value is to be set for pesticide residues present in products or groups of products covered by Annex I for which no MRLs have been established in Annexes II or III, unless the active substance in question is listed in Annex IV. It is appropriate to set the default value at 0,01 mg/kg and to provide for the possibility of setting it at a different level for active substances covered by Annex V, taking into account the routine analytical methods available and/or consumer protection.\n(23)\nRegulation (EC) No 178/2002 establishes procedures for taking emergency measures in relation to food and feed of Community origin or imported from a third country. Those procedures allow the Commission to adopt such measures in situations where food is likely to constitute a serious risk to human health, animal health or the environment and where such risk cannot be contained satisfactorily by measures taken by the Member State(s) concerned. It is appropriate that these measures and their effect on humans and, where relevant, animals be assessed by the Authority.\n(24)\nThe lifetime exposure, and where appropriate the acute exposure of consumers to pesticide residues via food products should be evaluated in accordance with Community procedures and practices, taking account of guidelines published by the World Health Organisation.\n(25)\nThrough the World Trade Organisation, the Community's trading partners should be consulted about the MRLs proposed, and their observations should be taken into account before the MRLs are adopted. MRLs set at the international level by the Codex Alimentarius Commission should also be considered when Community MRLs are being set, taking into account the corresponding good agricultural practices.\n(26)\nFor food and feed produced outside the Community, different agricultural practices as regards the use of plant protection products may be legally applied, sometimes resulting in pesticide residues differing from those resulting from uses legally applied in the Community. It is therefore appropriate that MRLs are set for imported products that take these uses and the resulting residues into account provided that the safety of the products can be demonstrated using the same criteria as for domestic produce.\n(27)\nIt is necessary that the Authority assess MRL applications and evaluation reports prepared by the Member States, taking into account the full range of toxicological effects such as immunotoxicity, endocrine disruption and developmental toxicity, with a view to determining the associated risks to consumers and, where relevant, to animals.\n(28)\nMember States should lay down rules on sanctions applicable to infringements of this Regulation and ensure that they are implemented. Those sanctions are to be effective, proportionate and dissuasive.\n(29)\nThe development of a Community-harmonised system for MRLs entails the development of guidelines, databases and other activities with associated costs. It is appropriate for the Community in certain cases to make a contribution to those costs.\n(30)\nIt is good administrative practice and technically desirable to coordinate the timing of decisions on MRLs for active substances with decisions taken for those substances under Directive 91/414/EEC. For many substances for which Community MRLs have not yet been set, decisions are not due to be taken under that Directive before the date of entry into force of this Regulation.\n(31)\nIt is therefore necessary to adopt separate rules providing for temporary but mandatory harmonised MRLs, with a view to setting MRLs progressively as decisions are taken on individual active substances as part of the evaluations under Directive 91/414/EEC. Such temporary harmonised MRLs should be based, in particular, on existing national MRLs established by the Member States and should respect the national arrangements by which they were established, provided that the MRLs do not present an unacceptable risk to consumers.\n(32)\nFollowing the inclusion of existing active substances in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC, Member States are to re-evaluate each plant protection product containing those active substances within four years of the date of inclusion. The MRLs concerned should be retained for a period of up to four years to provide for continuity of authorisations and, on completion of re-evaluation, should be made definitive if they are supported by dossiers which satisfy Annex III to Directive 91/414/EEC, or be set to a default level if they are not so supported.\n(33)\nThis Regulation establishes MRLs for the control of pesticide residues in food and feed. It is therefore appropriate that Member States establish national programmes to control these residues. The results of the national control programmes are to be submitted to the Commission, the Authority and the other Member States and included in the Community annual report.\n(34)\nTo ensure that consumers are kept adequately informed, Member States should, in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 882/2004, publish the results of national monitoring residues annually on the Internet, providing all individual data, including the place of collection and the names of retailers, traders and/or producers.\n(35)\nThe measures necessary for the implementation of this Regulation should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission (12).\n(36)\nIn accordance with the principle of proportionality, it is necessary and appropriate for the achievement of the basic objectives of facilitating trade whilst protecting the consumer to lay down rules on MRLs for products of plant and animal origin. This Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve the objectives pursued in accordance with the third paragraph of Article 5 of the Treaty,\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nCHAPTER I\nSUBJECT MATTER, SCOPE AND DEFINITIONS\nArticle 1\nSubject matter\nThis Regulation establishes, in accordance with the general principles laid down in Regulation (EC) No 178/2002, in particular the need to ensure a high level of consumer protection and harmonised Community provisions relating to maximum levels of pesticide residues in or on food and feed of plant and animal origin.\nArticle 2\nScope\n1.   This Regulation shall apply to products of plant and animal origin or parts thereof covered by Annex I to be used as fresh, processed and/or composite food or feed in or on which pesticide residues may be present.\n2.

The following definitions shall also apply:\n(a)\n‘good agricultural practice’ (GAP) means the nationally recommended, authorised or registered safe use of plant protection products under actual conditions at any stage of production, storage, transport, distribution and processing of food and feed. It also implies the application, in conformity with Directive 91/414/EEC, of the principles of integrated pest control in a given climate zone, as well as using the minimum quantity of pesticides and setting MRLs/temporary MRLs at the lowest level which allows the desired effect to be obtained;\n(b)\n‘critical GAP’ means the GAP, where there is more than one GAP for an active substance/product combination, which gives rise to the highest acceptable level of pesticide residue in a treated crop and is the basis for establishing the MRL;\n(c)\n‘pesticide residues’ means residues, including active substances, metabolites and/or breakdown or reaction products of active substances currently or formerly used in plant protection products as defined in Article 2, point 1 of Directive 91/414/EEC, which are present in or on the products covered by Annex I to this Regulation, including in particular those which may arise as a result of use in plant protection, in veterinary medicine and as a biocide;\n(d)\n‘maximum residue level’ (MRL) means the upper legal level of a concentration for a pesticide residue in or on food or feed set in accordance with this Regulation, based on good agricultural practice and the lowest consumer exposure necessary to protect vulnerable consumers;\n(e)\n‘CXL’ means an MRL set by the Codex Alimentarius Commission;\n(f)\n‘limit of determination’ (LOD) means the validated lowest residue concentration which can be quantified and reported by routine monitoring with validated control methods;\n(g)\n‘import tolerance’ means an MRL set for imported products to meet the needs of international trade where:\n—\nthe use of the active substance in a plant protection product on a given product is not authorised in the Community for reasons other than public health reasons for the specific product and specific use; or\n—\na different level is appropriate because the existing Community MRL was set for reasons other than public health reasons for the specific product and specific use;\n(h)\n‘proficiency test’ means a comparative test in which several laboratories perform analyses on identical samples, allowing an evaluation of the quality of the analysis performed by each laboratory;\n(i)\n‘acute reference dose’ means the estimate of the amount of substance in food, expressed on a body weight basis, that can be ingested over a short period of time, usually during one day, without appreciable risk to the consumer on the basis of the data produced by appropriate studies and taking into account sensitive groups within the population (e.g. children and the unborn);\n(j)\n‘acceptable daily intake’ means the estimate of the amount of substances in food expressed on a body weight basis, that can be ingested daily over a lifetime, without appreciable risk to any consumer on the basis of all known facts at the time of evaluation, taking into account sensitive groups within the population (e.g. children and the unborn).\nArticle 4\nList of groups of products for which harmonised MRLs shall apply\n1.   The products, product groups and/or parts of products referred to in Article 2(1) to which harmonised MRLs shall apply shall be defined in and covered by Annex I in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 45(2). Annex I shall include all products for which MRLs are set, as well as the other products for which it is appropriate to apply harmonised MRLs in particular in view of their relevance in the diet of consumers or in trade. Products shall be grouped in such a way that MRLs may as far as possible be set for a group of similar or related products.\n2.   Annex I shall be first established within three months from the entry into force of this Regulation and shall be revised when appropriate, in particular, at the request of a Member State.\nArticle 5\nEstablishment of a list of active substances for which no MRLs are required\n1.   Active substances of plant protection products evaluated under Directive 91/414/EEC for which no MRLs are required shall be defined in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 45(2) of this Regulation and listed in Annex IV hereto, taking into account the uses of those active substances and the matters referred to in Article 14(2), (a), (c) and (d) of this Regulation.\n2.   Annex IV shall be first established within 12 months from the entry into force of this Regulation.\nCHAPTER II\nPROCEDURE FOR APPLICATIONS FOR MRLS\nSECTION 1\nSubmission of applications for MRLs\nArticle 6\nApplications\n1.   Where a Member State envisages granting an authorisation or a provisional authorisation for the use of a plant protection product in accordance with Directive 91/414/EEC, that Member State shall consider whether, as a result of such use, an existing MRL set out in Annex II or III to this Regulation needs to be modified, whether it is necessary to set a new MRL, or whether the active substance should be included in Annex IV. If necessary it shall require the party requesting the authorisation to submit an application in accordance with Article 7.\n2.   All parties demonstrating, through adequate evidence, a legitimate interest in health, including civil society organisations, as well as commercially interested parties such as manufacturers, growers, importers and producers of products covered by Annex I may also submit an application to a Member State in accordance with Article 7.\n3.   Where a Member State considers that the setting, modification or deletion of an MRL is necessary, that Member State may also compile and evaluate an application for setting, modifying, or deleting the MRL in accordance with Article 7.\n4.   Applications for import tolerances shall be submitted to rapporteur Member States designated pursuant to Directive 91/414/EEC or, if no such rapporteur has been designated, applications shall be made to Member States designated by the Commission in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 45(2) of this Regulation at the request of the applicant. Such applications shall be made in accordance with Article 7 of this Regulation.\nArticle 7\nRequirements relating to applications for MRLs\n1.   The applicant shall include in an application for an MRL the following particulars and documents:\n(a)\nthe name and address of the applicant;\n(b)\na presentation of the application dossier including:\n(i)\na summary of the application;\n(ii)\nthe main substantive arguments;\n(iii)\nan index of the documentation;\n(iv)\na copy of the relevant GAP applying to the specific use of that active substance;\n(c)\na comprehensive overview of relevant concerns raised in the available scientific literature about the plant protection product and/or its residue;\n(d)\nthe data listed in Annexes II and III to Directive 91/414/EEC relating to data requirements for the setting of MRLs for pesticides including, where appropriate, toxicological data and data on routine analytical methods for use in control laboratories, as well as plant and animal metabolism data.\nHowever, where relevant data are already publicly available, in particular when an active substance has already been evaluated under Directive 91/414/EEC or when a CXL exists and such data are submitted by the applicant, a Member State may also use such information in evaluating an application. In such cases, the evaluation report shall include a justification for using or not using such data.\n2.   The evaluating Member State may, where appropriate, request the applicant to provide supplementary information in addition to information required under paragraph 1 within a time limit specified by the Member State. In no event may this period exceed two years.\nArticle 8\nEvaluation of applications\n1.   A Member State to which an application complying with Article 7 is submitted pursuant to Article 6 shall immediately forward a copy to the Authority and the Commission and draw up an evaluation report without undue delay.\n2.   Applications shall be evaluated in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Uniform Principles for the Evaluation and Authorisation of Plant Protection Products set out in Annex VI to Directive 91/414/EEC or specific evaluation principles to be laid down in a Commission Regulation in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 45(2) of this Regulation.\n3.   By way of derogation from paragraph 1 and by agreement between the Member States concerned, evaluation of the application may be carried out by the rapporteur Member State designated pursuant to Directive 91/414/EEC for that active substance.\n4.   Where a Member State encounters difficulties in evaluating an application or in order to avoid duplication of work, it may be decided in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 45(2) which Member State shall evaluate particular applications.\nArticle 9\nSubmission of evaluated applications to the Commission and the Authority\n1.   After completion of the evaluation report, the Member State shall forward it to the Commission. The Commission shall without delay inform the Member States and forward the application, the evaluation report and the supporting dossier to the Authority.\n2.   The Authority shall acknowledge in writing receipt of the application to the applicant, the evaluating Member State and the Commission without delay. The acknowledgement shall state the date of receipt of the application and the accompanying documents.\nSECTION 2\nConsideration of applications concerning MRLs by the authority\nArticle 10\nThe Authority's opinion on applications concerning MRLs\n1.   The Authority shall assess the applications and the evaluation reports and give a reasoned opinion on, in particular, the risks to the consumer and where relevant to animals associated with the setting, modification or deletion of an MRL. That opinion shall include:\n(a)\nan assessment of whether the analytical method for routine monitoring proposed in the application is appropriate for the intended control purposes;\n(b)\nthe anticipated LOD for the pesticide/product combination;\n(c)\nan assessment of the risks of the acceptable daily intake or acute reference dose being exceeded as a result of the modification of the MRL; the contribution to the intake due to the residues in the product for which the MRLs was requested;\n(d)\nany other element relevant to the risk assessment.\n2.   The Authority shall forward its reasoned opinion to the applicant, the Commission and the Member States. The reasoned opinion shall clearly define the basis for each conclusion reached.\n3.   Without prejudice to Article 39 of Regulation (EC) No 178/2002, the Authority shall make its reasoned opinion public.\nArticle 11\nTime limits for the Authority's opinion on applications concerning MRLs\n1.   The Authority shall give its reasoned opinion as provided for in Article 10 as soon as possible and at the latest within three months from the date of receipt of the application.\nIn exceptional cases where more detailed evaluations need to be carried out, the time limit laid down in the first subparagraph may be extended to six months from the date of receipt of the valid application.\n2.   Where the Authority requests supplementary information, the time limit laid down in paragraph 1 shall be suspended until that information has been provided. Such suspensions are subject to Article 13.\nArticle 12\nAssessment of existing MRLs by the Authority\n1.   The Authority shall, within a period of 12 months from the date of the inclusion or non-inclusion of an active substance in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC after the entry into force of this Regulation, submit a reasoned opinion based in particular on the relevant assessment report prepared under Directive 91/414/EEC to the Commission and the Member States on:\n(a)\nexisting MRLs for that active substance set out in Annex II or III to this Regulation;\n(b)\nthe necessity of setting new MRLs for that active substance, or its inclusion in Annex IV to this Regulation;\n(c)\nspecific processing factors as referred to in Article 20(2) of this Regulation that may be needed for that active substance;\n(d)\nMRLs which the Commission may consider including in Annex II and/or Annex III to this Regulation and on those MRLs which may be deleted related to that active substance.\n2.   For substances included in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC before the entry into force of this Regulation, the reasoned opinion referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article shall be delivered within 12 months of the entry into force of this Regulation.\nArticle 13\nAdministrative review\nAny decision taken under, or failure to exercise, the powers vested in the Authority by this Regulation may be reviewed by the Commission on its own initiative or in response to a request from a Member State or from any person directly and individually concerned.\nFor that purpose, a request shall be submitted to the Commission within two months after the day on which the party concerned became aware of the act or omission in question.\nThe Commission shall take a decision within two months requiring, if appropriate, the Authority to withdraw its decision or to remedy its failure to act within a set time-limit.\nSECTION 3\nSetting, modifying or deletion of MRLs\nArticle 14\nDecisions on applications concerning MRLs\n1.   Upon receipt of the opinion of the Authority and taking into account that opinion, a Regulation on the setting, modification or deletion of an MRL or a Decision rejecting the application shall be prepared by the Commission without delay and at the latest within three months, and submitted for adoption in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 45(2).\n2.   With regard to the acts referred to in paragraph 1, account shall be taken of:\n(a)\nthe scientific and technical knowledge available;\n(b)\nthe possible presence of pesticide residues arising from sources other than current plant protection uses of active substances, and their known cumulative and synergistic effects, when the methods to assess such effects are available;\n(c)\nthe results of an assessment of any potential risks to consumers with a high intake and high vulnerability and, where appropriate, to animals;\n(d)\nthe results of any evaluations and decisions to modify the uses of plant protection products;\n(e)\na CXL or a GAP implemented in a third country for the legal use of an active substance in that country;\n(f)\nother legitimate factors relevant to the matter under consideration.\n3.   The Commission may request at any time that supplementary information be provided by the applicant or by the Authority. The Commission shall make available any supplementary information received to the Member States and the Authority.\nArticle 15\nInclusion of new or modified MRLs in Annexes II and III\n1.   The Regulation referred in Article 14(1) shall:\n(a)\nset new or modified MRLs and list them in Annex II to this Regulation where the active substances have been included in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC; or\n(b)\nwhere the active substances have not been included in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC and where they are not included in Annex II to this Regulation, set or modify temporary MRLs and list them in Annex III to this Regulation; or\n(c)\nin the cases mentioned in Article 16, set temporary MRLs and list them in Annex III to this Regulation.\n2.   Where a temporary MRL is set as provided for in paragraph 1(b), it shall be deleted from Annex III by a Regulation one year after the date of the inclusion or non-inclusion in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC of the active substance concerned, in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 45(2) of this Regulation. However, where one or more Member States so request, it may be maintained for an additional year pending confirmation that any scientific studies necessary for supporting an application for setting a MRL have been undertaken. In cases where such confirmation is provided, the temporary MRL shall be maintained for a further two years, provided that no unacceptable safety concerns for the consumer have been identified.\nArticle 16\nProcedure for setting temporary MRLs in certain circumstances\n1.   The Regulation referred to in Article 14(1) may also set a temporary MRL to be included in Annex III in the following circumstances:\n(a)\nin exceptional cases, in particular where pesticide residues may arise as a result of environmental or other contamination or from uses of plant protection products pursuant to Article 8(4) of Directive 91/414/EEC; or\n(b)\nwhere the products concerned constitute a minor component of the diet of consumers, and do not constitute a major part of the diet of relevant subgroups, and, where relevant, of animals; or\n(c)\nfor honey; or\n(d)\nfor herbal infusions; or\n(e)\nwhere essential uses of plant protection products have been identified by a Decision to delete an active substance from, or not to include an active substance in, Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC; or\n(f)\nwhere new products, product groups and/or parts of products have been included in Annex I, and one or more Member States so request, in order to allow any scientific studies necessary for supporting an MRL to be undertaken and evaluated, provided that no unacceptable safety concerns for the consumer have been identified.\n2.   The inclusion of temporary MRLs as referred to in paragraph 1 shall be based on the opinion of the Authority, monitoring data and an assessment demonstrating that there are no unacceptable risks to consumers or animals.\nThe continued validity of the temporary MRLs referred to in paragraphs 1(a), (b), (c) and (d) shall be reassessed at least once every 10 years and any such MRLs shall be modified or deleted as appropriate.\nThe MRLs referred to in paragraph 1(e) shall be reassessed at the expiry of the period for which the essential use was authorised.

EU law regulates which MRLs apply to different products and establishes a default MRL where no specific MRL has been established.\nRegulation (EC) No 396/2005 sets the maximum quantities of pesticide residues permitted in products of animal or vegetable origin intended for human or animal consumption. These MRLs, which are fixed by the European Commission, include:\nMRLs which are specific to particular products intended for human or animal consumption;\na general MRL which applies where no specific MRL has been set (a ‘default level’ of 0.01 mg/kg).\nKEY POINTS\n              \nThe MRLs for all crops and pesticides are listed in the Commission’s EU pesticides database.\nFoodstuffs covered\nThe regulation covers all products intended for human or animal consumption, listed in its Annex I.\nThe regulation does not apply to products of animal or plant origin, if they are intended for:\nthe manufacture of non-food/feed products;\nsowing or planting;\nnationally authorised tests on active substances.\nExceptions\nCertain substances listed by the Commission (Annex VII) may be authorised by national authorities even if they exceed their MRL, if they meet the following conditions:\nthe products are not intended for immediate consumption;\ncontrols are in place to ensure that these products are not made available to the consumer;\nthe other EU Member States and the Commission are informed of the measures.\nSafety assessment\nThe European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) is responsible for the safety assessment of new applications submitted for MRLs and for the review of existing MRLs. This is based on the toxicity of each substance, the maximum levels expected in food and the diets of consumers. Based on the EFSA’s opinion, the Commission issues a regulation to establish a new MRL or to amend or delete an existing one.\nControls of pesticides residues in food\nThe EU has a coordinated multiannual control programme which, each year, requires the Member States to sample, analyse and test an agreed range of products (relevant in the diet) for an agreed range of pesticides.
