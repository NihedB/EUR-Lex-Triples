The introduction of a new criterion for counterparties eligible to conduct interventions at the margins directly with the ECB would require a further amendment of Annex I to the Agreement of 1 September 1998. In the interests of clarity and transparency therefore, the Agreement of 1 September 1998 should be replaced by a new Agreement.\n(2)\nThe European Council agreed in its Resolution of 16 June 1997 (hereinafter the ‘Resolution’) to set up an exchange rate mechanism (hereinafter ‘ERM II’) when the third stage of economic and monetary union began on 1 January 1999.\n(3)\nUnder the terms of the Resolution,\n—\nERM II replaces the European Monetary System;\n—\na stable economic environment is necessary for the good functioning of the single market and for higher investment, growth and employment, and is therefore in the interest of all Member States. The single market must not be endangered by real exchange rate misalignments or by excessive nominal exchange rate fluctuations between the euro and the other EU currencies, which would disrupt trade flows between Member States. Moreover, under Article 124 of the Treaty establishing the European Community, each Member State has an obligation to treat its exchange rate policy as a matter of common interest;\n—\nERM II helps to ensure that non-euro area Member States participating in ERM II (hereinafter ‘participating non-euro area Member States’) orient their policies to stability, foster convergence and thereby help them in their efforts to adopt the euro;\n—\nparticipation in ERM II is voluntary for the non-euro area Member States. Nevertheless, Member States with a derogation can be expected to join the mechanism. A Member State which does not participate from the outset in ERM II may participate at a later date;\n—\nERM II functions without prejudice to the primary objective of the ECB and the non-euro area NCBs to maintain price stability;\n—\nfor the currency of each participating non-euro area Member State (hereinafter ‘participating non-euro area currency’) a central rate against the euro is defined;\n—\nthere is one standard fluctuation band of ± 15 % around the central rates;\n—\nit should be ensured that any adjustment of central rates is conducted in a timely fashion so as to avoid significant misalignments. Thus, all parties to the mutual agreement on the central rates, including the ECB, have the right to initiate a confidential procedure aimed at reconsidering central rates;\n—\nintervention at the margins is in principle automatic and unlimited, with very short-term financing available. However, the ECB and the non-euro area NCBs participating in ERM II (hereinafter ‘participating non-euro area NCBs’) could suspend intervention if this were to conflict with their primary objective of price stability. In their decision they would take due account of all relevant factors and in particular of the need to maintain stability and the credible functioning of ERM II;\n—\nexchange rate policy co-operation may be further strengthened, for example by allowing closer exchange rate links between the euro and the participating non-euro area currencies, where, and to the extent that, these are appropriate in the light of progress towards convergence.\n(4)\nIntervention should be used as a supportive instrument in conjunction with other policy measures, including appropriate monetary and fiscal policies conducive to economic convergence and exchange rate stability. There is the possibility of coordinated intramarginal intervention decided by mutual agreement between the ECB and the respective participating non-euro area NCB, in parallel with other appropriate policy responses, including the flexible use of interest rates, by the latter.\n(5)\nSufficient flexibility needs to be allowed, in particular to accommodate the varying degrees, paces and strategies of economic convergence of the non-euro area Member States.\n(6)\nThis Agreement does not preclude the establishment, on a bilateral basis, of additional fluctuation bands and intervention arrangements between non-euro area Member States.\nHAVE AGREED AS FOLLOWS:\nI.   CENTRAL RATES AND FLUCTUATION BANDS\nArticle 1\nBilateral central rates and intervention rates between the euro and the participating non-euro area currencies\n1.1.\nThe parties to this Agreement shall participate in a joint notification to the market of the bilateral central rates, and any changes to them, between the participating non-euro area currencies and the euro as agreed following the common procedure specified in paragraph 2.3 of the Resolution.\n1.2.\nIn accordance with the fluctuation bands fixed pursuant to paragraphs 2.1, 2.3 and 2.4 of the Resolution, the ECB and each participating non-euro area NCB shall establish, by common accord, the bilateral upper and lower rates between the euro and the participating non-euro area currencies for automatic intervention. The ECB and the participating non-euro area NCBs shall jointly notify the market of these rates, which shall be quoted in accordance with the convention set forth in Annex I.\nII.   INTERVENTION\nArticle 2\nGeneral provisions\n2.1.\nIntervention shall in principle be effected in euro and the participating non-euro area currencies. The ECB and the participating non-euro area NCBs shall inform each other about all foreign exchange intervention intended to safeguard the cohesion of ERM II.\n2.2.\nThe ECB and the non-euro area NCBs shall inform each other about all other foreign exchange intervention.\nArticle 3\nIntervention at the margins\n3.1.\nIntervention at the margins shall in principle be automatic and unlimited. However, the ECB and the participating non-euro area NCBs could suspend automatic intervention if this were to conflict with their primary objective of maintaining price stability.\n3.2.\nIn deciding whether to suspend intervention, the ECB or a participating non-euro area NCB shall also take due account of all other relevant factors, including the credible functioning of ERM II. The ECB and/or the participating non-euro area NCB concerned shall base any decision on factual evidence and, in this context, also give consideration to any conclusion which may have been reached by other competent bodies. The ECB and/or the participating non-euro area NCB concerned shall notify, as long in advance as possible and on a strictly confidential basis, the other monetary authorities concerned and the monetary authorities of all other participating non-euro area Member States of any intention to suspend intervention.\n3.3.\nA payment after payment procedure shall be applied in the event of intervention at the margins, as set forth in Annex I.\nArticle 4\nCoordinated intramarginal intervention\nThe ECB and participating non-euro area NCBs may agree to co-ordinated intramarginal intervention.\nArticle 5\nProcedures for intervention and other transactions\n5.1.\nPrior agreement of the non-euro area NCB issuing the intervention currency shall be obtained when another central bank of the European System of Central Banks intends to use the former's currency in amounts exceeding mutually agreed limits in connection with all non-compulsory intervention, including unilateral intramarginal intervention.\n5.2.\nA non-euro area NCB shall give immediate notification to the ECB when it has used the euro in amounts exceeding mutually agreed limits in connection with all non-compulsory intervention, including unilateral intramarginal intervention.\n5.3.\nBefore carrying out transactions other than intervention which involve at least one non-euro area currency or the euro and which exceed mutually agreed limits, the party intending to carry out such transactions shall give prior notification to the central bank(s) concerned. In such cases the central banks concerned shall agree on an approach which minimises potential problems, including the possibility of settling the transaction, wholly or in part, directly between the two central banks.\nIII.   VERY SHORT-TERM FINANCING FACILITY\nArticle 6\nGeneral provisions\n6.1.\nFor the purpose of intervention in euro and in the participating non-euro area currencies, the ECB and each participating non-euro area NCB shall open for each other very short-term credit facilities.

The value date of the financing operations shall be identical to the value date of the intervention in the market. The ECB shall keep a record of all transactions conducted in the context of these facilities.\nArticle 7\nFinancing of intervention at the margins\n7.1.\nThe very short-term financing facility is in principle automatically available and unlimited in amount for the purpose of financing intervention in participating currencies at the margins.\n7.2.\nThe debtor central bank shall make appropriate use of its foreign reserve holdings prior to drawing on the facility.\n7.3.\nThe ECB and the participating non-euro area NCBs could suspend further automatic financing if it were to conflict with their primary objective of maintaining price stability. The suspension of further automatic financing will be subject to the provisions of Article 3.2 of this Agreement.\nArticle 8\nFinancing of intramarginal intervention\nFor the purpose of intramarginal intervention, the very short-term financing facility may, with the agreement of the central bank issuing the intervention currency, be made available subject to the following conditions:\n(a)\nthe cumulative amount of such financing made available to the debtor central bank shall not exceed the latter's ceiling as laid down in Annex II;\n(b)\nthe debtor central bank shall make appropriate use of its foreign reserve holdings prior to drawing on the facility.\nArticle 9\nRemuneration\n9.1.\nOutstanding very short-term financing balances shall be remunerated at the representative domestic three-month money market rate of the creditor's currency prevailing on the trade date of the initial financing operation or, in the event of a renewal pursuant to Articles 10 and 11 of this Agreement, the three-month money market rate of the creditor's currency prevailing two business days before the date on which the initial financing operation to be renewed falls due.\n9.2.\nAccrued interest shall be paid in the creditor's currency on the date of the initial maturity of the facility, or, if applicable, on the date of the advance liquidation of a debtor balance. In the event of a renewal of the facility pursuant to Articles 10 and 11 of this Agreement, interest shall be capitalised at the end of every three-month period and shall be paid on the date of the final repayment of the debtor balance.\n9.3.\nFor the purpose of Article 9.1 of this Agreement, each participating non-euro area NCB shall notify the ECB of its representative domestic three-month money market rate. A representative domestic three-month money market rate in euro shall be used by the ECB and notified to the participating non-euro area NCBs.\nArticle 10\nAutomatic renewal\nAt the request of the debtor central bank, the initial maturity for a financing operation may be extended for a period of three months.\nHowever:\n(a)\nthe initial maturity may only be automatically extended once for a maximum of three months;\n(b)\nthe total amount of indebtedness resulting from application of this Article may at no time exceed the debtor central bank's ceiling as laid down for each central bank in Annex II.\nArticle 11\nRenewal by mutual agreement\n11.1.\nAny debt exceeding the ceiling laid down in Annex II may be renewed once for three months subject to the agreement of the creditor central bank.\n11.2.\nAny debt already renewed automatically for three months may be renewed a second time for a further three months subject to the agreement of the creditor central bank.\nArticle 12\nAdvance repayment\nAny debtor balance recorded in accordance with Articles 6, 10 and 11 of this Agreement may be settled at any time in advance at the request of the debtor central bank.\nArticle 13\nNetting-out of mutual claims and liabilities\nMutual claims and liabilities between the ECB and a participating non-euro area NCB arising from the operations provided for in Articles 6 to 12 of this Agreement may be netted out against each other by mutual agreement between the two parties involved.\nArticle 14\nMeans of settlement\n14.1.\nWhen a financing operation falls due or in the event of advance repayment, settlement shall in principle be carried out by means of holdings in the creditor's currency.\n14.2.\nThis provision shall be without prejudice to other forms of settlement agreed between creditor and debtor central banks.\nIV.   CLOSER EXCHANGE RATE COOPERATION\nArticle 15\nCloser exchange rate cooperation\n15.1.\nThe exchange rate policy cooperation between participating non-euro area NCBs and the ECB may be further strengthened; in particular, closer exchange rate links may be agreed on a case-by-case basis at the initiative of the interested participating non-euro area Member State.\n15.2.\nOn a case-by-case basis, formally agreed fluctuation bands narrower than the standard one and backed up in principle by automatic intervention and financing may be set at the request of the participating non-euro area Member State concerned, according to the procedure laid down in paragraph 2.4 of the Resolution.\n15.3.\nOther types of closer exchange rate arrangements of an informal nature may also be established between the ECB and participating non-euro area NCBs.\nV.   MONITORING THE FUNCTION OF THE SYSTEM\nArticle 16\nTasks of the General Council of the ECB\n16.1.\nThe General Council of the ECB shall monitor the functioning of ERM II and serve as the forum for monetary and exchange rate policy coordination as well as for the administration of the intervention and financing mechanism specified in this Agreement.

Agreement as last amended by the Agreement of 16 September 2004 (OJ C 281, 18.11.2004, p. 3).\nANNEX I\nQUOTATION CONVENTION FOR CURRENCIES PARTICIPATING IN ERM II AND THE PAYMENT AFTER PAYMENT PROCEDURE IN THE EVENT OF INTERVENTION AT THE MARGINS\nA.   Quotation convention\nFor all the currencies of the non-euro area Member States participating in ERM II, the exchange rate for the bilateral central rate vis-à-vis the euro shall be quoted using the euro as the base currency. The exchange rate shall be expressed as the value of E1 using six significant digits for all currencies.\nThe same convention shall be applied for quoting the upper and lower intervention rates vis-à-vis the euro of the currencies of the non-euro area Member States participating in ERM II. The intervention rates shall be determined by adding or subtracting the agreed bandwidth, expressed as a percentage, to or from the bilateral central rates. The resulting rates shall be rounded to six significant digits.\nB.   Payment after payment procedure\nA payment after payment procedure shall be applied by both the ECB and the euro area NCBs in the event of intervention at the margins. The non-euro area NCBs participating in ERM II shall apply the payment after payment procedure when acting as correspondents of the euro area NCBs and the ECB in accordance with this Annex; the non-euro area NCBs participating in ERM II may, at their discretion, adopt the same payment after payment procedure when settling intervention at the margins that such NCBs have carried out on their own behalf.\n(i)   General principles\n—\nThe payment after payment procedure shall be applied when intervention at the margins in ERM II takes place between the euro and the currencies of the non-euro area Member States participating in ERM II.\n—\nTo be eligible for intervention at the margins in ERM II, counterparties shall be required to keep an account with the NCB concerned. Counterparties shall also be required to maintain SWIFT addresses and/or to exchange authenticated telex keys with the NCB concerned or with the ECB.\n—\nCounterparties eligible for intervention at the margins in ERM II may also conduct such intervention directly with the ECB, provided that they also have the status of eligible counterparties for executing foreign exchange transactions with the ECB pursuant to Guideline ECB/2000/1 of 3 February 2000 on the management of the foreign reserve assets of the European Central Bank by the national central banks and the legal documentation for operations involving the foreign reserve assets of the European Central Bank (1).\n—\nThe non-euro area NCBs participating in ERM II shall act as the correspondents of the euro area NCBs and the ECB.\n—\nWhen intervention at the margins takes place, the NCB concerned or the ECB shall release its payment for a given transaction only after receiving confirmation from its correspondent that the amount due has been credited to its account. Counterparties shall be required to pay in due time so as to enable the NCBs and the ECB to fulfil their respective payment obligations. Consequently, counterparties shall be required to pay before a predefined deadline.\n(ii)   Deadline for the receipt of funds from counterparties\nCounterparties shall pay intervention amounts at the latest by 1 p.m. ECB (CET) time on value date.\n(1)  OJ L 207, 17.8.2000, p. 24.

It established a stable exchange rate mechanism (ERM II), replacing the original European Monetary System, between the euro and the national currencies of non-euro-area Member States (Member States not adopting the euro) but participating in the agreement. Currently, ERM II includes the currencies of Bulgaria, Denmark and Croatia.\nThe aim of the resolution and the 2006 agreement is to avoid excessive exchange rate fluctuations disrupting the single market.\nThe 2020 amending agreement takes account of the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the EU. The Bank of England has no longer been a party to the ERM II Central Bank Agreement since 1 February 2020. Annex II to the agreement ‘Ceilings on access to the very short-term financing facility referred to in Articles 8, 10 and 11 of the Central Bank Agreement’ has been replaced to reflect this departure.\nKEY POINTS\nThe 2006 agreement: confirms that participation in ERM II is voluntary for non-euro-area Member States with an opt out from the single currency, but adds they are expected to participate;provides for a central rate – agreed by the ECB and the relevant national central bank – between the euro and each participating national currency, which may fluctuate by 15% in either direction;allows for automatic and unlimited intervention by the ECB and the national central bank if the 15% limit is crossed;establishes detailed procedures for: the involvement of a euro-area national central bank in any intervention,very short-term credit facilities between the ECB and a non-euro-area national central bank,repayment of outstanding very short-term financing balances,extension of any financing operation,closer exchange rate cooperation between the ECB and non-euro-area national central banks,monitoring of the overall ERM II system,possible amendments of the central rates and the 15% fluctuation limits.\nThe 2006 agreement must be amended whenever a new national central bank participates or a national central bank departs.\nFROM WHEN DO THE RESOLUTION AND AGREEMENT APPLY?\nThe resolution has applied since 16 June 1997.\nThe 2006 agreement has applied since 1 April 2006.\nThe 2020 agreement amends the ERM II Central Bank Agreement with effect from 1 February 2020.\nBACKGROUND\nConvergence of basic economic performance is essential for maintaining a stable exchange rate. A stable economic environment is necessary for the single market to operate properly and to promote higher investment, growth and employment.\nThe exchange rate mechanism gives non-euro-area Member States a reference for sound economic policies, enabling them to prepare to adopt the euro.\nMAIN DOCUMENTS\n            \nResolution of the European Council on the establishment of an exchange rate mechanism in the third stage of economic and monetary union Amsterdam, 16 June 1997 (OJ C 236, 2.8.1997, pp. 5–6).\nAgreement of 16 March 2006 between the European Central Bank and the national central banks of the Member States outside the euro area laying down the operating procedures for an exchange rate mechanism in stage three of Economic and Monetary Union (OJ C 73, 25.3.2006, pp. 21–27).\nAgreement of 22 January 2020 between the European Central Bank and the national central banks of the Member States outside the euro area amending the Agreement of 16 March 2006 between the European Central Bank and the national central banks of the Member States outside the euro area laying down the operating procedures for an exchange rate mechanism in stage three of Economic and Monetary Union (OJ C 32I, 1.2.2020, pp. 1–5).\nThe amendment to the 2006 agreement hasve been incorporated in the original text.
