Each Party shall ensure that, subject to the following paragraphs of this Article, public authorities, in response to a request for environmental information, make such information available to the public, within the framework of national legislation, including, where requested and subject to subparagraph (b) below, copies of the actual documentation containing or comprising such information:(a) without an interest having to be stated;(b) in the form requested unless:(i) it is reasonable for the public authority to make it available in another form, in which case reasons shall be given for making it available in that form; or(ii) the information is already publicly available in another form.2. The environmental information referred to in paragraph 1 above shall be made available as soon as possible and at the latest within one month after the request has been submitted, unless the volume and the complexity of the information justify an extension of this period up to two months after the request. The applicant shall be informed of any extension and of the reasons justifying it.3. A request for environmental information may be refused if:(a) the public authority to which the request is addressed does not hold the environmental information requested;(b) the request is manifestly unreasonable or formulated in too general a manner; or(c) the request concerns material in the course of completion or concerns internal communications of public authorities where such an exemption is provided for in national law or customary practice, taking into account the public interest served by disclosure.4.

The applicant shall be informed of any extension and of the reasons justifying it.8. Each Party may allow its public authorities to make a charge for supplying information, but such charge shall not exceed a reasonable amount.Public authorities intending to make such a charge for supplying information shall make available to applicants a schedule of charges which may be levied, indicating the circumstances in which they may be levied or waived and when the supply of information is conditional on the advance payment of such a charge.Article 5Collection and dissemination of environmental information1.

It is designed to help protect the right of every person of present and future generations to live in an environment adequate to their health and well-being. To this end, the convention provides for action in 3 areas:\nensuring public access to environmental information held by the public authorities;\nfostering public participation in decision-making which affects the environment;\nextending the conditions of access to justice in environmental matters.\nThe EU institutions are covered by the definition of a public authority within the meaning of the convention, on the same footing as national or local authorities.\nThe parties who have signed the convention agree to apply the listed rights and obligations:\nto take the necessary legislative, regulatory and other measures;\nto enable public officials and authorities to help and advise the public on access to information, participation in decision-making and access to justice;\nto promote environmental education and environmental awareness among the public;\nto provide for recognition of and support to associations, organisations or groups promoting environmental protection.\nPublic access to environmental information\nThe convention lays down precise rights and duties regarding access to environmental information, including deadlines for providing information and the grounds on which public authorities may refuse access to certain types of information.\nAccess may be refused in 3 cases:\nthe public authority does not hold the requested information;\nthe request is manifestly unreasonable or formulated in too general a manner;\nthe request concerns material in the course of completion.\nRequests may also be refused on grounds of confidentiality of the proceedings of public authorities, national defence and public security, to further the course of justice or to respect the confidentiality of:\ncommercial and industrial information;\nintellectual property rights;\npersonal data; and\nthe interests of a third party who has disclosed the information.\nBecause the disclosure of information may serve the public interest, all these grounds for refusal must be interpreted in a restrictive way.\nA decision to refuse access must state the reasons for the refusal and indicate what forms of appeal are open to the applicant.\nPublic authorities must keep the information they hold up to date, and to this end establish publicly accessible lists, registers and files. In this regard, these bodies are encouraged to progressively make use of electronic databases containing reports on the state of the environment, legislation, national plans and policies and international conventions.\nIn 2003, EU countries adopted Directive 2003/4/EC on public access to environmental information. They had to incorporate it into national law by 14 February 2005.\nIn 2006, the EU adopted Regulation (EC) No 1367/2006 which requires the EU’s institutions and bodies to implement the obligations contained in the Aarhus Convention.\nPublic participation in environmental decision-making\nThe second part of the convention concerns public participation in decision-making. This must be ensured through the authorisation procedure for certain specific activities (mainly of an industrial nature) listed in Annex I to the convention. The final decision to authorise the activity must take due account of the outcome of the public participation.\nThe public must be informed, early in the decision-making procedure, of the following:\nthe matter on which the decision is to be taken;\nthe nature of the decision;\nthe authority responsible;\nthe procedure to be used, including the practical details of the consultation procedure;\nthe procedure for an environmental impact assessment (if any).\nThe procedural timeframes must allow for genuine public participation.\nA streamlined procedure has been set up for the formulation of environmental plans and programmes.\nThe convention also invites its signatories to promote public participation in the preparation of environmental policies as well as standards and legislation that may have a significant effect on the environment.\nIn 2003, EU countries adopted Directive 2003/35/EC on public access to environmental information.\nIn 2006, Council Decision 2006/957/EC took account of an amendment of the convention which increases public participation in decisions concerning the deliberate release of GMOs into the environment. At EU level, this requirement is already met by certain articles of Directive 2001/18/EC on the deliberate release into the environment of genetically modified organisms and Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003 on genetically modified food and feed.\nSeveral other of the EU’s environmental directives contain rules on public participation in environmental decision-making. These include Directive 2001/42/EC and the Water Framework Directive (Directive 2000/60/EC).\nAccess to justice in environmental matters\nAll persons who feel their rights to access to information have been impaired (e.g. a request for information ignored, wrongfully refused or inadequately answered) must have access, in the appropriate circumstances, to a review procedure under national legislation.\nAccess to justice is also ensured in the event of the convention’s participation procedure being infringed. Access to justice is also allowed for the settlement of disputes relating to acts or omissions by private persons and public authorities which contravene national rules relating to the environment.\nDirectives 2003/4/EC and 2003/35/EC each contain provisions on access to justice. A 2003 proposal for a directive on access to environmental justice was withdrawn in 2014 as part of a European Commission fitness check of EU law (known as REFIT).\nIn April 2017, the Commission adopted a guidance document on access to justice in environmental matters. This clarifies how individuals and associations can challenge decisions, acts and omissions by public authorities related to EU environmental law before national courts.\nFROM WHEN DO THE CONVENTION AND THE DECISION APPLY?\n              \nThe convention has applied since 30 October 2001. The decision has applied since 17 February 2005.\nBACKGROUND\n              \nFor more information, see:\nThe EU & the Aarhus Convention: in the EU Member States, in the Community Institutions and Bodies (European Commission).\nMAIN DOCUMENT\n            \nCouncil Decision 2005/370/EC of 17 February 2005 on the conclusion, on behalf of the European Community, of the Convention on access to information, public participation in decision-making and access to justice in environmental matters (OJ L 124, 17.5.2005, pp. 1-3)\nConvention on access to information, public participation in decision‐making and access to justice in environmental matters (OJ L 124, 17.5.2005, pp. 4-20)\nRELATED DOCUMENTS\n            \nCommunication from the Commission of 28 April 2017 — Commission Notice on Access to Justice in Environmental Matters (C(2017) 2616 final, 28.4.2017)\nCouncil Decision 2006/957/EC of 18 December 2006 on the conclusion, on behalf of the European Community, of an amendment to the Convention on access to information, public participation in decision making and access to justice in environmental matters (OJ L 386, 29.12.2006, pp. 46-49)\nRegulation (EC) No 1367/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 September 2006 on the application of the provisions of the Aarhus Convention on Access to Information, Public Participation in Decision-making and Access to Justice in Environmental Matters to Community institutions and bodies (OJ L 264, 25.9.2006, pp. 13-19)\nRegulation (EC) No 1829/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 September 2003 on genetically modified food and feed (OJ L 268, 18.10.2003, pp. 1-23)\nSuccessive amendments to Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003 have been incorporated into the original document.
