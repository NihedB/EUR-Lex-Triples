 whereas in view of the central importance of these undertakings in the Community, such coordination is  necessary;(4) OJ No L 222, 14.8.1978, p. 11.(5) OJ No L 314, 4.12.1984, p. 28.Whereas Council Directive  83/349/EEC of 13 June 1983, based on Article 54 (3) (g) of the Treaty, on consolidated accounts (6), provides  for derogations for credit institutions only until expiry of the deadline imposed for the application of this  Directive; whereas this Directive must therefore also include provisions specific to credit institutions in respect  of consolidated accounts;(6) OJ No L 193, 18.7.1983, p. 1.Whereas such coordination has also become  urgent because more and more credit institutions are operating across national borders; whereas for creditors,  debtors and members and for the general public improved comparability of the annual accounts and consolidated  accounts of these institutions is of crucial importance;Whereas in virtually all the Member States of the  Community credit institutions within the meaning of Council Directive 77/780/EEC of the 12 December 1977 on  the coordination of laws, regulations and administrative provisions relating to the taking up and pursuit of the  business of credit institutions (7), having many different legal forms, are in competition with one another in the  banking sector; whereas it therefore seems advisable not to confine coordination in respect of these credit  institutions to the legal forms covered by Directive 78/660/EEC but rather to opt for a scope which includes all  companies and firms as defined in the second paragraph of Article 58 of the Treaty;(7) OJ No L 322,  17.12.1977, p. 30.Whereas as far as financial institutions are concerned the scope of this Directive should  however be confined to those financial institutions taking one of the legal forms referred to in Directive  78/660/EEC; whereas financial institutions which are not subject to that Directive must automatically come  under this Directive;Whereas a link with coordination in respect of credit institutions is necessary because  aspects of the provisions governing annual accounts and consolidated accounts will have an impact on other  areas of that coordination, such as authorization requirements and the indicators used for supervisory  purposes;Whereas although, in view of the specific characteristics of credit institutions, it would appear  appropriate to adopt a separate Directive on the annual accounts and consolidated accounts of such institutions,  this does not imply a new set of rules separate from those under Directives 78/660/EEC and 83/349/EEC;  whereas such separate rules would be neither appropriate nor consistent with the principles underlying the  coordination of company law since, given the important role which they play in the Community economy, credit  institutions cannot be excluded from a framework of rules devised for undertakings generally; whereas, for this  reason, only the particular characteristics of credit institutions have been taken into account and this Directive  deals only with exceptions to the rules contained in Directives 78/660/EEC and 83/349/EEC;Whereas the  structure and content of the balance sheets of credit institutions differ in each Member State; whereas this  Directive must therefore prescribe the same layout, nomenclature and terminology for the balance sheets of all  credit institutions in the Community; whereas derogations should be allowed if necessitated by the legal form of  an institution or by the especial nature of its business;Whereas, if the annual accounts and consolidated  accounts are to be comparable, a number of basic questions regarding the disclosure of various transactions in  the balance sheet and off the balance sheet must be settled;Whereas, in the interests of greater comparability, it  is also necessary that the content of the various balance sheet and off-balance sheet items be determined  precisely;Whereas the same applies to the layout and definition of the items in the profit and loss  account;Whereas the comparability of figures in the balance sheet and profit and loss account also depends  crucially on the values at which assets and liabilities are entered in the balance sheet;Whereas, in view of the  particular risks associated with banking and of the need to maintain confidence, provision should be made for the  possibility of introducing a liabilities item in the balance sheet entitled 'Fund for general banking risks'; whereas it  would appear advisable for the same reasons that the Member States be permitted, pending subsequent  coordination, to allow credit institutions some discretion, especially in the valuation of loans and advances and of  certain securities; whereas, however, in this last case the Member States should allow these same credit  institutions to create the «Fund for general banking risks» mentioned above; whereas it would also appear  appropriate to permit the Member States to allow credit institutions to set of certain charges and income in the  profit and loss account;Whereas, in view of the special nature of credit institutions, certain changes are also  necessary with regard to the notes on the accounts;Whereas, in the desire to place on the same footing as many  credit institutions as possible, as was the case with Directive 77/780/EEC, the relief under Directive 78/660/EEC  is not provided for in the case of small and medium-sized credit institutions; whereas, nevertheless, if in the light  of experience such relief were to prove necessary it would be possible to provide for it in subsequent  coordination; whereas for the same reasons the scope allowed the Member States under Directive 83/349/EEC  to exempt parent undertakings from the consolidation requirement if the undertakings to be consolidated do not  together exceed a certain size has not been extended to credit institutions;Whereas the application of the  provisions on consolidated accounts to credit institutions requires certain adjustments to some of the rules  applicable to all industrial and commercial companies; whereas explicit rules have been provided for in the case  of mixed groups and exemption from subconsolidation may be made subject to additional conditions;Whereas,  given the scale on which banking networks extend beyond national borders and their constant development, the  annual accounts and consolidated accounts of a credit institution having its head office in one Member State  should be published in all the Member States in which it is established;Whereas the examination of problems  which arise in connection with the subject matter of this Directive, notably concerning its application, requires  the cooperation of representatives of the Member States and the Commission in a contact committee; whereas,  in order to avoid the proliferation of such committees, it is desirable that such cooperation take place in the  Committee provided for in Article 52 of Directive 78/660/EEC; whereas, nevertheless, when examining  problems concerning credit institutions the Committee will have to be appropriately constituted;Whereas, in  view of the complexity of the matter, the credit institutions covered by this Directive must be allowed a longer  period than usual to implement its provisions;Whereas provision should be made for the review of certain  provisions of this Directive after five years' experience of its application, in the light of the aims of greater  transparency and harmonization,HAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:SECTION 1PRELIMINARY  PROVISIONS AND SCOPEArticle 11. Articles 2, 3, 4 (1), (3) to (5), 6, 7, 13, 14, 15 (3) and (4), 16 to 21,  29 to 35, 37 to 41, 42 first sentence, 45 (1), 46, 48 to 50, 51 (1), 54, 56 to 59 and 61 of Directive 78/660/EEC  shall apply to the institutions mentioned in Article 2 of this Directive, except where this Directive provides  otherwise.2.

References in Directives 78/660/EEC and 83/349/EEC to Articles 31 to 42 of Directive  78/660/EEC shall be deemed to references to those Articles, taking account of Articles 35 to 39 of this  Directive.4. Where reference is made in the aforementioned provisions of Directive 78/660/EEC to balance  sheet items for which this Directive makes no equivalent provision, such references shall be deemed to be  references to the items in Article 4 of this Directive which include the assets and liabilities in question.Article  21. The coordination measures prescribed by this Directive shall apply to(a) credit institutions within the  meaning of the first indent of Article 1 of Directive 77/780/EEC which are companies or firms as defined in the  second paragraph of Article 58 of the Treaty;(b) financial institutions having one of the legal forms referred to  in Article 1 (1), of Directive 78/660/EEC which, on the basis of paragraph 2 of that Article, are not subject to  that Directive.For the purposes of this Directive 'credit institutions' shall also include financial institutions unless  the context requires otherwise.2.

Without prejudice to Article 2 (3) of Directive 78/660/EEC  and pending subsequent coordination, the Member States may:(a) in the case of the credit institutions referred  to in Article 2 (1) (a) of this Directive which are not companies of any of the types listed in Article 1 (1) of  Directive 78/660/EEC, lay down rules derogating from this Directive where derogating rules are necessary  because of such institutions' legal form;(b) in the case of specialized credit institutions, lay down rules  derogating from this Directive where derogating rules are necessary because of the special nature of such  institutions' business.Such derogating rules may provide only for adaptations to the layout, nomenclature,  terminology and content of items in the balance sheet and the profit and loss account; they may not have the  effect of permitting the institutions to which they apply to provide less information in their annual accounts than  other institutions subject to this Directive.The Member States shall inform the Commission of those credit  institutions, possibly by category, within six months of the end of the period stipulated in Article 47 (2). They  shall inform the Commission of the derogations laid down to that end.These derogations shall be reviewed  within 10 years of the notification of this Directive.

The Member States may, however, require or  permit differences produced by translation in accordance with paragraphs 1 and 2 to be included, in whole or in  part, in reserves not available for distribution, where they arise on assets held as financial fixed assets, on tangible  and intangible assets and on any transactions undertaken to cover those assets.4. The Member States may  provide that positive translation differences arising out of forward transactions, assets or liabilities not covered  or not specifically covered by other forward transactions, or by assets or liabilities shall not be shown in the  profit and loss account.5. If a method specified in Article 59 of Directive 78/660/EEC is used, the Member  States may provide that any translation differences shall be transferred, in whole or in part, directly to reserves.

In that event, where a credit institution has acquired an existing loan not evidenced  by a certificate, the Member States shall require classification of that loan to be based on the remaining maturity  as at the date on which it was acquired. For the purposes of this subparagraph, the originally agreed maturity for  loans shall be the period between the date of first drawing and the date of repayment; the period of notice shall  be deemed to be the period between the date on which notice is given and the date on which repayment is to be  made; if loans and advances or liabilities are redeemable by instalments, the agreed maturity shall be the period  between the date on which such loans and advances or liabilities arose and the date on which the last instalment  falls due.

In place of the information required under Article 43 (1) (8) of  Directive 78/660/EEC, a credit institution shall indicate in the notes on its accounts the proportion of its income  relating to items 1, 3, 4, 6 and 7 of Article 27 or to items B 1, B 2, B 3, B 4 and B 7 of Article 28 by  geographical markets, in so far as, taking account of the manner in which the credit institution is organized,  those markets differ substantially from one another.

 whereas in view of the central importance of these undertakings in the Community, such coordination is  necessary;(4) OJ No L 222, 14.8.1978, p. 11.(5) OJ No L 314, 4.12.1984, p. 28.Whereas Council directive 83/349/eec of 13 June 1983, based on Article 54 (3) (g) of the Treaty, on consolidated accounts (6), provides  for derogations for credit institutions only until expiry of the deadline imposed for the application of this  Directive; whereas this Directive must therefore also include provisions specific to credit institutions in respect  of consolidated accounts;(6) OJ No L 193, 18.7.1983, p. 1.Whereas such coordination has also become  urgent because more and more credit institutions are operating across national borders; whereas for creditors,  debtors and members and for the general public improved comparability of the annual accounts and consolidated  accounts of these institutions is of crucial importance;Whereas in virtually all the Member States of the  Community credit institutions within the meaning of Council directive 77/780/eec of the 12 December 1977 on  the coordination of laws, regulations and administrative provisions relating to the taking up and pursuit of the  business of credit institutions (7), having many different legal forms, are in competition with one another in the  banking sector; whereas it therefore seems advisable not to confine coordination in respect of these credit  institutions to the legal forms covered by directive 78/660/eec but rather to opt for a scope which includes all  companies and firms as defined in the second paragraph of Article 58 of the Treaty;(7) OJ No L 322,  17.12.1977, p. 30.Whereas as far as financial institutions are concerned the scope of this Directive should  however be confined to those financial institutions taking one of the legal forms referred to in directive 78/660/eec; whereas financial institutions which are not subject to that Directive must automatically come  under this Directive;Whereas a link with coordination in respect of credit institutions is necessary because  aspects of the provisions governing annual accounts and consolidated accounts will have an impact on other  areas of that coordination, such as authorization requirements and the indicators used for supervisory  purposes;Whereas although, in view of the specific characteristics of credit institutions, it would appear  appropriate to adopt a separate Directive on the annual accounts and consolidated accounts of such institutions,  this does not imply a new set of rules separate from those under directive 78/660/eec directive 83/349/eec;  whereas such separate rules would be neither appropriate nor consistent with the principles underlying the  coordination of company law since, given the important role which they play in the Community economy, credit  institutions cannot be excluded from a framework of rules devised for undertakings generally; whereas, for this  reason, only the particular characteristics of credit institutions have been taken into account and this Directive  deals only with exceptions to the rules contained in directive 78/660/eec directive 83/349/eec;Whereas the  structure and content of the balance sheets of credit institutions differ in each Member State; whereas this  Directive must therefore prescribe the same layout, nomenclature and terminology for the balance sheets of all  credit institutions in the Community; whereas derogations should be allowed if necessitated by the legal form of  an institution or by the especial nature of its business;Whereas, if the annual accounts and consolidated  accounts are to be comparable, a number of basic questions regarding the disclosure of various transactions in  the balance sheet and off the balance sheet must be settled;Whereas, in the interests of greater comparability, it  is also necessary that the content of the various balance sheet and off-balance sheet items be determined  precisely;Whereas the same applies to the layout and definition of the items in the profit and loss  account;Whereas the comparability of figures in the balance sheet and profit and loss account also depends  crucially on the values at which assets and liabilities are entered in the balance sheet;Whereas, in view of the  particular risks associated with banking and of the need to maintain confidence, provision should be made for the  possibility of introducing a liabilities item in the balance sheet entitled 'Fund for general banking risks'; whereas it  would appear advisable for the same reasons that the Member States be permitted, pending subsequent  coordination, to allow credit institutions some discretion, especially in the valuation of loans and advances and of  certain securities; whereas, however, in this last case the Member States should allow these same credit  institutions to create the «Fund for general banking risks» mentioned above; whereas it would also appear  appropriate to permit the Member States to allow credit institutions to set of certain charges and income in the  profit and loss account;Whereas, in view of the special nature of credit institutions, certain changes are also  necessary with regard to the notes on the accounts;Whereas, in the desire to place on the same footing as many  credit institutions as possible, as was the case with directive 77/780/eec, the relief under directive 78/660/eec  is not provided for in the case of small and medium-sized credit institutions; whereas, nevertheless, if in the light  of experience such relief were to prove necessary it would be possible to provide for it in subsequent  coordination; whereas for the same reasons the scope allowed the Member States under directive 83/349/eec  to exempt parent undertakings from the consolidation requirement if the undertakings to be consolidated do not  together exceed a certain size has not been extended to credit institutions;Whereas the application of the  provisions on consolidated accounts to credit institutions requires certain adjustments to some of the rules  applicable to all industrial and commercial companies; whereas explicit rules have been provided for in the case  of mixed groups and exemption from subconsolidation may be made subject to additional conditions;Whereas,  given the scale on which banking networks extend beyond national borders and their constant development, the  annual accounts and consolidated accounts of a credit institution having its head office in one Member State  should be published in all the Member States in which it is established;Whereas the examination of problems  which arise in connection with the subject matter of this Directive, notably concerning its application, requires  the cooperation of representatives of the Member States and the Commission in a contact committee; whereas,  in order to avoid the proliferation of such committees, it is desirable that such cooperation take place in the  Committee provided for in Article 52 of directive 78/660/eec; whereas, nevertheless, when examining  problems concerning credit institutions the Committee will have to be appropriately constituted;Whereas, in  view of the complexity of the matter, the credit institutions covered by this Directive must be allowed a longer  period than usual to implement its provisions;Whereas provision should be made for the review of certain  provisions of this Directive after five years' experience of its application, in the light of the aims of greater  transparency and harmonization,HAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:SECTION 1PRELIMINARY  PROVISIONS AND SCOPEArticle 11. Articles 2, 3, 4 (1), (3) to (5), 6, 7, 13, 14, 15 (3) and (4), 16 to 21,  29 to 35, 37 to 41, 42 first sentence, 45 (1), 46, 48 to 50, 51 (1), 54, 56 to 59 and 61 of directive 78/660/eec  shall apply to the institutions mentioned in Article 2 of this Directive, except where this Directive provides  otherwise.2.

References in directive 78/660/eec directive 83/349/eec to Articles 31 to 42 of directive 78/660/eec shall be deemed to references to those Articles, taking account of Articles 35 to 39 of this  Directive.4. Where reference is made in the aforementioned provisions of directive 78/660/eec to balance  sheet items for which this Directive makes no equivalent provision, such references shall be deemed to be  references to the items in Article 4 of this Directive which include the assets and liabilities in question.Article  21. The coordination measures prescribed by this Directive shall apply to(a) credit institutions within the  meaning of the first indent of Article 1 of directive 77/780/eec which are companies or firms as defined in the  second paragraph of Article 58 of the Treaty;(b) financial institutions having one of the legal forms referred to  in Article 1 (1), of directive 78/660/eec which, on the basis of paragraph 2 of that Article, are not subject to  that Directive.For the purposes of this Directive 'credit institutions' shall also include financial institutions unless  the context requires otherwise.2. The Member States need not apply this Directive to:(a) the credit institutions  listed in Article 2 (2) of directive 77/780/eec;(b) institutions of the same Member State which, as defined in  Article 2 (4) (a) of directive 77/780/eec, are affiliated to a central body in that Member State.

Without prejudice to Article 2 (3) of directive 78/660/eec  and pending subsequent coordination, the Member States may:(a) in the case of the credit institutions referred  to in Article 2 (1) (a) of this Directive which are not companies of any of the types listed in Article 1 (1) of  directive 78/660/eec, lay down rules derogating from this Directive where derogating rules are necessary  because of such institutions' legal form;(b) in the case of specialized credit institutions, lay down rules  derogating from this Directive where derogating rules are necessary because of the special nature of such  institutions' business.Such derogating rules may provide only for adaptations to the layout, nomenclature,  terminology and content of items in the balance sheet and the profit and loss account; they may not have the  effect of permitting the institutions to which they apply to provide less information in their annual accounts than  other institutions subject to this Directive.The Member States shall inform the Commission of those credit  institutions, possibly by category, within six months of the end of the period stipulated in Article 47 (2). They  shall inform the Commission of the derogations laid down to that end.These derogations shall be reviewed  within 10 years of the notification of this Directive. The Commission shall, if appropriate, submit suitable  proposals. It shall also submit an interim report within five years of the notification of this Directive.SECTION  2GENERAL PROVISIONS CONCERNING THE BALANCE SHEET AND THE PROFIT AND LOSS  ACCOUNTArticle 3In the case of credit institutions the possibility of combining items pursuant to Article 4  (3) (a) or (b) of directive 78/660/eec shall be restricted to balance sheet and profit and loss account sub-items  preceded by lower-case letters and shall be authorized only under the rules laid down by the Member States to  that end.SECTION 3LAYOUT OF THE BALANCE SHEETThe Member States shall prescribe the  following layout for the balance sheet.Assets1.

In that event, where a credit institution has acquired an existing loan not evidenced  by a certificate, the Member States shall require classification of that loan to be based on the remaining maturity  as at the date on which it was acquired. For the purposes of this subparagraph, the originally agreed maturity for  loans shall be the period between the date of first drawing and the date of repayment; the period of notice shall  be deemed to be the period between the date on which notice is given and the date on which repayment is to be  made; if loans and advances or liabilities are redeemable by instalments, the agreed maturity shall be the period  between the date on which such loans and advances or liabilities arose and the date on which the last instalment  falls due.
