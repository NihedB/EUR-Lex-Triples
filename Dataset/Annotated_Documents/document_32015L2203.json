{"celex_id": "32015L2203", "reference": "1.12.2015\nEN\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\nL 314/1\nDIRECTIVE (EU) 2015/2203 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL\nof 25 November 2015\non the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to caseins and caseinates intended for human consumption and repealing Council Directive 83/417/EEC\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 114 thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee (1),\nActing in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure (2),\nWhereas:\n(1)\nCouncil Directive 83/417/EEC (3) provides for the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to certain lactoproteins (caseins and caseinates) intended for human consumption. Since the entry into force of that Directive, several changes have taken place, in particular the development of a comprehensive legal framework in the area of food law and the adoption of an international standard for edible casein products by the Codex Alimentarius Commission (‘Codex standard for edible casein products’), which need to be taken into account.\n(2)\nDirective 83/417/EEC confers powers on the Commission in order to implement some of its provisions. As a consequence of the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty, those powers need to be aligned to Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (‘TFEU’).\n(3)\nFor the sake of clarity, Directive 83/417/EEC should therefore be repealed and replaced with a new Directive.\n(4)\nRegulation (EC) No 178/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council (4) contains general, horizontal and uniform Union rules concerning the adoption of emergency measures for food and feed. The related provisions of Directive 83/417/EEC are therefore no longer necessary.\n(5)\nRegulation (EC) No 882/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council (5) contains general, horizontal and uniform Union rules concerning the methods of sampling and analysis of foodstuffs. The related provisions of Directive 83/417/EEC are therefore no longer necessary.\n(6)\nUnder Regulation (EU) No 1169/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council (6), sufficient information is to be provided in business to business relations in order to ensure the presence and accuracy of food information for the final consumer. Since the products covered by this Directive are meant to be sold from business to business, for the preparation of food products, it is appropriate to maintain and adapt the specific rules already included in Directive 83/417/EEC to the current legal framework and simplify them. Such specific rules should provide for the information to be provided for the products covered by this Directive, in business to business relations, in order, on the one hand, to make available to food business operators the information they need for the labelling of the final products, for example when it comes to allergens, and, on the other hand, to avoid those products being confused with similar products not meant or not suitable for human consumption.\n(7)\nRegulation (EC) No 1333/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council (7) lays down a definition of food additives and processing aids referred to as technological adjuvants in Directive 83/417/EEC. Consequently, this Directive should use the terms ‘food additives’ and ‘processing aids’ instead of ‘technological adjuvants’. Such use of terminology would also be in line with the Codex standard for edible casein products.\n(8)\nOther terms and references used in the Annexes to Directive 83/417/EEC should be adapted to take into account those used in Regulation (EC) No 1332/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council (8) and Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008.\n(9)\nAnnex I to Directive 83/417/EEC fixes the maximum moisture content for edible caseins at 10 % and the maximum milk fat content for edible acid casein at 2,25 %. Taking into consideration that the Codex standard for edible casein products fixes those parameters at 12 % and 2 % respectively, the corresponding parameters should be set in line with that standard so as to avoid trade distortions.\n(10)\nIn order to promptly adapt or update the technical elements contained in the Annexes to this Directive so as to take account of developments in relevant international standards or technical progress, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 TFEU should be delegated to the Commission in respect of the standards applicable to edible caseins and edible caseinates laid down in Annexes I and II. It is of particular importance that the Commission carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level. The Commission, when preparing and drawing up delegated acts, should ensure a simultaneous, timely and appropriate transmission of relevant documents to the European Parliament and to the Council.\n(11)\nSince the objectives of this Directive, namely to facilitate, through approximation of the laws of the Member States, the free movement of caseins and caseinates intended for human consumption while providing a high level of protection of health, and to bring existing provisions into line with general Union legislation on food and with international standards, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States but can rather, by reason of their scale and effects, be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Directive does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives,\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:\nArticle 1\nScope\nThis Directive applies to caseins and caseinates which are intended for human consumption and mixtures thereof.\nArticle 2\nDefinitions\nFor the purposes of this Directive, the following definitions apply:\n(a)\n‘edible acid casein’ means a milk product obtained by separating, washing and drying the acid-precipitated coagulum of skimmed milk and/or of other products obtained from milk;\n(b)\n‘edible rennet casein’ means a milk product obtained by separating, washing and drying the coagulum of skimmed milk and/or of other products obtained from milk; the coagulum is obtained through the reaction of rennet or other coagulating enzymes;\n(c)\n‘edible caseinate’ means a milk product obtained by action of edible casein or edible casein curd coagulum with neutralizing agents, followed by drying.\nArticle 3\nObligations of Member States\nMember States shall take all the necessary steps to ensure that:\n(a)\nthe milk products defined in Article 2 are marketed, under the names specified therein, only if they comply with the rules laid down in this Directive and the standards set out in Annexes I and II; and\n(b)\ncaseins and caseinates which do not comply with the standards set out in points (b) and (c) of Section I of Annex I, points (b) and (c) of Section II of Annex I or points (b) and (c) of Annex II, are not used for the preparation of food, and, where lawfully marketed for other purposes, are named and labelled in such a way that the purchaser is not misled as to their nature, quality or intended use.\nArticle 4\nLabelling\n1.   The following particulars shall be marked on the packages, containers or labels of the milk products defined in Article 2 in easily visible, clearly legible and indelible characters:\n(a)\nthe name of the milk product as laid down in points (a), (b) and (c) of Article 2 with, in the case of edible caseinates, an indication of the cation or cations as listed in point (d) of Annex II;\n(b)\nin the case of products marketed as mixtures:\n(i)\nthe words ‘mixture of …’ followed by the names of the different products of which the mixture is composed, in decreasing order of weight,\n(ii)\nan indication of the cation or cations, as listed in point (d) of Annex II, in the case of edible caseinates,\n(iii)\nthe protein content in the case of mixtures containing edible caseinates;\n(c)\nthe net quantity of the products, expressed in kilograms or grams;\n(d)\nthe name or business name and the address of the food business operator under whose name or business name the product is marketed or, if that food business operator is not established in the Union, the importer into the Union market;\n(e)\nin the case of products imported from third countries, the name of the country of origin;\n(f)\nthe lot identification of the products or the date of production.\nBy way of derogation from the first subparagraph, the particulars referred to in point (iii) of point (b) and in points (c), (d) and (e) of the first subparagraph may be marked only in an accompanying document.\n2.   A Member State shall prohibit the marketing of milk products defined in points (a), (b) and (c) of Article 2 in its territory if the particulars referred to in the first subparagraph of paragraph 1 of this Article are not marked in a language easily understood by the purchasers of that Member State where those products are marketed, unless such information is provided by the food business operator by other means. Those particulars may be marked in several languages.\n3.   Where the minimum milk protein content set out in point (a)2 of Section I of Annex I, point (a)2 of Section II of Annex I, and point (a)2 of Annex II is exceeded in the milk products defined in Article 2, this fact may, without prejudice to other provisions of Union law, be adequately marked on the packages, containers or labels of the products.\nArticle 5\nDelegation of power\nThe Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 6 to amend the standards set out in Annexes I and II in order to take account of developments in relevant international standards and of technical progress.\nArticle 6\nExercise of the delegation\n1.   The power to adopt delegated acts is conferred on the Commission subject to the conditions laid down in this Article.

The delegation of power referred to in Article 5 may be revoked at any time by the European Parliament or by the Council. A decision to revoke shall put an end to the delegation of the power specified in that decision. It shall take effect the day following the publication of the decision in the Official Journal of the European Union or at a later date specified therein. It shall not affect the validity of the delegated acts already in force.\n4.   As soon as it adopts a delegated act, the Commission shall notify it simultaneously to the European Parliament and to the Council.\n5.   A delegated act adopted pursuant to Article 5 shall enter into force only if no objection has been expressed either by the European Parliament or the Council within a period of two months of notification of that act to the European Parliament and to the Council or if, before the expiry of that period, the European Parliament and the Council have both informed the Commission that they will not object. That period shall be extended by two months at the initiative of the European Parliament or of the Council.\nArticle 7\nTransposition\n1.   Member States shall bring into force the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive by 22 December 2016.

The directive gives food businesses the information they need to label consumer products correctly. This is particularly important in helping consumers to identify allergens in their food.\nKEY POINTS\n              \nCasein, along with whey, is one of the major proteins in milk. It is used in cheese-making, as a fining agent to clarify wine and as a dietary supplement. The caseins covered in the directive are:\nedible acid casein: obtained by washing and drying skimmed milk solids following an acid separation process;\nedible rennet casein: obtained by washing and drying skimmed milk solids following a separation process which uses rennet, a natural substance produced in the stomachs of cattle;\nedible caseinate: obtained after adding a neutralising agent to casein (changing the level of acidity), followed by drying. Potassium hydroxide is one such agent and is used to make the protein more soluble for use in clarifying wine.\nLabelling\nThe name of the milk product (casein or caseinate) should be marked on all packaging. In the case of mixtures, the following wording must be used: ‘mixture of …’, followed by a list of products in decreasing order of weight.\n For edible caseinates, the name of the neutralising or other agent used should also be given.\nThe label must also state:\nthe protein content of mixtures containing edible caseinates;\nthe net weight;\nthe name and address of the food business, or importer if the product is from outside the EU;\nthe country of origin if outside the EU;\nthe lot identification of the products or the date of production.\nThis information could alternatively be listed in an accompanying document.\nAn EU country must prohibit the sale of these milk products if they are not marked on labels in a language easily understood by purchasers in that country.\nStandards\nAnnexes to the directive set out standards for caseins and caseinates, such as the minimum protein percentage. If the minimum milk protein content is exceeded, this may be marked on packaging. The annexes also list permitted casein-processing substances and additives, including agents used to produce caseinates.\nRepeal\nThe directive repeals Directive 83/417/EEC with effect from 22 December 2016.\nFROM WHEN DOES THE DIRECTIVE APPLY?\n              \nIt applies from 21 December 2015. EU countries have to incorporate it into national law by 22 December 2016.\nACT\n            \nDirective (EU) 2015/2203 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 November 2015 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to caseins and caseinates intended for human consumption and repealing Council Directive 83/417/EEC (OJ L 314, 1.12.2015, pp. 1-9)\nlast update 18.04.2016", "tags": ["human nutrition", "milk protein", "approximation of laws", "milk by-product", "food chemistry", "food additive", "labelling"], "subjects": ["Milk products", "Foodstuffs", "Approximation of laws", "Protocol on Ireland/Northern Ireland"], "split": "train", "reference_annotations": {"32015L2203_p2": {"text": "(6)  regulation 1169/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 October 2011 on the provision of food information to consumers, amending regulation 1924/2006 regulation 1925/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council, and repealing Commission directive 87/250/eec, Council directive 90/496/eec, Commission directive 1999/10/ec, directive 2000/13/ec of the European Parliament and of the Council, Commission directive 2002/67/ec directive 2008/5/ec and Commission regulation 608/2004 (OJ L 304, 22.11.2011, p. 18).", "triples": [" regulation 1169/2011,  amending,  regulation 1924/2006", " regulation 1169/2011,  amending,  regulation 1925/2006", " regulation 1169/2011,  repealing,  directive 87/250/eec", " regulation 1169/2011,  repealing,  directive 90/496/eec", " regulation 1169/2011,  repealing,  directive 1999/10/ec", " regulation 1169/2011,  repealing,  directive 2000/13/ec", " regulation 1169/2011,  repealing,  directive 2002/67/ec", " regulation 1169/2011,  repealing,  directive 2008/5/ec", " regulation 1169/2011,  repealing,  regulation 608/2004"]}, "32015L2203_p1": {"text": "directive 2015/2203 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL---of 25 November 2015---on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to caseins and caseinates intended for human consumption and repealing Council directive 83/417/eec", "triples": [" directive 2015/2203,  repealing,  directive 83/417/eec"]}, "32015L2203_p3": {"text": "(8)  regulation 1332/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 December 2008 on food enzymes and amending Council directive 83/417/eec, Council regulation 1493/1999, directive 2000/13/ec, Council directive 2001/112/ec and regulation 258/97 (OJ L 354, 31.12.2008, p. 7).", "triples": [" regulation 1332/2008,  amending,  directive 83/417/eec", " regulation 1332/2008,  amending,  regulation 1493/1999", " regulation 1332/2008,  amending,  directive 2000/13/ec", " regulation 1332/2008,  amending,  directive 2001/112/ec", " regulation 1332/2008,  amending,  regulation 258/97"]}}, "summary_annotations": {"32015L2203_p1": {"text": "directive 2015/2203 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 November 2015 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to caseins and caseinates intended for human consumption and repealing Council directive 83/417/eec (OJ L 314, 1.12.2015, pp. 1-9)---last update 18.04.2016", "triples": [" directive 2015/2203,  repealing,  directive 83/417/eec"]}}}
