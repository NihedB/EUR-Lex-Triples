GENERAL REQUIREMENTS\n1.1.\nSubject to the provisions of paragraph 5.4, every tyre fitted to a vehicle, including where applicable any spare tyre, shall meet the requirements of Regulation (EC) No 661/2009 and its implementing measures.\n2.   TYRE FITMENT\n2.1.\nAll tyres normally fitted to the vehicle, thus excluding any temporary-use spare unit, shall have the same structure.\n2.2.\nAll of the tyres normally fitted to one axle shall be of the same type.\n2.3.\nThe space in which the wheel revolves shall be such as to allow unrestricted movement when using the maximum permissible size of tyres and rim widths, taking into account the minimum and maximum wheel off-sets, within the minimum and maximum suspension and steering constraints as declared by the vehicle manufacturer. This shall be verified by performing the checks with the largest and the widest tyres, taking into account the applicable dimensional tolerances (i.e. maximum envelope) related to the tyre size designation as specified in the relevant UNECE Regulation.\n2.4.\nThe technical service may agree to an alternative test procedure (e.g. virtual testing) to verify that the requirements of paragraph 2.3 of this Annex are met.\n3.   LOAD CAPACITY\n3.1.\nSubject to the provisions of paragraph 5 of this Annex, the maximum load rating of every tyre as determined in paragraph 3.2 of this Annex, including a spare tyre (if provided), with which the vehicle is fitted shall be:\n3.1.1.\nIn the case of a vehicle fitted with tyres of the same type in single formation: at least equal to half of the technically permissible maximum axle mass for the most heavily loaded axle, as declared by the manufacturer of the vehicle.\n3.1.2.\nIn the case of a vehicle fitted with tyres of more than one type, in single formation: at least equal to half of the technically permissible maximum axle mass as declared by the manufacturer of the vehicle, in respect of the relevant axle.\n3.1.3.\nIn the case of a vehicle fitted with tyres of class C1 in dual (twin) formation: at least equal to 0,27 times the technically permissible maximum axle mass, as declared by the manufacturer of the vehicle, in respect of the relevant axle.\n3.1.4.\nIn the case of axles fitted with tyres of class C2 or C3 in dual (twin) formation: at least equal to 0,25 times, with reference to the load capacity index for dual application, the technically permissible maximum axle mass as declared by the manufacturer of the vehicle, in respect of the relevant axle.\n3.2.\nThe maximum load rating of a tyre is determined as follows:\n3.2.1.\nIn the case of tyres of class C1, the ‘maximum load rating’ as referred to in paragraph 2.31 of UNECE Regulation No 30 is taken into account.\n3.2.2.\nIn the case of tyres of class C2 or C3, the ‘table load-capacity variation with speed’ as referred to in paragraph 2.29 of UNECE Regulation No 54 is taken into account, which shows, as a function of the load-capacity indices and nominal-speed-category symbols, the load variations which a pneumatic tyre can withstand taking into account the maximum design speed of the vehicle.\n3.3.\nThe relevant information shall be stated clearly in the vehicle owner’s handbook in order to ensure that suitable replacement tyres with an appropriate load capacity shall be fitted when necessary, once the vehicle has been put into service.\n4.   SPEED CAPACITY\n4.1.\nEvery tyre with which the vehicle is normally fitted shall bear a speed category symbol.\n4.1.1.\nIn the case of a tyre of class C1, the speed category symbol shall be compatible with the maximum vehicle design speed and shall take into account, in the case of tyres of speed categories V, W and Y, the maximum load rating as described in UNECE Regulation No 30.\n4.1.2.\nIn the case of a tyre of class C2 or C3, the speed category symbol shall be compatible with the maximum vehicle design speed and the applicable load/speed combination derived from the ‘table load-capacity variation with speed’ as described in paragraph 3.2.2 of this Annex.\n4.2.\nThe requirements of paragraphs 4.1.1 and 4.1.2 shall not apply in the following situations:\n4.2.1.\nIn the case of temporary-use spare units for which paragraph 6 of this Annex applies.\n4.2.2.\nIn the case of vehicles normally equipped with ordinary tyres and occasionally fitted with snow tyres (i.e. with the alpine or three-peaked mountain snowflake symbol marking) where in such a case the speed category symbol of the snow tyre shall correspond to a speed either greater than the maximum vehicle design speed or not less than 160 km/h (or both). However, if the maximum vehicle design speed is greater than the speed corresponding to the lowest speed category symbol of the fitted snow tyres, a maximum speed warning label, specifying the lowest value of the maximum speed capability of the fitted snow tyres, shall be displayed inside the vehicle in a prominent position readily and permanently visible to the driver. Other tyres with improved snow traction (i.e. with the M+S marking, but without the alpine or three-peaked mountain snowflake symbol marking) shall comply with the requirements of paragraphs 4.1.1 and 4.1.2 of this Annex.\n4.2.3.\nIn the case of vehicles equipped with professional off-road tyres with the POR marking. However, if the maximum vehicle design speed is greater than the speed corresponding to the lowest speed category symbol of the fitted special use tyres, a maximum speed warning label, specifying the lowest value of the maximum speed capability of the fitted special use tyres, shall be displayed inside the vehicle in a prominent position readily and permanently visible to the driver.\n4.2.4.\nIn the case of vehicles of categories M2, M3, N2 or N3 equipped with a speed limitation device (SLD) approved according to UNECE Regulation No 89 (1) where in such a case the speed symbol of the tyres shall be compatible with the speed at which the limitation is set. However, if the vehicle manufacturer has foreseen that the maximum vehicle design speed is greater than the speed corresponding to the lowest speed category symbol of the fitted tyres, a maximum speed warning label, specifying the maximum speed capability of the tyres, shall be displayed inside the vehicle in a prominent position readily and permanently visible to the driver.\n4.2.5.\nIn the case of vehicles of categories M1 or N1 equipped with an on-board system fulfilling a speed limitation function where in such a case the speed symbol of the tyres shall be compatible with the speed at which the limitation is set. However, if the vehicle manufacturer has foreseen that the maximum vehicle design speed is greater than the speed corresponding to the lowest speed category symbol of the fitted tyres, a maximum speed warning label, specifying the maximum speed capability of the tyres, shall be displayed inside the vehicle in a prominent position readily and permanently visible to the driver.\n4.3.\nThe relevant information shall be stated clearly in the vehicle owner’s handbook in order to ensure that suitable replacement tyres with an appropriate speed capacity shall be fitted when necessary, once the vehicle has been put into service.\n5.   SPECIAL CASES\n5.1.\nIn the case of trailers of categories O1 and O2, with a maximum vehicle design speed of 100 km/h or less and fitted with tyres of class C1 in single formation, the maximum load rating of every tyre shall be at least equal to 0,45 times the technically permissible maximum axle mass for the most heavily loaded axle, as declared by the manufacturer of the trailer. For tyres in dual (twin) formation this factor shall be at least equal to 0,24. In such cases a maximum operating speed warning label, specifying the maximum vehicle design speed, shall be permanently and durably affixed near the front coupling device of the trailer.\n5.2.\nIn the case of vehicles of categories M1 and N1, which are designed to be capable of towing a trailer, the additional load imposed at the trailer coupling device may cause the rear tyre maximum load ratings to be exceeded in case of class C1 tyres, but not by more than 15 %. In such a case, the vehicle owner’s handbook shall contain clear information and advice on the maximum permissible vehicle speed when towing a trailer, in any case not exceeding 100 km/h, and on the rear tyre pressure, at least 20 kPa (0,2 bar) above the tyre pressure(s) as recommended for normal use (i.e. without a trailer attached).\n5.3.\nIn the case of some special vehicles, as listed below, fitted with tyres of class C2 or C3, the ‘table load-capacity variation with speed’ as described in paragraph 3.2.2 of this Annex shall not be applied. In such a case, the tyre maximum load rating to check against the technically permissible maximum axle mass (see paragraphs 3.1.2 to 3.1.4) shall be determined by multiplying the load corresponding to the load capacity index by an appropriate coefficient which is related to the type of vehicle and its use, rather than to the maximum vehicle design speed, and the requirements of paragraphs 4.1.1 and 4.1.2 of this Annex shall not apply.\nThe appropriate coefficients shall be the following:\n5.3.1.\n1,15 in the case of a Class I or Class A vehicle (M2 or M3), as referred to in paragraphs 2.1.1.1 (Class I) and 2.1.2.1 (Class A) of UNECE Regulation No 107 (2).\n5.3.2.\n1,10 in the case of vehicles of category N which are specifically designed for use over short distances in urban and suburban applications, such as street and road sweepers or refuse collection vehicles, provided that the maximum vehicle design speed does not exceed 60 km/h.\n5.4.\nIn exceptional cases, where vehicles are designed for conditions of use which are incompatible with the characteristics of tyres of class C1, C2 or C3 and it is therefore necessary to fit tyres with different characteristics, the requirements of paragraph 1.1 of this Annex shall not apply, provided that all of the following conditions are met:\n5.4.1.\nthe tyres shall be approved according to either UNECE Regulation No 75 (3) or UNECE Regulation No 106 (4); and\n5.4.2.\nthe type-approval authority and technical service are satisfied that the tyres fitted are suitable for the operating conditions of the vehicle. The nature of the exemption and motivation of acceptance shall be stated in the test report as well as under the remarks on the type-approval certificate.\n6.   SPARE WHEELS AND TYRES\n6.1.\nIn cases where a vehicle is provided with a spare unit, it shall be one of the following:\n6.1.1.\nA standard spare unit in the same size as the tyres actually fitted to the vehicle.\n6.1.2.\nA temporary-use spare unit of a type suitable for use on the vehicle, however, vehicles of categories other than M1 or N1 shall not be equipped or fitted with a temporary-use spare unit.\n6.1.2.1.\nIf specific precautions have to be taken in order to fit a temporary-use spare unit to the vehicle (e.g. temporary-use spare unit is only to be fitted on the front axle and therefore a front standard unit must first be fitted on the rear axle in order to address a malfunction of a rear standard unit) this shall be stated clearly in the vehicle owner’s handbook and compliance with the appropriate aspects of paragraph 2.3 of this Annex shall be verified.\n6.2.\nEvery vehicle provided with a temporary-use spare unit or run flat tyres shall hold a valid type-approval under UNECE Regulation No 64 with respect to the requirements concerning the equipment of vehicles with temporary-use spare units and run flat tyres.\n(1)  OJ L 158, 19.5.2007, p. 1.\n(2)  OJ L 255, 29.9.2010, p. 1.\n(3)  Has not been published yet.
