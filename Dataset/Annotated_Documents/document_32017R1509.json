Subsequent UNSC Resolutions (UNSCRs) 1874 (2009), 2087 (2013), 2094 (2013), 2270 (2016), 2321 (2016) and 2371 (2017) further extended these restrictive measures.\n(2)\nIn accordance with these UNSCRs, Decision (CFSP) 2016/849 provides in particular for restrictions on the import and export of certain goods, services and technology which could contribute to the DPRK's nuclear-related, ballistic missile-related or other weapons of mass destruction-related programmes (Weapons of mass destruction (WMD) programmes), a luxury goods embargo as well as an asset freeze on persons, entities and bodies that have been linked to the WMD programmes. Further measures target the transport sector, including inspections of cargo and prohibitions pertaining to DPRK vessels and aircraft, the financial sector, such as a provision of certain financial services, and the diplomatic sphere, to prevent abuse of privileges and immunities.\n(3)\nFurthermore, the Council has adopted several additional EU restrictive measures that complement and reinforce the UN-based restrictive measures. To that end, the Council extended the arms embargo, import and export restrictions, extended the list of persons and entities subject to an asset freeze and introduced prohibitions on transfers of funds and investment.\n(4)\nAdoption of a regulation within the meaning of Article 215 of the Treaty at the level of the Union is necessary in order to give effect to the above-mentioned restrictive measures, in particular with a view to ensuring their uniform application by economic operators in all Member States.\n(5)\nCouncil Regulation (EC) No 329/2007 (2) has been amended several times. In view of the extent of the amendments introduced, it is appropriate to consolidate all measures into a new regulation which repeals and replaces Regulation (EC) No 329/2007.\n(6)\nThe Commission should be empowered to publish the list of goods and technology that will be adopted by the Committee of the UNSC which was established pursuant to paragraph 12 of UNSCR 1718 (2006) (‘Sanctions Committee’) or the UNSC and, if appropriate, to add the nomenclature codes from the Combined Nomenclature as set out in Annex I to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2658/87 (3).\n(7)\nThe Commission should also be empowered to amend the list of luxury goods if necessary in view of any definition or guidelines that the Sanctions Committee may promulgate to facilitate the implementation of the restrictions concerning luxury goods, taking the lists of luxury goods produced in other jurisdictions into account.\n(8)\nThe power to amend the lists in Annexes XIII, XIV, XV, XVI and XVII to this Regulation should be exercised by the Council, in view of the specific threat to international peace and security posed by DPRK, and in order to ensure consistency with the process for amending and reviewing Annexes I, II, III, IV and V to Decision (CFSP) 2016/849.\n(9)\nThe Commission should be empowered to amend the list of services, taking into account information provided by Member States as well as any definition or guidelines that may be issued by the United Nations Statistical Commission, or in order to add reference numbers taken from the Central Product Classification system for goods and services promulgated by the United Nations Statistical Commission.\n(10)\nUNSCR 2270 (2016) recalls that the Financial Action Task Force (‘FATF’) has called upon countries to apply enhanced due diligence and effective countermeasures to protect their jurisdictions from the DPRK's illicit financial activity, and calls upon UN Member States to apply FATF Recommendation 7, its Interpretive Note and related guidance to effectively implement targeted financial sanctions related to proliferation.\n(11)\nThis Regulation respects the fundamental rights and observes the principles recognised in particular by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union and in particular the right to an effective remedy and to a fair trial and the right to the protection of personal data. This Regulation should be applied in accordance with those rights.\n(12)\nFor the implementation of this Regulation, and to create the highest level of legal certainty within the Union, the names and other relevant data concerning natural and legal persons, entities and bodies whose funds and economic resources are to be frozen in accordance with this Regulation, should be made public. Any processing of personal data of natural persons under this Regulation should be in conformity with Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council (4) and Directive

element of the goods being procured.\nGoods specified in this Annex include both new and used goods.\nGENERAL TECHNOLOGY NOTE (GTN)\n(To be read in conjunction with Part C.)\nThe sale, supply, transfer or export of ‘technology’ which is ‘required’ for the ‘development’, ‘production’ or ‘use’ of goods the sale, supply, transfer or export of which is prohibited in Part A (Goods) below, is prohibited in accordance with the provisions of Part B.\nThe ‘technology’‘required’ for the ‘development’, ‘production’ or ‘use’ of prohibited goods remains under prohibition even when applicable to
