{"celex_id": "32007R0834", "reference": "20.7.2007\nEN\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\nL 189/1\nCouncil Regulation (EC) No 834/2007\nof 28 June 2007\non organic production and labelling of organic products and repealing Regulation (EEC) No 2092/91\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 37 thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the Commission,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European Parliament (1),\nWhereas:\n(1)\nOrganic production is an overall system of farm management and food production that combines best environmental practices, a high level of biodiversity, the preservation of natural resources, the application of high animal welfare standards and a production method in line with the preference of certain consumers for products produced using natural substances and processes. The organic production method thus plays a dual societal role, where it on the one hand provides for a specific market responding to a consumer demand for organic products, and on the other hand delivers public goods contributing to the protection of the environment and animal welfare, as well as to rural development.\n(2)\nThe share of the organic agricultural sector is on the increase in most Member States. Growth in consumer demand in recent years is particularly remarkable. Recent reforms of the common agricultural policy, with its emphasis on market-orientation and the supply of quality products to meet consumer demands, are likely to further stimulate the market in organic produce. Against this background the legislation on organic production plays an increasingly important role in the agricultural policy framework and is closely related to developments in the agricultural markets.\n(3)\nThe Community legal framework governing the sector of organic production should pursue the objective of ensuring fair competition and a proper functioning of the internal market in organic products, and of maintaining and justifying consumer confidence in products labelled as organic. It should further aim at providing conditions under which this sector can progress in line with production and market developments.\n(4)\nThe Communication from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament on a European Action Plan for Organic Food and Farming proposes to improve and reinforce the Community's organic farming standards and import and inspection requirements. In its conclusions of 18 October 2004, the Council called on the Commission to review the Community legal framework in this field with a view to ensure simplification and overall coherence and in particular to establish principles encouraging harmonisation of standards and, where possible, to reduce the level of detail.\n(5)\nIt is therefore appropriate to define more explicitly the objectives, principles and rules applicable to organic production, in order to contribute to transparency and consumer confidence as well as to a harmonised perception of the concept of organic production.\n(6)\nTo that end, Council Regulation (EEC) No 2092/91 of 24 June 1991 on organic production of agricultural products and indications referring thereto on agricultural products and foodstuffs (2) should be repealed and replaced by a new regulation.\n(7)\nA general Community framework of organic production rules should be established with regard to plant, livestock, and aquaculture production, including rules for the collection of wild plants and seaweeds, rules on conversion, as well as rules on the production of processed food, including wine, and feed and organic yeast. The Commission should authorise the use of products and substances and decide on methods to be used in organic farming and in the processing of organic food.\n(8)\nThe development of organic production should be facilitated further, in particular by fostering the use of new techniques and substances better suited to organic production.\n(9)\nGenetically modified organisms (GMOs) and products produced from or by GMOs are incompatible with the concept of organic production and consumers' perception of organic products. They should therefore not be used in organic farming or in the processing of organic products.\n(10)\nThe aim is to have the lowest possible presence of GMOs in organic products. The existing labelling thresholds represent ceilings which are exclusively linked to the adventitious and technically unavoidable presence of GMOs.\n(11)\nOrganic farming should primarily rely on renewable resources within locally organised agricultural systems. In order to minimise the use of non-renewable resources, wastes and by-products of plant and animal origin should be recycled to return nutrients to the land.\n(12)\nOrganic plant production should contribute to maintaining and enhancing soil fertility as well as to preventing soil erosion. Plants should preferably be fed through the soil eco-system and not through soluble fertilisers added to the soil.\n(13)\nThe essential elements of the organic plant production management system are soil fertility management, choice of species and varieties, multiannual crop rotation, recycling organic materials and cultivation techniques. Additional fertilisers, soil conditioners and plant protection products should only be used if they are compatible with the objectives and principles of organic production.\n(14)\nLivestock production is fundamental to the organisation of agricultural production on organic holdings in so far as it provides the necessary organic matter and nutrients for cultivated land and accordingly contributes towards soil improvement and the development of sustainable agriculture.\n(15)\nIn order to avoid environmental pollution, in particular of natural resources such as the soil and water, organic production of livestock should in principle provide for a close relationship between such production and the land, suitable multiannual rotation systems and the feeding of livestock with organic-farming crop products produced on the holding itself or on neighbouring organic holdings.\n(16)\nAs organic stock farming is a land-related activity animals should have, whenever possible, access to open air or grazing areas.\n(17)\nOrganic stock farming should respect high animal welfare standards and meet animals' species-specific behavioural needs while animal-health management should be based on disease prevention. In this respect, particular attention should be paid to housing conditions, husbandry practices and stocking densities. Moreover, the choice of breeds should take account of their capacity to adapt to local conditions. The implementing rules for livestock production and aquaculture production should at least ensure compliance with the provisions of the European Convention for the Protection of Animals kept for Farming purposes and the subsequent recommendations by its standing committee (T-AP).\n(18)\nThe organic livestock production system should aim at completing the production cycles of the different livestock species with organically reared animals. It should therefore encourage the increase of the gene pool of organic animals, improve self reliance and thus ensure the development of the sector.\n(19)\nOrganic processed products should be produced by the use of processing methods which guarantee that the organic integrity and vital qualities of the product are maintained through all stages of the production chain.\n(20)\nProcessed food should be labelled as organic only where all or almost all the ingredients of agricultural origin are organic. However, special labelling provisions should be laid down for processed foods which include agricultural ingredients that cannot be obtained organically, as it is the case for products of hunting and fishing. Moreover, for the purpose of consumer information, transparency in the market and to stimulate the use of organic ingredients, it should also be made possible to refer to organic production in the ingredients list under certain conditions.\n(21)\nIt is appropriate to provide for flexibility as regards the application of production rules, so as to make it possible to adapt organic standards and requirements to local climatic or geographic conditions, specific husbandry practices and stages of development. This should allow for the application of exceptional rules, but only within the limits of specific conditions laid down in Community legislation.\n(22)\nIt is important to maintain consumer confidence in organic products. Exceptions from the requirements applicable to organic production should therefore be strictly limited to cases where the application of exceptional rules is deemed to be justified.\n(23)\nFor the sake of consumer protection and fair competition, the terms used to indicate organic products should be protected from being used on non-organic products throughout the Community and independently of the language used. The protection should also apply to the usual derivatives or diminutives of those terms, whether they are used alone or combined.\n(24)\nIn order to create clarity for consumers throughout the Community market, the EU-logo should be made obligatory for all organic pre-packaged food produced within the Community. It should otherwise be possible to use the EU-logo on a voluntary basis in the case of non pre-packaged organic products produced within the Community or any organic products imported from third countries.\n(25)\nIt is however considered appropriate to limit the use of the EU-logo to products which contain only, or almost only, organic ingredients in order not to mislead consumers as to the organic nature of the entire product. It should therefore not be allowed to use it in the labelling of in-conversion products or processed foodstuffs of which less than 95 % of its ingredients of agricultural origin are organic.\n(26)\nThe EU-logo should under no circumstances prevent the simultaneous use of national or private logos.\n(27)\nMoreover, for the sake of avoiding deceptive practices and any possible confusion amongst consumers on the Community or non-Community origin of the product, whenever the EU-logo is used, consumers should be informed about the place were the agricultural raw materials of which the product is composed have been farmed.\n(28)\nThe Community rules should promote a harmonised concept of organic production. The competent authorities, control authorities and control bodies should refrain from any conduct that might create obstacles to the free movement of compliant products that have been certified by an authority or body located in another Member State. They should in particular not impose any additional controls or financial burdens.\n(29)\nFor the sake of consistency with Community legislation in other fields, in the case of plant and livestock production, Member States should be allowed to apply within their own territories, national production rules which are stricter than the Community organic production rules, provided that these national rules also apply to non-organic production and are otherwise in conformity with Community law.\n(30)\nThe use of GMOs in organic production is prohibited. For the sake of clarity and coherence, it should not be possible to label a product as organic where it has to be labelled as containing GMOs, consisting of GMOs or produced from GMOs.\n(31)\nIn order to ensure that organic products are produced in accordance with the requirements laid down under the Community legal framework on organic production, activities performed by operators at all stages of production, preparation and distribution of organic products should be submitted to a control system set up and managed in conformity with the rules laid down in Regulation (EC) No 882/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on official controls performed to ensure the verification of compliance with feed and food law, animal health and animal welfare rules (3).\n(32)\nIt might in some cases appear disproportionate to apply notification and control requirements to certain types of retail operators, such as those who sell products directly to the final consumer or user. It is therefore appropriate to allow Member States to exempt such operators from these requirements. However, in order to avoid fraud it is necessary to exclude from the exemption those retail operators who produce, prepare or store products other than in connection with the point of sale, or who import organic products or who have contracted out the aforesaid activities to a third party.\n(33)\nOrganic products imported into the European Community should be allowed to be placed on the Community market as organic, where they have been produced in accordance with production rules and subject to control arrangements that are in compliance with or equivalent to those laid down in Community legislation. In addition, the products imported under an equivalent system should be covered by a certificate issued by the competent authority, or recognised control authority or body of the third country concerned.\n(34)\nThe assessment of equivalency with regard to imported products should take into account the international standards laid down in Codex Alimentarius.\n(35)\nIt is considered appropriate to maintain the list of third countries recognised by the Commission as having production standards and control arrangement which are equivalent to those provided for in Community legislation. For third countries which are not included in that list, the Commission should set up a list of control authorities and control bodies recognised as being competent for the task of ensuring controls and certification in third countries concerned.\n(36)\nRelevant statistical information should be collected in order to obtain reliable data needed for the implementation and follow-up of this Regulation and as a tool for producers, market operators and policy makers. The statistical information needed should be defined within the context of the Community Statistical Programme.\n(37)\nThis Regulation should apply from a date which gives the Commission sufficient time to adopt the measures necessary for its implementation.\n(38)\nThe measures necessary for the implementation of this Regulation should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission (4).\n(39)\nThe dynamic evolution of the organic sector, certain highly sensitive issues linked to the organic production method and the need to ensure a smooth functioning of the internal market and control system makes it appropriate to provide for a future review of the Community rules on organic farming, taking into account the experience gained from the application of these rules.\n(40)\nPending the adoption of detailed Community production rules for certain animal species and aquatic plants and micro-algae, Member States should have the possibility to provide for the application of national standards or, in the absence thereof, private standards accepted or recognised by the Member States,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nTITLE I\nAIM, SCOPE AND DEFINITIONS\nArticle 1\nAim and scope\n1.

GMOs\n1.   GMOs and products produced from or by GMOs shall not be used as food, feed, processing aids, plant protection products, fertilisers, soil conditioners, seeds, vegetative propagating material, micro-organisms and animals in organic production.\n2.   For the purpose of the prohibition referred to in paragraph 1 concerning GMOs or products produced from GMOs for food and feed, operators may rely on the labels accompanying a product or any other accompanying document, affixed or provided pursuant to Directive 2001/18/EC, Regulation (EC) 1829/2003 of the European Parliament and the Council of 22 September 2003 on genetically modified food and feed (14) or Regulation (EC) 1830/2003 concerning the traceability and labelling of genetically modified organisms and the traceability of food and feed products produced from genetically modified organisms.\nOperators may assume that no GMOs or products produced from GMOs have been used in the manufacture of purchased food and feed products when the latter are not labelled, or accompanied by a document, pursuant to those Regulations, unless they have obtained other information indicating that labelling of the products in question is not in conformity with those Regulations.\n3.   For the purpose of the prohibition referred to in paragraph 1, with regard to products not being food or feed, or products produced by GMOs, operators using such non-organic products purchased from third parties shall require the vendor to confirm that the products supplied have not been produced from or by GMOs.\n4.   The Commission shall decide on measures implementing the prohibition on the use of GMOs and products produced from or by GMOs in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 37(2).\nArticle 10\nProhibition on the use of ionising radiation\nThe use of ionising radiation for the treatment of organic food or feed, or of raw materials used in organic food or feed is prohibited.\nCHAPTER 2\nFarm production\nArticle 11\nGeneral farm production rules\nThe entire agricultural holding shall be managed in compliance with the requirements applicable to organic production.\nHowever, in accordance with specific conditions to be laid down in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 37(2), a holding may be split up into clearly separated units or aquaculture production sites which are not all managed under organic production. As regards animals, different species shall be involved. As regards aquaculture the same species may be involved, provided that there is adequate separation between the production sites. As regards plants, different varieties that can be easily differentiated shall be involved.\nWhere, in accordance with the second subparagraph, not all units of a holding are used for organic production, the operator shall keep the land, animals, and products used for, or produced by, the organic units separate from those used for, or produced by, the non-organic units and keep adequate records to show the separation.\nArticle 12\nPlant production rules\n1.   In addition to the general farm production rules laid down in Article 11, the following rules shall apply to organic plant production:\n(a)\norganic plant production shall use tillage and cultivation practices that maintain or increase soil organic matter, enhance soil stability and soil biodiversity, and prevent soil compaction and soil erosion;\n(b)\nthe fertility and biological activity of the soil shall be maintained and increased by multiannual crop rotation including legumes and other green manure crops, and by the application of livestock manure or organic material, both preferably composted, from organic production;\n(c)\nthe use of biodynamic preparations is allowed;\n(d)\nin addition, fertilisers and soil conditioners may only be used if they have been authorised for use in organic production under Article 16;\n(e)\nmineral nitrogen fertilisers shall not be used;\n(f)\nall plant production techniques used shall prevent or minimise any contribution to the contamination of the environment;\n(g)\nthe prevention of damage caused by pests, diseases and weeds shall rely primarily on the protection by natural enemies, the choice of species and varieties, crop rotation, cultivation techniques and thermal processes;\n(h)\nin the case of an established threat to a crop, plant protection products may only be used if they have been authorised for use in organic production under Article 16;\n(i)\nfor the production of products other than seed and vegetative propagating material only organically produced seed and propagating material shall be used.

The collection of wild plants and parts thereof, growing naturally in natural areas, forests and agricultural areas is considered an organic production method provided that:\n(a)\nthose areas have not, for a period of at least three years before the collection, received treatment with products other than those authorised for use in organic production under Article 16;\n(b)\nthe collection does not affect the stability of the natural habitat or the maintenance of the species in the collection area.\n3.   The measures necessary for the implementation of the production rules contained in this Article shall be adopted in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 37(2).\nArticle 13\nProduction rules for seaweed\n1.   The collection of wild seaweeds and parts thereof, growing naturally in the sea, is considered as an organic production method provided that:\n(a)\nthe growing areas are of high ecological quality as defined by Directive 2000/60/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 October 2000 establishing a framework for Community action in the field of water policy (15) and, pending its implementation, of a quality equivalent to designated waters under Directive 2006/113/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 December 2006 on the quality required of shellfish waters (16), and are not unsuitable from a health point of view. Pending more detailed rules to be introduced in implementing legislation, wild edible seaweeds shall not be collected in areas which would not meet the criteria for Class A or Class B areas as defined in Annex II of Regulation (EC) No 854/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 laying down specific rules for the organisation of official controls on products of animal origin intended for human consumption (17);\n(b)\nthe collection does not affect the long term stability of the natural habitat or the maintenance of the species in the collection area.\n2.   The farming of seaweeds shall take place in coastal areas with environmental and health characteristics at least equivalent to those outlined in paragraph 1 in order to be considered organic. In addition to this:\n(a)\nsustainable practices shall be used in all stages of production, from collection of juvenile seaweed to harvesting;\n(b)\nto ensure that a wide gene-pool is maintained, the collection of juvenile seaweed in the wild should take place on a regular basis to supplement indoor culture stock;\n(c)\nfertilisers shall not be used except in indoor facilities and only if they have been authorised for use in organic production for this purpose under Article 16.\n3.

It contains the basic objectives and general principles for organic farming and illustrates the rules on production, labelling, controls and trade with non-EU countries.\nIn harmonising the rules on the production, labelling and control of organic products, it seeks to ensure that there is\nfair competition between producers and\ngreater confidence in these products among consumers.\nKEY POINTS\nScope\nThe framework governs:\nagricultural products (including aquaculture products), either processed or unprocessed and intended for human consumption;\nanimal feed;\nvegetative propagating material (e.g. roots and grafts) and seed used for crops;\nyeasts used as food or feed.\nObjectives and principles\nThe objectives focus on sustainable agriculture and production quality, which must meet consumers’ needs.\nThe general principles concern, for example, specific production methods, the use of natural resources and strict restrictions on synthetic chemical inputs.\nIt also lays down specific principles concerning farming, the processing of organic food and organic animal feed.\nProduction rules\nAccording to the general rules for organic production, genetically modified organisms (GMOs) are prohibited in all their forms. Rules concerning the labelling of food allow operators to ensure compliance with this prohibition. Treatment by ionising radiation is also prohibited.\nThose wishing to operate both types of agricultural production (organic and non-organic) must ensure that animals and land for these 2 activities are separated.\nOrganic plant production must comply with certain rules concerning:\nground treatment, which must preserve life and the natural fertility of the ground;\nthe prevention of damage, which must be based on natural methods but which can make use of a limited number of plant protection products authorised by the European Commission (Article 16 of the Regulation);\nseed and plant propagation material, which must be produced using organic methods;\ncleaning products, for which authorisation must be requested from the Commission.\nWild plants collected in some areas are also classified as organic products if they comply with certain conditions relating to their harvest and provenance (e.g. the place where they are gathered has not been treated by products that are not authorised for at least 3 years). Seaweed may also be considered as an organic product as long as its area of production and harvest comply with certain conditions.\nOrganic livestock production must comply with certain rules concerning:\nthe animals’ origin — they must have been born and reared in organic holdings;\nlivestock management and care practices, which, among other things, relate to certain features of animal housing;\nanimal breeding methods, generally natural;\nanimal feed, which must be organic;\nthe prevention of disease;\ncleaning and disinfection, involving the exclusive use of products authorised by the Commission.\nSimilar specific rules apply to aquaculture animals.\nThe Commission authorises the use of a limited number of products and substances in organic farming. These products may be for plant care, animal feed and the cleaning of buildings used for livestock and plant production. The Commission may also set certain limits and conditions for the application of these products.\nHoldings which are entering into a new organic farming activity must comply with a conversion period — a transition phase during which organic practices must be respected. The regulation lays down rules governing this conversion period.\nOrganic processed feed must contain organic raw materials and may not be processed using chemical solvents. Processed food must contain mainly ingredients of agricultural origin. Other ingredients are permitted if authorisation has been requested from the Commission. Organic yeast must be produced from organic substrates and other authorised ingredients.\nThe Commission may make exceptions to provisions concerning objectives, production rules and labelling. These exceptions must be limited in time and apply to certain particular cases.\nLabelling\nLabelling, advertising or commercial documents may use terms such as ‘eco’ and ‘bio’ to describe an organic product, its ingredients, or raw materials.\nThe labelling of an organic product must be clearly visible on the packaging and contain a reference to the control body that certifies the product concerned.\nSince 1 July 2010, the use of the EU logo on organic food products has been mandatory, as has been an indication of the provenance of raw materials used in the product. This indication must be shown in the same field of vision as the EU logo.\nControls\nCompliance with the provisions contained in this regulation is guaranteed by a system of controls based on Regulation (EC) No 882/2004 and precautionary and control measures drawn up by the Commission. This system guarantees the traceability of food in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 178/2002.\nAn assessment of the risk of infringement determines the type and frequency of controls. These will be organised by authorities appointed by EU countries. Under certain conditions, these authorities may delegate control duties to accredited bodies, but they remain responsible for the supervision of the controls carried out and the granting of exemptions. EU countries must notify the Commission regularly of the list of authorities and control bodies.\nThe authorities must also control the activities of each operator involved in the marketing of an organic product before it is placed on the market.\nFollowing this control, the operator receives certification that it complies with this regulation. If irregularities are noted, the authority must ensure that the labelling of the products at issue do not contain any reference to organic production.\nTrade with non-EU countries\nProducts from non-EU countries may also be sold in the EU market as organic products as long as they comply with this regulation and if they have been subject to control. This control may be carried out either by a body recognised by the EU, or by an accredited control body.\nMarketing and statistical surveillance\nThe marketing of an organic product may not be hindered in any way by any authority of an EU country other than the authority which has inspected the product.\nThe Commission carries out statistical surveillance activities based on the data provided by EU countries. The Regulatory Committee on Organic Farming assists the Commission in defining policies for organic farming.\nRepeal\nRegulation (EU) 2018/848 (see summary) repeals and replaces Regulation (EC) No 834/2007 with effect from 1 January 2022.\nFROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?\n              \nIt has applied since 1 January 2009.\nBACKGROUND\nThis regulation has been adopted as part of a series of initiatives to foster organic farming.\nIn 2014, the Commission approved an Action Plan for the future of Organic Production in Europe.\nFor more information, see:\nOrganic farming: logo (European Commission).\nMAIN DOCUMENT\n            \nCouncil Regulation (EC) No 834/2007 of 28 June 2007 on organic production and labelling of organic products and repealing Regulation (EEC) No 2092/91 (OJ L 189, 20.7.2007, pp. 1-23)\nSuccessive amendments to Regulation (EC) No 834/2007 have been incorporated in to the original document.
