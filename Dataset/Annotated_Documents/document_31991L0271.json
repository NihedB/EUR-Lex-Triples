The law also covers wastewater generated by industries such as the agro-food industries (like food-processing and brewing).\nKEY POINTS\nEU countries must:\ncollect and treat wastewater in urban settlements with a population of at least 2,000 and apply secondary treatment* on the collected wastewaters;\napply more advanced treatment in urban settlements with populations over 10,000 located in designated sensitive areas*;\nguarantee that treatment plants are properly maintained, so as to ensure sufficient performance, and can operate under all normal weather conditions;\ntake measures to limit the pollution of receiving waters from storm water overflows under extreme situations, such as unusually heavy rain;\nmonitor the performance of treatment plants and receiving waters;\nmonitor sewage sludge disposal and re-use.\nAs well as outlining methods for the monitoring and evaluation of results, Annex I lists general requirements for:\ncollecting systems;\ndischarges from urban wastewater treatment plants, including emission limit values for these;\nindustrial wastewater discharged into urban collecting systems.\nAnnex II describes the criteria for the identification of sensitive and less sensitive areas.\nThe last available report from the European Commission on the implementation status and implementation programmes, published in 2016, notes that this directive has played an essential role in improving the quality of EU waters. However, there are still some implementation gaps, especially concerning the appropriate treatment level. The investments performed so far and planned by the EU countries are considerable, but are indispensable to bridge the above-mentioned gap and also to maintain compliance. Furthermore, the substantial contribution from the urban waste water sector to economic growth and the creation of jobs is significant.\nFROM WHEN DOES THE DIRECTIVE APPLY?\n              \nFrom 29 May 1991, with several different deadlines for the various requirements. In 1998, the Commission adopted Directive 98/15/EC to clarify some of the rules due to differing interpretations in EU countries. This came into force on 27 March 1998. Other deadlines apply to countries that joined the EU from 2004 onwards. These are specified in the Accession Treaties with each of the countries concerned.\nBACKGROUND\n              \nFor more information, see:\n‘Urban Waste Water Directive Overview’ on the European Commission's website.\n* KEY TERMS\n              \nEutrophication: enrichment of water by nutrients causing, among other things, an accelerated growth of algae which disturb the balance of water organisms and the water quality.\nSecondary treatment: a process generally involving biological treatment, so that the requirements in Annex I of the Directive are accomplished.\nSensitive areas: natural waters which are found to be or may become eutrophic in the near future if protective action is not taken, or those which need more advance treatment to reach compliance with other EU directives (e.g., the Bathing Water Directive)\nMAIN DOCUMENT\n            \nCouncil Directive 91/271/EEC of 21 May 1991 concerning urban wastewater treatment (OJ L 135, 30.5.1991, pp. 40–52)\nSuccessive amendments to Directive 91/271/EEC have been incorporated in the original text.
