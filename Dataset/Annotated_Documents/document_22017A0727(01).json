Auditors.\nDetailed provisions shall be adopted for financial control and auditing, administrative measures, penalties and recovery that enable the European Commission, OLAF and the Court of Auditors

Agreement may be terminated by either Contracting Party by giving six months' notice in writing.\nArticle 8\nThe Contracting Parties may review this Agreement for the first time no later than three
