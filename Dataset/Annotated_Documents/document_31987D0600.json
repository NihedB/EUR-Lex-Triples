These arrangements shall apply to the notification and provision of information whenever a Member State decides to take measures of a wide-spread nature in order to protect the general public in case of a radiological emergency following:\n(a)\nan accident in its territory involving facilities or activities referred to in paragraph 2 from which a significant release of radioactive material occurs or is likely to occur; or\n(b)\nthe detection, within or outside its own territory, of abnormal levels of radioactivity which are likely to be detrimental to public health in that Member State; or\n(c)\naccidents other than those specified in {a) involving facilities or activities referred to in paragraph 2 from which a significant release of radioactive material occurs or is likely to occur; or\n(d)\nother accidents from which a significant release of radioactive materials occurs or is likely to occur.\n2.   The facilities or activities referred to in paragraph 1 (a) and 1 (c) are the following:\n(a)\nany nuclear reactor, wherever located;\n(b)\nany other nuclear fuel cycle facility;\n(c)\nany radioactive waste management facility;\n(d)\nthe transport and storage of nuclear fuels or radioactive wastes;\n(e)\nthe manufacture, use, storage, disposal and transport of radioisotopes for agricultural, industrial, medical and related scientific and research purposes; and\n(f)\nthe use of radioisotopes for power generation in space objects.\nArticle 2\n1.   When a Member State decides to take measures as referred to in Article 1, that Member State shall:\n(a)\nforthwith notify the Commission and those Member States which are, or are likely to be, affected of such measures and the reasons for taking them;\n(b)\npromptly provide the Commission and those Member States which are, or are likely to be, affected with available information relevant to minimizing the foreseen radiological consequences, if any, in those States.\n2.   A Member State should whenever possible provide the Commission and those Member States which are likely to be affected with notification of its intention to take without delay measures as referred to in Article 1.\nArticle 3\n1.   The information to be provided pursuant to Article 2 (1) (b) shall, without jeopardy to matters of national security, include, as far as practicable and appropriate, the following:\n(a)\nthe nature and time of the event, its exact location and the facility or the activity involved;\n(b)\nthe assumed or established cause and the foreseeable development of the accident relevant to the release of the radioactive materials;\n(c)\nthe general characteristics of the radioactive release, including the nature, probable physical and chemical form and the quantity, composition and effective height of the radioactive release;\n(d)\ninformation on current and forecast meteorological and hydrological conditions, necessary for forecasting the dispersion of the radioactive release;\n(e)\nthe results of environmental monitoring;\n(f)\nthe results of measurements of foodstuffs, feeding-stuffs and drinking water;\n(g)\nthe protective measures taken or planned;\n(h)\nthe measures taken, or planned, to inform the public;\n(i)\nthe predicted behaviour over time of the radioactive release.\n2.   The information shall be supplemented at appropriate intervals by further relevant information, including the development of the emergency situation and its foreseeable or actual termination.\n3.   The Member State referred to in Article 1 shall, in accordance with Article 36 of the Treaty, continue to inform the Commission at appropriate intervals of the levels of radioactivity as laid down in paragraph 1 (e) and (f).\nArticle 4\nAny Member State, upon receipt of the information set out in Articles 2 and 3, shall:\n(a)\npromptly inform the Commission of the measures taken and recommendations issued following the receipt of such information;\n(b)\ninform the Commission, at appropriate intervals, of the levels of radioactivity measured by their monitoring facilities in foodstuffs, feedingstuffs, drinking water and the environment.\nArticle 5\n1.   Upon receipt of the information referred to in Articles 2, 3 and 4, the Commission shall, subject to Article 6, immediately forward it to the competent authorities of all other Member States. Likewise the Commission shall forward to all Member States any information it receives about significant increases in the level of radioactivity or about nuclear accidents in non-Community countries and especially those adjacent to the Community.\n2.   Detailed procedures for the transmission of the information referred to in Articles 1 to 4 shall be agreed by the Commission and the competent authorities of the Member States and tested at regular intervals.\n3.   Each Member State shall indicate to the Commission the competent national authorities and points of contact designated to forward or receive the information set out in Articles 2 to 5.
