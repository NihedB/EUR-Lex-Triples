Cocolaf also complements the Hercule III programme, which funds projects that, among other things, increase anti-fraud cooperation between EU countries, the Commission and OLAF.\nCocolaf, in agreement with the Commission, may set up working parties that tackle specific issues. In this respect, the following 4 sub-groups have been created:\nFraud Prevention Group: stimulates cooperation among the relevant national authorities of EU countries and the Commission by exchanging experiences and best practices in the field of fraud prevention (e.g.\nexperience with fraud risk assessments,\nexchange on fraudulent practices detected,\nexperience with the development and implementation of national or sectoral anti-fraud strategies or policies or measures, etc.).\nReporting and Analysis of Fraudulent and Other Irregularities Group: focuses on introducing and discussing statistical analysis of reported cases and considers other issues relevant to the preparation of the Article 325 report.\nAFCOS (Anti-Fraud Coordination Service) Group: exchanges experience and best practices in investigative cooperation between OLAF and national authorities, in line with the regulation governing OLAF’s investigations (Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 883/2013).\nOLAF Anti-Fraud Communicators’ Network (OAFCN): brings together spokespersons and public relations officers from relevant national authorities and OLAF to share media strategies and promote communication on preventing and deterring fraud.\nThe Commission arranges meetings and provides secretariat services for Cocolaf.\nBACKGROUND\n              \nArticle 325 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union requires EU countries to counter fraud at EU level in the same manner as they would counter fraud affecting their own financial interests. Meanwhile, the Commission is responsible for the proper implementation of the EU budget. For these reasons, it was decided to establish a committee covering the whole area of fraud against the EU budget.\n* KEY TERMS\n              \nFraud: wrongful deception intended to result in financial or criminal gain.\nMAIN DOCUMENT\n            \nCommission Decision 94/140/EC of 23 February 1994 setting up an advisory committee for the coordination of fraud prevention (OJ L 61, 4.3.1994, pp. 27–28)\nSuccessive amendments to Decision 94/140/EC have been incorporated in to the original document.
