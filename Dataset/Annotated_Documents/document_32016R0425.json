{"celex_id": "32016R0425", "reference": "31.3.2016\nEN\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\nL 81/51\nREGULATION (EU) 2016/425 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL\nof 9 March 2016\non personal protective equipment and repealing Council Directive 89/686/EEC\n(Text with EEA relevance)\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 114 thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee (1),\nActing in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure (2),\nWhereas:\n(1)\nCouncil Directive 89/686/EEC (3) was adopted in the context of establishing the internal market, in order to harmonise health and safety requirements for personal protective equipment (PPE) in all Member States and to remove obstacles to trade in PPE between Member States.\n(2)\nDirective 89/686/EEC is based on the ‘new approach’ principles, as set out in the Council Resolution of 7 May 1985 on a new approach to technical harmonisation and standards (4). Thus, it sets only the essential requirements applying to PPE, whereas technical details are adopted by the European Committee for Standardisation (CEN) and the European Committee for Electrotechnical Standardisation (Cenelec) in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 1025/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council (5). Conformity with the harmonised standards so set, the reference numbers of which are published in the Official Journal of the European Union, provides a presumption of conformity with the requirements of Directive 89/686/EEC. Experience has shown that those basic principles have worked well in that sector and should be maintained and even further promoted.\n(3)\nExperience with the application of Directive 89/686/EEC has shown inadequacies and inconsistencies in the product coverage and conformity assessment procedures. In order to take account of that experience and to provide clarification in relation to the framework within which products covered by this Regulation may be made available on the market, certain aspects of Directive 89/686/EEC should be revised and enhanced.\n(4)\nSince the scope, the essential health and safety requirements and conformity assessment procedures have to be identical in all the Member States there is almost no flexibility in transposing a directive based on the new approach principles into national law. Directive 89/686/EEC should therefore be replaced by a regulation, which is the appropriate legal instrument for imposing clear and detailed rules which do not give room for divergent transposition by Member States.\n(5)\nRegulation (EC) No 765/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council (6) lays down rules on the accreditation of conformity assessment bodies, provides a framework for the market surveillance of products and for controls on products from third countries, and lays down the general principles of the CE marking.\n(6)\nDecision No 768/2008/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (7) lays down common principles and reference provisions intended to apply across sectoral legislation. In order to ensure consistency with other sectoral product legislation, it is appropriate to align certain provisions of this Regulation to that Decision, in so far as sectoral specificities do not require a different solution. Therefore, certain definitions, the general obligations of economic operators, the presumption of conformity, EU declaration of conformity, rules on CE marking, requirements for conformity assessment bodies and notification procedures, the conformity assessment procedures and the provisions concerning procedures to deal with PPE presenting a risk should be adapted to that Decision.\n(7)\nRegulation (EU) No 1025/2012 provides for a procedure for objections to harmonised standards where those standards do not entirely satisfy the requirements of this Regulation.\n(8)\nThis Regulation covers PPE which is new to the Union market when it is placed on the market; that is to say it is either new PPE made by a manufacturer established in the Union or PPE, whether new or second-hand, imported from a third country.\n(9)\nThis Regulation should apply to all forms of supply, including distance selling.\n(10)\nSome products on the market that provide a protective function to the user are excluded from the scope of Directive 89/686/EEC. In order to ensure as high a level of protection for the user of those products as for the user of PPE covered by Directive 89/686/EEC, the scope of this Regulation should include PPE for private use against heat, in line with similar PPE for professional use which is already covered by Directive 89/686/EEC. Artisanal decorative products do not claim to fulfil a protective function, are by definition not personal protective equipment and are therefore not concerned by that inclusion. Clothing intended for private use with reflective or fluorescent elements included for reasons of design or decoration is not personal protective equipment and is therefore not covered by this Regulation. As for products intended for private use to protect against atmospheric conditions that are not of an extreme nature or to protect against damp and water, including but not limited to seasonal clothing, umbrellas and dishwashing gloves, those should also fall outside of the scope of this Regulation. It is also appropriate to clarify the list of excluded PPE set out in Annex I to Directive 89/686/EEC by adding a reference to products covered by other legislation and therefore excluded from the scope of this Regulation.\n(11)\nEconomic operators should be responsible for the compliance of PPE with the requirements of this Regulation, in relation to their respective roles in the supply chain, so as to ensure a high level of protection of public interests, such as health and safety, and the protection of users, and to guarantee fair competition on the Union market.\n(12)\nAll economic operators intervening in the supply and distribution chain should take appropriate measures to ensure that they make available on the market only PPE which is in conformity with this Regulation. This Regulation should provide a clear and proportionate distribution of obligations which correspond to the role of each economic operator in the supply and distribution chain.\n(13)\nIn order to facilitate communication between economic operators, national market surveillance authorities and consumers, Member States should encourage economic operators to include a website address in addition to the postal address.\n(14)\nThe manufacturer, having detailed knowledge of the design and production process, is best placed to carry out the conformity assessment procedure. Conformity assessment should therefore remain solely the obligation of the manufacturer.\n(15)\nIt is necessary to ensure that PPE from third countries entering the Union market complies with the requirements of this Regulation and, in particular, that appropriate conformity assessment procedures have been carried out by manufacturers. Provision should therefore be made for importers to make sure that PPE they place on the market complies with the requirements of this Regulation and that they do not place on the market PPE which does not comply with such requirements or which present a risk. Provision should also be made for importers to make sure that the conformity assessment procedures have been carried out and that the CE marking and technical documentation drawn up by manufacturers are available for inspection by the competent national authorities.\n(16)\nThe distributor makes PPE available on the market after it has been placed on the market by the manufacturer or the importer and should act with due care to ensure that its handling of PPE does not adversely affect the compliance of the PPE.\n(17)\nWhen placing PPE on the market, every importer should indicate on the PPE his name, registered trade name or registered trade mark and the postal address at which he can be contacted. Exceptions should be provided for in cases where the size or nature of the PPE does not allow it. This includes cases where the importer would have to open the packaging to put his name and address on the PPE.\n(18)\nEfforts should be made by economic operators to ensure that all relevant documentation, such as the user's instructions, whilst ensuring precise and comprehensible information, are easily understandable, take into account technological developments and changes to end-user behaviour, and are as up to date as possible. When PPE is made available on the market in packages containing multiple units, the instructions and information should accompany each smallest commercially available unit.\n(19)\nAny economic operator who either places PPE on the market under his own name or trademark or modifies a product in such a way that compliance with the requirements of this Regulation may be affected should be considered to be the manufacturer and should assume the obligations of the manufacturer.\n(20)\nDistributors and importers, being close to the market place, should be involved in market surveillance tasks carried out by the competent national authorities, and should be prepared to participate actively, providing those authorities with all necessary information relating to the PPE concerned.\n(21)\nEnsuring traceability of PPE throughout the whole supply chain helps to make market surveillance simpler and more efficient. An efficient traceability system facilitates the market surveillance authorities' task of tracing economic operators who made non-compliant PPE available on the market. When keeping the information required under this Regulation for the identification of other economic operators, economic operators should not be required to update such information in respect of other economic operators who have either supplied them with PPE or to whom they have supplied PPE.\n(22)\nIn order to simplify and adapt certain essential safety requirements of Directive 89/686/EEC to the current practice, the requirement to label PPE protecting against harmful noise with a comfort index should be removed as experience has shown that it is not possible to measure and establish such an index. As regards mechanical vibrations, it is appropriate to remove the requirement not to exceed the limit values set by Union legislation on the exposure of workers to vibrations since the use of PPE alone is not able to achieve this objective. As regards PPE protecting against radiation, it is no longer necessary to require that the instructions for use supplied by the manufacturer indicate transmission curves, since the indication of the protection factor is more useful and is sufficient for the user.\n(23)\nIt is necessary to clearly specify the relationship with, and the scope of this Regulation as regards, the entitlement of Member States to lay down requirements for the use of PPE at the workplace, in particular pursuant to Council Directive 89/656/EEC (8), in order to avoid any confusion and ambiguity and hence ensure the free movement of compliant PPE. Article 4 of that Directive obliges employers to provide PPE which complies with the relevant Union provisions on design and manufacture with respect to safety and health. Pursuant to that Article, manufacturers of PPE who provide that PPE to their employees must ensure that such PPE fulfils the requirements laid down in this Regulation.\n(24)\nMarket surveillance authorities should have easy access to the EU declaration of conformity. In order to fulfil that requirement, manufacturers should ensure that PPE is accompanied either by a copy of the EU declaration of conformity or by the internet address at which the EU declaration of conformity can be accessed.\n(25)\nTo ensure effective access to information for market surveillance purposes, the information required to identify all applicable Union acts for PPE should be available in a single EU declaration of conformity. In order to reduce the administrative burden on economic operators, it should be possible for that single EU declaration of conformity to be a dossier made up of relevant individual declarations of conformity.\n(26)\nIn order to increase the efficiency of market surveillance, it is necessary to extend the obligation to draw up complete technical documentation to all PPE.\n(27)\nIn order to ensure that PPE is examined on the basis of the state of the art, the limit of validity of the EU type-examination certificate should be set at a maximum of five years. A process for reviewing the certificate should be provided for. A minimum content of the certificate should be required in order to facilitate the work of the market surveillance authorities.\n(28)\nA simplified procedure should be applied in the case of renewal of the EU type- examination certificate where the manufacturer has not modified the approved type and the harmonised standards or other technical specifications applied by the manufacturer have not been changed and continue to meet the essential health and safety requirements in the light of the state of the art. In such cases, additional tests or examinations should not be necessary and the administrative burden and related costs should be kept to a minimum.\n(29)\nThe CE marking, indicating the conformity of a product, is the visible consequence of a whole process comprising conformity assessment in a broad sense. The general principles governing the CE marking are set out in Regulation (EC) No 765/2008. Rules governing the affixing of the CE marking on PPE should be laid down in this Regulation.\n(30)\nIn order to ensure compliance with the essential health and safety requirements laid down in this Regulation, it is necessary to lay down appropriate conformity assessment procedures to be followed by the manufacturer. Directive 89/686/EEC classifies PPE into three categories that are subject to different conformity assessment procedures. In order to ensure a consistently high level of safety of all PPE, the range of products subject to one of the conformity assessment procedures relating to the production phase should be enlarged. The conformity assessment procedures for each category of PPE should be set, as far as possible, on the basis of the conformity assessment modules laid down in Decision No 768/2008/EC.\n(31)\nThe conformity assessment procedures should be adapted to the specific conditions of the manufacture of PPE produced in series where each item is adapted to fit an individual user, and of PPE produced as a single unit to fit an individual user.\n(32)\nIt is necessary to ensure a uniformly high level of performance of bodies performing conformity assessment of PPE throughout the Union, and all such bodies should perform their functions at the same level and under conditions of fair competition. Therefore obligatory requirements should be set for conformity assessment bodies wishing to be notified in order to provide conformity assessment services.\n(33)\nIf a conformity assessment body demonstrates conformity with the criteria laid down in harmonised standards, it should be presumed to comply with the corresponding requirements set out in this Regulation.\n(34)\nIn order to ensure a consistent level of quality in the performance of conformity assessment of PPE, it is also necessary to set requirements for notifying authorities and other bodies involved in the assessment, notification and monitoring of notified bodies.\n(35)\nThe system set out in this Regulation should be complemented by the accreditation system provided for in Regulation (EC) No 765/2008. Since accreditation is an essential means of verifying the competence of conformity assessment bodies, it should also be used for the purposes of notification.\n(36)\nTransparent accreditation as provided for in Regulation (EC) No 765/2008, ensuring the necessary level of confidence in certificates of conformity, should be considered by the national public authorities throughout the Union as the preferred means of demonstrating the technical competence of conformity assessment bodies. However, national authorities may consider that they possess the appropriate means of carrying out that evaluation themselves. In such cases, in order to ensure the appropriate level of credibility of evaluations carried out by other national authorities, they should provide the Commission and the other Member States with the necessary documentary evidence demonstrating the compliance of the conformity assessment bodies evaluated with the relevant regulatory requirements.\n(37)\nConformity assessment bodies frequently subcontract parts of their activities linked to the assessment of conformity or have recourse to a subsidiary. In order to safeguard the level of protection required for the PPE to be placed on the market, it is essential that conformity assessment subcontractors and subsidiaries fulfil the same requirements as notified bodies in relation to the performance of conformity assessment tasks. Therefore, it is important that the assessment of the competence and the performance of bodies to be notified, and the monitoring of bodies already notified, cover also activities carried out by subcontractors and subsidiaries.\n(38)\nSince notified bodies may offer their services throughout the Union, it is appropriate to give the other Member States and the Commission the opportunity to raise objections concerning a notified body. It is therefore important to provide for a period during which any doubts or concerns as to the competence of conformity assessment bodies can be clarified before they start operating as notified bodies.\n(39)\nIn the interests of competitiveness, it is crucial that notified bodies apply the conformity assessment procedures without creating unnecessary burdens for economic operators. For the same reason, and to ensure equal treatment of economic operators, consistency in the technical application of the conformity assessment procedures needs to be ensured. That can best be achieved through appropriate coordination and cooperation between notified bodies.\n(40)\nInterested parties should have the right to appeal against the result of a conformity assessment carried out by a notified body. For that reason, it is important to ensure that an appeal procedure against decisions taken by notified bodies is available.\n(41)\nMember States should take all appropriate measures to ensure that PPE covered by this Regulation may be placed on the market only if, when properly stored and used for its intended purpose, or under conditions of use which can be reasonably foreseen, it does not endanger the health or safety of persons. PPE covered by this Regulation should be considered as non-compliant with the essential health and safety requirements laid down in this Regulation only under conditions of use which can be reasonably foreseen, that is when such use could result from lawful and readily predictable human behaviour.\n(42)\nIn order to ensure legal certainty, it is necessary to clarify that rules on Union market surveillance and control of products entering the Union market provided for in Regulation (EC) No 765/2008 apply to PPE covered by this Regulation. This Regulation should not prevent Member States from choosing the competent authorities to carry out those tasks.\n(43)\nDirective 89/686/EEC already provides for a safeguard procedure which is necessary to allow for the possibility of contesting the conformity of a product. In order to increase transparency and to reduce processing time, it is necessary to improve the existing safeguard procedure, with a view to making it more efficient and drawing on the expertise available in Member States.\n(44)\nThe existing system should be supplemented by a procedure under which interested parties are informed of measures intended to be taken with regard to PPE presenting a risk to the health or safety of persons. It should also allow market surveillance authorities, in cooperation with the relevant economic operators, to act at an earlier stage in respect of such PPE.\n(45)\nWhere the Member States and the Commission agree as to the justification of a measure taken by a Member State, no further involvement of the Commission should be required, except where non-compliance can be attributed to shortcomings of a harmonised standard.\n(46)\nIn order to take into account technical progress and knowledge or new scientific evidence, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union should be delegated to the Commission in respect of amending the categories of risks against which the PPE is intended to protect users. It is of particular importance that the Commission carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level. The Commission, when preparing and drawing up delegated acts, should ensure a simultaneous, timely and appropriate transmission of relevant documents to the European Parliament and to the Council.\n(47)\nIn order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of this Regulation, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission. Those powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council (9).\n(48)\nThe advisory procedure should be used for the adoption of implementing acts requesting the notifying Member State to take the necessary corrective measures in respect of notified bodies that do not meet or no longer meet the requirements for their notification.\n(49)\nThe examination procedure should be used for the adoption of implementing acts with respect to compliant PPE which presents a risk to the health or safety of persons or to other aspects of public interest protection.\n(50)\nThe Commission should adopt immediately applicable implementing acts where, in duly justified cases relating to compliant PPE which presents a risk to the health or safety of persons, imperative grounds of urgency so require.\n(51)\nIn line with established practice, the committee set up by this Regulation can play a useful role in examining matters concerning the application of this Regulation raised either by its chair or by a representative of a Member State in accordance with its rules of procedure.\n(52)\nWhen matters relating to this Regulation, other than its implementation or infringements, are being examined, i.e. in a Commission expert group, the European Parliament should in line with existing practice receive full information and documentation and, where appropriate, an invitation to attend such meetings.\n(53)\nThe Commission should, by means of implementing acts and, given their special nature, acting without the application of Regulation (EU) No 182/2011, determine whether measures taken by Member States in respect of non-compliant PPE are justified or not.\n(54)\nIn order to allow manufacturers and other economic operators sufficient time to adapt to the requirements of this Regulation, it is necessary to provide for a sufficient transitional period after the entry into force of this Regulation during which PPE which complies with Directive 89/686/EEC may still be placed on the market.\n(55)\nMember States should lay down rules on penalties applicable to infringements of this Regulation and ensure that those rules are enforced. The penalties provided for should be effective, proportionate and dissuasive.\n(56)\nSince the objective of this Regulation, namely to ensure that PPE on the market fulfils the requirements providing for a high level of protection of health and safety of users, whilst guaranteeing the functioning of the internal market, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States, but can rather, by reason of its scale and effects, be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve that objective.\n(57)\nDirective 89/686/EEC has been amended several times. Since further substantial amendments are to be made and in order to ensure a uniform implementation throughout the Union, Directive 89/686/EEC should be repealed,\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nCHAPTER I\nGENERAL PROVISIONS\nArticle 1\nSubject matter\nThis Regulation lays down requirements for the design and manufacture of personal protective equipment (PPE) which is to be made available on the market, in order to ensure protection of the health and safety of users and establish rules on the free movement of PPE in the Union.\nArticle 2\nScope\n1.

When placing PPE on the market, manufacturers shall ensure that it has been designed and manufactured in accordance with the applicable essential health and safety requirements set out in Annex II.\n2.   Manufacturers shall draw up the technical documentation referred to in Annex III (‘technical documentation’) and carry out the applicable conformity assessment procedure referred to in Article 19 or have it carried out.\nWhere compliance of PPE with the applicable essential health and safety requirements has been demonstrated by the appropriate procedure, manufacturers shall draw up the EU declaration of conformity referred to in Article 15 and affix the CE marking referred to in Article 16.\n3.   Manufacturers shall keep the technical documentation and the EU declaration of conformity for 10 years after the PPE has been placed on the market.\n4.   Manufacturers shall ensure that procedures are in place for series production to remain in conformity with this Regulation. Changes in the design or characteristics of the PPE and changes in the harmonised standards or in other technical specifications by reference to which the conformity of the PPE is declared shall be adequately taken into account.\nWhen deemed appropriate with regard to the risks presented by PPE, manufacturers shall, to protect the health and safety of consumers and other end-users, carry out sample testing of PPE made available on the market, investigate, and, if necessary, keep a register of complaints, of non-conforming PPE and PPE recalls, and shall keep distributors informed of any such monitoring.\n5.   Manufacturers shall ensure that the PPE which they place on the market bears a type, batch or serial number or other element allowing its identification, or, where the size or nature of the PPE does not allow it, that the required information is provided on the packaging or in a document accompanying the PPE.\n6.   Manufacturers shall indicate, on the PPE, their name, registered trade name or registered trade mark and the postal address at which they can be contacted or, where that is not possible, on its packaging or in a document accompanying the PPE. The address shall indicate a single point at which the manufacturer can be contacted. The contact details shall be in a language easily understood by end-users and market surveillance authorities.\n7.   Manufacturers shall ensure that the PPE is accompanied by the instructions and information set out in point 1.4 of Annex II in a language which can be easily understood by consumers and other end-users, as determined by the Member State concerned. Such instructions and information, as well as any labelling, shall be clear, understandable, intelligible and legible.\n8.   The manufacturer shall either provide the EU declaration of conformity with the PPE or include in the instructions and information set out in point 1.4 of Annex II the internet address at which the EU declaration of conformity can be accessed.\n9.   Manufacturers who consider or have reason to believe that PPE which they have placed on the market is not in conformity with this Regulation shall immediately take the corrective measures necessary to bring that PPE into conformity, to withdraw it or to recall it, as appropriate. Furthermore, where the PPE presents a risk, manufacturers shall immediately inform the competent national authorities of the Member States in which they made the PPE available on the market to that effect, giving details, in particular, of the non-conformity and of any corrective measures taken.\n10.   Manufacturers shall, further to a reasoned request from a competent national authority, provide it with all the information and documentation, in paper or electronic form, necessary to demonstrate the conformity of the PPE with this Regulation, in a language which can be easily understood by that authority. They shall cooperate with that authority, at its request, on any action taken to eliminate the risks posed by PPE which they have placed on the market.\nArticle 9\nAuthorised representatives\n1.   A manufacturer may, by a written mandate, appoint an authorised representative.\nThe obligations laid down in Article 8(1) and the obligation to draw up the technical documentation referred to in Article 8(2) shall not form part of the authorised representative's mandate.\n2.   An authorised representative shall perform the tasks specified in the mandate received from the manufacturer. The mandate shall allow the authorised representative to do at least the following:\n(a)\nkeep the EU declaration of conformity and the technical documentation at the disposal of the national market surveillance authorities for 10 years after the PPE has been placed on the market;\n(b)\nfurther to a reasoned request from a competent national authority, provide that authority with all the information and documentation necessary to demonstrate the conformity of the PPE;\n(c)\ncooperate with the competent national authorities, at their request, on any action taken to eliminate the risks posed by PPE covered by the authorised representative's mandate.\nArticle 10\nObligations of importers\n1.   Importers shall place only compliant PPE on the market.\n2.   Before placing PPE on the market, importers shall ensure that the appropriate conformity assessment procedure referred to in Article 19 has been carried out by the manufacturer. They shall ensure that the manufacturer has drawn up the technical documentation, that the PPE bears the CE marking and is accompanied by the required documents, and that the manufacturer has complied with the requirements set out in Article 8(5) and (6).\nWhere an importer considers or has reason to believe that PPE is not in conformity with the applicable essential health and safety requirements set out in Annex II, he shall not place it on the market until it has been brought into conformity. Furthermore, where the PPE presents a risk, the importer shall inform the manufacturer and the market surveillance authorities to that effect.\n3.   Importers shall indicate, on the PPE, their name, registered trade name or registered trade mark and the postal address at which they can be contacted or, where that is not possible, on its packaging or in a document accompanying the PPE. The contact details shall be in a language easily understood by end-users and market surveillance authorities.\n4.   Importers shall ensure that the PPE is accompanied by the instructions and information set out in point 1.4 of Annex II in a language which can be easily understood by consumers and other end-users, as determined by the Member State concerned.\n5.   Importers shall ensure that, while the PPE is under their responsibility, storage or transport conditions do not jeopardise its conformity with the applicable essential health and safety requirements set out in Annex II.\n6.   When deemed appropriate with regard to the risks presented by PPE, importers shall, to protect the health and safety of consumers and other end-users, carry out sample testing of PPE made available on the market, investigate, and, if necessary, keep a register of complaints, of non-conforming PPE and PPE recalls, and shall keep distributors informed of any such monitoring.\n7.   Importers who consider or have reason to believe that PPE which they have placed on the market is not in conformity with this Regulation shall immediately take the corrective measures necessary to bring the PPE into conformity, to withdraw it or to recall it, as appropriate. Furthermore, where the PPE presents a risk, importers shall immediately inform the competent national authorities of the Member States in which they made the PPE available on the market to that effect, giving details, in particular, of the non-conformity and of any corrective measures taken.\n8.   Importers shall, for 10 years after the PPE has been placed on the market, keep a copy of the EU declaration of conformity at the disposal of the market surveillance authorities and ensure that the technical documentation can be made available to those authorities, upon request.\n9.   Importers shall, further to a reasoned request from a competent national authority, provide it with all the information and documentation, in paper or electronic form, necessary to demonstrate the conformity of PPE in a language which can be easily understood by that authority. They shall cooperate with that authority, at its request, on any action taken to eliminate the risks posed by PPE which they have placed on the market.\nArticle 11\nObligations of distributors\n1.   When making PPE available on the market, distributors shall act with due care in relation to the requirements of this Regulation.\n2.   Before making PPE available on the market, distributors shall verify that it bears the CE marking, is accompanied by the required documents and by the instructions and information set out in point 1.4 of Annex II in a language which can be easily understood by consumers and other end-users in the Member State in which PPE is to be made available on the market and that the manufacturer and the importer have complied with the requirements set out in Article 8(5) and (6) and Article 10(3) respectively.\nWhere a distributor considers or has reason to believe that PPE is not in conformity with the applicable essential health and safety requirements set out in Annex II, he shall not make the PPE available on the market until it has been brought into conformity. Furthermore, where the PPE presents a risk, the distributor shall inform the manufacturer or the importer to that effect as well as the market surveillance authorities.\n3.   Distributors shall ensure that, while PPE is under their responsibility, its storage or transport conditions do not jeopardise its conformity with the applicable essential health and safety requirements set out in Annex II.\n4.

Where the market surveillance authorities of one Member State have sufficient reason to believe that PPE covered by this Regulation presents a risk to the health or safety of persons, they shall carry out an evaluation in relation to the PPE concerned covering all relevant requirements laid down in this Regulation. The relevant economic operators shall cooperate as necessary with the market surveillance authorities for that purpose.\nWhere, in the course of the evaluation referred to in the first subparagraph, the market surveillance authorities find that the PPE does not comply with the requirements laid down in this Regulation, they shall without delay require the relevant economic operator to take all appropriate corrective action to bring the PPE into compliance with those requirements, to withdraw the PPE from the market, or to recall it within a reasonable period, commensurate with the nature of the risk, as they may prescribe.\nThe market surveillance authorities shall inform the relevant notified body accordingly.\nArticle 21 of Regulation (EC) No 765/2008 shall apply to the measures referred to in the second subparagraph of this paragraph.\n2.   Where the market surveillance authorities consider that non-compliance is not restricted to their national territory, they shall inform the Commission and the other Member States of the results of the evaluation and of the actions which they have required the economic operator to take.\n3.   The economic operator shall ensure that all appropriate corrective action is taken in respect of all the PPE concerned that it has made available on the market throughout the Union.\n4.   Where the relevant economic operator does not take adequate corrective action within the period referred to in the second subparagraph of paragraph 1, the market surveillance authorities shall take all appropriate provisional measures to prohibit or restrict the PPE being made available on their national market, to withdraw the PPE from that market or to recall it.\nThe market surveillance authorities shall inform the Commission and the other Member States, without delay, of those measures.\n5.   The information referred to in the second subparagraph of paragraph 4 shall include all available details, in particular the data necessary for the identification of the non-compliant PPE, the origin of the PPE, the nature of the non-compliance alleged and the risk involved, the nature and duration of the national measures taken and the arguments put forward by the relevant economic operator. In particular, the market surveillance authorities shall indicate whether the non-compliance is due to either of the following:\n(a)\nfailure of the PPE to meet requirements relating to the health or safety of persons; or\n(b)\nshortcomings in the harmonised standards referred to in Article 14 conferring a presumption of conformity.\n6.   Member States other than the Member State initiating the procedure under this Article shall without delay inform the Commission and the other Member States of any measures adopted and of any additional information at their disposal relating to the non-compliance of the PPE concerned, and, in the event of disagreement with the adopted national measure, of their objections.\n7.   Where, within three months of receipt of the information referred to in the second subparagraph of paragraph 4, no objection has been raised by either a Member State or the Commission in respect of a provisional measure taken by a Member State, that measure shall be deemed justified.\n8.   Member States shall ensure that appropriate restrictive measures, such as withdrawal of the PPE from the market, are taken in respect of the PPE concerned without delay.\nArticle 39\nUnion safeguard procedure\n1.   Where, on completion of the procedure set out in Article 38(3) and (4), objections are raised against a measure taken by a Member State, or where the Commission considers a national measure to be contrary to Union legislation, the Commission shall without delay enter into consultation with the Member States and the relevant economic operator or operators and shall evaluate the national measure. On the basis of the results of that evaluation, the Commission shall adopt an implementing act determining whether the national measure is justified or not.\nThe Commission shall address its decision to all Member States and shall immediately communicate it to them and the relevant economic operator or operators.\n2.   If the national measure is considered justified, all Member States shall take the necessary measures to ensure that the non-compliant PPE is withdrawn from their market, and shall inform the Commission accordingly. If the national measure is considered unjustified, the Member State concerned shall withdraw that measure.\n3.   Where the national measure is considered justified and the non-compliance of the PPE is attributed to shortcomings in the harmonised standards referred to in point (b) of Article 38(5) of this Regulation, the Commission shall apply the procedure provided for in Article 11 of Regulation (EU) No 1025/2012.\nArticle 40\nCompliant PPE which presents a risk\n1.   Where, having carried out an evaluation under Article 38(1), a Member State finds that although PPE is in compliance with this Regulation, it presents a risk to the health or safety of persons, it shall require the relevant economic operator to take all appropriate measures to ensure that the PPE concerned, when placed on the market, no longer presents that risk, to withdraw the PPE from the market or to recall it within a reasonable period, commensurate with the nature of the risk, as it may prescribe.\n2.   The economic operator shall ensure that corrective action is taken in respect of all the PPE concerned that he has made available on the market throughout the Union.\n3.   The Member State shall immediately inform the Commission and the other Member States. That information shall include all available details, in particular the data necessary for the identification of the PPE concerned, the origin and the supply chain of the PPE, the nature of the risk involved and the nature and duration of the national measures taken.\n4.   The Commission shall without delay enter into consultation with the Member States and the relevant economic operator or operators and shall evaluate the national measures taken. On the basis of the results of that evaluation, the Commission shall decide by means of implementing acts whether the national measure is justified or not and, where necessary, propose appropriate measures.\nThe implementing acts referred to in the first subparagraph of this paragraph shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 44(3).\nOn duly justified imperative grounds of urgency relating to the protection of health and safety of persons, the Commission shall adopt immediately applicable implementing acts in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 44(4).\n5.   The Commission shall address its decision to all Member States and shall immediately communicate it to them and the relevant economic operator or operators.\nArticle 41\nFormal non-compliance\n1.   Without prejudice to Article 38, where a Member State makes one of the following findings, it shall require the relevant economic operator to put an end to the non-compliance concerned:\n(a)\nthe CE marking has been affixed in violation of Article 30 of Regulation (EC) No 765/2008 or of Article 17 of this Regulation;\n(b)\nthe CE marking has not been affixed;\n(c)\nthe identification number of the notified body involved in the production control phase has been affixed in violation of Article 17 or has not been affixed;\n(d)\nthe EU declaration of conformity has not been drawn up or has not been drawn up correctly;\n(e)\nthe technical documentation is either not available or not complete;\n(f)\nthe information referred to in Article 8(6) or Article 10(3) is absent, false or incomplete;\n(g)\nany other administrative requirement provided for in Article 8 or Article 10 is not fulfilled.\n2.

The essential health and safety requirements laid down in this Regulation are compulsory.\n2.   Obligations related to essential health and safety requirements apply only where the corresponding risk exists for the PPE in question.\n3.   The essential health and safety requirements are to be interpreted and applied in such a way as to take into account the state of the art and current practice at the time of design and manufacture, as well as technical and economic considerations which are consistent with a high degree of health and safety protection.\n4.   The manufacturer shall carry out a risk assessment in order to identify the risks which apply to his PPE. He shall then design and manufacture it taking into account that assessment.\n5.   When designing and manufacturing the PPE, and when drafting the instructions, the manufacturer shall envisage not only the intended use of the PPE, but also the reasonably foreseeable uses. Where applicable, the health and safety of persons other than the user shall be ensured.\n1.   GENERAL REQUIREMENTS APPLICABLE TO ALL PPE\nPPE must provide adequate protection against the risks against which it is intended to protect.\n1.1.   Design principles\n1.1.1.

Lightness and strength\nPPE must be as light as possible without prejudicing its strength and effectiveness.\nPPE must satisfy the specific additional requirements in order to provide adequate protection against the risks for which it is intended and PPE must be capable of withstanding environmental factors in the foreseeable conditions of use.\n1.3.3.   Compatibility of different types of PPE intended for simultaneous use\nIf the same manufacturer places on the market several PPE models of different types in order to ensure the simultaneous protection of adjacent parts of the body, they must be compatible.\n1.3.4.   Protective clothing containing removable protectors\nProtective clothing containing removable protectors constitutes PPE and shall be assessed as a combination during conformity assessment procedures.\n1.4.   Manufacturer's instructions and information\nIn addition to the name and address of the manufacturer, the instructions that must be supplied with the PPE must contain all relevant information on:\n(a)\ninstructions for storage, use, cleaning, maintenance, servicing and disinfection. Cleaning, maintenance or disinfectant products recommended by manufacturers must have no adverse effect on the PPE or the user when applied in accordance with the relevant instructions;\n(b)\nperformance as recorded during relevant technical tests to check the levels or classes of protection provided by the PPE;\n(c)\nwhere applicable, accessories that may be used with the PPE and the characteristics of appropriate spare parts;\n(d)\nwhere applicable, the classes of protection appropriate to different levels of risk and the corresponding limits of use;\n(e)\nwhere applicable, the month and year or period of obsolescence of the PPE or of certain of its components;\n(f)\nwhere applicable, the type of packaging suitable for transport;\n(g)\nthe significance of any markings (see point 2.12);\n(h)\nthe risk against which the PPE is designed to protect;\n(i)\nthe reference to this Regulation and, where applicable, the references to other Union harmonisation legislation;\n(j)\nthe name, address and identification number of the notified body or bodies involved in the conformity assessment of the PPE;\n(k)\nreferences to the relevant harmonised standard(s) used, including the date of the standard(s), or references to the other technical specifications used;\n(l)\nthe internet address where the EU declaration of conformity can be accessed.\nThe information referred to in points (i), (j), (k) and (l) need not be contained in the instructions supplied by the manufacturer if the EU declaration of conformity accompanies the PPE.\n2.

Protection in liquids\n3.4.1.   Prevention of drowning\nPPE designed to prevent drowning must be capable of returning to the surface as quickly as possible, without danger to health, a user who may be exhausted or unconscious after falling into a liquid medium, and of keeping the user afloat in a position which permits breathing while awaiting help.\nPPE may be wholly or partially inherently buoyant or may be inflated by gas which can be manually or automatically released, or inflated orally.\nUnder the foreseeable conditions of use:\n(a)\nPPE must, without prejudice to its satisfactory operation, be capable of withstanding the effects of impact with the liquid medium and the environmental factors inherent in that medium;\n(b)\ninflatable PPE must be capable of inflating rapidly and fully.\nWhere particular foreseeable conditions of use so require, certain types of PPE must also satisfy one or more of the following additional requirements:\n(a)\nthey must have all the inflation devices referred to in the second subparagraph, and/or a light or sound-signalling device;\n(b)\nthey must have a device for hitching and attaching the body so that the user may be lifted out of the liquid medium;\n(c)\nthey must be suitable for prolonged use throughout the period of activity exposing the user, possibly dressed, to the risk of falling into the liquid medium or requiring the user's immersion in it.\n3.4.2.   Buoyancy aids\nClothing intended to ensure an effective degree of buoyancy, depending on its foreseeable use, shall be safe when worn and afford positive support in the liquid medium. In foreseeable conditions of use, this PPE must not restrict the user's freedom of movement but must enable the user, in particular, to swim or take action to escape from danger or to rescue other persons.\n3.5.   Protection against the harmful effects of noise\nPPE intended to prevent the harmful effects of noise must be capable of attenuating the latter so that the exposure of the user does not exceed the limit values laid down by Directive 2003/10/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (1).\nEach item of PPE must bear labelling indicating the noise attenuation level provided by the PPE. Should that not be possible, the labelling must be fixed to the packaging.\n3.6.   Protection against heat and/or fire\nPPE designed to protect all or a part of the body against the effects of heat and/or fire must possess thermal insulation capacity and mechanical strength appropriate to the foreseeable conditions of use.\n3.6.1.   PPE constituent materials and other components\nConstituent materials and other components intended for protection against radiant and convective heat must possess an appropriate coefficient of transmission of incident heat flux and be sufficiently incombustible to preclude any risk of spontaneous ignition under the foreseeable conditions of use.\nWhere the external surface of those materials and components must be reflective, the reflective power must be appropriate to the intensity of the heat flux due to radiation in the infrared range.\nMaterials and other components of equipment intended for brief use in high-temperature environments and of PPE which may be splashed by hot products such as molten material must also possess sufficient thermal capacity to retain most of the stored heat until after the user has left the danger area and removed the PPE.\nPPE materials and other components which may be splashed by hot products must also possess sufficient mechanical-impact absorbency (see point 3.1).\nPPE materials and other components which may accidentally come into contact with flame and those used in the manufacture of industrial or fire-fighting equipment must also possess a degree of non-flammability and thermal or arc heat protection corresponding to the risk class associated with the foreseeable conditions of use. They must not melt when exposed to flames nor contribute to flame propagation.\n3.6.2.   Complete PPE ready for use\nUnder the foreseeable conditions of use:\n(a)\nthe quantity of heat transmitted by PPE to the user must be sufficiently low to prevent the heat accumulated during wear in the part of the body at risk from attaining, under any circumstances, the pain or health impairment threshold;\n(b)\nPPE must, if necessary, prevent liquid or steam penetration and must not cause burns resulting from contact between its protective integument and the user.\nIf PPE incorporates refrigeration devices for the absorption of incident heat by means of liquid evaporation or solid sublimation, the design of such devices must be such that any volatile substances released are discharged beyond the outer protective integument and not towards the user.\nIf PPE incorporates a breathing device, that device must adequately fulfil the protective function assigned to it under the foreseeable conditions of use.\nThe manufacturer's instructions accompanying PPE intended for brief use in high-temperature environments must, in particular, provide all relevant data for the determination of the maximum permissible user exposure to the heat transmitted by the equipment when used in accordance with its intended purpose.\n3.7.   Protection against cold\nPPE designed to protect all or a part of the body against the effects of cold must possess thermal insulating capacity and mechanical strength appropriate to the foreseeable conditions of use for which it is intended.\n3.7.1.

Flexible materials and other components of PPE intended for use in a low-temperature environment must retain the degree of flexibility required for the necessary gestures and postures.\nPPE materials and other components which may be splashed by cold products must also possess sufficient mechanical-impact absorbency (see point 3.1).\n3.7.2.   Complete PPE ready for use\nUnder the foreseeable conditions of use, the following requirements apply:\n(a)\nthe flux transmitted by PPE to the user must be sufficiently low to prevent the cold accumulated during wear at any point on the part of the body being protected, including the tips of fingers and toes in the case of hands or feet, from attaining, under any circumstances, the pain or health impairment threshold;\n(b)\nPPE must as far as possible prevent the penetration of such liquids as rain water and must not cause injuries resulting from contact between its cold protective integument and the user.\nIf PPE incorporates a breathing device, that device must adequately fulfil the protective function assigned to it under the foreseeable conditions of use.\nThe manufacturer's instructions accompanying PPE intended for brief use in low-temperature environments must provide all relevant data concerning the maximum permissible user exposure to the cold transmitted by the equipment.\n3.8.   Protection against electric shock\n3.8.1.   Insulating equipment\nPPE designed to protect all or part of the body against the effects of electric current must be sufficiently insulated against the voltages to which the user is likely to be exposed under the most unfavourable foreseeable conditions.\nTo this end, the constituent materials and other components of those types of PPE must be chosen or designed and incorporated so as to ensure that the leakage current measured through the protective integument under test conditions at voltages correlated with those likely to be encountered in situ is minimised and, in any event, below a maximum conventional permissible value which correlates with the tolerance threshold.\nTogether with their packaging, PPE types intended exclusively for use during work or activities in electrical installations which are or may be under tension must bear markings indicating, in particular, their protection class or corresponding operating voltage, their serial number and their date of manufacture. A space must also be provided outside the protective integument of such PPE for the subsequent inscription of the date of entry into service and those of the periodic tests or inspections to be conducted.\nThe manufacturer's instructions must indicate, in particular, the exclusive use for which those PPE types are intended and the nature and frequency of the dielectric tests to which they are to be subjected during their useful life.\n3.8.2.   Conductive equipment\nConductive PPE intended for live working at high voltages shall be designed and manufactured in such a way as to ensure that there is no difference of potential between the user and the installations on which he is intervening.\n3.9.   Radiation protection\n3.9.1.   Non-ionising radiation\nPPE designed to prevent acute or chronic eye damage from sources of non-ionising radiation must be capable of absorbing or reflecting the majority of the energy radiated in the harmful wavelengths without unduly affecting the transmission of the innocuous part of the visible spectrum, the perception of contrasts and the ability to distinguish colours where required by the foreseeable conditions of use.\nTo that end, eye protective equipment must be designed and manufactured so as to possess, for each harmful wavelength, a spectral transmission factor such that the radiant-energy illumination density capable of reaching the user's eye through the filter is minimised and under no circumstances exceeds the maximum permissible exposure value. PPE designed to protect the skin against non-ionising radiation must be capable of absorbing or reflecting the majority of the energy radiated in the harmful wavelengths.\nFurthermore, the glasses must not deteriorate or lose their properties as a result of the effects of radiation emitted under the foreseeable conditions of use and all marketed specimens must bear the protection-factor number corresponding to the spectral distribution curve of their transmission factor.\nGlasses suitable for radiation sources of the same type must be classified in the ascending order of their protection factors and the manufacturer's instructions must indicate, in particular, how to select the appropriate PPE taking into account the relevant conditions of use such as the distance from the source and the spectral distribution of the energy radiated at that distance.\nThe relevant protection factor number must be marked on all specimens of filtering eye protective equipment by the manufacturer.\n3.9.2.   Ionising radiation\n3.9.2.1.   Protection against external radioactive contamination\nPPE constituent materials and other components designed to protect all or a part of the body against radioactive dust, gases, liquids or mixtures thereof must be chosen or designed and incorporated so as to ensure that this equipment effectively prevents the penetration of the contaminants under the foreseeable conditions of use.\nDepending on the nature or condition of these contaminants, the necessary leak-tightness can be provided by the impermeability of the protective integument and/or by any other appropriate means, such as ventilation and pressurisation systems designed to prevent the back-scattering of these contaminants.\nAny decontamination measures to which PPE is subject must not prejudice its possible reuse during the foreseeable useful life of those types of equipment.\n3.9.2.2.   Protection against external irradiation\nPPE intended to provide complete user protection against external irradiation or, failing this, adequate attenuation thereof, must be designed to counter only weak electron (e.g. beta) or weak photon (e.g. X, gamma) radiation.\nThe constituent materials and other components of these types of PPE must be chosen or designed and incorporated so as to provide the degree of user protection required by the foreseeable conditions of use without leading to an increase in exposure time as a result of the impedance of user gestures, posture or movement (see point 1.3.2).\nPPE must bear a mark indicating the type and equivalent thickness of the constituent material(s) suitable for the foreseeable conditions of use.\n3.10.   Protection against substances and mixtures which are hazardous to health and against harmful biological agents\n3.10.1.   Respiratory protection\nPPE intended for the protection of the respiratory system must make it possible to supply the user with breathable air when exposed to a polluted atmosphere and/or an atmosphere having an inadequate oxygen concentration.\nThe breathable air supplied to the user by PPE must be obtained by appropriate means, for example after filtration of the polluted air through PPE or by supply from an external unpolluted source.\nThe constituent materials and other components of those types of PPE must be chosen or designed and incorporated so as to ensure appropriate user respiration and respiratory hygiene for the period of wear concerned under the foreseeable conditions of use.\nThe leak-tightness of the facepiece and the pressure drop on inspiration and, in the case of the filtering devices, purification capacity must keep contaminant penetration from a polluted atmosphere low enough not to be prejudicial to the health or hygiene of the user.\nThe PPE must bear details of the specific characteristics of the equipment which, in conjunction with the instructions, enable a trained and qualified user to employ the PPE correctly.\nIn the case of filtering equipment, the manufacturer's instructions must also indicate the time limit for the storage of new filters kept in their original packaging.\n3.10.2.   Protection against cutaneous and ocular contact\nPPE intended to prevent the surface contact of all or part of the body with substances and mixtures which are hazardous to health or with harmful biological agents must be capable of preventing the penetration or permeation of such substances and mixtures and agents through the protective integument under the foreseeable conditions of use for which the PPE is intended.\nTo this end, the constituent materials and other components of those types of PPE must be chosen or designed and incorporated so as to ensure, as far as possible, complete leak-tightness, which will allow where necessary prolonged daily use or, failing this, limited leak-tightness necessitating a restriction of the period of wear.\nWhere, by virtue of their nature and the foreseeable conditions of their use, certain substances and mixtures which are hazardous to health or harmful biological agents possess high penetrative power which limits the duration of the protection provided by the PPE in question, the latter must be subjected to standard tests with a view to their classification on the basis of their performance. PPE which is considered to be in conformity with the test specifications must bear a marking indicating, in particular, the names or, in the absence of the names, the codes of the substances used in the tests and the corresponding standard period of protection.
