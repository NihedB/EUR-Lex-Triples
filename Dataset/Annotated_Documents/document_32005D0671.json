The Member States’ specialised national services, the judicial authorities and relevant bodies of the European Union such as Europol and Eurojust absolutely need information if they are to perform their tasks.\n(4)\nCouncil Decision 2003/48/JHA of 19 December 2002 on the implementation of specific measures for police and judicial cooperation to combat terrorism in accordance with Article 4 of Common Position 2001/931/CFSP (2) is a major step forward. The persistence of the terrorist threat and the complexity of the phenomenon raise the need for ever greater exchanges of information. The scope of information exchanges must be extended to all stages of criminal proceedings, including convictions, and to all persons, groups or entities investigated, prosecuted or convicted for terrorist offences.\n(5)\nSince the objectives of this decision cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States acting alone and can therefore, given the need for reciprocity, be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures, act in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Decision does not go beyond what is necessary to achieve those objectives.\n(6)\nIn the execution of the exchange of information, this Decision is without prejudice to essential national security interests, and it should not jeopardise the safety of individuals or the success of a current investigation or specific intelligence activities in the field of State security.\n(7)\nThis Decision respects the fundamental rights and observes the principles recognised in particular by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union,\nHAS DECIDED AS FOLLOWS:\nArticle 1\nDefinitions\nFor the purposes of this Decision, the following definitions shall apply:\n(a)\n‘terrorist offences’: the offences specified in Articles 1, 2 and 3 of Council Framework Decision 2002/475/JHA of 13 June 2002 on combating terrorism (3);\n(b)\n‘Europol Convention’: the Convention of 26 July 1995 on the establishment of a European Police Office (4);\n(c)\n‘Eurojust Decision’: Council Decision 2002/187/JHA of 28 February 2002 setting up Eurojust with a view to reinforcing the fight against serious crime (5);\n(d)\n‘group or entity’: ‘terrorist groups’ within the meaning of Article 2 of Council Framework Decision 2002/475/JHA and the groups and entities listed in the Annex to Council Common Position 2001/931/CFSP of 27 December 2001 on the application of specific measures to combat terrorism (6).\nArticle 2\nProvision of information concerning terrorist offences to Eurojust, Europol and the Member States\n1.
