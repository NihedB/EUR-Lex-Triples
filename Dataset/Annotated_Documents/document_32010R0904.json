{"celex_id": "32010R0904", "reference": "12.10.2010\nEN\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\nL 268/1\nCOUNCIL REGULATION (EU) No 904/2010\nof 7 October 2010\non administrative cooperation and combating fraud in the field of value added tax\n(recast)\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 113 thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European Commission,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European Parliament (1),\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee (2),\nActing in accordance with a special legislative procedure,\nWhereas:\n(1)\nCouncil Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 of 7 October 2003 on administrative cooperation in the field of value added tax (3) has been substantially amended several times. Since further amendments are to be made, it should be recast in the interests of clarity.\n(2)\nThe instruments to combat fraud in the field of value added tax (hereinafter ‘VAT’) in Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 should be improved and supplemented subsequent to the Council Conclusions of 7 October 2008; the Communication from the Commission to the Council, the European Parliament and the European Economic and Social Committee on a coordinated strategy to improve the fight against VAT fraud in the European Union; and the Report from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament on the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 concerning administrative cooperation in the field of VAT (hereinafter the ‘Commission’s report’). Editorial and practical clarifications of the provisions of Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 are also required.\n(3)\nTax evasion and tax avoidance extending across the frontiers of Member States lead to budget losses and violations of the principle of fair taxation. They are also liable to bring about distortions of capital movements and of the conditions of competition. They thus affect the operation of the internal market.\n(4)\nCombating VAT evasion calls for close cooperation between the competent authorities in each Member State responsible for the application of the provisions in that field.\n(5)\nThe tax harmonisation measures taken to complete the internal market should include the establishment of a common system for cooperation between the Member States, in particular as concerns exchange of information, whereby the Member States’ competent authorities are to assist each other and to cooperate with the Commission in order to ensure the proper application of VAT on supplies of goods and services, intra-Community acquisition of goods and importation of goods.\n(6)\nAdministrative cooperation should not lead to an undue shift of administrative burdens between Member States.\n(7)\nFor the purposes of collecting the tax owed, Member States should cooperate to help ensure that VAT is correctly assessed. They must therefore not only monitor the correct application of tax owed in their own territory, but should also provide assistance to other Member States for ensuring the correct application of tax relating to activity carried out on their own territory but owed in another Member State.\n(8)\nMonitoring the correct application of VAT on cross-border transactions taxable in a Member State other than that where the supplier is established depends in many cases on information which is held by the Member State of establishment or which can be much more easily obtained by that Member State. Effective supervision of such transactions is therefore dependent on the Member State of establishment collecting, or being in a position to collect, that information.\n(9)\nIn order to establish the one-stop shop scheme provided for by Council Directive 2006/112/EC of 28 November 2006 on the common system of value added tax (4), and to apply the refund procedure for taxable persons not established in the Member State of refund provided for in Council Directive 2008/9/EC of 12 February 2008 laying down detailed rules for the refund of value added tax, provided for in Directive 2006/112/EC, to taxable persons not established in the Member State of refund but established in another Member State (5), rules on the exchange and storage of information by Member States are required.\n(10)\nIn cross-border situations, it is important to specify the obligations of each Member State so that the tax can be effectively monitored in the Member State in which it is owed.\n(11)\nElectronic storage and transmission of certain data for VAT control purposes are indispensable for the proper functioning of the VAT system. They allow for rapid information exchange and automated access to information, which strengthen the fight against fraud. That can be achieved by enhancing the databases on VAT-taxable persons and their intra-Community transactions through the inclusion in those databases of a range of information on the taxable persons and their transactions.\n(12)\nThe Member States should implement proper verification procedures to ensure that the information is up-to-date, comparable and of good quality, thereby increasing its reliability. The conditions for the exchange of, and the automated access of Member States to, electronically stored data should be clearly defined.\n(13)\nIn order to fight fraud effectively, it is necessary to provide for information exchange without prior request. To facilitate the exchange of information, the categories for which an automatic exchange needs to be established should be specified.\n(14)\nAs indicated in the Commission’s report, feedback is an appropriate means to ensure continual improvement of the quality of the information exchanged. A framework for the provision of feedback should therefore be put in place.\n(15)\nFor the effective monitoring of VAT on cross-border transactions, it is necessary to provide for the possibility of simultaneous controls by Member States and of the presence of officials of one Member State in the territory of another Member State, within the framework of administrative cooperation.\n(16)\nOnline confirmation of the validity of VAT identification numbers is a tool which is increasingly used by operators. The system for confirming the validity of VAT identification numbers should provide automated confirmation of the relevant information to operators.\n(17)\nSome taxable persons are subject to specific obligations which are different from those in force in the Member State in which they are established, particularly as regards invoicing, when they supply goods or services to customers established on the territory of another Member State. A mechanism should be established to make information on such obligations readily available for those taxable persons.\n(18)\nRecent practical experience of the application of Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 in the fight against carrousel fraud has shown that in some cases it is essential to establish a much faster mechanism for the exchange of information, covering much more, and better targeted, information in order to combat fraud effectively. In accordance with the Council Conclusions of 7 October 2008, a decentralised network without legal personality, to be called Eurofisc, should be established within the framework of this Regulation for all the Member States, to promote and facilitate multilateral and decentralised cooperation permitting targeted and swift action to combat specific types of fraud.\n(19)\nThe Member State of consumption has primary responsibility for assuring that non-established suppliers comply with their obligations. To this end, the application of the temporary special scheme for electronically supplied services that is provided for in Chapter 6 of Title XII of Directive 2006/112/EC requires the definition of rules concerning the provision of information and transfer of money between the Member State of identification and the Member State of consumption.\n(20)\nInformation obtained by a Member State from third countries may be very useful to other Member States. Likewise information obtained by a Member State from other Member States may be very useful to third countries. The conditions for the exchange of such information should therefore be specified.\n(21)\nNational rules on banking secrecy should not stand in the way of the application of this Regulation.\n(22)\nThis Regulation should not affect other measures adopted at Union level which contribute to combating VAT fraud.\n(23)\nIn the interests of effectiveness and speed and on grounds of cost, it is essential that the information communicated under this Regulation should be provided by electronic means wherever possible.\n(24)\nIn view of the repetitive nature of certain requests and the linguistic diversity within the Union, it is important to enhance the use of standard forms in the exchange of information so that information requests can be more rapidly processed.\n(25)\nThe time limits laid down in this Regulation for the provision of information are to be understood as maximum periods not to be exceeded, the principle being that, in order for cooperation to be effective, information already available to the requested Member State should be provided without further delay.\n(26)\nFor the purposes of this Regulation, it is appropriate to consider limitations of certain rights and obligations laid down by Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data (6) in order to safeguard the interests referred to in Article 13(1)(e) of that Directive. Such limitations are necessary and proportionate in view of the potential loss of revenue for Member States and the crucial importance of information covered by this Regulation for the effectiveness of the fight against fraud.\n(27)\nAs the measures necessary to implement this Regulation are measures of general scope within the meaning of Article 2 of Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission (7), they must be adopted in conformity with the regulatory procedure provided for in Article 5 of that Decision,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nCHAPTER I\nGENERAL PROVISIONS\nArticle 1\n1.   This Regulation lays down the conditions under which the competent authorities in the Member States responsible for the application of the laws on VAT are to cooperate with each other and with the Commission to ensure compliance with those laws.\nTo that end, it lays down rules and procedures to enable the competent authorities of the Member States to cooperate and to exchange with each other any information that may help to effect a correct assessment of VAT, monitor the correct application of VAT, particularly on intra-Community transactions, and combat VAT fraud. In particular, it lays down rules and procedures for Member States to collect and exchange such information by electronic means.\n2.   This Regulation lays down the conditions under which the authorities referred to in paragraph 1 are to assist in the protection of VAT revenue in all the Member States.\n3.

It shall inform the Commission and the other Member States thereof. The central liaison office may also be designated as responsible for contacts with the Commission.\n2.   The competent authority of each Member State may designate liaison departments. The central liaison office shall be responsible for keeping the list of those departments up-to-date and making it available to the central liaison offices of the other Member States concerned.\n3.   The competent authority of each Member State may in addition designate, under the conditions laid down by it, competent officials who can directly exchange information on the basis of this Regulation. When it does so, it may limit the scope of such designation.

In such a case, the period laid down in Article 10 shall start the day after the request for assistance has been forwarded to the central liaison office.\nCHAPTER II\nEXCHANGE OF INFORMATION ON REQUEST\nSECTION 1\nRequest for information and for administrative enquiries\nArticle 7\n1.   At the request of the requesting authority, the requested authority shall communicate the information referred to in Article 1, including any information relating to a specific case or cases.\n2.   For the purpose of forwarding the information referred to in paragraph 1, the requested authority shall arrange for the conduct of any administrative enquiries necessary to obtain such information.\n3.   Until 31 December 2014, the request referred to in paragraph 1 may contain a reasoned request for an administrative enquiry. If the requested authority takes the view that the administrative enquiry is not necessary, it shall immediately inform the requesting authority of the reasons thereof.\n4.   As from 1 January 2015, the request referred to in paragraph 1 may contain a reasoned request for a specific administrative enquiry. If the requested authority takes the view that no administrative enquiry is necessary, it shall immediately inform the requesting authority of the reasons thereof.\nNotwithstanding the first subparagraph, an enquiry into the amounts declared by a taxable person in connection with the supplies of goods or services listed in Annex I, which are made by a taxable person established in the Member State of the requested authority and are taxable in the Member State of the requesting authority, may be refused solely:\n(a)\non the grounds provided for in Article 54(1), assessed by the requested authority in conformity with a statement of best practices concerning the interaction of this paragraph and Article 54(1), to be adopted in accordance with the procedure provided for in Article 58(2);\n(b)\non the grounds provided for in paragraphs 2, 3 and 4 of Article 54; or\n(c)\non the grounds that the requested authority had already supplied the requesting authority with information on the same taxable person as a result of an administrative enquiry held less than two years previously.\nWhere the requested authority refuses an administrative enquiry referred to in the second subparagraph on the grounds set out in points (a) or (b), it shall nevertheless provide to the requesting authority the dates and values of any relevant supplies made by the taxable person in the Member State of the requesting authority over the previous two years.\n5.   In order to obtain the information sought or to conduct the administrative enquiry requested, the requested authority or the administrative authority to which it has recourse shall proceed as though acting on its own account or at the request of another authority in its own Member State.\nArticle 8\nRequests for information and for administrative enquiries pursuant to Article 7 shall be sent using a standard form adopted in accordance with the procedure provided for in Article 58(2), except in the cases referred to in Article 50 or in exceptional cases where the request includes the reasons for which the requesting authority considers the standard form not to be appropriate.\nArticle 9\n1.   At the request of the requesting authority, the requested authority shall communicate to it any pertinent information it obtains or has in its possession as well as the results of administrative enquiries, in the form of reports, statements and any other documents, or certified true copies or extracts thereof.\n2.   Original documents shall be provided only where this is not contrary to the provisions in force in the Member State in which the requested authority is established.\nSECTION 2\nTime limit for providing information\nArticle 10\nThe requested authority shall provide the information referred to in Articles 7 and 9 as quickly as possible and no later than three months following the date of receipt of the request.\nHowever, where the requested authority is already in possession of that information, the time limit shall be reduced to a maximum period of one month.\nArticle 11\nIn certain special categories of cases, time limits which are different from those provided for in Article 10 may be agreed between the requested and the requesting authorities.\nArticle 12\nWhere the requested authority is unable to respond to the request by the deadline, it shall inform the requesting authority in writing forthwith of the reasons for its failure to do so, and when it considers it would be likely to be able to respond.\nCHAPTER III\nEXCHANGE OF INFORMATION WITHOUT PRIOR REQUEST\nArticle 13\n1.   The competent authority of each Member State shall, without prior request, forward the information referred to in Article 1 to the competent authority of any other Member State concerned, in the following cases:\n(a)\nwhere taxation is deemed to take place in the Member State of destination and the information provided by the Member State of origin is necessary for the effectiveness of the control system of the Member State of destination;\n(b)\nwhere a Member State has grounds to believe that a breach of VAT legislation has been committed or is likely to have been committed in the other Member State;\n(c)\nwhere there is a risk of tax loss in the other Member State.\n2.   The exchange of information without prior request shall either be automatic, in accordance with Article 14, or spontaneous, in accordance with Article 15.\n3.   The information shall be forwarded by means of standard forms adopted in accordance with the procedure provided for in Article 58(2).\nArticle 14\n1.   The following shall be determined in accordance with the procedure provided for in Article 58(2):\n(a)\nthe exact categories of information subject to automatic exchange;\n(b)\nthe frequency of the automatic exchange for each category of information; and\n(c)\nthe practical arrangements for the automatic exchange of information.\nA Member State may abstain from taking part in the automatic exchange of information with respect to one or more categories where the collection of information for such exchange would require the imposition of new obligations on persons liable for VAT or would impose a disproportionate administrative burden on the Member State.\nThe results of the automatic exchange of information for each category shall be reviewed once a year by the Committee referred to in Article 58(1), so as to ensure that this type of exchange takes places only where it is the most efficient means for the exchange of information.\n2.   As from 1 January 2015, the competent authority of each Member State shall, in particular, exchange information automatically in order to enable Member States of consumption to ascertain whether taxable persons not established in their territory declare and correctly pay the VAT due with regard to telecommunication services, broadcasting services and electronically supplied services, regardless of whether those taxable persons make use of the special scheme provided for in Section 3 of Chapter 6 of Title XII of Directive 2006/112/EC. The Member State of establishment shall inform the Member State of consumption of any discrepancies of which it becomes aware.\nArticle 15\nThe competent authorities of the Member States shall, by spontaneous exchange, forward to the competent authorities of the other Member States any information referred to in Article 13(1) which has not been forwarded under the automatic exchange referred to in Article 14 of which they are aware and which they consider may be useful to those competent authorities.\nCHAPTER IV\nFEEDBACK\nArticle 16\nWhere a competent authority provides information pursuant to Article 7 or 15, it may request the competent authority which receives the information to give feedback thereon. If such request is made, the competent authority which receives the information shall, without prejudice to the rules on tax secrecy and data protection applicable in its Member State, send feedback as soon as possible, provided that this does not impose a disproportionate administrative burden on it. Practical arrangements shall be determined in accordance with the procedure provided for in Article 58(2).\nCHAPTER V\nSTORAGE AND EXCHANGE OF SPECIFIC INFORMATION\nArticle 17\n1.   Each Member State shall store in an electronic system the following information:\n(a)\ninformation which it collects pursuant to Chapter 6 of Title XI of Directive 2006/112/EC;\n(b)\ndata on the identity, activity, legal form and address of persons to whom it has issued a VAT identification number, collected pursuant to Article 213 of Directive 2006/112/EC, as well as the date on which that number was issued;\n(c)\ndata on VAT identification numbers it has issued which have become invalid, and the dates on which those numbers became invalid; and\n(d)\ninformation which it collects pursuant to Articles 360, 361, 364 and 365 of Directive 2006/112/EC as well as, from 1 January 2015, information which it collects pursuant to Articles 369c, 369f and 369g of that Directive.\n2.   The technical details concerning the automated enquiry of the information referred to in points (b), (c) and (d) of paragraph 1 shall be adopted in accordance with the procedure provided for in Article 58(2).\nArticle 18\nTo enable the information referred to in Article 17 to be used in the procedures provided for in this Regulation, that information shall be available for at least five years from the end of the first calendar year in which access to the information is to be granted.\nArticle 19\nMember States shall ensure that the information available in the electronic system referred to in Article 17 is kept up-to-date, and is complete and accurate.\nCriteria shall be defined, in accordance with the procedure provided for in Article 58(2), to determine which changes are not pertinent, essential or useful and therefore need not be made.\nArticle 20\n1.   The information referred to in Article 17 shall be entered into the electronic system without delay.\n2.   By way of derogation from paragraph 1, the information referred to in Article 17(1)(a) shall be entered into the electronic system no later than one month after the end of the period to which that information relates.\n3.   By way of derogation from paragraphs 1 and 2, where information is to be corrected in, or added to, the electronic system pursuant to Article 19, the information must be entered no later than one month after the period in which it was collected.\nArticle 21\n1.   Every Member State shall grant the competent authority of any other Member State automated access to the information stored pursuant to Article 17.\n2.   With respect to the information referred to in Article 17(1)(a), at least the following details shall be accessible:\n(a)\nVAT identification numbers issued by the Member State receiving the information;\n(b)\nthe total value of all intra-Community supplies of goods and the total value of all intra-Community supplies of services to persons holding a VAT identification number referred to in point (a) by all operators identified for the purposes of VAT in the Member State providing the information;\n(c)\nthe VAT identification numbers of the persons who carried out the supplies of goods and services referred to in point (b);\n(d)\nthe total value of the supplies of goods and services referred to in point (b) from each person referred to in point (c) to each person holding a VAT identification number referred to in point (a);\n(e)\nthe total value of the supplies of goods and services referred to in point (b) from each person referred to in point (c) to each person holding a VAT identification number issued by another Member State under the following conditions:\n(i)\naccess is in connection with an investigation into suspected fraud;\n(ii)\naccess is through a Eurofisc liaison official, as referred to in Article 36(1), who holds a personal user identification for the electronic systems allowing access to this information; and\n(iii)\naccess is only granted during general working hours.\nThe values referred to in points (b), (d) and (e) shall be expressed in the currency of the Member State providing the information and shall relate to the periods for submission of the recapitulative statements specific to each taxable person which are established in accordance with Article 263 of Directive 2006/112/EC.\nArticle 22\n1.   In order to provide a reasonable level of assurance to tax administrations with regard to the quality and reliability of the information available through the electronic system referred to in Article 17, Member States shall adopt the measures necessary to ensure that the data provided by taxable persons and non-taxable legal persons for their identification for VAT purposes in accordance with Article 214 of Directive 2006/112/EC, are, in their assessment, complete and accurate.\nMember States shall implement procedures for checking these data as determined by the results of their risk assessment. The checks shall be carried out, in principle, prior to identification for VAT purposes or, where only preliminary checks are conducted before such identification, no later than six months from such identification.\n2.   The Member States shall inform the Committee referred to in Article 58(1) of the measures implemented at national level to ensure the quality and reliability of the information in accordance with paragraph 1.\nArticle 23\nMember States shall ensure that the VAT identification number, referred to in Article 214 of Directive 2006/112/EC, is shown as invalid in the electronic system referred to in Article 17 of this Regulation at least in the following situations:\n(a)\nwhere persons identified for VAT purposes have stated that their economic activity, as defined in Article 9 of Directive 2006/112/EC, has ceased or where the competent tax administration considers that they have ceased such activity. A tax administration may presume in particular that a person has ceased economic activity when, despite being required to do so, that person has failed to submit VAT returns and recapitulative statements for a year after expiry of the deadline for submission of the first return or statement missed. The person shall have the right to prove the existence of an economic activity by other means;\n(b)\nwhere persons have declared false data in order to obtain VAT identification or have failed to communicate changes to their data and, had the tax administration known, the latter would have refused identification for VAT purposes or withdrawn the VAT identification number.\nArticle 24\nWhere, for the purposes of Articles 17 to 21, the competent authorities of the Member States exchange information by electronic means, they shall take all measures necessary to ensure compliance with Article 55.\nMember States shall be responsible for all necessary developments to their systems to permit the exchange of that information using the CCN/CSI network.\nCHAPTER VI\nREQUEST FOR ADMINISTRATIVE NOTIFICATION\nArticle 25\nThe requested authority shall, at the request of the requesting authority and in accordance with the rules governing the notification of similar instruments in the Member State in which the requested authority is established, notify the addressee of all instruments and decisions which emanate from the competent authorities and concern the application of VAT legislation in the territory of the Member State in which the requesting authority is established.\nArticle 26\nRequests for notification, mentioning the subject of the instrument or decision to be notified, shall indicate the name, address and any other relevant information for identifying the addressee.\nArticle 27\nThe requested authority shall inform the requesting authority immediately of its response to the request for notification and notify it, in particular, of the date of notification of the decision or instrument to the addressee.\nCHAPTER VII\nPRESENCE IN ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICES AND PARTICIPATION IN ADMINISTRATIVE ENQUIRIES\nArticle 28\n1.   By agreement between the requesting authority and the requested authority, and in accordance with the arrangements laid down by the latter, officials authorised by the requesting authority may, with a view to exchanging the information referred to in Article 1, be present in the offices of the administrative authorities of the requested Member State, or any other place where those authorities carry out their duties. Where the requested information is contained in documentation to which the officials of the requested authority have access, the officials of the requesting authority shall be given copies thereof.\n2.   By agreement between the requesting authority and the requested authority, and in accordance with the arrangements laid down by the latter, officials authorised by the requesting authority may, with a view to exchanging the information referred to in Article 1, be present during the administrative enquiries carried out in the territory of the requested Member State. Such administrative enquiries shall be carried out exclusively by the officials of the requested authority. The officials of the requesting authority shall not exercise the powers of inspection conferred on officials of the requested authority. They may, however, have access to the same premises and documents as the latter, through the intermediation of the officials of the requested authority and for the sole purpose of carrying out the administrative enquiry.\n3.   The officials of the requesting authority present in another Member State in accordance with paragraphs 1 and 2 must at all times be able to produce written authority stating their identity and their official capacity.\nCHAPTER VIII\nSIMULTANEOUS CONTROLS\nArticle 29\nMember States may agree to conduct simultaneous controls whenever they consider such controls to be more effective than controls carried out by only one Member State.\nArticle 30\n1.   A Member State shall identify independently the taxable persons which it intends to propose for a simultaneous control. The competent authority of that Member State shall notify the competent authority of the other Member States concerned of the cases proposed for a simultaneous control. It shall give reasons for its choice, as far as possible, by providing the information which led to its decision. It shall specify the period of time during which such controls should be conducted.\n2.   The competent authority of the Member State that receives the proposal for a simultaneous control shall confirm its agreement or communicate its reasoned refusal to its counterpart authority, in principle within two weeks of receipt of the proposal, but within a month at the latest.\n3.   Each competent authority of the Member States concerned shall appoint a representative to be responsible for supervising and coordinating the control operation.\nCHAPTER IX\nPROVIDING INFORMATION TO TAXABLE PERSONS\nArticle 31\n1.   The competent authorities of each Member State shall ensure that persons involved in the intra-Community supply of goods or of services and non-established taxable persons supplying telecommunication services, broadcasting services and electronically supplied services, in particular those referred to in Annex II to Directive 2006/112/EC, are allowed to obtain, for the purposes of such transactions, confirmation by electronic means of the validity of the VAT identification number of any specified person as well as the associated name and address. This information shall correspond to the data referred to in Article 17.\n2.   Each Member State shall provide confirmation by electronic means of the name and address of the person to whom the VAT identification number has been issued in accordance with its national data protection rules.\n3.   During the period provided for in Article 357 of Directive 2006/112/EC, paragraph 1 of this Article shall not apply to non-established taxable persons supplying telecommunication services and radio and television broadcasting services.\nArticle 32\n1.   The Commission shall, on the basis of the information provided by the Member States, publish on its website the details of the provisions approved by each Member State which transpose Chapter 3 of Title XI of Directive 2006/112/EC.\n2.

With a view to evaluating the effectiveness of this system of administrative cooperation in combating tax evasion and tax avoidance, Member States may communicate to the Commission any other information referred to in Article 1.\n5.   The Commission shall forward the information referred to in paragraphs 2, 3 and 4 to the other Member States concerned.\n6.   Where necessary, in addition to what is required by other provisions in this Regulation, the Commission shall send to the competent authorities of each Member State any information that might enable them to combat fraud in the field of VAT as soon as it obtains such information.\n7.   The Commission may, at the request of a Member State, provide its expert opinions, technical or logistical assistance, or any other support with a view to attaining the objectives of this Regulation.\nCHAPTER XIV\nRELATIONS WITH THIRD COUNTRIES\nArticle 50\n1.   When the competent authority of a Member State receives information from a third country, that authority may pass the information on to the competent authorities of Member States which might be interested in it and, in any event, to all those which request it, in so far as permitted by assistance arrangements with that particular third country.\n2.   Competent authorities may communicate, in accordance with their domestic provisions on the communication of personal data to third countries, information obtained in accordance with this Regulation to a third country, provided that the following conditions are met:\n(a)\nthe competent authority of the Member State from which the information originates has consented to that communication; and\n(b)\nthe third country concerned has given an undertaking to provide the cooperation required to gather evidence of the irregular nature of transactions which appear to contravene VAT legislation.\nCHAPTER XV\nCONDITIONS GOVERNING THE EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION\nArticle 51\n1.   Information communicated pursuant to this Regulation shall, as far as possible, be provided by electronic means under arrangements to be adopted in accordance with the procedure provided for in Article 58(2).\n2.   Where the request has not been lodged completely through the electronic system referred to in paragraph 1, the requested authority shall confirm receipt of the request by electronic means without delay and, in any event, no later than five working days after receipt.\nWhere an authority has received a request or information of which it is not the intended recipient, it shall send a message by electronic means to the sender without delay and, in any event, no later than five working days after receipt.\nArticle 52\nRequests for assistance, including requests for notification, and attached documents may be made in any language agreed between the requested and requesting authority. The said requests shall be accompanied by a translation into the official language or one of the official languages of the Member State in which the requested authority is established only in special cases when the requested authority gives a reason for asking for such a translation.\nArticle 53\nThe Commission and the Member States shall ensure that such existing or new communication and information exchange systems which are necessary to provide for the exchanges of information described in this Regulation are operational.

The requested authority in one Member State shall provide a requesting authority in another Member State with the information referred to in Article 1 provided that:\n(a)\nthe number and the nature of the requests for information made by the requesting authority within a specific period do not impose a disproportionate administrative burden on that requested authority;\n(b)\nthat requesting authority has exhausted the usual sources of information which it could have used in the circumstances to obtain the information requested, without running the risk of jeopardising the achievement of the desired end.\n2.   This Regulation shall impose no obligation to have enquiries carried out or to provide information on a particular case if the laws or administrative practices of the Member State which would have to supply the information do not authorise the Member State to carry out those enquiries or collect or use that information for that Member State’s own purposes.\n3.   The competent authority of a requested Member State may refuse to provide information where the requesting Member State is unable, for legal reasons, to provide similar information. The Commission shall be informed of the grounds of the refusal by the requested Member State.\n4.   The provision of information may be refused where it would lead to the disclosure of a commercial, industrial or professional secret or of a commercial process, or of information whose disclosure would be contrary to public policy.\n5.   Paragraphs 2, 3 and 4 should on no account be interpreted as authorising the requested authority of a Member State to refuse to supply information on a taxable person identified for VAT purposes in the Member State of the requesting authority on the sole grounds that this information is held by a bank, other financial institution, nominee or person acting in an agency or fiduciary capacity or because it relates to ownership interests in a legal person.\n6.   The requested authority shall inform the requesting authority of the grounds for refusing a request for assistance.\n7.   A minimum threshold triggering a request for assistance may be adopted in accordance with the procedure provided for in Article 58(2).\nArticle 55\n1.   Information communicated or collected in any form pursuant to this Regulation, including any information to which an official has had access in the circumstances set out in Chapters VII, VIII and X, and in the cases referred to in paragraph 2 of this Article, shall be covered by the obligation of official secrecy and enjoy the protection extended to similar information under both the national law of the Member State which received it and the corresponding provisions applicable to Union authorities. Such information shall be used only in the circumstances provided for in this Regulation.\nSuch information may be used for the purpose of establishing the assessment base or the collection or administrative control of tax for the purpose of establishing the assessment base.\nThe information may also be used for the assessment of other levies, duties, and taxes covered by Article 2 of Council Directive 2008/55/EC of 26 May 2008 on mutual assistance for the recovery of claims relating to certain levies, duties, taxes and other measures (9).\nIn addition, it may be used in connection with judicial proceedings that may involve penalties, initiated as a result of infringements of tax law without prejudice to the general rules and legal provisions governing the rights of defendants and witnesses in such proceedings.\n2.   Persons duly accredited by the Security Accreditation Authority of the Commission may have access to this information only in so far as it is necessary for care, maintenance and development of the CCN/CSI network.\n3.   By way of derogation from paragraph 1, the competent authority of the Member State providing the information shall permit its use for other purposes in the Member State of the requesting authority, if, under the legislation of the Member State of the requested authority, the information can be used for similar purposes.\n4.   Where the requesting authority considers that information it has received from the requested authority is likely to be useful to the competent authority of a third Member State, it may transmit it to the latter authority. It shall inform the requested authority thereof in advance. The requested authority may require that the transmission of the information to a third party be subject to its prior agreement.\n5.   All storage or exchange of information referred to in this Regulation is subject to the provisions implementing Directive 95/46/EC. However, Member States shall, for the purpose of the correct application of this Regulation, restrict the scope of the obligations and rights provided for in Article 10, Article 11(1) and Articles 12 and 21 of Directive 95/46/EC to the extent required in order to safeguard the interests referred to in Article 13(1)(e) of that Directive.\nArticle 56\nReports, statements and any other documents, or certified true copies or extracts thereof, obtained by the staff of the requested authority and communicated to the requesting authority under the assistance provided for by this Regulation may be invoked as evidence by the competent bodies of the Member State of the requesting authority on the same basis as similar documents provided by another authority of that country.\nArticle 57\n1.   For the purpose of applying this Regulation, Member States shall take all necessary measures to:\n(a)\nensure effective internal coordination between the competent authorities;\n(b)\nestablish direct cooperation between the authorities authorised for the purposes of such coordination;\n(c)\nensure the smooth operation of the information exchange arrangements provided for in this Regulation.\n2.   The Commission shall communicate to each Member State, as quickly as possible, any information which it receives and which it is able to provide.\nCHAPTER XVI\nFINAL PROVISIONS\nArticle 58\n1.

"Administrative cooperation in the field of VAT\nAdministrative cooperation in the field of VAT\nSUMMARY OF:\nRegulation (EU) No 904/2010 on administrative cooperation and combating fraud in the field of value added tax\nWHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?\n              \nIt sets out procedures allowing EU countries’ authorities to work together and share information on value added tax (VAT) and to combat VAT fraud. It thus ensures that:\nVAT is assessed and applied correctly;\nVAT fraud is detected and prevented;\nVAT revenue is protected.\nKEY POINTS\nSingle central liaison office\nEU countries each designate a central liaison office as a contact point for the other EU countries and the European Commission. The office must keep a list of designated officials and liaison departments that can share information with their counterparts in other EU countries. Where officials or liaison departments receive a request or reply to a request to send information, they must inform their central liaison office.\nSharing information\nCountries share information using a standard form. Requested authorities must reply to requesting authorities within 3 months of receiving a request or within 1 month if they already have the information available.\nCertain information is shared automatically when:\ninformation from the EU country of origin is essential for the control system of the EU country of destination where taxation will take place;\nthere is reason to believe that there has been or will be a breach of VAT legislation in the EU country of destination;\nthere is a risk of tax loss in the EU country of destination.\nEU countries may also share information spontaneously and may request feedback from the countries with which it is shared.\nEU countries may refuse to provide information where:\nrequests for information within a specific period from the requesting authority impose a disproportionate burden;\nthe usual sources of information have not been exhausted by the requesting authority;\nit would lead to the disclosure of a commercial, industrial or professional secret or is against public policy.\nStoring information\nEach EU country must store the following up-to-date information in an electronic system for at least 5 years starting from the end of the first calendar year in which access to it is granted, by automated means, to the other EU countries:\ninformation provided in the recapitulative statements submitted by taxable persons identified for VAT purposes;\ndata on persons to whom the EU country has issued a VAT identification number;\ndata on VAT identification numbers that have become invalid;\ninformation on non-established taxable persons.\nRegulation (EU) 2020/283 introduces an amendment requiring the Commission to develop, maintain, host and technically manage a central electronic system of payment information (CESOP) for the purpose of investigations into suspected VAT fraud or to detect VAT fraud. CESOP will store the payment data collected by EU countries and aggregate it per beneficiary, as well as cross-check it with the other information exchanged under Regulation (EU) No 904/2010. Data in CESOP will only be made available to anti-fraud experts of EU countries. This will apply from 1 January 2024.\nDirective (EU) 2020/285 introduces simplified rules to reduce the administrative burden and compliance costs for small businesses and to create a more advantageous tax environment to help them grow and trade across borders more efficiently. Small businesses will be able to qualify for simplified VAT compliance rules where their annual turnover remains below a threshold set by the EU country concerned, which cannot be higher than €85,000. Under certain conditions, small businesses from other EU countries, which do not exceed this threshold, will also be able to benefit from the simplified scheme if their total annual turnover in the whole of the EU does not exceed €100,000. These new rules apply from 1 January 2025.\nVAT refunds\nEU countries forward the applications for VAT refunds they receive from taxable persons established in other EU countries to the authorities of the EU countries of refund concerned. This is done electronically within 15 days from the date of receipt of the application. The authorities of the EU countries of refund must notify the authorities of the other EU countries if:\nthey require additional electronically coded information on the nature and services of the applicants; or\nif they require the applicants to provide a description of their business activities by using harmonised codes.\nNon-EU countries\nProvided that the assistance arrangements with the non-EU country in question allow it, the competent authority of an EU country may forward information it receives from that country to any EU country that requests it or to any other EU country to which it may be of interest. EU countries’ authorities may forward information to non-EU countries if:\nthe EU country from where it originates consents;\nthe non-EU country in question has agreed to cooperate in gathering evidence of irregular transactions that may breach VAT legislation.\nFighting VAT fraud\nThe regulation establishes Eurofisc, a network of anti-fraud experts that allows EU countries to exchange early warnings on businesses suspected of being involved in VAT fraud.\nElectronic commerce\nAs part of a package of measures to modernise the EU’s VAT system and to adapt it to EU cross-border business and consumer e-commerce, Regulation (EU) 2017/2454 amends Regulation (EU) No 904/2010 by introducing rules that will increase administrative cooperation between EU countries. The 2017 amending regulation ensures that supplies of services and distance sales of goods under Directive (EU) 2017/2455 (which, in turn, amends Directives 2006/112/EC — see summary and 2009/132/EC — see summary) are covered. It applies from January 2021.\nAmong other things, the regulation requires that:\nthe identification number under which VAT is paid is provided in advance to allow customs authorities to check its validity when importing goods;\nrequests for records and administrative enquiries made by EU countries to taxable persons will be coordinated by the country of identification*.\nAt the beginning of 2020, the Commission adopted Implementing Regulation (EU) 2020/21, concerning administrative cooperation and combating fraud in the field of VAT, and Implementing Regulation (EU) 2020/194, laying down details on the working of the VAT one-stop shop for sales of online goods.\nBoth implementing regulations contribute to ensuring that VAT is paid in the EU country of the final consumer, leading to a fairer distribution of tax revenues amongst EU countries.\nDue to the COVID-19 crisis, these new VAT e-commerce rules will only apply as of 1 July 2021 instead of entering into force on 1 January 2021 (Implementing Regulation (EU) 2020/1318).\nThis will also allow all EU countries to finalise the necessary IT systems to implement and apply those changes.\nFROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?\n              \nIt has applied since 1 January 2012.\nBACKGROUND\n              \nFor more information, see:\nVAT and administrative cooperation (European Commission).\nKEY TERMS\n              \nCountry of identification: the country in which the taxable person is registered for using the mini one-stop shop* and where it declares and pays the VAT in the country (or countries) of consumption.\nMini one-stop shop: a system which, since 2015, has allowed taxable persons supplying services such as telecommunication, television and radio broadcasting and electronically supplied ones to non-taxable persons in EU countries in which they do not have an establishment to account for the VAT due on those supplies via a web portal in the EU country of identification.\nMAIN DOCUMENT\n            \nCouncil Regulation (EU) No 904/2010 of 7 October 2010 on administrative cooperation and combating fraud in the field of value added tax (OJ L 268, 12.10.2010, pp. 1-18)\nSuccessive amendments to Regulation (EU) No 904/2010 have been incorporated in the original text.
