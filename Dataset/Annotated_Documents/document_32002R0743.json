To that end, the Community must adopt, among others, measures in the field of judicial cooperation in civil matters necessary for the proper functioning of the internal market.(2) On 3 December 1998, the Council adopted an action plan of the Council and the Commission on how best to implement the provisions of the Treaty of Amsterdam on an area of freedom, security and justice (hereinafter the \"Vienna action plan\")(4).(3) The European Council meeting in Tampere on 15 and 16 October 1999 adopted the conclusions entitled \"Towards a union of freedom, security and justice: the Tampere milestones\".(4) On 30 November 2000, the Council adopted a joint programme of the Commission and the Council of measures for implementation of the principle of mutual recognition of decisions in civil and commercial matters(5).(5) Joint Action 96/636/JHA(6) established, for the period 1996 to 2000, a programme of incentives and exchanges for legal practitioners (Grotius).(6) By Regulation (EC) No 290/2001(7), the programme of incentives and exchanges for legal practitioners in the area of civil law (Grotius civil) was extended for a one-year transition period only, pending the outcome of a thorough analysis of how Community actions and support should be focused in the future.(7) Decision No 1496/98/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council(8) established an action programme to improve awareness of Community law within the legal professions (Robert Schuman project) for a period of three years.(8) A flexible and effective general Community framework for activities in the area of civil law is necessary if the ambitious objectives set by the Treaty, the Vienna action plan and the Tampere conclusions are to be realised.(9) The general Community framework for activities should provide for initiatives taken by the Commission, in compliance with the principle of subsidiarity, for actions in support of organisations promoting and facilitating judicial cooperation in civil matters, and for actions in support of specific projects.(10) A number of actions will be required for the further development of judicial cooperation in civil matters and should therefore be undertaken in the framework of a Community programme for activities. The planning and implementation of those actions will benefit from being grouped together in a general Community framework for activities.(11) The Commission's actions could include specific actions, such as studies, research, seminars, conferences, experts' meetings, publications, manuals, databases and/or websites, as well as measures to disseminate the results of projects co-financed under the general Community framework for activities.(12) A general Community framework for activities to improve mutual understanding of the legal and judicial systems of the Member States will contribute to lowering the barriers to judicial cooperation in civil matters, which will improve the functioning of the internal market.(13) Measures to ensure good use is made of Community instruments in the area of judicial cooperation in civil matters are necessary; they will be more effective if they are coordinated within a general Community framework for activities.(14) Since the objectives of the proposed action cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore, by reason of the European dimension necessary for achieving its objectives, the expected economies of scale and the cumulative effects of the actions envisaged, be better achieved by the Community, the Community may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives.(15) The participation in this general Community framework for activities of the candidate countries for accession to the European Union will provide a useful preparation for accession, in particular as regards these countries' ability to apply the Community acquis.(16) Certain principles must be laid down concerning the sanctions to be imposed where irregularities are noted or where obligations under grant agreements between the Commission and beneficiaries are not respected.(17) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Regulation should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission(9).(18) The annual work programme shall be adopted by the management committee procedure in order to ensure a measure of institutional balance, taking account in particular of the fact that the specific actions provided for in Article 3(1) are to be taken by the Commission.(19) The United Kingdom and Ireland, in accordance with Article 3 of the Protocol on the position of the United Kingdom and Ireland annexed to the Treaty on European Union and the Treaty establishing the European Community, have given notice of their wish to participate in the adoption and implementation of this Regulation.(20) Denmark, in accordance with Articles 1 and 2 of the Protocol on the position of Denmark annexed to the Treaty on European Union and the Treaty establishing the European Community, is not participating in the adoption of this Regulation, which is not binding on Denmark nor applicable to it,HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:CHAPTER IOBJECTIVES AND ACTIVITIESArticle 1Subject matter1.

Such activities include actions in support of organisations promoting and facilitating judicial cooperation in civil matters and actions in support of specific projects.\nACT\nCouncil Regulation (EC) No 743/2002 of 25 April 2002 establishing a general Community framework of activities to facilitate the implementation of judicial cooperation in civil matters.\nSUMMARY\nThis regulation aims to establish a general framework for Community activities for the period from 1 January 2002 to 31 December 2006 to facilitate judicial cooperation in civil matters. The European Commission put forward a proposal on 6 April 2005 to establish for the period 2007-13 the specific “Civil justice” programme as part of the general “Fundamental Rights and Justice” programme (see “related acts”).\nThis regulation is not applicable in Denmark. The United Kingdom and Ireland, on the other hand, expressed their wish to participate in the adoption and application of this regulation (in accordance with the Protocols on the position of the United Kingdom and Ireland annexed to the EU and EC Treaties).\nProviding grants, working towards the programme’s objectives\nThe programme’s objectives are to:\npromote judicial cooperation in civil matters with a view to ensuring legal certainty and improving access to justice;\nimprove mutual knowledge of legal and judicial systems between European Union (EU) countries;\nensure the sound implementation and application of Community instruments in the area of judicial cooperation in civil matters;\nimprove information to the public on access to justice, judicial cooperation and the legal systems of EU countries.\nAs regards the activities supported, the general framework is to provide:\ngrants for co-financed projects that meet at least one of the objectives;\ngrants to cover the running costs of European non-governmental organisations;\nfunding for actions set up by the Commission of its own motion.\nProviding grants for private and public institutions\nThis regulation provides for grants for the activities of non-governmental organisations and for specific projects submitted by institutions and public or private organisations.\nNon-governmental organisations may be granted financial support if they meet specified criteria:\nthey must be non-profit-making organisations, established under the law of one of the EU countries;\nthey must pursue activities with a European dimension, involving, as a general rule, at least half of the EU countries;\nthey must pursue activities with a view to promoting judicial cooperation in civil matters.\nSpecific projects may be submitted by institutions and public or private organisations, including professional organisations, research institutes, etc. They must consist of training, exchanges and work experience placements, studies and research, meetings and seminars or dissemination of information.\nArticle 4 of the regulation provides for this general framework to be opened up to include the participation of the candidate countries of central and eastern Europe, Cyprus, Malta and Turkey, and other countries, subject to various conditions and if the relevant agreements and procedures permit. This article is no longer applicable to the ten new EU countries that joined the Union on 1 May 2004.\nEnsuring implementation of the Community activity framework\nTo ensure implementation of the framework for activities, the Commission, if possible before 30 June each year, is to publish an annual work programme setting out the priorities in terms of objectives and types of activities for the following year.\nThe Commission is responsible for the evaluation and selection of projects, having regard to a series of priority criteria (the European dimension, ability to contribute to the objectives set, complementarity with other activities, etc.).\nAll financing decisions are subject to financial control by the Commission and to audits by the Court of Auditors. The proportion of financial support from the general budget of the EU should in principle not exceed 60% of the total cost of the actions undertaken. However, under exceptional circumstances, financial support may amount to 80%.\nThe Commission is to ensure the yearly publication of a list of recipients and actions financed to ensure transparency. Recipients are to report to the Commission on each action. The Commission may reduce, suspend or recover financial support granted for an activity if it detects irregularities.\nReferences\nAct\nEntry into force\nDeadline for transposition in the Member States\nOfficial Journal\nRegulation (EC) No 743/2002\n1.5.2002\n-\nOJ L 115 of 1.5.2002\nRELATED ACTS\nDecision No 1149/2007/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 September 2007 establishing for the period 2007-2013 the Specific Programme “Civil Justice” as part of the General Programme “Fundamental Rights and Justice” [Official Journal L 257 of 3.10.2007].\nReport from the Commission to the European Parliament and the Council of 9 February 2005 on the implementation of the framework programme for judicial cooperation in civil matters (2002-2006) [COM(2005) 34 – Not published in the Official Journal].\n               This report documents the programme’s progress from its adoption in 2002 to 30 June 2004. The Commission’s actions, which aimed to inform legal practitioners and the general public of progress made in the field of cooperation in civil matters (e.g. the European Judicial Atlas in Civil Matters, the case-law database under the “Brussels I” and “Brussels II” and an information campaign aimed at legal practitioners), have been very well received. However, the 2002, 2003 and 2004 calls for proposals for specific civil-society projects attracted a limited amount of interest, probably owing to the available budget. 51 of the 106 proposals were accepted.\nLast updated: 18.08.2010", "tags": ["approximation of laws", "civil law", "access to the courts", "judicial cooperation in criminal matters in the EU"], "subjects": ["Justice and home affairs"], "split": "train", "reference_annotations": {}, "summary_annotations": {}}
