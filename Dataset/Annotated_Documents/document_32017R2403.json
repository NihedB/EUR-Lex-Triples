{"celex_id": "32017R2403", "reference": "28.12.2017\nEN\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\nL 347/81\nREGULATION (EU) 2017/2403 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL\nof 12 December 2017\non the sustainable management of external fishing fleets, and repealing Council Regulation (EC) No 1006/2008\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 43(2) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee (1),\nActing in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure (2),\nWhereas:\n(1)\nCouncil Regulation (EC) No 1006/2008 (3) (the ‘FAR’) established a system concerning authorisations for fishing activities of Union fishing vessels outside Union waters and the access of third-country vessels to Union waters.\n(2)\nThe Union is a contracting party to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea of 10 December 1982 (4) (UNCLOS) and has ratified the United Nations Agreement of 4 August 1995 on the implementation of the provisions of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea relating to the conservation and management of straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks (5). Those international provisions set out the principle that all states have to adopt appropriate measures to ensure the sustainable management and conservation of marine resources and to cooperate with each other to that end.\n(3)\nThe Union has accepted the Agreement to promote compliance with international conservation and management measures by fishing vessels on the high seas of 24 November 1993 of the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations (6). That Agreement stipulates that a contracting party is to abstain from granting authorisation to use a vessel for fishing on the high seas if certain conditions are not met, as well as implement sanctions if certain reporting obligations are not fulfilled.\n(4)\nThe Union has endorsed the FAO International Plan of Action to prevent, deter and eliminate illegal, unreported and undeclared fishing (‘IPOA-IUU’) adopted in 2001. The IPOA-IUU and the FAO Voluntary Guidelines for flag state performance endorsed in 2014 underline the responsibility of the flag state to ensure the long-term conservation and sustainable use of living marine resources and marine ecosystems. The IPOA-IUU provides that a flag state should issue authorisations to fish in waters outside its sovereignty or jurisdiction to vessels flying its flag. Those Voluntary Guidelines also recommend that an authorisation be given by the flag state and by the coastal state when the fishing activities take place under a fisheries access agreement or even outside such an agreement. They should both be satisfied that such activities will not undermine the sustainability of the stocks in the coastal state’s waters.\n(5)\nIn 2014, all members of the FAO, including the Union and its developing country partners, unanimously adopted the Voluntary Guidelines on Securing Sustainable Small-scale Fisheries in the Context of Food Security and Poverty Eradication. Point 5.7 of those Guidelines highlights that small-scale fisheries should be given due consideration before agreements on resource access are entered into with third countries and third parties. Those Guidelines call for the adoption of measures for the long-term conservation and sustainable use of fisheries resources and for the securing of the ecological foundation for food production, underlining the importance of environmental standards for fishing activities outside Union waters that include an ecosystem-based approach to fisheries management together with the precautionary approach.\n(6)\nIf there is evidence that the conditions on the basis of which a fishing authorisation has been issued are no longer met, the flag Member State should take appropriate action, including amending or withdrawing the authorisation and, if necessary, imposing effective, proportionate and dissuasive sanctions. In fisheries under a regional fisheries management organisation (‘RFMO’) or a Sustainable Fisheries Partnership Agreement (‘SFPA’), if a Union fishing vessel does not comply with the conditions for a fishing authorisation and the Member State fails to take appropriate action to remedy the situation, even after having been required to do so by the Commission, the Commission should conclude that no appropriate action has been taken. Consequently, the Commission should take additional action to make sure that the vessel concerned should no longer fish as long as the conditions are not met.\n(7)\nThe Union committed itself at the United Nations Summit on Sustainable Development on 25 September 2015 to implementing the resolution containing the outcome document entitled ‘Transforming our world: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development’, including Sustainable Development Goal 14 which is to ‘conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development’, as well as Sustainable Development Goal 12 which is to ‘ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns’ and their targets.\n(8)\nThe objective of the common fisheries policy (CFP), as set out in Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council (7) (the ‘Basic Regulation’), is to ensure that fishing activities are environmentally, economically and socially sustainable and are managed consistently with the objectives of achieving economic, social and employment benefits, and of restoring and maintaining fish stocks above levels which can produce maximum sustainable yield and that they are contributing to the availability of food supplies. It is also necessary, in implementing this policy, to take account of development cooperation objectives in accordance with the second subparagraph of Article 208(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (‘TFEU’).\n(9)\nThe Basic Regulation also requires that SFPAs be limited to surplus catches as referred to in Article 62(2) and (3) of UNCLOS.\n(10)\nThe Basic Regulation stresses the need to promote the objectives of the CFP internationally, ensuring that Union fishing activities outside Union waters are based on the same principles and standards as those applicable under Union law, while promoting a level playing field for Union operators and third-country operators.\n(11)\nThe FAR was intended to establish common ground for authorising fishing activities to be carried out by Union vessels outside Union waters with a view to supporting the fight against illegal, unreported and undeclared (‘IUU’) fishing and better control and monitoring of the Union fleet across the globe, as well as conditions for the authorising of third-country vessels fishing in Union waters.\n(12)\nCouncil Regulation (EC) No 1005/2008 (8) (the ‘IUU Regulation’) was adopted in parallel to the FAR, and Council Regulation (EC) No 1224/2009 (9) (‘the Control Regulation’) was adopted a year later. Those Regulations are the three implementing pillars of the control and enforcement provisions of the CFP.\n(13)\nHowever, the IUU Regulation, the FAR and the Control Regulation were not implemented consistently; in particular there were inconsistencies between the FAR and the Control Regulation. The implementation of the FAR also revealed several loopholes, since some challenges in terms of control, such as chartering, reflagging and the issuance of fishing authorisations issued by a third-country competent authority to a Union fishing vessel outside the framework of an SFPA (‘direct authorisations’), were not covered. Besides, some reporting obligations have proven difficult as has the division of administrative roles between the Member States and the Commission.\n(14)\nThe core principle of this Regulation is that any Union vessel fishing outside Union waters should be authorised by its flag Member State and monitored accordingly, irrespective of where it operates and the framework under which it does so. The issuing of an authorisation should be dependent on a basic set of common eligibility criteria being fulfilled. The information gathered by the Member States and provided to the Commission should allow the Commission to intervene in the monitoring of the fishing operations of all Union fishing vessels in any given area outside Union waters at any time.\n(15)\nRecent years have seen considerable improvements in the Union’s external fisheries policy, in terms of the conditions and terms of SFPAs and the diligence with which the provisions are enforced. Safeguarding the Union’s interests in terms of access rights and conditions within the framework of SFPAs should therefore be a priority objective of the Union’s external fisheries policy and similar conditions should be applied to Union activities outside the scope of SFPAs.\n(16)\nSupport vessels may have a substantial impact on the way fishing vessels are able to carry out their fishing operations and on the quantity of fish they can retrieve. It is therefore necessary to take them into account in the authorisation and reporting processes set out in this Regulation.\n(17)\nReflagging operations become an issue when their objective is to circumvent CFP rules or existing conservation and management measures. The Union should therefore be able to define, detect and hamper such operations. Traceability and proper follow-up of compliance history should be ensured throughout the lifespan of a vessel owned by a Union operator regardless of the flag or flags it operates under. The requirement that a unique vessel number be granted by the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) where required under Union law should also serve that purpose.\n(18)\nIn third-country waters, Union vessels may operate either under the provisions of SFPAs concluded between the Union and third countries or by obtaining direct fishing authorisations from third countries if no SFPA is in force. In both cases these activities should be carried out in a transparent and sustainable way. Flag Member States may authorise the vessels flying their flag to seek and obtain direct authorisations from third countries which are coastal states, under a defined set of criteria and subject to monitoring. The fishing operation should be authorised once the flag Member State is satisfied that it will not undermine sustainability and where the Commission has no duly justified objection. The operator should be allowed to starts its fishing operation only after having been given the authorisation from both the flag Member State and the coastal state.\n(19)\nUnion fishing vessels are not allowed to fish in waters under the jurisdiction or sovereignty of third countries with which the Union has an agreement but no protocol in force. In the case of such an agreement, where no protocol has been in force for at least 3 years, the Commission should examine the reasons for the situation and take appropriate action, which could include proposing to negotiate a new protocol.\n(20)\nA specific issue pertaining to SFPAs is the reallocation of underutilised fishing opportunities that occurs when fishing opportunities allocated to Member States by the relevant Council Regulations are not fully used. Since the access costs set out in the SFPAs are financed for a large part by the Union general budget, a temporary reallocation and sub-allocation system is important to preserve Union financial interests and ensure that no fishing opportunity which has been paid for is wasted. It is therefore necessary to clarify and improve those allocation systems, which should be a last resort mechanism. Its application should be temporary and it should not affect the initial allocation of fishing opportunities among Member States in accordance with applicable relative stability principles. Reallocation should only occur once the relevant Member States have given up on their rights to exchange fishing opportunities among themselves, and should primarily be addressed in the context of SFPAs giving access to mixed fisheries.\n(21)\nWhere a third country is not party to an RFMO, the Union may endeavour to provide, with the third country with which an SFPA is being considered, for the allocation of a proportion of the sectoral support funding to facilitate the joining of that RFMO by the third country concerned.\n(22)\nFishing operations under the auspices of RFMOs and on the high seas should also be authorised by the flag Member State and comply with RFMO-specific rules or Union law governing fishing operations on the high seas.\n(23)\nIn order to implement the Union’s international commitments in RFMOs and in accordance with the objectives referred to in Article 28 of the Basic Regulation, the Union should encourage periodic assessments of performance by independent bodies, and should play an active role in setting up and reinforcing implementation committees in all RFMOs to which it is a contracting party. It should in particular ensure that those implementation committees perform general supervision of the implementation of the external fisheries policy and of the measures decided within RFMOs.\n(24)\nEffective management of chartering arrangements is important to ensure that the effectiveness of conservation and management measures is not undermined, as well as to ensure the sustainable exploitation of living marine resources. It is therefore necessary to set out a legal framework that helps the Union to better monitor the activities of Union fishing vessels chartered by either a third country or by Union operators on the basis of what has been adopted by the relevant RFMO.\n(25)\nTranshipments at sea escape any proper control by flag or coastal states and therefore constitute a possible way for operators to carry illegal catch. Transhipments by Union vessels on the high sea and under direct authorisations should be subject to prior notification when conducted outside port. Member States should inform the Commission on all transhipment operations carried out by their vessels, once a year.\n(26)\nProcedures should be transparent and predictable for Union and third-country operators, as well as for their respective competent authorities.\n(27)\nThe exchange of data in electronic form between Member States and the Commission, as provided for by the Control Regulation, should be ensured. Member States should collect all requested data about their fleets and their fishing operations, manage those data and make them available to the Commission. Moreover, they should cooperate with each other, the Commission and third countries where relevant in order to coordinate those data collection activities.\n(28)\nWith a view to improving the transparency and accessibility of information on Union fishing authorisations, the Commission should set up an electronic fishing authorisation database comprising both a public part and a secure part. Information in the Union fishing authorisation database includes personal data. The processing of personal data based on this Regulation should comply with Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council (10), Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (11) and applicable national law.\n(29)\nWith a view to properly addressing access to Union waters of fishing vessels flying the flag of a third country, the relevant rules should be consistent with those applicable to Union fishing vessels, in accordance with the Control Regulation. In particular, Article 33 of that Regulation on the reporting of catch and catch-related data should also apply to third-country vessels fishing in Union waters.\n(30)\nFishing vessels from third countries without authorisation under this Regulation should, when navigating in Union waters, be obliged to ensure that their fishing gear is installed in such a manner that it is not readily usable for fishing operations.\n(31)\nMember States should be responsible for controlling the fishing operations of third-country vessels in Union waters and, in the event of infringements, for recording them in the national register provided for in Article 93 of the Control Regulation.\n(32)\nThird-country fishing vessels fishing under agreements on exchange or joint management should respect the quotas allocated to them by their own flag states in Union waters. When third countries’ vessels overfish the quotas allocated to them for stocks in Union waters, the Commission should operate deductions from the quotas allocated to those third countries in subsequent years. In those cases, the deduction of quotas to be operated by the Commission in the case of overfishing is to be understood as the input that the Commission provides in the framework of the consultation with coastal states.\n(33)\nIn order to simplify authorisation procedures, a common system of data exchange and data storage should be used by the Member States and the Commission to provide necessary information and updates while minimising administrative burden.\n(34)\nIn order to take into account technological progress and subsequent possible new international law requirements, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 TFEU should be delegated to the Commission in respect of the adoption of modifications to the Annex to this Regulation setting out the list of information to be provided by an operator in order to obtain a fishing authorisation, and in respect of supplementing the conditions for fishing authorisations in Article 10 to the extent necessary to reflect in Union law the outcome of the consultations between the Union and third countries with which the Union has concluded an agreement, or of arrangements with coastal states with which fish stocks are shared. It is of particular importance that the Commission carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level, and that those consultations be conducted in accordance with the principles laid down in the Interinstitutional Agreement of 13 April 2016 on Better Law-Making (12). In particular, to ensure equal participation in the preparation of delegated acts, the European Parliament and the Council receive all documents at the same time as Member States’ experts, and their experts systematically have access to meetings of Commission expert groups dealing with the preparation of delegated acts.\n(35)\nIn order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of this Regulation, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission in respect of the recording, format and the transmission of data related to fishing authorisations from the Member States to the Commission and to the Union fishing authorisation database, as well as for deciding on the temporary reallocation of unused fishing opportunities under existing protocols to SFPAs as a transitional measure corresponding to the provisions of Article 10 of the FAR. Those powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council (13).\n(36)\nIn order to make the Union fishing authorisation database operational and to enable Member States to meet the technical transmission requirements, the Commission should provide technical assistance to the Member States concerned to enable them to transfer data electronically. Member States may also draw on financial aid from the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund pursuant to point (a) of Article 76(2) of Regulation (EU) No 508/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council (14).\n(37)\nBy reason of the number and importance of the amendments to be made, the FAR should be repealed,\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nTITLE I\nGENERAL PROVISIONS\nArticle 1\nSubject matter\nThis Regulation sets out rules for issuing and managing fishing authorisations for:\n(a)\nUnion fishing vessels conducting fishing operations in waters under the sovereignty or jurisdiction of a third country, under the auspices of an RFMO to which the Union is a contracting party, in or outside Union waters, or on the high seas; and\n(b)\nthird-country fishing vessels conducting fishing operations in Union waters.\nArticle 2\nRelationship to international and Union law\nThis Regulation shall apply without prejudice to the provisions:\n(a)\nin SFPAs and other fisheries agreements concluded between the Union and third countries;\n(b)\nadopted by RFMOs to which the Union is a contracting party;\n(c)\nin Union law implementing or transposing provisions referred to in points (a) and (b).\nArticle 3\nDefinitions\n1.   For the purpose of this Regulation, the definitions set out in Article 4 of the Basic Regulation and in points 1 to 4, 15, 16 and 22 of Article 2 of the IUU Regulation shall apply, save as otherwise provided for in this Regulation.\n2.   For the purpose of this Regulation, the following definitions also apply:\n(a)\n‘support vessel’ means a vessel other than a craft carried on board that is not equipped with operational fishing gear designed to catch or attract fish and that facilitates, assists or prepares fishing operations;\n(b)\n‘fishing authorisation’ means, in respect of a Union fishing vessel, an authorisation:\n—\nwithin the meaning of point 10 of Article 4 of the Control Regulation,\n—\nissued by a third country entitling a Union fishing vessel to carry out specific fishing operations in the waters under the sovereignty or jurisdiction of that third country, during a specified period, in a given area or for a given fishery under specific conditions,\nand, in respect of a third-country fishing vessel, an authorisation entitling it to carry out in Union waters specific fishing operations during a specified period, in a given area or for a given fishery under specific conditions;\n(c)\n‘direct authorisation’ means a fishing authorisation issued by a third-country competent authority to a Union fishing vessel outside the framework of an SFPA or of an agreement on exchange of fishing opportunities and joint management of species of common interest;\n(d)\n‘third-country waters’ means waters under the sovereignty or jurisdiction of a third country. The waters of a Member State that are not Union waters are considered as third-country waters for the purpose of this Regulation;\n(e)\n‘observer programme’ means a scheme under the auspices of an RFMO, an SFPA, a third country or a Member State that provides observers on board fishing vessels including, where specifically provided for in the applicable observer scheme, to verify the vessel’s compliance with the rules adopted by that RFMO or that third country, or under that SFPA;\n(f)\n‘chartering’ means an arrangement by which a fishing vessel flying the flag of a Member State is contracted for a defined period by an operator in either another Member State or a third country without a change of flag;\n(g)\n‘fishing operation’ means all activities in connection with searching for fish, the shooting, towing and hauling of active gears, setting, soaking, removing or resetting of passive gears and the removal of any catch from the gear, keep nets, or from a transport cage to fattening and farming cages.\nTITLE II\nFISHING OPERATIONS BY UNION FISHING VESSELS OUTSIDE UNION WATERS\nCHAPTER I\nCommon provisions\nArticle 4\nGeneral principle\nWithout prejudice to the requirement to obtain an authorisation from the competent organisation or third country, a Union fishing vessel shall not carry out fishing operations outside Union waters unless it has been authorised by its flag Member State, and the fishing operations are indicated in a valid fishing authorisation issued in accordance with Chapters II to V, as appropriate.\nArticle 5\nEligibility criteria\n1.   A flag Member State may only issue a fishing authorisation for fishing operations outside Union waters if:\n(a)\nit has received complete and accurate information, in accordance with the requirements of the Annex or the SFPA concerned or RFMO concerned, about the fishing vessel and the associated support vessel(s), including non-Union support vessels;\n(b)\nthe fishing vessel has a valid fishing licence under Article 6 of the Control Regulation;\n(c)\nthe fishing vessel and any associated support vessel apply the relevant IMO ship identification number scheme insofar as is required under Union law;\n(d)\nthe fishing vessel is not included in an IUU vessel list adopted by an RFMO and/or by the Union pursuant to the IUU Regulation;\n(e)\nwhere applicable, fishing opportunities are available to the flag Member State under the fisheries agreement concerned or the relevant provisions of the RFMO; and\n(f)\nwhere applicable, the fishing vessel complies with the requirements set out in Article 6.\n2.   The Commission is empowered to adopt delegated acts, in accordance with Article 44, for the purpose of amending the Annex to ensure appropriate monitoring of the activities of fishing vessels under this Regulation, in particular through new data requirements resulting from fisheries agreements or the development of information technologies.\nArticle 6\nReflagging operations\n1.   This Article applies to vessels that, during the 5 years preceding the application for a fishing authorisation, have:\n(a)\nleft the Union fishing fleet register and been reflagged in a third country; and\n(b)\nsubsequently returned to the Union fishing fleet register.\n2.   A flag Member State may only issue a fishing authorisation if it has verified that, during the period that the vessel referred to in paragraph 1 operated under a third-country flag, it did not:\n(a)\nengage in IUU fishing;\n(b)\noperate in waters of a third country identified as a country allowing non-sustainable fishing pursuant to point (a) of Article 4(1) of Regulation (EU) No 1026/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council (15);\n(c)\noperate in waters of a third country listed as non-cooperating pursuant to Article 33 of the IUU Regulation; and\n(d)\noperate in waters of a third country identified as non-cooperating in fighting IUU fishing pursuant to Article 31 of the IUU Regulation after a period of 6 weeks following the adoption of the decision of the Commission identifying that third country as such, except for any operations carried out in the event that the Council has rejected a proposal to designate that third country as non-cooperating pursuant to Article 33 of that Regulation.\n3.   To that end, an operator shall provide the following information related to the period during which the vessel operated under a third-country flag required by a flag Member State:\n(a)\na declaration of catches and fishing effort during the relevant period as required by the third-country flag state;\n(b)\na copy of any fishing authorisations permitting fishing operations during the relevant period;\n(c)\nan official statement by the third country where the vessel was reflagged listing the sanctions the vessel or the operator had been subject to during the relevant period;\n(d)\ncomplete flag history during the period when the vessel had left the Union fleet register.\n4.   A flag Member State shall not issue a fishing authorisation to a vessel that has been reflagged in a third country:\n(a)\nlisted as non-cooperating in fighting IUU fishing pursuant to Article 33 of the IUU Regulation;\n(b)\nidentified as non-cooperating in fighting IUU fishing pursuant to Article 31 of the IUU Regulation after a period of 6 weeks following the adoption of the decision of the Commission identifying that third country as such, except for any operations carried out in the event that the Council has rejected a proposal to designate that third country as non-cooperating pursuant to Article 33 of that Regulation; or\n(c)\nidentified as allowing non-sustainable fishing pursuant to point (a) of Article 4(1) of Regulation (EU) No 1026/2012.\n5.   Paragraph 4 shall not apply if the flag Member State is satisfied that, as soon as the circumstances described in points (b) to (d) of paragraph 2 or points (a) to (c) of paragraph 4 became applicable, the operator:\n(a)\nceased fishing operations; and\n(b)\nimmediately started the relevant administrative procedures to remove the vessel from the fishing fleet register of the third country.\nArticle 7\nManagement of fishing authorisations\n1.   When applying for a fishing authorisation, an operator shall provide the flag Member State with complete and accurate data.\n2.   An operator shall immediately inform the flag Member State of any change to the related data.\n3.   A flag Member State shall on a regular basis monitor whether the conditions on the basis of which a fishing authorisation has been issued continue to be met during the period of validity of that authorisation.\n4.   If, as a result of the final outcome of the monitoring activities referred to in paragraph 3, there is evidence that the conditions on the basis of which a fishing authorisation has been issued are no longer met, the flag Member State shall take appropriate action, including amending or withdrawing the authorisation and, if necessary, imposing sanctions. The sanctions applied by the flag Member State in respect of infringements shall be sufficiently stringent to ensure effective compliance with the rules, to prevent infringements and to deprive offenders of the benefits derived from infringements. The flag Member State shall immediately notify the operator and the Commission thereof. Where relevant, the Commission shall notify the secretariat of the RFMO or the third country concerned accordingly.\n5.   Upon a reasoned request from the Commission, a flag Member State shall take appropriate action as provided for in paragraph 4, in the event of contravention of conservation and management measures of marine biological resources adopted by an RFMO to which the Union is a contracting party, or under SFPAs.\n6.   Where the Union is a contracting party to an RFMO and a Union fishing vessel does not comply with the conditions set out in point (b) of Article 21 as established in the final inspection report recognised by the RFMO, and where the flag Member State fails to take the appropriate action as provided for in paragraph 4 of this Article, the Commission may by decision require the flag Member State concerned to ensure that the Union fishing vessel concerned fulfils those conditions.\nWhere the flag Member State concerned has not taken appropriate action to comply with the Commission decision referred to in the first subparagraph within a period of 15 days, the Commission shall send the updated details of the fishing vessels referred to in Article 22 to the Secretariat of the RFMO to address the vessel concerned. The Commission shall inform the flag Member State of its action. The flag Member State shall notify the operator of the action of the Commission.\n7.   Where the Union has concluded an SFPA with a third country and a Union fishing vessel does not comply with the conditions set out in point (b) of Article 10 as established in the final inspection report recognised by the competent authorities, and where the flag Member State fails to take the appropriate action as provided for in paragraph 4 of this Article, the Commission may by decision require the flag Member State concerned to ensure that the Union fishing vessel concerned fulfils those conditions.\nWhere the flag Member State concerned has not taken appropriate action to comply with the Commission decision referred to in the first subparagraph within a period of 15 days, the Commission shall send the updated details of the fishing vessels to the third country to address the Union fishing vessel concerned. The Commission shall inform the flag Member State of its action. The flag Member State shall notify the operator of the action of the Commission.\nCHAPTER II\nFishing operations by Union fishing vessels in third-country waters\nSection 1\nFishing operations under sfpas\nArticle 8\nScope\nThis Section shall apply to fishing operations carried out by Union fishing vessels in third-country waters under an SFPA.\nArticle 9\nRFMO membership\nA Union fishing vessel may only carry out fishing operations in waters of a third country on stocks managed by an RFMO if that third country is a contracting party to that RFMO.\nArticle 10\nConditions for fishing authorisations by the flag Member State\nA flag Member State may only issue a fishing authorisation for fishing operations carried out in third-country waters under an SFPA if:\n(a)\nthe eligibility criteria set out in Article 5 are fulfilled;\n(b)\nthe conditions set out in the relevant SFPA are complied with;\n(c)\nthe operator has paid all fees due under the relevant agreements, and where applicable, related financial sanctions established by a judicial or administrative decision having final and binding effect; and\n(d)\nthe fishing vessel has a valid fishing authorisation issued by the third country with sovereignty or jurisdiction over the waters where the fishing operations take place.\nArticle 11\nProcedure for obtaining fishing authorisations of the third country\n1.   For the purpose of point (d) of Article 10, a flag Member State that has verified that the conditions set out in points (a) to (c) of Article 10 are complied with shall send to the Commission the corresponding application for the authorisation of the third country.\n2.   The application referred to in paragraph 1 shall contain the information required under the SFPA.\n3.   The flag Member State shall send the application to the Commission at least 10 calendar days before the deadline for the transmission of applications laid down in the SFPA. The Commission may send a duly justified request to the flag Member State for any additional information necessary for verifying the conditions.\n4.   Upon receipt of the application or any additional information requested pursuant to paragraph 3 of this Article, the Commission shall conduct a preliminary examination to determine whether the conditions set out in points (a) to (c) of Article 10 are met. The Commission shall then:\n(a)\nsend the application to the third country without delay and, in any event, before the expiry of the deadline for the transmission of applications laid down in the SFPA, provided that the deadline set out in paragraph 3 of this Article has been met; or\n(b)\nnotify the Member State that the application is refused.\n5.   If a third country informs the Commission that it has decided to issue, refuse, suspend or withdraw a fishing authorisation for a Union fishing vessel under the agreement, the Commission shall immediately inform the flag Member State accordingly, if possible by electronic means.\nArticle 12\nTemporary reallocation of unused fishing opportunities in the framework of SFPAs\n1.   During a specific year or any other relevant period of the implementation of a protocol to an SFPA taking into account validity periods of the fishing authorisations and fishing seasons, the Commission may identify unused fishing opportunities and inform Member States benefiting from the corresponding shares of the allocation accordingly.\n2.   Within 10 calendar days of receipt of this information from the Commission, the Member States referred to in paragraph 1 may:\n(a)\ninform the Commission that they will use their fishing opportunities later in the relevant period of implementation by providing a fishing plan with detailed information on the number of fishing authorisations requested, the estimated catches, area and period of fishing; or\n(b)\nnotify the Commission of the use of their fishing opportunities through exchanges of fishing opportunities, pursuant to Article 16(8) of the Basic Regulation.\n3.   If certain Member States have not informed the Commission of one of the actions referred to in paragraph 2, or have informed it of a partial use of their fishing opportunities only, and, if as a result, fishing opportunities remain unused, the Commission may launch a call for interest for the available unused fishing opportunities among the other Member States benefiting from a share of the allocation. The Commission shall at the same time inform all Member States of the launch of the call for interest.\n4.   Within 10 calendar days of receipt of the call for interest referred to in paragraph 3, Member States benefiting from a share of the allocation may communicate their interest in the available unused fishing opportunities to the Commission. In support for their request, they shall provide a fishing plan with detailed information on the number of fishing authorisations requested, the estimated catches, area and period of fishing.\n5.   If deemed necessary for the assessment of the request, the Commission may ask the Member States concerned for additional information.\n6.   In the absence of interest in the total amount of the available unused fishing opportunities by the Member States benefiting from a share of the allocation at the end of the 10-day period referred to in paragraph 4, the Commission may extend the call for interest to all Member States. A Member State may communicate its interest in the unused fishing opportunities under the conditions referred to in that paragraph.\n7.   On the basis of the information provided by Member States in accordance with paragraph 4 or 6 of this Article, the unused fishing opportunities shall be reallocated by the Council in accordance with Article 43(3) TFEU, solely on a temporary basis for the relevant period of time referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article.\nThe Commission shall inform the Member States of the Member States to which the reallocation has been made and the quantities reallocated.\n8.   The temporary reallocation of fishing opportunities shall be based on transparent and objective criteria including, where applicable, those of an environmental, social and economic nature. Those criteria may include:\n(a)\nthe fishing opportunities available for reallocation;\n(b)\nthe number of requesting Member States;\n(c)\nthe share assigned to each requesting Member State in the initial allocation of fishing opportunities;\n(d)\nthe historic catch and effort levels of each requesting Member State, where applicable;\n(e)\nthe viability of the fishing plans provided by the requesting Member States, in light of the number, type and characteristics of vessels and gear used.\nArticle 13\nSub-allocation of a yearly quota broken down into several successive catch limits\n1.   Where a protocol to an SFPA sets monthly or quarterly catch limits or other subdivisions of the fishing opportunities available for the relevant year, and where the fishing opportunities allocated are not all used during the same monthly, quarterly or otherwise applicable period of time, the corresponding available fishing opportunities shall be sub-allocated by the Council in accordance with Article 43(3) TFEU among the Member States concerned for the relevant periods of time.\n2.   The sub-allocation of the available fishing opportunities shall be carried out using transparent and objective criteria.

From the date of the notification referred to in paragraph 1, the fishing authorisations issued to vessels flying the flag of that third country concerned shall be considered to be suspended for the fishing operations concerned and the vessels shall no longer be authorised to engage in those fishing operations.\n3.   Fishing authorisations shall be considered to be withdrawn where a suspension of fishing authorisations in accordance with paragraph 2 concerns all the operations for which they have been granted.\n4.   The third country shall ensure that the fishing vessels concerned are informed immediately of the application of this Article and that they cease all fishing operations concerned. The third country shall also inform the Commission without delay when fishing vessels flying its flag have ceased their fishing operations.\nArticle 37\nOverfishing of quotas in Union waters\n1.   When the Commission establishes that a third country has exceeded the quotas it has been allocated for a stock or group of stocks, the Commission shall operate deductions from the quotas allocated to that country for that stock or group of stocks in subsequent years. The Commission shall endeavour to ensure that the amount of the deduction is consistent with deductions imposed on Member States in similar circumstances.\n2.   If a deduction in accordance with paragraph 1 cannot be made on the quota for a stock or group of stocks that was overfished as such because that quota for a stock or group of stocks is not sufficiently available to the third country concerned, the Commission may, after consultation with the third country concerned, operate from quotas in subsequent years for other stocks or groups of stocks available to that third country in the same geographical area, or to the corresponding commercial value.\nArticle 38\nControl and enforcement\n1.   A third-country vessel authorised to fish in Union waters shall comply with the control rules governing the fishing operations of Union vessels in the fishing area in which it operates.\n2.

fleets\nSustainable management of external fishing fleets\nSUMMARY OF:\nRegulation (EU) 2017/2403 — sustainable management of external fishing fleets\nWHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?\nIt strengthens controls on fishing activities, mostly through authorisations for EU vessels fishing outside EU waters.\nIt implements some of the EU flag state authorisations, derived from EU bilateral fisheries agreements and regional fisheries management organisations.\nIt also reinforces the objectives of the common fisheries policy with regard to sustainable fisheries, control and EU rules on tackling illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing.\nKEY POINTS\nFishing authorisations\nAn EU vessel fishing outside EU waters requires an authorisation by the EU country in which it is registered (‘flag state’). This authorisation is based on a set of common eligibility criteria including:\nadministrative information on the vessel, its owner and the master;\na unique vessel identification number from the International Maritime Organization (IMO) where this is required by EU law;\nvalid fishing licence;\nproof that the vessel is not included in an illegal fishing (IUU) vessel list adopted by a regional fisheries management organisation and/or by the EU.\nThroughout the period of validity, the flag state concerned must regularly monitor whether the vessel is continuing to meet the conditions of the authorisation.\nIt must ensure that the activities are carried out in waters of a foreign Coastal State with the authorisation of that Coastal State, and after a scientific evaluation has been carried out and validated, verifying the sustainability of the fishing operations.\nThe EU vessels should fish on the surplus determined by the foreign Coastal State, or for migratory species, respect the rules set for these species at regional level.\nReflagging operations\nA vessel that has left the EU register to be re-registered in a non-EU country during the 5 years prior to the application for an authorisation — and that has subsequently returned to the EU register — would only receive the authorisation if the EU country concerned has checked that the vessel neither engaged in IUU activities, nor operated in either a non-cooperating country or a third country identified as allowing non-sustainable fishing.\nPublic register\nAn EU electronic fishing authorisation register will be set up with a part of it being accessible to the public. The public part will contain information on the name of the vessel, IMO number, target species and fishing zone.\nThe EU currently has a database in which all fishing vessels flying the flag of an EU country, and registered in an EU territory, must be registered.\nFrom when does the regulation apply?\nIt has applied since 17 January 2018.\nBACKGROUND\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nFor more information,
