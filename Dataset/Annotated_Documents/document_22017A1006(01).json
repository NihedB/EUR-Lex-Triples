Subject to the conditions in paragraph 4, a Party shall not, and shall ensure that its supervisory authorities or any other competent authorities do not, as a condition to allow an assuming reinsurer which has its head office or is domiciled in the territory of the other Party (hereunder for the purpose of Article 3, a ‘Home Party Assuming Reinsurer’) to enter into a reinsurance agreement with a ceding insurer which has its head office or is domiciled in its territory (hereunder for the purpose of Article 3, a ‘Host Party Ceding Insurer’):\n(a)\nmaintain or adopt any requirement to post collateral in connection with cessions from a Host Party Ceding Insurer to a Home Party Assuming Reinsurer and any related reporting requirement attributable to such removed collateral, or\n(b)\nmaintain or adopt any new requirement with substantially the same regulatory impact on the Home Party Assuming Reinsurer as collateral requirements removed under this Agreement or any reporting requirement attributable to such removed collateral,\nwhich, in the case of either (a) or (b), results in less favourable treatment of Home Party Assuming Reinsurers than assuming reinsurers which have their head office or are domiciled in the territory of the same supervisory authority as a Host Party Ceding Insurer. This paragraph does not prohibit a Party in whose territory a ceding insurer has its head office or is domiciled (hereunder for the purpose of Article 3, a ‘Host Party’) or its supervisory authorities from applying requirements as a condition to allow the Home Party Assuming Reinsurers to enter into a reinsurance agreement with a Host Party Ceding Insurer if the same requirements apply to reinsurance agreements between a ceding insurer and an assuming reinsurer which have their head office or are domiciled in the territory of the same supervisory authority.\n2.   Subject to the conditions in paragraph 4, a Host Party shall not, and shall ensure that its supervisory authorities or any other competent authorities do not, as a condition to allow a Host Party Ceding Insurer to take credit for reinsurance or for risk mitigation effects of reinsurance agreements concluded with a Home Party Assuming Reinsurer:\n(a)\nmaintain or adopt any requirement to post collateral in connection with cessions from a Host Party Ceding Insurer to a Home Party Assuming Reinsurer and any related reporting requirement attributable to such removed collateral, or\n(b)\nmaintain or adopt any new requirement with substantially the same regulatory impact on the Home Party Assuming Reinsurer as collateral requirements removed under this Agreement or any reporting requirement attributable to such removed collateral,\nwhich, in the case of either (a) or (b), results in less favourable treatment of Home Party Assuming Reinsurers than assuming reinsurers which have their head office or are domiciled in the territory of the same supervisory authority as a Host Party Ceding Insurer. This paragraph does not prohibit a Host Party or its supervisory authorities from applying requirements as a condition to allow a Host Party Ceding Insurer to take credit for reinsurance or risk mitigation effects of reinsurance agreements concluded with a Home Party Assuming Reinsurer if the same requirements apply to reinsurance agreements between a ceding insurer and an assuming reinsurer which have their head office or are domiciled in the territory of the same supervisory authority.\n3.   Subject to the conditions in paragraph 4, a Host Party shall not, and shall ensure that its supervisory authorities or any other competent authorities, as applicable, do not, as a condition of entering into a reinsurance agreement with a Host Party Ceding Insurer or as a condition to allow the Host Party Ceding Insurer to recognise credit for such reinsurance or credit for risk mitigation effect of such reinsurance agreement:\n(a)\nmaintain or adopt any requirement for a Home Party Assuming Reinsurer to have a local presence, or\n(b)\nmaintain or adopt any new requirement with substantially the same regulatory impact on the Home Party Assuming Reinsurer as local presence,\nwhich, in the case of either (a) or (b), results in less favourable treatment of a Home Party Assuming Reinsurer than assuming reinsurers which have their head office or are domiciled in the territory of the supervisory authority of the Host Party Ceding Insurer or which have their head office or are domiciled in the territory of the Host Party and are licensed or permitted to operate in the territory of the supervisory authority of the Host Party Ceding Insurer. For a U.S. State, ‘permitted to operate’ shall mean, for purposes of this provision, admitted in that State.\n4.   Paragraphs 1 to 3 apply subject to the following conditions:\n(a)\nthe assuming reinsurer has and maintains on an ongoing basis,\n(i)\nat least 226 million Euro, where the ceding insurer has its head office in the EU, or 250 million U.S. dollars, where the ceding insurer is domiciled in the United States, of own funds or capital and surplus, calculated according to the methodology of its home jurisdiction; or\n(ii)\nif the assuming reinsurer is an association including incorporated and individual unincorporated underwriters:\n(A)\nminimum capital and surplus equivalents (net of liabilities) or own funds, calculated according to the methodology applicable in its home jurisdiction, of at least 226 million Euro, where the ceding insurer has its head office in the EU, or 250 million U.S. dollars, where the ceding insurer is domiciled in the United States; and\n(B)\na central fund containing a balance of at least 226 million Euro, where the ceding insurer has its head office in the EU, or 250 million U.S. dollars, where the ceding insurer is domiciled in the United States;\n(b)\nthe assuming reinsurer has and maintains on an ongoing basis:\n(i)\na solvency ratio of 100 percent SCR under Solvency II or an RBC of 300 percent Authorized Control Level, as applicable in the territory in which the assuming reinsurer has its head office or is domiciled; or\n(ii)\nif the assuming reinsurer is an association including incorporated and individual unincorporated underwriters, a solvency ratio of 100 percent SCR under Solvency II or an RBC of 300 percent Authorized Control Level, as applicable in the territory in which the assuming reinsurer has its head office or is domiciled;\n(c)\nthe assuming reinsurer agrees to provide prompt written notice and explanation to the supervisory authority in the territory of the ceding insurer if:\n(i)\nit falls below the minimum capital and surplus or own funds, as applicable, specified in subparagraph (a), or the solvency or capital ratio, as applicable, specified in subparagraph (b); or\n(ii)\nany regulatory action is taken against it for serious noncompliance with applicable law;\n(d)\nthe assuming reinsurer provides written confirmation to the Host supervisory authority of consent to the jurisdiction of the courts of the territory in which the ceding insurer has its head office or is domiciled, in accordance with applicable requirements of that territory for providing such consent. Nothing in this Agreement shall limit or in any way alter the capacity of parties to a reinsurance agreement to agree to alternative dispute resolution mechanisms;\n(e)\nwhere applicable for ‘service of process’ purposes, the assuming reinsurer provides written confirmation to the Host supervisory authority of consent to the appointment of that supervisory authority as agent for service of process. The Host supervisory authority may require that such consent be provided to it and included in each reinsurance agreement under its jurisdiction;\n(f)\nthe assuming reinsurer consents in writing to pay all final judgments, wherever enforcement is sought, obtained by a ceding insurer, that have been declared enforceable in the territory where the judgment was obtained;\n(g)\nthe assuming reinsurer agrees in each reinsurance agreement subject to this Agreement that it will provide collateral for 100 percent of the assuming reinsurer's liabilities attributable to reinsurance ceded pursuant to that agreement if the assuming reinsurer resists enforcement of a final judgment that is enforceable under the law of the territory in which it was obtained or a properly enforceable arbitration award, whether obtained by the ceding insurer or by its resolution estate, if applicable;\n(h)\nThe assuming reinsurer or its legal predecessor or successor, where applicable, provides the following documentation to the Host supervisory authority, if requested by that supervisory authority:\n(i)\nwith respect to the two years preceding entry into the reinsurance agreement and on an annual basis thereafter, its annual audited financial statements, in accordance with the applicable law of the territory of its head office, including the external audit report;\n(ii)\nwith respect to the two years preceding entry into the reinsurance agreement, solvency and financial condition report or actuarial opinion, if filed with the assuming reinsurer's supervisor;\n(iii)\nprior to entry into the reinsurance agreement and not more than semi-annually thereafter, an updated list of all disputed and overdue reinsurance claims outstanding for 90 days or more, regarding reinsurance assumed from ceding insurers of the jurisdiction of the ceding insurer; and\n(iv)\nprior to entry into the reinsurance agreement and not more than semi-annually thereafter, information regarding the assuming reinsurer's assumed reinsurance by ceding company, ceded reinsurance by the assuming reinsurer, and reinsurance recoverable on paid and unpaid losses by the assuming reinsurer, to allow for the evaluation of the criteria set forth in subparagraph (i) of paragraph 4;\n(i)\nthe assuming reinsurer maintains a practice of prompt payment of claims under reinsurance agreements. The lack of prompt payment will be evidenced if any of the following criteria is met:\n(i)\nmore than 15 percent of the reinsurance recoverables are overdue and in dispute as reported to the supervisor;\n(ii)\nmore than 15 percent of the reinsurer's ceding insurers or reinsurers have overdue reinsurance recoverables on paid losses of 90 days or more which are not in dispute and which exceed for each ceding insurer 90,400 Euro, where the assuming reinsurer has its head office in the EU, or 100,000 U.S. dollars, where the assuming reinsurer is domiciled in the United States; or\n(iii)\nthe aggregate amount of reinsurance recoverables on paid losses which are not in dispute, but are overdue by 90 days or more, exceeds 45,200,000 Euro, where the assuming reinsurer has its head office in the EU, or 50,000,000 U.S. dollars, where the assuming reinsurer is domiciled in the United States;\n(j)\nthe assuming reinsurer confirms that it is not presently participating in any solvent scheme of arrangement, which involves Host Party Ceding Insurers, and agrees to notify the ceding insurer and its supervisory authority and to provide 100 percent collateral to the ceding insurer consistent with the terms of the scheme should the assuming reinsurer enter into such an arrangement;\n(k)\nif subject to a legal process of resolution, receivership, or winding-up proceedings as applicable, the ceding insurer, or its representative, may seek and, if determined appropriate by the court in which the resolution, receivership, or winding-up proceedings is pending, may obtain an order requiring that the assuming reinsurer post collateral for all outstanding ceded liabilities; and\n(l)\nthe assuming reinsurer's Home supervisory authority confirms to the Host Party supervisory authority on an annual basis that the assuming reinsurer complies with subparagraph (b).\n5.   Nothing in this Agreement precludes an assuming reinsurer from providing to supervisory authorities information on a voluntary basis.\n6.   Each Party shall ensure that, in its capacity as a Host Party, with respect to its supervisory authorities, where the Host supervisory authority determines that a Home Party Assuming Reinsurer no longer satisfies one of the conditions listed in paragraph 4, the Host supervisory authority only imposes any of the requirements addressed in paragraphs 1 to 3 if that Host supervisory authority follows the procedure set out in subparagraphs (a) to (c):\n(a)\nprior to imposing any such requirements the Host supervisory authority communicates with the assuming reinsurer and, except for exceptional circumstances in which a shorter period is necessary for policyholder and other consumer protection, provides the assuming reinsurer with 30 days from the initial communication to submit a plan to remedy the defect and 90 days from the initial communication to remedy the defect, and informs the Home supervisory authority;\n(b)\nonly where, after the expiry of this period of 90 days or less under exceptional circumstances as set out in (a), the Host supervisory authority considers that no or insufficient action was taken by the assuming reinsurer, the Host supervisory authority may impose any of the requirements as set out in paragraphs 1 to 3; and\n(c)\nthe imposition of any of the requirements set out in paragraphs 1 to 3 is explained in writing and communicated to the assuming reinsurer concerned.\n7.   Subject to applicable law and the terms of this Agreement, nothing in this Article shall limit or in any way alter the capacity of parties to a reinsurance agreement to agree on requirements for collateral or other terms in that reinsurance agreement.\n8.   This Agreement shall apply only to reinsurance agreements entered into, amended, or renewed on or after the date on which a measure that reduces collateral pursuant to this Article takes effect, and only with respect to losses incurred and reserves reported from and after the later of (i) the date of the measure, or (ii) the effective date of such new reinsurance agreement, amendment, or renewal. Nothing in this Agreement shall limit or in any way alter the capacity of parties to any reinsurance agreement to renegotiate such reinsurance agreement.\n9.   For greater clarity, in the event of termination of this Agreement, nothing in this Agreement prevents supervisory authorities, or other competent authorities, from requiring the local presence of Host Party assuming reinsurers, or requiring posting of collateral and related requirements, or compliance with other provisions of applicable law, with respect to any liabilities under reinsurance agreements described in this Agreement.\nArticle 4\nGroup supervision\nFor the purposes of Articles 9 and 10, the Parties set forth the following practices of group supervision:\n(a)\nWithout prejudice to subparagraphs (c) to (h) and participation in supervisory colleges, a Home Party insurance or reinsurance group is subject only to worldwide prudential insurance group supervision including worldwide group governance, solvency and capital, and reporting, as applicable, by its Home supervisory authorities, and is not subject to group supervision at the level of the worldwide parent undertaking of the insurance or reinsurance group by any Host supervisory authority.\n(b)\nNotwithstanding subparagraph (a), Host supervisory authorities may exercise supervision with regard to a Home Party insurance or reinsurance group as set out in subparagraphs (c) to (h). Host supervisory authorities may exercise group supervision, where appropriate, with regard to a Home Party insurance or reinsurance group at the level of the parent undertaking in its territory. Host supervisory authorities do not otherwise exercise worldwide group supervision with regard to a Home Party insurance or reinsurance group, without prejudice to group supervision of the insurance or reinsurance group at the level of the parent undertaking in the territory of the Host Party.\n(c)\nWhere a worldwide risk management system, as evidenced by the submission of a worldwide group Own Risk and Solvency Assessment (ORSA), is applied to a Home Party insurance or reinsurance group according to the applicable law, the Home supervisory authority that requires the ORSA provides a summary of the worldwide group ORSA:\n(i)\nto the Host supervisory authorities, if they are members of the insurance or reinsurance group's supervisory college, without delay, and;\n(ii)\nto the supervisory authorities of significant subsidiaries or branches of that group in the Host Party, at the request of those supervisory authorities.\nWhere no such worldwide group ORSA is applied to a Home Party insurance or reinsurance group, according to applicable law, the relevant U.S. State or EU Member State's supervisory authority provides equivalent documentation which is prepared consistent with applicable law of the Home supervisory authority as referred to in subparagraphs (i) and (ii) above.\n(d)\nThe summary of the worldwide group ORSA, or the equivalent documentation as set out in subparagraph (c), includes the following elements:\n(i)\na description of the insurance or reinsurance group's risk management framework;\n(ii)\nan assessment of the insurance or reinsurance group's risk exposure; and\n(iii)\na group assessment of risk capital and a prospective solvency assessment.\n(e)\nNotwithstanding subparagraph (a), if the summary of the worldwide group ORSA, or, where applicable, equivalent documentation as set out in subparagraph (c), exposes any serious threat to policyholder protection or financial stability in the territory of the Host supervisory authority, that Host supervisory authority may impose preventive, corrective, or otherwise responsive measures with respect to insurers or reinsurers in the Host Party.\nPrior to imposing such measures, the Host supervisory authority consults the insurance or reinsurance group's relevant Home supervisory authority. The Parties encourage supervisory authorities to continue to address prudential insurance group supervision matters within supervisory colleges.\n(f)\nPrudential insurance group supervision reporting requirements as set out in the applicable law in the territory of the Host Party do not apply at the level of the worldwide parent undertaking of the insurance or reinsurance group unless they directly relate to the risk of a serious impact on the ability of undertakings within the insurance or reinsurance group to pay claims in the territory of the Host Party.\n(g)\nA Host supervisory authority retains the ability to request and obtain information from an insurer or reinsurer pursuing activities in its territory, whose worldwide parent undertaking has its head office in the territory of the Home Party, for purposes of prudential insurance group supervision, where such information is deemed necessary by the Host supervisory authority to protect against serious harm to policyholders or serious threat to financial stability or a serious impact on the ability of an insurer or reinsurer to pay its claims in the territory of the Host supervisory authority. The Host supervisory authority bases such information request on prudential supervisory criteria and, whenever possible, avoids burdensome and duplicative requests. The requesting supervisory authority informs the supervisory college of such a request.\nNotwithstanding subparagraph (a), the failure of an insurer or reinsurer to comply with such an information request may result in preventive, corrective or otherwise responsive measures being imposed within the Host supervisory authority's territory.\n(h)\nWith regard to a Home Party insurance or reinsurance group with operations in the Host Party and that is subject to a group capital assessment in the Home Party which fulfils the following conditions:\n(i)\nthe group capital assessment includes a worldwide group capital calculation capturing risk at the level of the entire group, including the worldwide parent undertaking of the insurance or reinsurance group, which may affect the insurance or reinsurance operations and activities occurring in the territory of the other Party; and\n(ii)\nthe supervisory authority in the territory of the Party where the group capital assessment as set out in subparagraph (i) above is applied has the authority to impose preventive, corrective, or otherwise responsive measures on the basis of the assessment, including requiring, where appropriate, capital measures;\nthe Host supervisory authority does not impose a group capital assessment or requirement at the level of the worldwide parent undertaking of the insurance or reinsurance group according to the applicable law in its territory.\nWhere a Home Party insurer or reinsurer is subject to a group capital requirement in the territory of the Home Party, the Host supervisory authority does not impose a group capital requirement or assessment at the level of the worldwide parent undertaking of the insurance or reinsurance group.\n(i)\nNotwithstanding any provision in this Agreement, this Agreement does not and is not intended to limit or restrict the ability of EU supervisory authorities to exercise supervisory or regulatory authority over entities or groups that own or control credit institutions in the EU, have banking operations in the EU, or whose material financial distress or the nature, scope, size, scale, concentration, interconnectedness or mix of activities have been determined could pose a threat to the financial stability of the EU, including through exercise of: Directive 2002/87/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 December 2002 on the supplementary supervision of credit institutions, insurance undertakings and investment firms in a financial conglomerate and amending Council Directives 73/239/EEC, 79/267/EEC, 92/49/EEC, 92/96/EEC, 93/6/EEC and 93/22/EEC, and Directives 98/78/EC and 2000/12/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council, Directive 2013/36/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 June 2013 on access to the activity of credit institutions and the prudential supervision of credit institutions and investment firms amending Directive 2002/87/EC and repealing Directives 2006/48/EC and 2006/49/EC (CRD IV), Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 June 2013 on prudential requirements for credit institutions and investment firms and amending Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 (CRR), Directive 2014/59/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 May 2014 establishing a framework for the recovery and resolution of credit institutions and investment firms and amending Council Directive 82/891/EEC, and Directives 2001/24/EC, 2002/47/EC, 2004/25/EC, 2005/56/EC, 2007/36/EC, 2011/35/EU, 2012/30/EU and 2013/36/EU and Regulations (EU) No 1093/2010 and (EU) No 648/2012, of the European Parliament and of the Council, Regulation (EU) No 806/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 July 2014 establishing uniform rules and a uniform procedure for the resolution of credit institutions and certain investment firms in the framework of a Single Resolution Mechanism and a Single Resolution Fund and amending\nRegulation (EU) No 1093/2010 and Council Regulation (EU) No 1024/2013 of 15 October 2013 conferring specific tasks on the European Central Bank concerning policies relating to the prudential supervision of credit institutions, or other related laws and regulations.\nNotwithstanding any provision in this Agreement, this Agreement does not and is not intended to limit or restrict the ability of the applicable U.S. supervisory authority to exercise supervisory or regulatory authority over entities or groups that own or control depository institutions in the United States, have banking operations in the United States, or whose material financial distress or the nature, scope, size, scale, concentration, interconnectedness, or mix of activities have been determined could pose a threat to the financial stability of the United States, including through exercise of authority pursuant to the Bank Holding Company Act (12 U.S.C. § 1841 et seq.), the Home Owners' Loan Act (12 U.S.C. § 1461 et seq.), the International Banking Act (12 U.S.C. § 3101 et seq.), the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (12 U.S.C. § 5301 et seq.), or other related laws or regulations.\nArticle 5\nExchange of Information\n1.

Mnuchin\nU.S Department of the Treasury\nAmbassador Robert E. Lighthizer\nUnited States Trade Representative\nANNEX\nModel Memorandum of Understanding Provisions on Exchange of Information between Supervisory Authorities\nArticle 1\nObjective\n1.   The Supervisory Authority of (U.S. State) and the national Supervisory Authority of (EU Member State), the Authorities signing this Memorandum of Understanding, recognise the need for co-operation in exchange of information.\n2.   The Authorities recognise that practical arrangements concerning cross-border cooperation and information exchange are essential for both crisis situations and day-to-day supervision.\n3.   The purpose of this Memorandum of Understanding is to facilitate cooperation in the exchange of information between the Authorities to the extent permitted by Applicable Law and consistent with supervisory and regulatory purposes.\n4.   The Authorities recognise that nothing in this Memorandum of Understanding addresses requirements that may apply to the exchange of personal data by supervisory authorities.\n5.   Applicable Law on exchange and protection of Confidential Information is in place in the territory of the Authorities, with the aim of protecting the confidential nature of data exchanged between Authorities under this Memorandum of Understanding. Amongst other things, this Applicable Law seeks to ensure that:\n(a)\nThe exchange of Confidential Information is only for purposes directly related to the fulfilment of the supervisory functions of the Authorities; and\n(b)\nAll persons gaining access to such Confidential Information in the course of their duties will maintain the confidentiality of such information, except in certain defined circumstances as set forth in Article 7.\nArticle 2\nDefinitions\nFor the purpose of this Memorandum of Understanding, the following definitions should apply:\n(a)\n‘Applicable Law’ means any law, regulation, administrative provision or other legal practice applicable in the jurisdiction of an Authority relevant to insurance and reinsurance supervision, the exchange of supervisory information, the protection of confidentiality and the handling and disclosure of information;\n(b)\n‘Confidential Information’ means any Provided Information regarded as confidential by the jurisdiction of the Requested Authority;\n(c)\n‘Insurer’ means an undertaking which is authorised or licensed to take up or engage in the business of direct or primary insurance;\n(d)\n‘Person’ means a natural person, legal entity, partnership, or unincorporated association;\n(e)\n‘Personal Data’ means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person;\n(f)\n‘Provided Information’ means any information provided by a Requested Authority to a Requesting Authority in response to a request for information;\n(g)\n‘Regulated Entity’ means an insurer or reinsurer authorised or supervised by a Supervisory Authority of the European Union or the United States;\n(h)\n‘Reinsurer’ means an undertaking which is authorised or licensed to take up or engage in the business of reinsurance activities;\n(i)\n‘Requested Authority’ means the Authority to whom a request for information is made;\n(j)\n‘Requesting Authority’ means the Authority making a request for information;\n(k)\n‘Supervisory Authority’ means any insurance and reinsurance supervisor in the European Union or in the United States; and\n(l)\n‘Undertaking’ means any entity engaged in economic activity.\nArticle 3\nCooperation\n1.   Subject to Applicable Law, the Requested Authority should consider requests from the Requesting Authority seriously and should respond in a timely fashion. It should provide the Requesting Authority with the fullest possible response to a request for information consistent with its regulatory functions.\n2.   Subject to Applicable Law, the existence and content of any request for information should be treated as confidential by both the Requested and the Requesting Authorities, unless both Authorities mutually decide otherwise.\nArticle 4\nUse of Provided Information\n1.   The Requesting Authority should only make requests for information if it has a legitimate regulatory or supervisory purpose for the request directly relevant to a Requesting Authority's lawful supervision of a Regulated Entity. It is generally not considered a legitimate regulatory or supervisory purpose for a Requesting Authority to seek information on individuals, unless the request is directly relevant to the fulfilment of supervisory functions.\n2.   The Requesting Authority should use Provided Information only for lawful purposes related to the Authority's regulatory, supervisory, financial stability, or prudential functions.\n3.   Subject to Applicable Law, any Provided Information exchanged belongs to, and will remain the property of, the Requested Authority.\nArticle 5\nRequest for Information\n1.   Requests for information by the Requesting Authority should be in writing, or in accordance with paragraph 2 where it is urgent, and include the following elements:\n(a)\nthe Authorities involved, the field of supervision concerned and the purpose for which the information is sought;\n(b)\nthe name of the person or Regulated Entity concerned;\n(c)\ndetails of the request which may include a description of the facts underlying the request, specific questions under investigation, and an indication of any sensitivity about the request;\n(d)\nthe information requested;\n(e)\nthe date by which the information is requested and any relevant legal deadlines; and\n(f)\nif relevant, whether, how, and to whom any of the information may be passed consistent with Article 7.\n2.   For urgent requests, a request can be presented orally, and should be followed by written confirmation without undue delay.\n3.   The Requested Authority should handle the request as follows:\n(a)\nThe Requested Authority should confirm receipt of the request.\n(b)\nThe Requested Authority should assess each request on a case-by-case basis to determine the fullest extent of information that can be provided under the terms of this Memorandum of Understanding and the procedures applicable in the jurisdiction of the Requested Authority. In deciding whether and to what extent to fulfil a request, the Requested Authority may take into account:\n(i)\nwhether the request conforms with the Memorandum of Understanding;\n(ii)\nwhether compliance with the request would be so burdensome as to disrupt the proper performance of the Requested Authority's functions;\n(iii)\nwhether it would be otherwise contrary to the essential interest of the Requested Authority's jurisdiction to provide the information requested;\n(iv)\nany other matters specified by the Applicable Law of the Requested Authority's jurisdiction (in particular those relating to confidentiality and professional secrecy, data protection and privacy, and procedural fairness); and\n(v)\nwhether complying with the request may otherwise be prejudicial to the performance by the Requested Authority of its functions.\n(c)\nWhere a Requested Authority denies or is unable to provide all or part of the requested Information, the Requested Authority should, to the extent practical and appropriate subject to Applicable Law, explain its reasons for not providing the information and consider possible alternative ways to meet the supervisory objective of the Requesting Authority. A request for Information may, in particular, be denied by the Requested Authority where the request would require the Requested Authority to act in a manner that would violate its Applicable Law.\nArticle 6\nTreatment of Confidential Information\n1.   As a general rule, any information received under this Memorandum of Understanding should be treated as Confidential Information except where otherwise indicated.\n2.   The Requesting Authority should take all lawful and reasonably practicable actions to preserve the confidentiality of Confidential Information.\n3.   Subject to Article 7 and Applicable Law, the Requesting Authority should restrict access to Confidential Information received from a Requested Authority to persons working for the Requesting Authority or acting on its behalf who:\n(a)\nare subject to the Requesting Authority's obligations in its jurisdiction to prevent unauthorized disclosure of Confidential Information;\n(b)\nare under the supervision and control of the Requesting Authority;\n(c)\nhave a need for such information that is consistent with, and directly related to, a lawful regulatory or supervisory purpose; and\n(d)\nare subject to ongoing confidentiality requirements after leaving the Requesting Authority.\nArticle 7\nOnward Sharing of Provided Information\n1.   Except as provided in Article 7(2), a Requesting Authority should not transmit to a third party Provided Information received from the Requested Party, unless:\n(a)\nthe Requesting Authority has obtained prior written consent from the Requested Authority for onward sharing of such information unless the request is urgent, in which case it can be presented orally followed by written confirmation without delay; and\n(b)\nthe third party commits to abide by restrictions which maintain a substantially similar level of confidentiality as the one to which the Requesting Authority is subject to as set forth in this Memorandum of Understanding.\n2.   Subject to Applicable Law, if the Requesting Authority is subject to a legally compelled demand for or under a legal obligation to disclose Provided Information, the Requesting Authority should provide the Requested Authority with as much notice as reasonably practical of such demand and any related proceedings to facilitate opportunities to intervene and assert privilege. If the Requested Authority's consent to the production of Provided Information is not given, the Requesting Authority should take all reasonable steps where appropriate to resist disclosure, including by employing legal means to resist such disclosure and to assert and protect the confidentiality of any Confidential Information subject to potential disclosure.\nBrussels, 18 September 2017\nThe Honorable Ambassador Lighthizer\nUnited States Trade Representative\nOffice of the United States Trade Representative\n600 17th Street NW\nWashington, DC 20508\nUSA\nDear Ambassador Lighthizer,\nI am pleased to proceed with the signature of the Bilateral Agreement between the European Union and the United States of America on prudential measures regarding insurance and reinsurance (‘the Agreement’), attached in the Annex to this letter.

LIGHTHIZER\nUnited States Trade Representative", "summary": "EU-US Agreement on Insurance and Reinsurance\nEU-US Agreement on Insurance and Reinsurance\nSUMMARY OF:\nBilateral agreement between the EU and the United States on prudential measures regarding insurance and reinsurance\nDecision (EU) 2017/1792 — signing, on behalf of the EU, and provisional application of the bilateral agreement between the EU and the United States on prudential measures regarding insurance and reinsurance\nDecision (EU) 2018/539 — conclusion of the bilateral agreement between the EU and the United States on prudential measures regarding insurance and reinsurance\nWHAT IS THE AIM OF THE AGREEMENT AND THE DECISIONS?\nThe agreement aims to: strengthen regulatory certainty and ensure a level playing field for insurers and reinsurers* operating in the EU and the United States;improve protection for policyholders and other consumers;promote cooperation and exchange of confidential information between supervisors on both sides of the Atlantic.\nCouncil Decision (EU) 2017/1792 approves the EU’s signature to the bilateral agreement. Council Decision (EU) 2018/539 approves the agreement itself.\nKEY POINTS\n              \nThe agreement:\neliminates the imposition of any local presence, collateral* or similar requirements on a company (‘assuming reinsurer’) which is not based in the same jurisdiction as the original insurer (‘ceding insurer’);\nspecifies that to benefit from equal treatment, an assuming reinsurer must comply with certain financial and market conduct conditions, such as having at least €226 million where the ceding insurer is based in the EU or $250 million if they are domiciled in the United States;maintaining a certain solvency ratio;providing documentation to the host country’s authorities when requested; andpaying promptly any claims under the insurance agreement;\nsets out the procedure the host authority must follow if it wishes to impose any conditions because it considers an assuming reinsurer no longer meets all the listed requirements;\nconfirms that supervision of a reinsurance company rests with the authorities in the jurisdiction where the parent is based, although host authorities may become involved in certain circumstances;\nencourages supervisory authorities in the EU and the United States to exchange information while respecting confidentiality — an annex details how to conduct the exchanges;\nestablishes a joint committee of EU and US representatives to meet regularly and oversee the implementation of the agreement;\nallows either party, after consulting the other, to terminate the agreement provided certain procedures are followed.\nDATE OF ENTRY INTO FORCE\n              \nThe agreement entered into force on 4 April 2018, although it had already applied provisionally since 7 November 2017.\nBACKGROUND\nInsurance companies often take out reinsurance to reduce their risk, especially when facing possible major environmental or other disasters. The reinsurer, in exchange for a premium, pays a share of any claims against the original insurer.\nThe EU and the United States are major trading partners in reinsurance services. However, state insurance laws in the United States required non-US reinsurers, except those based in France, Germany, Ireland and the United Kingdom, to post 100% collateral for the risks involved — a significant deterrent for many companies in the EU.\nEU insurance harmonisation through the Solvency II directive (Directive 2009/138/EC — see summary) opened the way in 2015 for insurance and reinsurance negotiations with the United States. These were completed in January 2017.\nFor more information, see: EU-US insurance agreement concluded — press release (Council of the European Union).\nKEY TERMS\n              \nReinsurer: a company that provides financial protection to insurance companies.\nCollateral: assets such as cash and credit letters.\nMAIN DOCUMENTS\n            \nBilateral agreement between the European Union and the United States of America on prudential measures regarding insurance and reinsurance (OJ L 258, 6.10.2017, pp. 4-21)\nCouncil Decision (EU) 2017/1792 of 29 May 2017 on the signing, on behalf of the Union, and provisional application of the bilateral agreement between the European Union and the United States of America on prudential measures regarding insurance and reinsurance (OJ L 258, 6.10.2017, pp. 1-2)\nSuccessive amendments to Decision (EU) 2017/1792 have been incorporated into the original text.
