{"celex_id": "32013L0029", "reference": "28.6.2013\nEN\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\nL 178/27\nDIRECTIVE 2013/29/EU OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL\nof 12 June 2013\non the harmonisation of the laws of the Member States relating to the making available on the market of pyrotechnic articles (recast)\n(Text with EEA relevance)\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 114 thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee (1),\nActing in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure (2),\nWhereas:\n(1)\nDirective 2007/23/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 May 2007 on the placing on the market of pyrotechnic articles (3) has been substantially amended (4). Since further amendments are to be made, that Directive should be recast in the interests of clarity.\n(2)\nRegulation (EC) No 765/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 9 July 2008 setting out the requirements for accreditation and market surveillance relating to the marketing of products (5) lays down rules on the accreditation of conformity assessment bodies, provides a framework for the market surveillance of products and for controls on products from third countries, and lays down the general principles of the CE marking.\n(3)\nDecision No 768/2008/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 9 July 2008 on a common framework for the marketing of products (6) lays down common principles and reference provisions intended to apply across sectoral legislation in order to provide a coherent basis for revision or recasts of that legislation. Directive 2007/23/EC should be adapted to that Decision.\n(4)\nThe laws, regulations and administrative provisions in force in the Member States with regard to the making available on the market of pyrotechnic articles are divergent, in particular as regards aspects such as safety and performance characteristics.\n(5)\nThe laws, regulations and administrative provisions of Member States, being liable to cause barriers to trade within the Union, need to be harmonised in order to guarantee the free movement of pyrotechnic articles within the internal market while ensuring a high level of protection of human health and safety and the protection of consumers and professional end-users. Such high level of protection should include the relevant age limits associated with users of pyrotechnic articles being adhered to.\n(6)\nCouncil Directive 93/15/EEC of 5 April 1993 on the harmonisation of the provisions relating to the placing on the market and supervision of explosives for civil uses (7) excludes pyrotechnic articles from its scope.\n(7)\nSafety during storage is governed by Council Directive 96/82/EC of 9 December 1996 on the control of major-accident hazards involving dangerous substances (8) which sets out safety requirements for establishments where explosives, including pyrotechnic substances, are present.\n(8)\nAs regards safety in transportation, the rules concerning the transport of pyrotechnic articles are covered by international conventions and agreements, including the United Nations recommendations on the transport of dangerous goods. Those aspects should therefore not fall within the scope of this Directive.\n(9)\nThis Directive should apply to all forms of supply, including distance selling.\n(10)\nThis Directive should not apply to pyrotechnic articles to which Council Directive 96/98/EC of 20 December 1996 on marine equipment (9) and the relevant international conventions referred to therein apply. It should also not apply to percussion caps intended for toys falling within the scope of Directive 2009/48/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 June 2009 on the safety of toys (10).\n(11)\nFireworks which are built by a manufacturer for his own use and approved for use exclusively on its territory by the Member State in which the manufacturer is established, and which remain on the territory of that Member State, should not be considered as having been made available on the market and should therefore not need to comply with this Directive.\n(12)\nIt should not be possible, where the requirements laid down in this Directive are satisfied, for Member States to prohibit, restrict or hinder the free movement of pyrotechnic articles. This Directive should apply without prejudice to national legislation on the licensing of manufacturers, distributors and importers by the Member States.\n(13)\nPyrotechnic articles should include fireworks, theatrical pyrotechnic articles and other pyrotechnic articles for technical purposes, such as gas generators used in airbags or in seatbelt pretensioners.\n(14)\nIn order to ensure appropriately high levels of protection, pyrotechnic articles should be categorised according to their level of hazard as regards their type of use, purpose or noise level.\n(15)\nGiven the dangers inherent in the use of pyrotechnic articles, it is appropriate to lay down age limits for their being made available to persons, and to ensure that their labelling displays sufficient and appropriate information on safe use, in order to protect human health and safety and the environment. Certain pyrotechnic articles should be made available only to persons with the necessary knowledge, skills and experience. With regard to pyrotechnic articles for vehicles, labelling requirements should take into account current practice and the fact that those articles are supplied exclusively to professional users.\n(16)\nThe use of pyrotechnic articles and, in particular, the use of fireworks, is subject to markedly divergent cultural customs and traditions in the respective Member States. It is therefore necessary to allow Member States to take national measures to limit the use or sale of certain categories of pyrotechnic articles to the general public for reasons, inter alia, of public security or health and safety.\n(17)\nEconomic operators should be responsible for the compliance of pyrotechnic articles with the requirements of this Directive, in relation to their respective roles in the supply chain, so as to ensure a high level of protection of public interests, such as health and safety and the protection of consumers, and to guarantee fair competition on the Union market.\n(18)\nAll economic operators intervening in the supply and distribution chain should take appropriate measures to ensure that they only make available on the market pyrotechnic articles which are in conformity with this Directive. It is necessary to provide for a clear and proportionate distribution of obligations which correspond to the role of each economic operator in the supply and distribution chain.\n(19)\nIn order to facilitate communication between economic operators, market surveillance authorities and consumers, Member States should encourage economic operators to include a website address in addition to the postal address.\n(20)\nThe manufacturer, having detailed knowledge of the design and production process, is best placed to carry out the conformity assessment procedure. Conformity assessment should therefore remain solely the obligation of the manufacturer.\n(21)\nIt is necessary to ensure that pyrotechnic articles from third countries entering the Union market comply with the requirements of this Directive, and in particular that appropriate conformity assessment procedures have been carried out by manufacturers with regard to those pyrotechnic articles. Provision should therefore be made for importers to make sure that the pyrotechnic articles they place on the market comply with the requirements of this Directive and that they do not place on the market pyrotechnic articles which do not comply with such requirements or present a risk. Provision should also be made for importers to make sure that conformity assessment procedures have been carried out and that marking of pyrotechnic articles and documentation drawn up by manufacturers are available for inspection by the competent national authorities.\n(22)\nThe distributor makes a pyrotechnic article available on the market after it has been placed on the market by the manufacturer or the importer and should act with due care to ensure that his handling of the pyrotechnic article does not adversely affect the compliance of the pyrotechnic article.\n(23)\nAny economic operator who either places a pyrotechnic article on the market under his own name or trademark or modifies a pyrotechnic article in such a way that compliance with the requirements of this Directive may be affected should be considered to be the manufacturer and should assume the obligations of the manufacturer.\n(24)\nDistributors and importers, being close to the market place, should be involved in market surveillance tasks carried out by the competent national authorities, and should be prepared to participate actively, providing those authorities with all necessary information relating to the pyrotechnic article concerned.\n(25)\nWhen keeping the information required under this Directive for the identification of other economic operators, economic operators should not be required to update such information in respect of other economic operators who have either supplied them with a pyrotechnic article or to whom they have supplied a pyrotechnic article.\n(26)\nIt is appropriate to establish essential safety requirements for pyrotechnic articles in order to protect consumers and to prevent accidents.\n(27)\nSome pyrotechnic articles, particularly pyrotechnic articles for vehicles such as air bag gas generators, contain small amounts of commercial blasting agents and military explosives. Following the adoption of Directive 2007/23/EC it has become obvious that it will not be possible to replace these substances as additives in strictly combustive compositions, where they are used to enhance the energetic balance. The essential safety requirement, which restricts the use of commercial blasting agents and military explosives, should therefore be modified.\n(28)\nIn order to facilitate conformity assessment with the essential safety requirements provided for in this Directive, it is necessary to provide for a presumption of conformity for pyrotechnic articles which are in conformity with harmonised standards that are adopted in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 1025/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 October 2012 on European Standardisation, amending Council Directives 89/686/EEC and 93/15/EEC and Directives 94/9/EC, 94/25/EC, 95/16/EC, 97/23/EC, 98/34/EC, 2004/22/EC, 2007/23/EC, 2009/23/EC and 2009/105/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (11) for the purpose of expressing detailed technical specifications of those requirements.\n(29)\nRegulation (EU) No 1025/2012 provides for a procedure for objections to harmonised standards where those standards do not entirely satisfy the requirements of this Directive.\n(30)\nIn order to enable economic operators to demonstrate and the competent authorities to ensure that pyrotechnic articles made available on the market comply with the essential safety requirements, it is necessary to provide for conformity assessment procedures. Decision No 768/2008/EC establishes modules for conformity assessment procedures, which include procedures from the least to the most stringent, in proportion to the level of risk involved and the level of safety required. In order to ensure intersectoral coherence and to avoid ad-hoc variants, conformity assessment procedures should be chosen from among those modules.\n(31)\nManufacturers should draw up an EU declaration of conformity to provide information required under this Directive on the conformity of a pyrotechnic article with the requirements of this Directive and of other relevant Union harmonisation legislation.\n(32)\nTo ensure effective access to information for market surveillance purposes, the information required to identify all applicable Union acts should be available in a single EU declaration of conformity. In order to reduce the administrative burden on economic operators, that single EU declaration of conformity may be a dossier made up of relevant individual declarations of conformity.\n(33)\nThe CE marking, indicating the conformity of a pyrotechnic article, is the visible consequence of a whole process comprising conformity assessment in a broad sense. General principles governing the CE marking are set out in Regulation (EC) No 765/2008. Rules governing the affixing of the CE marking should be laid down in this Directive.\n(34)\nThe conformity assessment procedures set out in this Directive require the intervention of conformity assessment bodies, which are notified by the Member States to the Commission.\n(35)\nExperience has shown that the criteria set out in Directive 2007/23/EC that conformity assessment bodies have to fulfil to be notified to the Commission are not sufficient to ensure a uniformly high level of performance of notified bodies throughout the Union. It is, however, essential that all notified bodies perform their functions to the same level and under conditions of fair competition. That requires the setting of obligatory requirements for conformity assessment bodies wishing to be notified in order to provide conformity assessment services.\n(36)\nIn order to ensure a consistent level of conformity assessment quality it is also necessary to set requirements for notifying authorities and other bodies involved in the assessment, notification and monitoring of notified bodies.\n(37)\nThe system set out in this Directive should be complemented by the accreditation system provided for in Regulation (EC) No 765/2008. Since accreditation is an essential means of verifying the competence of conformity assessment bodies, it should also be used for the purposes of notification.\n(38)\nTransparent accreditation as provided for in Regulation (EC) No 765/2008, ensuring the necessary level of confidence in certificates of conformity, should be considered by the national public authorities throughout the Union as the preferred means of demonstrating the technical competence of conformity assessment bodies. However, national authorities may consider that they possess the appropriate means of carrying out that evaluation themselves. In such cases, in order to ensure the appropriate level of credibility of evaluations carried out by other national authorities, they should provide the Commission and the other Member States with the necessary documentary evidence demonstrating the compliance of the conformity assessment bodies evaluated with the relevant regulatory requirements.\n(39)\nConformity assessment bodies frequently subcontract parts of their activities linked to the assessment of conformity or have recourse to a subsidiary. In order to safeguard the level of protection required for the pyrotechnic articles to be placed on the Union market, it is essential that conformity assessment subcontractors and subsidiaries fulfil the same requirements as notified bodies in relation to the performance of conformity assessment tasks. Therefore, it is important that the assessment of the competence and the performance of bodies to be notified and the monitoring of bodies already notified cover also activities carried out by subcontractors and subsidiaries.\n(40)\nIt is necessary to increase the efficiency and transparency of the notification procedure and, in particular, to adapt it to new technologies so as to enable online notification.\n(41)\nSince notified bodies may offer their services throughout the Union, it is appropriate to give the other Member States and the Commission the opportunity to raise objections concerning a notified body. It is therefore important to provide for a period during which any doubts or concerns as to the competence of conformity assessment bodies can be clarified before they start operating as notified bodies.\n(42)\nIn the interests of competitiveness, it is crucial that notified bodies apply the conformity assessment procedures without creating unnecessary burdens for economic operators. For the same reason, and to ensure equal treatment of economic operators, consistency in the technical application of the conformity assessment procedures needs to be ensured. That can best be achieved through appropriate coordination and cooperation between notified bodies.\n(43)\nMember States should take all appropriate measures to ensure that pyrotechnic articles may be placed on the market only if, when properly stored and used for their intended purpose, or under conditions of use which can be reasonably foreseen, they do not endanger the health and safety of persons. Pyrotechnic articles should be considered as non-compliant with the essential safety requirements laid down in this Directive only under conditions of use which can be reasonably foreseen, that is when such use could result from lawful and readily predictable human behaviour.\n(44)\nIn order to ensure legal certainty, it is necessary to clarify that the rules on Union market surveillance and control of products entering the Union market provided for in Regulation (EC) No 765/2008 apply to pyrotechnic articles. This Directive should not prevent Member States from choosing the competent authorities to carry out those tasks.\n(45)\nGroups of pyrotechnic articles that are similar in design, function or behaviour should be assessed by the notified bodies as product families.\n(46)\nA safeguard procedure is necessary to allow the possibility for contesting the conformity of a pyrotechnic article. In order to increase transparency and to reduce processing time, it is necessary to improve the existing safeguard procedure, with a view to making it more efficient and drawing on the expertise available in Member States.\n(47)\nThe existing system should be supplemented by a procedure under which interested parties are informed of measures intended to be taken with regard to pyrotechnic articles presenting a risk to the health or safety of persons or to other aspects of public interest protection. It should also allow market surveillance authorities, in cooperation with the relevant economic operators, to act at an earlier stage in respect of such pyrotechnic articles.\n(48)\nWhere the Member States and the Commission agree as to the justification of a measure taken by a Member State, no further involvement of the Commission should be required, except where non-compliance can be attributed to shortcomings of a harmonised standard.\n(49)\nIt is in the interests of the manufacturer and the importer to supply safe pyrotechnic articles in order to avoid liability costs for defective products causing damage to individuals and private property. In this regard, Council Directive 85/374/EEC of 25 July 1985 on the approximation of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States concerning liability for defective products (12) complements this Directive, since Directive 85/374/EEC imposes a strict liability regime on manufacturers and importers and ensures an adequate level of protection for consumers. Furthermore, Directive 85/374/EEC provides that notified bodies should be adequately insured in respect of their professional activities, unless their liability is assumed by the State in accordance with national law, or the Member State itself is directly responsible for the tests.\n(50)\nIn order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of this Directive, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission. Those powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 February 2011 laying down the rules and general principles concerning mechanisms for control by Member States of the Commission’s exercise of implementing powers (13).\n(51)\nThe advisory procedure should be used for the adoption of implementing acts requesting the notifying Member State to take the necessary corrective measures in respect of notified bodies that do not meet or no longer meet the requirements for their notification.\n(52)\nThe examination procedure should be used for the adoption of implementing acts determining a uniform numbering system for identification of pyrotechnic articles and the practical arrangements for a register with registration numbers of pyrotechnic articles as well as for the regular collection and updating of data on accidents related to pyrotechnic articles.\n(53)\nThe examination procedure should also be used for the adoption of implementing acts with respect to compliant pyrotechnic articles which present a risk to the health or safety of persons or to other aspects of public interest protection.\n(54)\nThe Commission should adopt immediately applicable implementing acts where, in duly justified cases relating to compliant pyrotechnic articles which present a risk to the health or safety of persons, imperative grounds of urgency so require.\n(55)\nIn line with established practice, the committee set up by this Directive can play a useful role in examining matters concerning the application of this Directive raised either by its chair or by a representative of a Member State in accordance with its rules of procedure.\n(56)\nThe Commission should, by means of implementing acts and, given their special nature, acting without the application of Regulation (EU) No 182/2011, determine whether measures taken by Member States in respect of non-compliant pyrotechnic articles are justified or not.\n(57)\nMember States should lay down rules on penalties applicable to infringements of the provisions of national law adopted pursuant to this Directive and ensure that those rules are enforced. The penalties provided for should be effective, proportionate and dissuasive.\n(58)\nManufacturers and importers need to be given time to exercise any rights under national rules in force before the date of application of national measures transposing this Directive in order, for example, to sell their stocks of manufactured products. It is therefore necessary to provide for reasonable transitional arrangements that allow the making available on the market without the need to comply with further product requirements of pyrotechnic articles that have already been placed on the market in accordance with Directive 2007/23/EC before the date of application of national measures transposing this Directive. Distributors should therefore be able to supply pyrotechnic articles that have been placed on the market, namely stock that is already in the distribution chain, before the date of application of national measures transposing this Directive.\n(59)\nPyrotechnic articles for vehicles are designed for vehicle life cycles and therefore require special transitional arrangements. It is necessary for such a pyrotechnic article to comply with the requirements of the law applicable at the time it is first made available on the market and for the period of the lifetime of the vehicle in which it is installed.\n(60)\nIn order to ensure the uninterrupted use of certain pyrotechnic articles, in particular in the automotive industry, it is necessary to apply point 4 of Annex I from 4 July 2013.\n(61)\nSince the objective of this Directive, namely to ensure that pyrotechnic articles on the market fulfil the requirements providing a high level of protection of health and safety and other public interests while guaranteeing the functioning of the internal market, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore, by reason of its scale and effects, be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Directive does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve that objective.\n(62)\nThe obligation to transpose this Directive into national law should be confined to those provisions which represent a substantive amendment as compared to the earlier Directive. The obligation to transpose the provisions which are unchanged arose under Directive 2007/23/EC.\n(63)\nThis Directive should be without prejudice to the obligations of the Member States relating to the time-limits for transposition into national law and the dates of application of the Directive set out in Annex IV, Part B,\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:\nCHAPTER 1\nGENERAL PROVISIONS\nArticle 1\nSubject matter\n1.

Member States may increase the age limits set out in paragraph 1 where justified on grounds of public order, security or health and safety. Member States may also lower the age limits for persons vocationally trained or undergoing such training.\n3.   Manufacturers, importers and distributors shall not make available on the market the following pyrotechnic articles except to persons with specialist knowledge:\n(a)\nfireworks of category F4;\n(b)\ntheatrical pyrotechnic articles of category T2 and other pyrotechnic articles of category P2.\n4.   Other pyrotechnic articles of category P1 for vehicles, including airbag and seat belt pre-tensioner systems, shall not be made available to members of the general public unless those pyrotechnic articles for vehicles have been incorporated in a vehicle or a detachable vehicle part.\nCHAPTER 2\nOBLIGATIONS OF ECONOMIC OPERATORS\nArticle 8\nObligations of the manufacturers\n1.   When placing their pyrotechnic articles on the market, manufacturers shall ensure that they have been designed and manufactured in accordance with the essential safety requirements set out in Annex I.\n2.   Manufacturers shall draw up the technical documentation referred to in Annex II and have the relevant conformity assessment procedure referred to in Article 17 carried out.\nWhere compliance of a pyrotechnic article with the applicable requirements has been demonstrated by that procedure, manufacturers shall draw up an EU declaration of conformity and affix the CE marking.\n3.   Manufacturers shall keep the technical documentation and the EU declaration of conformity for 10 years after the pyrotechnic article has been placed on the market.\n4.   Manufacturers shall ensure that procedures are in place for series production to remain in conformity with this Directive. Changes in pyrotechnic article design or characteristics and changes in the harmonised standards or in other technical specifications by reference to which conformity of a pyrotechnic article is declared shall be adequately taken into account.\nWhen deemed appropriate with regard to the risks presented by a pyrotechnic article, manufacturers shall, to protect the health and safety of consumers, upon a duly justified request of the competent authorities, carry out sample testing of pyrotechnic articles made available on the market, investigate, and, if necessary, keep a register of complaints, of non-conforming pyrotechnic articles and pyrotechnic article recalls, and shall keep distributors informed of any such monitoring.\n5.   Manufacturers shall ensure that pyrotechnic articles which they have placed on the market are labelled in accordance with Article 10 or Article 11.\n6.   Manufacturers shall indicate on the pyrotechnic article their name, registered trade name or registered trade mark and the postal address at which they can be contacted or, where that is not possible, on its packaging or in a document accompanying the pyrotechnic article. The address shall indicate a single point at which the manufacturer can be contacted. The contact details shall be in a language easily understood by end-users and market surveillance authorities.\n7.   Manufacturers shall ensure that the pyrotechnic article is accompanied by instructions and safety information in a language which can be easily understood by consumers and other end-users, as determined by the Member State concerned. Such instructions and safety information, as well as any labelling, shall be clear, understandable and intelligible.\n8.   Manufacturers who consider or have reason to believe that a pyrotechnic article which they have placed on the market is not in conformity with this Directive shall immediately take the corrective measures necessary to bring that pyrotechnic article into conformity, to withdraw it or recall it, if appropriate. Furthermore, where the pyrotechnic article presents a risk, manufacturers shall immediately inform the competent national authorities of the Member States in which they made the pyrotechnic article available on the market to that effect, giving details, in particular, of the non-compliance and of any corrective measures taken.\n9.   Manufacturers shall, further to a reasoned request from a competent national authority, provide it with all the information and documentation in paper or electronic form necessary to demonstrate the conformity of the pyrotechnic article with this Directive, in a language which can be easily understood by that authority. They shall cooperate with that authority, at its request, on any action taken to eliminate the risks posed by pyrotechnic articles which they have placed on the market.\nArticle 9\nTraceability\n1.   In order to facilitate the traceability of pyrotechnic articles, manufacturers shall label them with a registration number assigned by the notified body carrying out the conformity assessment pursuant to Article 17.

market\nSUMMARY OF:\nDirective 2013/29/EU — EU rules relating to pyrotechnic articles\nWHAT IS THE AIM OF THIS DIRECTIVE?\n              \nIt sets out the rules to achieve the free movement of pyrotechnic articles* within the EU market while seeking to ensure high levels of protection of health and safety, and of the environment.\nIt revises the existing rules on pyrotechnic articles (Directive 2007/23/EC) to align them with the so-called New Legislative Framework, a package of measures to improve market surveillance and the quality of conformity assessments.\nKEY POINTS\n              \nThe directive lists the categories of pyrotechnic articles to which it applies by type of use.\nFireworks built by a manufacturer for his own use and approved for use only in the EU country in which the manufacturer is established and which remain in that country, are not covered.\nIt lays down the essential safety requirements that pyrotechnic articles must meet so as to be made available on the market. These are listed in the directive’s Annex I.\nIt sets out the conformity assessment procedures, where an EU-type examination is carried out, a notified body examines the technical design of an article, and verifies and attests that this design meets the requirements of the directive.\nIt sets minimum age limits and other restrictions on access to pyrotechnic articles:\nFireworks\nF1 category: 12 years;\nF2 category: 16 years;\nF3 category: 18 years.\nTheatrical pyrotechnic articles: T1 category: 18 years.\nOther pyrotechnic articles: P1 category: 18 years.\nSome pyrotechnic articles may only be made available to people with a specialist knowledge, for example, F4 category fireworks, fireworks for professional use, which present a high hazard.\nEU countries may increase these age limits and may further restrict some pyrotechnic articles’ availability to the general public on grounds of public order, security, health and safety, and environmental protection.\nAll businesses and organisations in the supply and distribution chain must ensure that they only make available on the market those pyrotechnic articles that meet the requirements of this directive. The directive lays down the obligations of each party along this chain.\nManufacturers have to indicate their name, registered trade name or registered trade mark and the postal address at which they can be contacted on the pyrotechnic article, or, where that is not possible, on the packaging or in a document accompanying each article. Contact details must be in a language easily understood both by end-users and market surveillance authorities.\nInstructions and safety information must be given in a language which can be easily understood by consumers and other end-users in the EU country in which the article is to be made available on the market.\nLabelling must be done in the official language(s) of the country in which the pyrotechnic article is made available. Such labelling must contain at least the minimum information required by the directive.\nFor market surveillance purposes, manufacturers draw up an EU declaration of conformity for each product in accordance with the model in the directive’s Annex III. This states that the product meets the essential safety requirements. By drawing up the EU declaration of conformity, the manufacturer assumes the legal responsibility for the compliance of the pyrotechnic article with the directive’s requirements.\nManufacturers must ensure that the labelling bears the registration number assigned to the product by the notified body that carries out the conformity assessment.\nImporters must ensure that they only place products that comply with this directive on the market. They need to ensure that:\nthe appropriate conformity assessment procedure has been carried out by the manufacturer;\nthe pyrotechnic article bears the CE conformity marking;\nthe labelling meets the requirements;\nthe documents drawn up by the manufacturer are available to the competent authorities upon request.\nBoth manufacturers and importers must keep records of the registration numbers of the articles they make available on the market. Implementing Directive 2014/58/EU introduces a system for the traceability of pyrotechnic articles.\nThe directive requires EU countries to ensure that manufacturers, importers, distributors, retailers, etc. may only place pyrotechnic articles on the market on condition that they are stored properly and used for their intended purpose, so that theydo not place health and safety at risk.\nEU countries must introduce rules on penalties to be applied where parties do not comply with the directive’s requirements. These rules may include criminal penalties for serious infringements.\nFROM WHEN DOES THE DIRECTIVE APPLY?\n              \nMost of the new rules contained in Directive 2013/29/EU have applied since 1 July 2015. They had to become law in the EU countries by 30 June 2015, while rules concerning new safety requirements for the most dangerous categories of pyrotechnic articles(categories P1, P2, T2 and F4) had to become law by 3 October 2013.\nBACKGROUND\n              \nFor more information, see:\nPyrotechnic articles (European Commission).\nKEY TERMS\n              \nPyrotechnic articles: articles containing explosive substances or an explosive mixture of substances designed to produce heat, light, sound, gas or smoke or a combination of such effects. Examples include fireworks, theatrical pyrotechnic articles, ignition devices and vehicle airbags.\nMAIN DOCUMENT\n            \nDirective 2013/29/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 June 2013 on the harmonisation of the laws of the Member States relating to the making available on the market of pyrotechnic articles (recast) (OJ L 178, 28.6.2013, pp. 27-65)\nRELATED DOCUMENTS\n            \nCommission communication in the framework of the implementation of Directive 2013/29/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council on the harmonisation of the laws of the Member States relating to the making available on the market of pyrotechnic articles (Publication of titles and references of harmonised standards under Union harmonisation legislation) (OJ C 149, 12.5.2017, pp. 1-5)\nCommission Implementing Directive 2014/58/EU of 16 April 2014 setting up, pursuant to Directive 2007/23/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council, a system for the traceability of pyrotechnic articles (OJ L 115, 17.4.2014, pp. 28-31)\nlast update 28.11.2017", "tags": ["free movement of goods", "marketing standard", "approximation of laws", "product safety", "EC conformity marking", "fireworks"], "subjects": ["Internal market - Principles", "Consumer protection", "Approximation of laws", "Protocol on Ireland/Northern Ireland"], "split": "train", "reference_annotations": {}, "summary_annotations": {}}
