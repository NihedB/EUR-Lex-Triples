The Contracting Parties undertake, in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, to ensure that the extradition system between, on the one hand, the Member States and, on the other hand, the Kingdom of Norway and the Republic of Iceland shall be based on a mechanism of surrender pursuant to an arrest warrant in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.3.

Nothing in this Agreement should be interpreted as prohibiting refusal to surrender a person in respect of whom an arrest warrant as defined by this Agreement has been issued when there are reasons to believe, on the basis of objective elements, that the said arrest warrant has been issued for the purpose of prosecuting or punishing a person on the grounds of his or her sex, race, religion, ethnic origin, nationality, language, political opinions or sexual orientation, or that that person's position may be prejudiced for any of these reasons.Article 2Definitions1. \"Contracting Parties\" shall mean the European Union and the Kingdom of Norway and the Republic of Iceland.2. \"Member State\" shall mean a Member State of the European Union.3. \"State\" shall mean a Member State, the Kingdom of Norway or the Republic of Iceland.4. \"Third State\" shall mean any State other than a State as defined in paragraph 3.5. \"Arrest warrant\" shall mean a judicial decision issued by a State with a view to the arrest and surrender by another State of a requested person, for the purposes of conducting a criminal prosecution or executing a custodial sentence or detention order.Article 3Scope1.

States can establish an obligation or an option for the executing judicial authority to refuse to execute the arrest warrant in the following cases:(a) if, in one of the cases referred to in Article 3(2), the act on which the arrest warrant is based does not constitute an offence under the law of the executing State; however, in relation to taxes or duties, customs and exchange, execution of the arrest warrant shall not be refused on the ground that the law of the executing State does not impose the same kind of tax or duty or does not contain the same type of rules as regards taxes, duties and customs and exchange regulations as the law of the issuing State;(b) where the person who is the subject of the arrest warrant is being prosecuted in the executing State for the same act as that on which the arrest warrant is based;(c) where the judicial authorities of the executing State have decided either not to prosecute for the offence on which the arrest warrant is based or to halt proceedings, or where a final judgement has been passed upon the requested person in a State, in respect of the same acts, which prevents further proceedings;(d) where the criminal prosecution or punishment of the requested person is statute-barred according to the law of the executing State and the acts fall within the jurisdiction of that State under its own criminal law;(e) if the executing judicial authority is informed that the requested person has been finally judged by a third State in respect of the same acts provided that, where there has been sentence, the sentence has been served or is currently being served or may no longer be executed under the law of the sentencing country;(f) if the arrest warrant has been issued for the purposes of execution of a custodial sentence or detention order, where the requested person is staying in, or is a national or a resident of the executing State and that State undertakes to execute the sentence or detention order in accordance with its domestic law;(g) where the arrest warrant relates to offences which:(i) are regarded by the law of the executing State as having been committed in whole or in part in the territory of the executing State or in a place treated as such;or(ii) have been committed outside the territory of the issuing State and the law of the executing State does not allow prosecution for the same offences when committed outside its territory.2. Each State shall inform the General Secretariat of the Council for which of the grounds of non-execution of paragraph 1, it has established an obligation for its executing judicial authorities to refuse the execution of an arrest warrant. The General Secretariat shall make the information received available to all States and the Commission.Article 6Political offence exception1. Execution may not be refused on the ground that the offence may be regarded by the executing State as a political offence, as an offence connected with a political offence or an offence inspired by political motives.2. Norway and Iceland, on the one hand, and the European Union, on behalf of any of its Member States, on the other hand, may make, however, a declaration to the effect that paragraph 1 will be applied only in relation to:(a) the offences referred to in Articles 1 and 2 of the European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism;(b) offences of conspiracy or association — which correspond to the description of behaviour referred to in Article 3(3) — to commit one or more of the offences referred to in Articles 1 and 2 of the European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism;and(c) Articles 1, 2, 3 and 4 of the Framework Decision of 13 June 2002 on combating terrorism.3.

Execution may not be refused on the ground that the person claimed is a national of the executing State.2. Norway and Iceland, on the one hand, and the European Union, on behalf of any of its Member States, on the other hand, may make a declaration to the effect that nationals will not be surrendered or that surrender will be authorised only under certain specified conditions.3. Where an arrest warrant has been issued by a State having made a declaration as referred to in paragraph 2, or by a State for which such a declaration has been made, any other State may, in the execution of the arrest warrant, apply reciprocity.Article 8Guarantees to be given by the issuing State in particular casesThe execution of the arrest warrant by the executing judicial authority may be subject to the following conditions:1) where the arrest warrant has been issued for the purposes of executing a sentence or a detention order imposed by a decision rendered in absentia and if the person concerned has not been summoned in person or otherwise informed of the date and place of the hearing which led to the decision rendered in absentia, surrender may be subject to the condition that the issuing judicial authority gives an assurance deemed adequate to guarantee the person who is the subject of the arrest warrant that he or she will have an opportunity to apply for a retrial of the case in the issuing State and to be present at the judgment;2) if the offence on the basis of which the arrest warrant has been issued is punishable by custodial life sentence or life-time detention order the execution of the said arrest warrant may be subject to the condition that the issuing State gives an assurance deemed sufficient by the executing state that it will review the penalty or measure imposed, on request or at the latest after 20 years, or will encourage the application of measures of clemency to which the person is entitled to apply for under the law or practice of the issuing State, aiming at a non-execution of such penalty or measure;3) where a person who is the subject of an arrest warrant for the purposes of prosecution is a national or resident of the executing State, surrender may be subject to the condition that the person, after being heard, is returned to the executing State in order to serve there the custodial sentence or detention order passed against him in the issuing State.Article 9Determination of the competent judicial authorities1. The issuing judicial authority shall be the judicial authority of the issuing State which is competent to issue an arrest warrant by virtue of the law of that State.2. The executing judicial authority shall be the judicial authority of the executing State which is competent to execute the arrest warrant by virtue of the law of that State. At the moment of notification referred to in Article 38(1), a Minister of Justice may be designated as a competent authority for the execution of an arrest warrant, whether or not the Minister of Justice is a judicial authority under the domestic law of that State.3. The Contracting Parties shall inform each other of their competent authorities.Article 10Recourse to the central authority1. The Contracting Parties may notify each other of the central authority for each State, having designated such an authority, or, when the legal system of the relevant State so provides, of more than one central authority to assist the competent judicial authorities.2. In doing so the Contracting Parties may indicate that, as a result of the organisation of the internal judicial system of the relevant States, the central authority(ies) are responsible for the administrative transmission and reception of arrest warrants as well as for all other official correspondence relating thereto. These indications shall be binding upon all the authorities of the issuing State.Article 11Content and form of the arrest warrant1. The arrest warrant shall contain the following information set out in accordance with the form contained in the Annex to this Agreement:(a) the identity and nationality of the requested person;(b) the name, address, telephone and fax numbers and e-mail address of the issuing judicial authority;(c) evidence of an enforceable judgement, an arrest warrant or any other enforceable judicial decision having the same effect, coming within the scope of Articles 2 and 3;(d) the nature and legal classification of the offence, particularly in respect of Article 3;(e) a description of the circumstances in which the offence was committed, including the time, place and degree of participation in the offence by the requested person;(f) the penalty imposed, if there is a final judgment, or the prescribed scale of penalties for the offence under the law of the issuing State;(g) if possible, other consequences of the offence.2. The arrest warrant must be translated into the official language or one of the official languages of the executing State. Any Contracting Party may, when this Agreement is concluded or at a later date, make a declaration to the effect that a translation in one or more other official languages of a State will be accepted.CHAPTER 2SURRENDER PROCEDUREArticle 12Transmission of an arrest warrant1. When the location of the requested person is known, the issuing judicial authority may transmit the arrest warrant directly to the executing judicial authority.2. The issuing judicial authority may, in any event, decide to issue an alert for the requested person in the Schengen Information System (SIS).Such an alert shall be effected in accordance with the relevant provisions of European Union law on alerts in the Schengen Information System on persons for the purpose of surrender. An alert in the Schengen Information System shall be equivalent to an arrest warrant accompanied by the information set out in Article 11(1).3. For a transitional period, until the SIS is capable of transmitting all the information described in Article 11, the alert shall be equivalent to an arrest warrant pending the receipt of the original in due and proper form by the executing judicial authority.Article 13Detailed procedures for transmitting an arrest warrant1. If the issuing judicial authority does not know the competent executing judicial authority, it shall make the requisite enquiries, in order to obtain that information from the executing State.2. If it is not possible to call on the services of the SIS, the issuing judicial authority may call on the International Criminal Police Organisation (Interpol) to transmit an arrest warrant.3. The issuing judicial authority may forward the arrest warrant by any secure means capable of producing written records under conditions allowing the executing State to establish its authenticity.4. All difficulties concerning the transmission or the authenticity of any document needed for the execution of the arrest warrant shall be dealt with by direct contacts between the judicial authorities involved, or, where appropriate, with the involvement of the central authorities of the States.5. If the authority which receives an arrest warrant is not competent to act upon it, it shall automatically forward the arrest warrant to the competent authority in its State and shall inform the issuing judicial authority accordingly.Article 14Rights of a requested person1. When a requested person is arrested, the executing competent judicial authority shall, in accordance with its national law, inform that person of the arrest warrant and of its contents, and also of the possibility of consenting to surrender to the issuing judicial authority.2. A requested person who is arrested for the purpose of the execution of an arrest warrant shall have a right to be assisted by a legal counsel and by an interpreter in accordance with the national law of the executing State.Article 15Keeping the person in detentionWhen a person is arrested on the basis of an arrest warrant, the executing judicial authority shall take a decision on whether the requested person should remain in detention, in accordance with the law of the executing State. The person may be released provisionally at any time in conformity with the domestic law of the executing State, provided that the competent authority of the said State takes all the measures it deems necessary to prevent the person absconding.Article 16Consent to surrender1. If the arrested person indicates that he or she consents to surrender, that consent and, if appropriate, express renunciation of entitlement to the \"speciality rule\", referred to in Article 30(2), shall be given before the executing judicial authority, in accordance with the domestic law of the executing State.2. Each State shall adopt the measures necessary to ensure that consent and, where appropriate, renunciation, as referred to in paragraph 1, are established in such a way as to show that the person concerned has expressed them voluntarily and in full awareness of the consequences. To that end, the requested person shall have the right to legal counsel.3. The consent and, where appropriate, renunciation, as referred to in paragraph 1, shall be formally recorded in accordance with the procedure laid down by the domestic law of the executing State.4. In principle, consent may not be revoked. Each State may provide that consent and, if appropriate, renunciation may be revoked, in accordance with the rules applicable under its domestic law. In this case, the period between the date of consent and that of its revocation shall not be taken into consideration in establishing the time limits laid down in Article 20. Norway and Iceland, on the one hand, and the European Union, on behalf of any of its Member States, on the other hand, may make, at the time of notification provided for in Article 38(1), a declaration indicating that they wish to have recourse to this possibility, specifying the procedures whereby revocation of consent shall be possible and any amendment to them.Article 17Hearing of the requested personWhere the arrested person does not consent to his or her surrender as referred to in Article 16, he or she shall be entitled to be heard by the executing judicial authority, in accordance with the law of the executing State.Article 18Surrender decision1. The executing judicial authority shall decide, within the time limits and under the conditions defined in this Agreement, whether the person is to be surrendered.2. If the executing judicial authority finds the information communicated by the issuing State to be insufficient to allow it to decide on surrender, it shall request that the necessary supplementary information, in particular with respect to Articles 4 to 6, 8 and 11, be furnished as a matter of urgency and may fix a time limit for the receipt thereof, taking into account the need to observe the time limits set in Article 20.3. The issuing judicial authority may at any time forward any additional useful information to the executing judicial authority.Article 19Decision in the event of multiple requests1. If two or more States have issued a European arrest warrant or an arrest warrant for the same person, the decision as to which of the arrest warrants shall be executed shall be taken by the executing judicial authority with due consideration of all the circumstances and especially the relative seriousness and place of the offences, the respective dates of the arrest warrants and whether the warrant has been issued for the purposes of prosecution or for execution of a custodial sentence or detention order.2. The executing judicial authority of a Member State may seek the advice of Eurojust when making the choice referred to in paragraph 1.3. In the event of a conflict between an arrest warrant and a request for extradition presented by a third State, the decision as to whether the arrest warrant or the extradition request takes precedence shall be taken by the competent authority of the executing State with due consideration of all the circumstances, in particular those referred to in paragraph 1 and those mentioned in the applicable convention.4. This Article shall be without prejudice to States' obligations under the Statute of the International Criminal Court.Article 20Time limits and procedures for the decision to execute the arrest warrant1. An arrest warrant shall be dealt with and executed as a matter of urgency.2. In cases where the requested person consents to his surrender, the final decision on the execution of the arrest warrant should be taken within a period of 10 days after consent has been given.3. In other cases, the final decision on the execution of the arrest warrant should be taken within a period of 60 days after the arrest of the requested person.4. Where in specific cases the arrest warrant cannot be executed within the time limits laid down in paragraphs 2 or 3, the executing judicial authority shall immediately inform the issuing judicial authority thereof, giving the reasons for the delay. In such case, the time limits may be extended by a further 30 days.5. The European Union, on behalf of any of its Member States, may make, at the time of notification provided for in Article 38(1), a declaration indicating in which cases paragraphs 3 and 4 will not apply. Norway and Iceland may apply reciprocity in relation to the Member States concerned.6. As long as the executing judicial authority has not taken a final decision on the arrest warrant, it shall ensure that the material conditions necessary for effective surrender of the person remain fulfilled.7. Reasons must be given for any refusal to execute an arrest warrant.Article 21Situation pending the decision1. Where the arrest warrant has been issued for the purpose of conducting a criminal prosecution, the executing judicial authority must:(a) either agree that the requested person should be heard according to Article 22;(b) or agree to the temporary transfer of the requested person.2. The conditions and the duration of the temporary transfer shall be determined by mutual agreement between the issuing and executing judicial authorities.3. In the case of temporary transfer, the person must be able to return to the executing State to attend hearings concerning him or her as part of the surrender procedure.Article 22Hearing the person pending the decision1. The requested person shall be heard by a judicial authority, assisted by another person designated in accordance with the law of the State of the requesting court.2. The requested person shall be heard in accordance with the law of the executing State and with the conditions determined by mutual agreement between the issuing and executing judicial authorities.3. The competent executing judicial authority may assign another judicial authority of its State to take part in the hearing of the requested person in order to ensure the proper application of this Article and of the conditions laid down.Article 23Privileges and immunities1. Where the requested person enjoys a privilege or immunity regarding jurisdiction or execution in the executing State, the time limits referred to in Article 20 shall not start running unless, and counting from the day when, the executing judicial authority is informed of the fact that the privilege or immunity has been waived.2. The executing State shall ensure that the material conditions necessary for effective surrender are fulfilled when the person no longer enjoys such privilege or immunity.3. Where power to waive the privilege or immunity lies with an authority of the executing State, the executing judicial authority shall request it to exercise that power forthwith. Where power to waive the privilege or immunity lies with an authority of another State or international organisation, it shall be for the issuing judicial authority to request it to exercise that power.Article 24Competing international obligationsThis Agreement shall not prejudice the obligations of the executing State where the requested person has been extradited to that State from a third State and where that person is protected by provisions of the arrangement under which he or she was extradited concerning speciality. The executing State shall take all necessary measures for requesting forthwith the consent of the State from which the requested person was extradited so that he or she can be surrendered to the State which issued the arrest warrant. The time limits referred to in Article 20 shall not start running until the day on which these speciality rules cease to apply.Pending the decision of the State from which the requested person was extradited, the executing State will ensure that the material conditions necessary for effective surrender remain fulfilled.Article 25Notification of the decisionThe executing judicial authority shall notify the issuing judicial authority immediately of the decision on the action to be taken on the arrest warrant.Article 26Time limits for surrender of the person1. The person requested shall be surrendered as soon as possible on a date agreed between the authorities concerned.2. He or she shall be surrendered no later than 10 days after the final decision on the execution of the arrest warrant.3. If the surrender of the requested person within the period laid down in paragraph 2 is prevented by circumstances beyond the control of any of the States, the executing and issuing judicial authorities shall immediately contact each other and agree on a new surrender date. In that event, the surrender shall take place within 10 days of the new date thus agreed.4. The surrender may exceptionally be temporarily postponed for serious humanitarian reasons, for example if there are substantial grounds for believing that it would manifestly endanger the requested person's life or health. The execution of the arrest warrant shall take place as soon as these grounds have ceased to exist. The executing judicial authority shall immediately inform the issuing judicial authority and agree on a new surrender date. In that event, the surrender shall take place within 10 days of the new date thus agreed.5. Upon expiry of the time limits referred to in paragraphs 2 to 4, if the person is still being held in custody he shall be released.Article 27Postponed or conditional surrender1. The executing judicial authority may, after deciding to execute the arrest warrant, postpone the surrender of the requested person so that he or she may be prosecuted in the executing State or, if he or she has already been sentenced, so that he or she may serve, in its territory, a sentence passed for an act other than that referred to in the arrest warrant.2. Instead of postponing the surrender, the executing judicial authority may temporarily surrender the requested person to the issuing State under conditions to be determined by mutual agreement between the executing and the issuing judicial authorities. The agreement shall be made in writing and the conditions shall be binding on all the authorities in the issuing State.Article 28Transit1. Each State shall permit the transit through its territory of a requested person who is being surrendered provided that it has been given information on:(a) the identity and nationality of the person subject to the arrest warrant;(b) the existence of an arrest warrant;(c) the nature and legal classification of the offence;(d) the description of the circumstances of the offence, including the date and place.The State, on behalf of which a declaration has been made in accordance with Article 7(2), to the effect that nationals will not be surrendered or that surrender will be authorised only under certain specified conditions, may, under the same terms, refuse the transit of its nationals through its territory or submit it to the same conditions.2. The Contracting Parties shall notify each other of the authority designated for each State responsible for receiving transit requests and the necessary documents, as well as any other official correspondence relating to transit requests.3. The transit request and the information set out in paragraph 1 may be addressed to the authority designated pursuant to paragraph 2 by any means capable of producing a written record. The State of transit shall notify its decision by the same procedure.4. This Agreement does not apply in the case of transport by air without a scheduled stopover. However, if an unscheduled landing occurs, the issuing State shall provide the authority designated pursuant to paragraph 2 with the information provided for in paragraph 1.5. Where a transit concerns a person who is to be extradited from a third State to a State this Article will apply mutatis mutandis. In particular the expression \"arrest warrant\" as defined by this Agreement shall be deemed to be replaced by \"extradition request\".CHAPTER 3EFFECTS OF THE SURRENDERArticle 29Deduction of the period of detention served in the executing State1. The issuing State shall deduct all periods of detention arising from the execution of an arrest warrant from the total period of detention to be served in the issuing State as a result of a custodial sentence or detention order being passed.2. To that end, all information concerning the duration of the detention of the requested person on the basis of the arrest warrant shall be transmitted by the executing judicial authority or the central authority designated under Article 10 to the issuing judicial authority at the time of the surrender.Article 30Possible prosecution for other offences1. Norway and Iceland, on the one hand, and the European Union, on behalf of any of its Member States, on the other hand, may notify each other that, for relations of States with other States to which the same notification applies, consent is presumed to have been given for the prosecution, sentencing or detention with a view to the carrying out of a custodial sentence or detention order for an offence committed prior to his or her surrender, other than that for which he or she was surrendered, unless in a particular case the executing judicial authority states otherwise in its decision on surrender.2. Except in the cases referred to in paragraphs 1 and 3, a person surrendered may not be prosecuted, sentenced or otherwise deprived of his or her liberty for an offence committed prior to his or her surrender other than that for which he or she was surrendered.3. Paragraph 2 does not apply in the following cases:(a) when the person having had an opportunity to leave the territory of the State to which he or she has been surrendered has not done so within 45 days of his or her final discharge, or has returned to that territory after leaving it;(b) the offence is not punishable by a custodial sentence or detention order;(c) the criminal proceedings do not give rise to the application of a measure restricting personal liberty;(d) when the person could be liable to a penalty or a measure not involving the deprivation of liberty, in particular a financial penalty or a measure in lieu thereof, even if the penalty or measure may give rise to a restriction of his or her personal liberty;(e) when the person consented to be surrendered, where appropriate at the same time as he or she renounced the speciality rule, in accordance with Article 16;(f) when the person, after his/her surrender, has expressly renounced entitlement to the speciality rule with regard to specific offences preceding his/her surrender. Renunciation shall be given before the competent judicial authorities of the issuing State and shall be recorded in accordance with that State's domestic law. The renunciation shall be drawn up in such a way as to make clear that the person has given it voluntarily and in full awareness of the consequences. To that end, the person shall have the right to legal counsel;(g) where the executing judicial authority which surrendered the person gives its consent in accordance with paragraph 4.4. A request for consent shall be submitted to the executing judicial authority, accompanied by the information mentioned in Article 11(1) and a translation as referred to in Article 11(2). Consent shall be given when the offence for which it is requested is itself subject to surrender in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement. Consent shall be refused on the grounds referred to in Article 4 and otherwise may be refused only on the grounds referred to in Articles 5, or 6(2) and 7(2). The decision shall be taken no later than 30 days after receipt of the request. For the situations mentioned in Article 8 the issuing State must give the guarantees provided for therein.Article 31Surrender or subsequent extradition1. Norway and Iceland, on the one hand, and the European Union, on behalf of any of its Member States, on the other hand, may notify each other that, for relations of States with other States to which the same notification applies, the consent for the surrender of a person to a State other than the executing State pursuant to an arrest warrant issued for an offence committed prior to his or her surrender is presumed to have been given, unless in a particular case the executing judicial authority states otherwise in its decision on surrender.2. In any case, a person who has been surrendered to the issuing State pursuant to an arrest warrant may, without the consent of the executing State, be surrendered to a State other than the executing State pursuant to an arrest warrant issued for any offence committed prior to his or her surrender in the following cases:(a) where the requested person, having had an opportunity to leave the territory of the State to which he or she has been surrendered, has not done so within 45 days of his final discharge, or has returned to that territory after leaving it;(b) where the requested person consents to be surrendered to a State other than the executing State pursuant to an arrest warrant.

In other cases, the final decision on carrying out the arrest warrant should be taken within 60 days after the arrest. In some circumstances this can be extended by 30 days.\nDouble criminality\nFor offences punishable by a custodial sentence of at least 3 years, the parties can declare that they do not require the condition of double criminality* for 32 categories of offences as long as the offences carry a sentence of at least 3 years.\nThese offences include:\nparticipation in a criminal organisation,\nterrorism,\ntrafficking in human beings,\nsexual exploitation of children and child pornography,\nillicit trafficking in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances,\nillicit trafficking in weapons, munitions and explosives,\ncorruption,\nfraud, including that affecting the EU’s financial interests,\nlaundering of the proceeds of crime,\ncounterfeiting currency, including of the euro,\ncomputer-related crime,\nenvironmental crime, including illicit trafficking in endangered animal species and in endangered plant species and varieties,\nfacilitation of unauthorised entry and residence,\nmurder, grievous bodily injury,\nillicit trade in human organs and tissue,\nkidnapping, illegal restraint and hostage-taking,\nracism and xenophobia,\norganised or armed robbery,\nillicit trafficking in cultural goods, including antiques and works of art,\nswindling,\nracketeering and extortion,\ncounterfeiting and piracy of products,\nforgery of administrative documents and trafficking therein,\nforgery of means of payment,\nillicit trafficking in hormonal substances and other growth promoters,\nillicit trafficking in nuclear or radioactive materials,\ntrafficking in stolen vehicles,\nrape,\narson,\ncrimes within the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court,\nunlawful seizure of aircraft/ships,\nsabotage.\nGrounds for not executing an arrest warrant\nMandatory grounds for refusal:\nJudicial authorities will refuse to carry out an arrest warrant if:\nthe offence is covered by an amnesty;\nthe person has already been tried for the same offence and has served or is serving their sentence;\nthe person cannot be held criminally responsible because of their age.\nOptional grounds for refusal:\nCountries can refuse to carry out an arrest warrant if:\nthe acts are not an offence in the country being asked to carry out the arrest warrant, that is, the executing state (except in relation to taxes, duties, customs and exchange);\nthe person is being prosecuted in the executing state for the same offence;\nthe state has passed a final judgement in respect of the same offence, which prevents further proceedings;\nthe authorities in the executing state have decided not to prosecute the person or have halted proceedings;\nthe criminal prosecution or punishment of the requested person is barred by statute in the executing state;\nthe requested person is a national or resident of the executing state and that state undertakes to carry out the sentence;\nthe offences were committed outside the issuing state or its laws do not permit prosecution for those offences.\nFundamental rights\nThe agreement states that it respects fundamental rights and fundamental legal principles laid down in the European Convention on Human Rights, or Article 6 of the Treaty on European Union.\nIt also states it should not be interpreted as prohibiting the refusal to surrender a person:\nwhere the arrest warrant may have been issued on the grounds of sex, race, religion, ethnic origin, nationality, language, political opinions or sexual orientation;\nwhere that person’s position may be prejudiced for any of these reasons.\nPolitical offence exception\nThe executing state may not refuse to carry out an arrest warrant on the grounds that it regards the offence as political.
