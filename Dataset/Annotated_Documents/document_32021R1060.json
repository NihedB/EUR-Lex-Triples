{"celex_id": "32021R1060", "reference": "30.6.2021\nEN\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\nL 231/159\nREGULATION (EU) 2021/1060 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL\nof 24 June 2021\nlaying down common provisions on the European Regional Development Fund, the European Social Fund Plus, the Cohesion Fund, the Just Transition Fund and the European Maritime, Fisheries and Aquaculture Fund and financial rules for those and for the Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund, the Internal Security Fund and the Instrument for Financial Support for Border Management and Visa Policy\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 177, point (a) of Article 322(1) and Article 349 thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee (1),\nHaving regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions (2),\nHaving regard to the opinion of the Court of Auditors (3),\nActing in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure (4),\nWhereas:\n(1)\nArticle 174 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) provides that, in order to strengthen its economic, social and territorial cohesion, the Union is to aim at reducing disparities between the levels of development of the various regions and the backwardness of the least favoured regions or islands, and that particular attention is to be paid to rural areas, areas affected by industrial transition, and regions which suffer from severe and permanent natural or demographic handicaps. Those regions particularly benefit from cohesion policy. Article 175 TFEU requires the Union to support the achievement of those objectives by the action it takes through the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund, Guidance Section, the European Social Fund, the European Regional Development Fund, the European Investment Bank and other instruments. Article 322 TFEU provides the basis for adopting financial rules determining the procedure to be adopted for establishing and implementing the budget and for presenting and auditing accounts, as well as for checks on the responsibility of financial actors.\n(2)\nIn order to further develop a coordinated and harmonised implementation of Union Funds implemented under shared management, namely the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), the European Social Fund Plus (ESF+), the Cohesion Fund, the Just Transition Fund (JTF), and measures financed under shared management in the European Maritime, Fisheries and Aquaculture Fund (EMFAF), the Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund (AMIF), the Internal Security Fund (ISF) and the Instrument for Financial Support for Border Management and Visa Policy (BMVI), financial rules based on Article 322 TFEU should be established for all these Funds (together referred to as ‘the Funds’), clearly specifying the scope of application of the relevant provisions. In addition, common provisions based on Article 177 TFEU should be established to cover policy -specific rules for the ERDF, the ESF+, the Cohesion Fund, the JTF and the EMFAF.\n(3)\nDue to the specificities of each Fund, specific rules applicable to each Fund and to the European territorial cooperation goal (Interreg) under the ERDF should be laid down in separate Regulations (‘Fund-specific Regulations’) to complement this Regulation.\n(4)\nThe outermost regions should benefit from specific measures and from additional funding to offset their structural social and economic situation together with the handicaps resulting from the factors referred to in Article 349 TFEU.\n(5)\nThe northern sparsely populated regions should benefit from specific measures and additional funding to offset the severe and natural or demographic handicaps referred to in Article 2 of Protocol No 6 to the 1994 Act of Accession.\n(6)\nHorizontal principles as set out in Article 3 of the Treaty on European Union (TEU) and in Article 10 TFEU, including the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality as set out in Article 5 TEU, should be respected in the implementation of the Funds, taking into account the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. Member States should also respect the obligations set out in the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, and in the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, and ensure accessibility in line with Article 9 thereof and in accordance with Union law harmonising accessibility requirements for products and services. In that context, the Funds should be implemented in a way that promotes the transition from institutional to family-based and community-based care. Member States and the Commission should aim at eliminating inequalities and at promoting equality between men and women and integrating the gender perspective, as well as at combating discrimination based on sex, racial or ethnic origin, religion or belief, disability, age or sexual orientation. The Funds should not support actions that contribute to any form of segregation or exclusion, and, when financing infrastructure, should ensure the accessibility for persons with disabilities. The objectives of the Funds should be pursued in the framework of sustainable development and the Union’s promotion of the aim of preserving, protecting and improving the quality of the environment as set out in Article 11 and Article 191(1) TFEU, taking into account the polluter pays principle, the UN Sustainable Development Goals and the Paris Agreement adopted under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (5) (the ‘Paris Agreement’). In order to protect the integrity of the internal market, operations benefiting undertakings are to comply with Union State aid rules as set out in Articles 107 and 108 TFEU. Poverty is a particularly important challenge in the Union. The objectives of the Funds should therefore be pursued with a view to contributing to the eradication of poverty. The objectives of the Funds should be pursued with a view to providing adequate support, in particular to local and regional authorities of coastal and urban areas, to address the socioeconomic challenges linked to the integration of third-country nationals and to providing adequate support to disadvantaged areas and communities in urban areas.\n(7)\nHorizontal financial rules adopted by the European Parliament and the Council on the basis of Article 322 TFEU apply to this Regulation. Those rules are laid down in Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2018/1046 of the European Parliament and of the Council (6) (‘the Financial Regulation’) and determine in particular the procedure for establishing and implementing the Union budget through grants, procurement, prizes, indirect management, financial instruments, budgetary guarantees, financial assistance and the reimbursement of external experts, and provide for checks on the responsibility of financial actors. Rules adopted on the basis of Article 322 TFEU also include a general regime of conditionality for the protection of the Union budget.\n(8)\nWhere a time limit is set for the Commission to take any action towards Member States, the Commission should take account of all necessary information and documents in a timely and efficient manner. Where submissions from Member States in any form under this Regulation are incomplete or non-compliant with the requirements of this Regulation and of Fund-specific Regulations, thus not allowing the Commission to take fully-informed action, that time limit should be suspended until the Member States comply with the regulatory requirements. Further, as the Commission is precluded from making payments for the expenditure incurred by beneficiaries and paid in implementing operations linked to specific objectives for which enabling conditions are not fulfilled, which is included in payment applications, the time limit for the Commission to make payments should not be triggered for such expenditure.\n(9)\nIn order to contribute to Union priorities, the Funds should focus their support on a limited number of policy objectives in line with their Fund-specific missions pursuant to their Treaty-based objectives. The policy objectives for the AMIF, the ISF and the BMVI should be set out in the respective Fund-specific Regulations. The JTF and any resources of the ERDF and the ESF+ that are transferred, on a voluntary basis, as a complementary support to the JTF, should contribute to a single specific objective.\n(10)\nReflecting the importance of tackling climate change in line with the Union’s commitments to implement the Paris Agreement and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, the Funds should contribute to mainstreaming climate actions and to the achievement of an overall target of 30 % of the Union budget expenditure supporting climate objectives. In that context, the Funds should support activities that would respect the climate and environmental standards and priorities of the Union and would do no significant harm to environmental objectives within the meaning of Article 17 of Regulation (EU) 2020/852 of the European Parliament and of the Council (7). Adequate mechanisms to ensure the climate proofing of supported investment in infrastructure should be an integral part of programming and implementation of the Funds.\n(11)\nReflecting the importance of tackling the loss of biodiversity, the Funds should contribute to mainstream biodiversity action in the Union policies and to the achievement of the overall ambition of providing 7,5 % of annual spending under the multiannual financial framework (MFF) to biodiversity objectives in the year 2024 and 10 % of annual spending under the MFF to biodiversity objectives in 2026 and 2027, while considering the existing overlaps between climate and biodiversity goals.\n(12)\nPart of the budget of the Union allocated to the Funds should be implemented by the Commission under shared management with Member States within the meaning of the Financial Regulation. Therefore, when implementing the Funds under shared management, the Commission and the Member States should respect the principles referred to in the Financial Regulation, such as sound financial management, transparency and non-discrimination.\n(13)\nMember States at the appropriate territorial level, in accordance with their institutional, legal and financial framework and the bodies designated by them for that purpose, should be responsible for preparing and implementing programmes. The Union and Member States should refrain from imposing unnecessary rules resulting in excessive administrative burden for beneficiaries.\n(14)\nThe principle of partnership is a key feature in the implementation of the Funds, building on the multi-level governance approach and ensuring the involvement of regional, local, urban and other public authorities, civil society, economic and social partners and, where appropriate, research organisations and universities. In order to provide continuity in the organisation of partnership, the European code of conduct on partnership for Partnership Agreements and programmes supported by the European Structural and Investment Funds established by the Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 240/2014 (8) (the ‘European code of conduct on partnership’) should continue to apply to the Funds.\n(15)\nAt Union level, the European Semester of economic policy coordination, including the principles of the European Pillar of Social Rights, is the framework to identify national reform priorities and monitor their implementation. Member States develop their own national multiannual investment strategies in support of those reforms. Those strategies should be presented alongside the yearly National Reform Programmes as a way to outline and coordinate priority investment projects to be supported by national or Union funding, or both. They should also serve to use Union funding in a coherent manner and to maximise the added value of the financial support to be received, in particular from the Funds, the Recovery and Resilience Facility established by Regulation (EU) 2021/241 of the European Parliament and of the Council (9) and the InvestEU Programme established by Regulation (EU) 2021/523 of the European Parliament and of the Council (10) (the ‘InvestEU Regulation’).\n(16)\nMember States should take into account relevant country-specific recommendations adopted in accordance with Article 121(2) TFEU and relevant Council recommendations adopted in accordance with Article 148(4) of the TFEU and complementary Commission recommendations issued in accordance with Article 34 of Regulation (EU) 2018/1999 of the European Parliament and of the Council (11), and for the AMIF, the ISF and the BMVI other relevant Union recommendations addressed to the Member State in the preparation of programming documents. During the 2021–2027 programming period (‘programming period’), Member States should regularly present to the monitoring committee and to the Commission the progress in implementing the programmes in support of the country-specific recommendations. During a mid-term review, Member States should, among other elements, consider the need for programme modifications to accommodate new challenges identified in relevant country-specific recommendations adopted or modified since the start of the programming period.\n(17)\nMember States should take account of the contents of their integrated national energy and climate plan, to be developed under Regulation (EU) 2018/1999, and the outcome of the process resulting in Union recommendations regarding these plans, for their programmes, including during the mid-term review, as well as for the financial needs allocated for low-carbon investments.\n(18)\nThe Partnership Agreement, prepared by each Member State, should be a concise and strategic document guiding the negotiations between the Commission and the Member State concerned on the design of programmes under the ERDF, the ESF+, the Cohesion Fund, the JTF and the EMFAF. In order to streamline the approval process, the Commission should respect the principle of proportionality in its assessment, particularly concerning the length of the Partnership Agreement and requests for additional information. In order to reduce the administrative burden, it should not be necessary to amend Partnership Agreements during the programming period. However, if the Member State so wishes, it should be able to submit to the Commission one amendment to its Partnership Agreement to take into account the outcome of the mid-term review. To facilitate the programming and avoid overlapping content in programming documents, a Partnership Agreement can be included as part of a programme.\n(19)\nIn order to provide Member States with sufficient flexibility in the implementation of their shared management allocations, it should be possible to transfer certain levels of funding between the Funds and between shared management and direct and indirectly managed instruments. Where the specific economic and social circumstances of a Member State justify it, that level of transfer should be higher.\n(20)\nEach Member State should have the flexibility to contribute to the InvestEU Programme for the provision of the EU guarantee and the InvestEU Advisory Hub for investments in that Member State, under certain conditions set out in this Regulation.\n(21)\nTo ensure the necessary prerequisites for the effective and efficient use of Union support granted by the Funds, a limited list of enabling conditions as well as a concise and exhaustive set of objective criteria for their assessment should be established. Each enabling condition should be linked to a specific objective and should be automatically applicable where the specific objective is selected for support. Without prejudice to the rules on decommitment, where those conditions are not fulfilled, expenditure related to operations under the related specific objectives should not be reimbursed by the Commission. In order to maintain a favourable investment framework, the continued fulfilment of the enabling conditions should be monitored regularly. At the request of a Member State, the EIB should be able to contribute to the assessment of the fulfilment of enabling conditions. It is also important to ensure that operations selected for support are implemented consistently with the strategies and planning documents in place underlying the fulfilled enabling conditions, thus ensuring that all co-financed operations are in line with the Union policy framework.\n(22)\nWhile pursuing the objectives of economic, social and territorial cohesion, support to network connectivity by the ERDF and the Cohesion Fund should aim at completing missing links to the trans-European transport network.\n(23)\nMember States should establish a performance framework for each programme covering all indicators, milestones and targets to monitor, report on and evaluate programme performance. This should allow monitoring, reporting on and evaluating performance during implementation, and contribute to measuring the overall performance of the Funds.\n(24)\nThe Member State should carry out a mid-term review of each programme supported by the ERDF, the ESF+, the Cohesion Fund and the JTF. That review should provide a fully-fledged adjustment of programmes based on programme performance, while also providing an opportunity to take account of new challenges and relevant country-specific recommendations issued in 2024, as well as progress in implementing the integrated national energy and climate plans and the principles of the European Pillar of Social Rights. For the purposes of the mid-term review, the socioeconomic situation of the Member State or region concerned, including any major negative financial, economic or social development or demographic challenges and the progress towards reaching the climate contribution targets at national level should also be taken into account. The Commission should prepare a report about the outcome of the mid-term review, including its assessment of the application of the management costs and fees under financial instruments managed by bodies selected through direct award.\n(25)\nMechanisms to ensure a link between Union funding policies and the economic governance of the Union should be further refined, allowing the Commission to make a proposal to the Council to suspend all or part of the commitments or payments for one or more of the programmes of the Member State concerned where that Member State fails to take effective action in the context of the economic governance process. The obligation of the Commission to propose a suspension should be suspended when and for as long as the so-called general escape clause under the Stability and Growth Pact has been activated. In order to ensure uniform implementation and in view of the importance of the financial effects of measures being imposed, implementing powers should be conferred on the Council which should act on the basis of a Commission proposal. To facilitate the adoption of decisions which are required to ensure effective action in the context of the economic governance process, reversed qualified majority voting should be used. Given the type of operations that are supported by the ESF+ and Interreg programmes, the ESF+ and these programmes should be excluded from the scope of those mechanisms.\n(26)\nIn order to allow for a rapid response to exceptional or unusual circumstances as referred to in the Stability and Growth Pact that may arise during the programming period, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission to adopt temporary measures to facilitate the use of the Funds in response to such circumstances. The Commission should adopt the measures that are most appropriate in light of the exceptional or unusual circumstances that a Member State is facing, while preserving the objectives of the Funds. The Commission should also monitor the implementation and assess the appropriateness of those measures.\n(27)\nIt is necessary to set out common requirements as regards the content of the programmes, taking into account the specific nature of each Fund. Those common requirements can be complemented by Fund-specific rules. Regulation (EU) 2021/1060 of the European Parliament and of the Council (12) (the ‘Interreg Regulation’) should set out specific provisions on the content of Interreg programmes.\n(28)\nIn order to allow for flexibility in programme implementation and reduce administrative burden, limited financial transfers should be allowed between priorities of the same programme without requiring a Commission decision amending the programme. The revised financial tables should be submitted to the Commission in order to ensure up-to-date information on financial allocations for each priority.\n(29)\nIn order to enhance the effectiveness of the JTF, it should be possible that complementary resources from the ERDF and the ESF+ are made available to the JTF on a voluntary basis. Those complementary resources should be provided through a specific voluntary transfer from those funds to the JTF, taking into account the transition challenges set out in the territorial just transition plans, which need to be addressed. Amounts to be transferred should be provided from resources of the categories of region where the territories identified in territorial just transition plans are located. Given these specific arrangements for the use of the JTF resources, only the specific transfer mechanism should apply for the constitution of the JTF resources. Furthermore, it should be clarified that only this Regulation and Regulation (EU) 2021/1060 of the European Parliament and of the Council (13) (the ‘JTF Regulation’) should apply to the JTF and to the resources of the ERDF and the ESF+ transferred to the JTF, which also become JTF support. Neither Regulation (EU) 2021/1060 of the European Parliament and of the Council (14) (the ‘ERDF and CF Regulation’) nor Regulation (EU) 2021/1060 of the European Parliament and of the Council (15) (the ‘ESF+ Regulation’) should apply to the complementary support. Therefore, the ERDF resources transferred as a complementary support to the JTF should be excluded from the basis of calculation of the thematic concentration requirements set out in the ERDF and CF Regulation and from the basis of calculation of minimum allocations to sustainable urban development as set out in the ERDF and CF Regulation. The same applies to the ESF+ resources transferred as a complementary support to the JTF in respect of thematic concentration requirements set out in the ESF+ Regulation.\n(30)\nTo strengthen the integrated territorial development approach, investments in the form of territorial tools, such as integrated territorial investments, community-led local development, referred to as ‘LEADER’ under the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD), or any other territorial tool which supports initiatives designed by the Member State, should be based on territorial and local development strategies. The same should apply to related initiatives such as the Smart Villages. For the purposes of integrated territorial investments and territorial tools designed by Member States, minimum requirements should be set out for the content of territorial strategies. Those territorial strategies should be developed and endorsed under the responsibility of relevant authorities or bodies. To ensure the involvement of relevant authorities or bodies in implementing territorial strategies, those authorities or bodies should be responsible for the selection of operations to be supported, or be involved in that selection. Territorial strategies, when promoting sustainable tourism initiatives, should ensure an appropriate balance between the needs of both residents and tourists, such as interconnecting cycling and railway networks.\n(31)\nIn order to address effectively the development challenges in rural areas, coordinated support from the Funds and the EAFRD should be facilitated. Member States and regions should ensure that the interventions supported through the Funds and the EAFRD are complementary and are implemented in a coordinated manner with a view to creating synergies and in order to reduce the administrative cost and burden for managing bodies and beneficiaries.\n(32)\nTo better mobilise potential at the local level, it is necessary to strengthen and facilitate community-led local development. It should take local needs and potential as well as relevant socio-cultural characteristics into account, and should provide for structural changes, build community capacity and stimulate innovation. The close cooperation and integrated use of the Funds and the EAFRD to deliver local development strategies should be strengthened. It is crucial that local action groups, representing the interests of the community, are responsible for the design and implementation of community-led local development strategies. In order to facilitate coordinated support from different Funds and the EAFRD to community-led local development strategies and to facilitate their implementation, the use of a ‘Lead Fund’ approach should be facilitated. When the EAFRD is selected as a Lead Fund, it should follow the rules established for the ‘Lead Fund’ approach.\n(33)\nIn order to reduce the administrative burden, it should be possible to implement technical assistance linked to programme implementation at the initiative of the Member State through a flat rate based on progress in programme implementation which may also cover horizontal tasks. However, in order to simplify the implementation for the AMIF, the ISF and the BMVI, and for Interreg programmes, only the flat-rate approach should be used. In order to facilitate financial management, Member States should have the possibility to indicate one or more bodies to which related reimbursements should be made. Since those reimbursements are based on the application of a flat rate, verifications and audits should be limited to verifying that the conditions triggering reimbursement of the Union contribution are met but underlying expenditure should not be subject to verification or audit. Nevertheless, where continuity with the 2014-2020 period is preferred, the Member State should also be provided with the possibility to continue receiving reimbursement of eligible costs actually incurred by the beneficiary and paid in implementing operations for technical assistance implemented through one or more separate programmes or one or more priorities within programmes. The Member State should indicate in its Partnership Agreement its choice of the form of Union contribution for technical assistance for the entire programming period. Regardless of the option chosen, it should be possible for technical assistance to be complemented by targeted administrative capacity building measures using reimbursement methods that are not linked to costs. It should also be possible for actions and deliverables as well as corresponding Union payments to be agreed in a roadmap and lead to payments for results on the ground.\n(34)\nWhere a Member State proposes to the Commission that a priority of a programme or a part thereof be supported through a financing scheme not linked to costs, the actions, deliverables and conditions agreed should be related to actual investments undertaken under the shared management programmes in that Member State or region. In that context, the respect of the principle of sound financial management should be ensured. In particular, as regards the appropriateness of the amounts linked to the fulfilment of the respective conditions or the achievement of results, the Commission and the Member State should ensure that resources employed are adequate for the investments undertaken. Where a financing scheme not linked to costs is used in a programme, the underlying costs linked to the implementation of that scheme should not be subject to any verifications or audits because the Commission provides an ex-ante agreement on the amounts linked to the fulfilment of the conditions or the achievement of results in the programme or in a delegated act. Verifications and audits should be limited instead to checking that the conditions or results triggering the reimbursement of the Union contribution are fulfilled.\n(35)\nIn order to examine the performance of programmes, Member States should set up monitoring committees, whose composition should include representatives of relevant partners. For the ERDF, the ESF+, the Cohesion Fund and the EMFAF, annual implementation reports should be replaced by an annual structured policy dialogue based on the latest information and data on programme implementation made available by the Member State. The review meeting should be organised also for programmes covering the JTF.\n(36)\nPursuant to paragraphs 22 and 23 of the Interinstitutional Agreement of 13 April 2016 on Better Law-Making (16), the Funds should be evaluated on the basis of information collected in accordance with specific monitoring requirements, while avoiding an administrative burden, in particular on Member States, and overregulation. Those requirements, where appropriate, should include measurable indicators, as a basis for evaluating the effects of the Funds on the ground. Those requirements should also enable the monitoring of the support of gender equality.\n(37)\nTo ensure availability of comprehensive up-to-date information on programme implementation, effective and timely electronic reporting on quantitative data should be required.\n(38)\nIn order to support the preparation of related programmes and activities of the subsequent programming period, the Commission should carry out a mid-term assessment of the Funds. At the end of the programming period, the Commission should carry out retrospective evaluations of the Funds, which should focus on the impact of the Funds. The results of these evaluations should be made public.\n(39)\nProgramme authorities, beneficiaries and stakeholders in Member States should raise awareness of the achievements of Union funding and inform the general public accordingly. Transparency, communication and visibility activities are essential in making Union action visible on the ground and should be based on true, accurate and updated information. In order for those requirements to be enforceable, programme authorities and, in the event of non-compliance, the Commission should be able to apply remedial measures.\n(40)\nManaging authorities should publish structured information on selected operations and beneficiaries on the website of the programme providing support to the operation, while taking account of requirements for data protection of personal data in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council (17).\n(41)\nWith a view to simplifying the use of the Funds and reducing the risk of error, it is appropriate to define both the forms of Union contribution to Member States and the forms of support provided by Member States to beneficiaries. It should also be possible for managing authorities to provide grants through the form of financing not linked to costs where these grants are covered by reimbursement of the Union contribution based on the same form, in order to increase experience with such a simplification possibility.\n(42)\nAs regards grants provided to beneficiaries, Member States should increasingly make use of simplified cost options. The threshold linked to the obligatory use of simplified cost options should be linked to the total costs of the operation in order to ensure the same treatment of all operations below the threshold, regardless of whether the support is public or private. Where a managing authority intends to propose the use of a simplified cost option in a call for proposals, it should be possible to consult the monitoring committee. Amounts and rates established by Member States need to be a reliable proxy to real costs. Periodic adjustments are a good practice in the context of multiannual programme implementation to take into account factors affecting rates and amounts. In order to facilitate the uptake of simplified cost options, this Regulation should also provide methods and rates that are able to be used without the requirement for Member States to carry out a calculation or define a methodology.\n(43)\nTo enable immediate implementation of flat rates, any flat rate established by Member States in the 2014-2020 period based on a fair, equitable and verifiable calculation method should continue to be applied for similar operations supported under this Regulation without requiring a new calculation method.\n(44)\nIn order to optimise the uptake of co-financed environmental investments, synergies should be ensured with the LIFE programme for the Environment and Climate Action established by Regulation (EU) 2021/783 of the European Parliament and of the Council (18), in particular through LIFE strategic integrated projects and strategic nature projects, as well as with projects funded under Horizon Europe established by Regulation (EU) 2021/695 Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council (19) (the ‘Horizon Europe Regulation’) and other Union programmes.\n(45)\nIn order to provide legal clarity, it is appropriate to specify the eligibility period for expenditure or costs linked to operations supported by the Funds under this Regulation and to restrict support for completed operations. The date from which expenditure becomes eligible for support from the Funds in case of adoption of new programmes or of changes in the programmes should also be clarified, including the exceptional possibility to extend the eligibility period to the start of a natural disaster in case there is urgent need to mobilise resources to respond to such disaster. At the same time, programme implementation should provide for flexibility in relation to the eligibility of expenditure for operations which contribute to the objectives of the programme, regardless of whether they are implemented outside of a Member State or the Union or in the same category of region within a Member State.\n(46)\nIn order to provide the necessary flexibility for implementation of public-private partnerships (PPPs), the PPP agreement should specify when expenditure is considered to be eligible, in particular under which conditions it is incurred by the beneficiary or by the private partner of the PPP, irrespective of who is carrying out the payments in implementing the PPP operation.\n(47)\nTo ensure the effectiveness, fairness and sustainable impact of the Funds, there should be provisions guaranteeing that investments in infrastructure or productive investment are long-lasting and prevent the Funds from being used to undue advantage. Managing authorities should pay particular attention not to support relocation when selecting operations and to treat sums unduly paid to operations not complying with the requirement of durability as irregularities.\n(48)\nWith a view to improving complementarities and simplifying implementation, it should be possible to combine support from the ERDF, the Cohesion Fund and the JTF with support from the ESF+ in joint programmes under the Investment for jobs and growth goal.\n(49)\nIn order to optimise the added value from investments funded wholly or in part through the budget of the Union, synergies should be sought in particular between the Funds and other relevant instruments, including the Recovery and Resilience Facility and the Brexit Adjustment Reserve. Those synergies should be achieved through user-friendly key mechanisms, namely the recognition of flat rates for eligible costs from Horizon Europe for a similar operation and the possibility of combining funding from different Union instruments in the same operation as long as double financing is avoided. This Regulation should therefore set out rules for complementary financing from the Funds.\n(50)\nFinancial instruments should not be used to support refinancing activities, such as replacing existing loan agreements or other forms of financing for investments which have already been physically completed or fully implemented at the date of the investment decision, but rather to support any type of new investments in line with the underlying policy objectives.\n(51)\nThe decision by the managing authorities to finance support measures through financial instruments should be determined on the basis of an ex ante assessment. This Regulation should lay down the mandatory elements of ex ante assessments, for which indicative information available at the date of their completion should be provided, and should allow Member States to make use of the ex ante assessments carried out for the 2014-2020 period, updated where necessary, in order to avoid administrative burden and delays in setting up financial instruments.\n(52)\nIn order to facilitate the implementation of certain types of financial instruments where programme support in the form of grants, including in the form of capital rebates, is envisaged, it is possible to apply the rules on financial instruments on such a combination in one financial instrument operation. However, conditions for such programme support and specific conditions preventing double financing should be set out.\n(53)\nIn full respect of the applicable State aid and public procurement rules that have been clarified during the 2014-2020 programming period, managing authorities should have the possibility to decide on the most appropriate implementation options for financial instruments in order to address the specific needs of target regions. In addition, in order to ensure continuity with the 2014-2020 programming period, managing authorities should have the possibility to implement financial instruments through a direct award of a contract to the EIB and to international financial institutions in which a Member State is a shareholder. Managing authorities should also have the possibility to award contracts directly to publicly-owned banks or institutions fulfilling the same strict conditions as provided for by the Financial Regulation for the 2014-2020 programming period. This Regulation should provide clear conditions in order to ensure that the possibility of direct award remains consistent with the principles of the internal market. In this framework, the Commission should provide support to auditors, managing authorities and beneficiaries with a view to ensuring compliance with State aid rules.\n(54)\nGiven the protracted low-interest rate environment and in order not to unduly penalise bodies implementing financial instruments, it is necessary, subject to active treasury management by these bodies, to enable the financing of negative interest generated as a result of investments of the Funds from resources paid back to the financial instrument. Through active treasury management, the bodies implementing financial instruments should seek to optimise returns and minimise charges, to an acceptable level of risk.\n(55)\nIn accordance with the principle and rules of shared management, Member States and the Commission should be responsible for the management and control of programmes and give assurance on the legal and regular use of the Funds. Since Member States should have the primary responsibility for such management and control and should ensure that operations supported by the Funds comply with applicable law, their obligations in that regard should be specified. The powers and responsibilities of the Commission in that context should also be laid down.\n(56)\nIn order to hasten the start of programme implementation, the roll-over of implementation arrangements from the previous programming period should be facilitated. The use of the computerised system already established for the previous programming period, adapted as required, should be maintained, unless a new technology is necessary.\n(57)\nTo support the effective use of the Funds, EIB support should be available to all Member States at their request. Such support could cover capacity building, support for project identification, preparation and implementation, as well as advice on financial instruments and investment platforms.\n(58)\nA Member State should have the possibility, at its own initiative, to identify a coordinating body to liaise with and provide information to the Commission and to coordinate activities of the programme authorities in that Member State.\n(59)\nTo streamline programme management functions, the integration of accounting functions with those of the managing authority should be maintained for the programmes supported by the AMIF, the ISF and the BMVI, and should be an option for the other Funds.\n(60)\nSince the managing authority bears the main responsibility for the effective and efficient implementation of the Funds and therefore fulfils a wide range of functions, its functions in relation to the selection of operations, programme management and support for the monitoring committee should be set out in detail. Procedures for the selection of operations can be competitive or non-competitive provided that criteria applied and procedures used are non-discriminatory, inclusive and transparent and the operations selected maximise the contribution of the Union funding and are in line with the horizontal principles defined in this Regulation. With a view to pursuing the objective of achieving a climate-neutral Union by 2050, Member States should ensure the climate proofing of investments in infrastructure and should prioritise operations that respect the ‘energy efficiency first’ principle when selecting such investments.\n(61)\nThe synergies between the Funds and directly managed instruments should be optimised. The provision of support for operations that have already received a Seal of Excellence or were co-funded by Horizon Europe with a contribution from the Funds should be facilitated. Conditions already assessed at Union level, prior to the attributing of the Seal of Excellence quality label or the co-funding by Horizon Europe, should not be assessed again, as long as the operations comply with a limited set of requirements established in this Regulation. This should also facilitate following the appropriate rules set out in Commission Regulation (EU) No 651/2014 (20).\n(62)\nTo ensure an appropriate balance between the effective and efficient implementation of the Funds and the related administrative costs and burdens, the frequency, scope and coverage of management verifications should be based on a risk assessment that takes into account factors such as the number, type, size and content of operations implemented, the beneficiaries as well as the level of the risk identified by previous management verifications and audits. Management verifications should be proportionate to the risks resulting from that risk assessment and audits should be proportionate to the level of risk to the budget of the Union.\n(63)\nThe audit authority should carry out audits and ensure that the audit opinion provided to the Commission is reliable. That audit opinion should provide assurance to the Commission on three points, namely the legality and regularity of the declared expenditure, the effective functioning of the management and control systems and the completeness, accuracy and veracity of the accounts. Where an audit based on internationally accepted audit standards providing reasonable assurance has been conducted by an independent auditor on the financial statements and reports setting out the use of a Union contribution, that audit should form the basis of the overall assurance the audit authority provides to the Commission, insofar as there is sufficient evidence of the independence and competence of the auditor in accordance with Article 127 of the Financial Regulation.\n(64)\nA reduction of verifications and audit requirements should be possible where there is assurance that the programme has functioned effectively for the latest two consecutive years, since this demonstrates that the Funds are being implemented effectively and efficiently over a prolonged period of time.\n(65)\nTo reduce the administrative burden on beneficiaries and administrative costs as well as to avoid duplication of audits and management verifications of the same expenditure declared to the Commission, the concrete application of the single audit principle should be specified for the Funds.\n(66)\nIn order to enhance the preventive role of audit, provide legal transparency and share good practice, the Commission should be able to share audit reports at the request of Member States, with the consent of the audited Member States.\n(67)\nIn order to improve financial management, a simplified pre-financing scheme should be provided for. The pre-financing scheme should ensure that a Member State has the means to provide support to beneficiaries from the start of the implementation of the programme.\n(68)\nTo reduce the administrative burden for Member States as well as for the Commission, a schedule of payment applications should be established. Commission payments should be subject to a 5 % retention until the payment of the annual balance of accounts when the Commission is able to conclude that the accounts are complete, accurate and true.\n(69)\nIn order to reduce the administrative burden, the procedure for the annual acceptance of accounts should be simplified by providing simpler arrangements for payments and recoveries where there is no disagreement between the Commission and the Member State.\n(70)\nIn order to safeguard the financial interests and the budget of the Union, proportionate measures should be established and implemented at the level of Member States and the Commission. The Commission should be able to interrupt payments deadlines, suspend interim payments and apply financial corrections where the respective conditions are fulfilled. The Commission should respect the principle of proportionality by taking into account the nature, gravity and frequency of irregularities and their financial implications for the budget of the Union. Where it is not possible for the Commission to quantify precisely the amount of irregular expenditure in order to apply financial corrections linked to individual cases, it should apply a flat-rate or statistically extrapolated financial correction. Suspension of interim payments based on a reasoned opinion issued by the Commission pursuant to Article 258 TFEU, should be possible provided there is a sufficiently direct link between the matter addressed by the reasoned opinion and the expenditure at stake so as to put at risk its legality and regularity.\n(71)\nMember States should prevent, detect and deal effectively with any irregularities, including fraud committed by economic operators. Moreover, in accordance with Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 883/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council (21), and Council Regulations (EC, Euratom) No 2988/95 (22) and (Euratom, EC) No 2185/96 (23), the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) has the power to carry out administrative investigations, including on-the-spot checks and inspections, with a view to establishing whether there has been fraud, corruption or any other illegal activity affecting the financial interests of the Union. The European Public Prosecutor’s Office (EPPO) is empowered, in accordance with Council Regulation (EU) 2017/1939 (24), to investigate and prosecute fraud and other criminal offences affecting the financial interests of the Union as provided for in Directive (EU) 2017/1371 of the European Parliament and of the Council (25). Member States should take the necessary measures to ensure that any person or entity receiving Union funds fully cooperates in the protection of the financial interests of the Union, grants the necessary rights and access to the Commission, OLAF, the Court of Auditors and, in respect of those Member States participating in enhanced cooperation pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2017/1939, EPPO, and ensures that any third parties involved in the implementation of Union funds grant equivalent rights. Member States should swiftly report to the Commission irregularities detected, including fraud, and any follow-up action they have taken with regard to such irregularities and with regard to any OLAF investigations.\n(72)\nTo enhance the protection of the Union’s budget, the Commission should make available an integrated and interoperable information and monitoring system, including a single data-mining and risk-scoring tool to access and analyse the relevant data, and the Commission should encourage its use with a view to a generalised application by Member States.\n(73)\nIn line with the Interinstitutional Agreement between the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission of 16 December 2020 on budgetary discipline, on cooperation in budgetary matters and on sound financial management, as well as on new own resources, including a roadmap for the introduction of new own resources (26), in order to enhance the protection of the Union budget and Next Generation EU against irregularities including fraud, standardised measures to collect, compare and aggregate information and figures on the recipients of Union funding should be introduced for the purposes of control and audit. The collection of data on those ultimately benefiting, directly or indirectly, from Union funding under shared management, including data on beneficial owners of the recipients of Union funding, is necessary to ensure effective controls and audits.\n(74)\nIn order to enhance the protection of the Union’s budget against irregularities, including fraud, it is necessary to process personal data of beneficial owners who are natural persons. In particular, in order to effectively detect, investigate and prosecute such frauds or remedy irregularities, it is necessary to be able to identify beneficial owners who are natural persons that ultimately profit from irregularities, including fraud. For that purpose, and for the sake of simplification and in order to reduce the administrative burden, Member States should be allowed to comply with their obligation regarding information on beneficial owners by using the data stored in the register already used for the purposes of Directive (EU) 2015/849 of the European Parliament and of the Council (27). In that regard, the purposes of processing of personal data of beneficial owners under this Regulation, namely to prevent, detect and correct and report irregularities including fraud, are compatible with the purposes of processing of personal data under the Directive (EU) 2015/849.\n(75)\nIn order to encourage financial discipline, it is appropriate to set out the arrangements for decommitment of budgetary commitments at programme level.\n(76)\nIn order to allow Member States appropriate time to declare to the Commission expenditure up to the available level of resources in the event of the adoption of the new rules or programmes under shared management after 1 January 2021, the amounts corresponding to the allocations not used in year 2021 should be transferred in equal proportions to the years 2022 to 2025 as envisaged under Article 7 of the Council Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2020/2093 (28).\n(77)\nIn order to promote the objectives of the TFEU related to economic, social and territorial cohesion, the Investment for jobs and growth goal should support all regions. To provide balanced and gradual support and reflect the level of economic and social development, resources under that goal should be allocated from the ERDF and the ESF+ on the basis of an allocation key which is predominantly based on gross domestic product (GDP) per capita. Member States whose per capita gross national income (GNI) is less than 90 % of that of the Union average should benefit under the Investment for jobs and growth goal from the Cohesion Fund.\n(78)\nThe resources for the European territorial cooperation goal (Interreg) should be allocated to Member States on the basis of the allocation methodology which takes into account in particular population density in border areas. Additionally, to ensure continuity of existing programmes, specific provisions to define programme areas and the eligibility of regions under the different strands of Interreg should be set out in the relevant Fund-specific Regulation.\n(79)\nObjective criteria should be established for designating eligible regions and areas for support from the Funds. To that end, the identification of the regions and areas at Union level should be based on the common system of classification of the regions established by Regulation (EC) No 1059/2003 of the European Parliament and the Council (29), as amended by Commission Regulation (EU) 2016/2066 (30).\n(80)\nIn order to set out an appropriate financial framework for the ERDF, the ESF+, the Cohesion Fund and the JTF, the Commission should set out the annual breakdown of available allocations per Member State under the Investment for jobs and growth goal, together with the list of eligible regions, as well as the allocations for the European territorial cooperation goal (Interreg).\n(81)\nTrans-European transport network projects under Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing the Connecting Europe Facility and repealing Regulations (EU) No 1316/2013 and (EU) No 283/2014 (the ‘CEF Regulation ‘) are to continue to be financed from the Cohesion Fund via both shared management and the direct implementation mode under the Connecting Europe Facility (CEF). Building on the successful approach of the 2014-2020 programming period, EUR 10 000 000 000 from the Cohesion Fund should be transferred to the CEF for this purpose.\n(82)\nA certain amount of the resources from the ERDF, the ESF+ and the Cohesion Fund should be allocated to the European Urban Initiative which should be implemented through direct or indirect management by the Commission.\n(83)\nWith a view to ensuring an appropriate allocation to categories of region, and as a matter of principle, the total allocations to Member States in respect of less developed, transitional and more developed regions should not be transferable between the categories. Nevertheless, to accommodate Member States’ needs to tackle specific challenges, Member States should be able to request a transfer from their allocations for more developed regions or transition regions to less developed regions and from more developed regions to transition regions and, in such a case, should justify that choice. In order to ensure sufficient financial resources for less developed regions, a ceiling should be established for transfers to more developed regions or transition regions. Transferability of resources between goals should not be possible except for cases strictly set out in this Regulation.\n(84)\nWhere a region was categorised as a more developed region for the 2014-2020 period but is categorised as a transition region for the 2021-2027 period and therefore would receive less support for the 2021-2027 period based on the allocation methodology, the Member State concerned is invited to take this factor into account when deciding on its internal distribution of funding.\n(85)\nWithin the context of the unique and specific circumstances on the island of Ireland, and with a view to supporting North-South cooperation under the Good Friday Agreement, a ‘PEACE PLUS’ cross-border programme is to continue and build on the work of previous programmes, Peace and Interreg, between the border counties of Ireland and Northern Ireland. Taking into account its practical importance, that programme should be supported with a specific allocation to continue support for peace and reconciliation actions, and an appropriate share of the Irish allocation under Interreg should also be allocated to that programme.\n(86)\nIt is necessary to establish the maximum rates of co-financing in the area of cohesion policy by category of region, where applicable, in order to ensure that the principle of co-financing is respected through an appropriate level of public or private national support. Those rates should reflect the level of economic development of regions in terms of GDP per capita in relation to the EU-27 average, while safeguarding no less favourable treatment due to shifts in their categorisation.\n(87)\nWithin the framework of the relevant rules under the Stability and Growth Pact as clarified in the European code of conduct on partnership, Member States may make a duly justified request for further flexibility for the public or equivalent structural expenditure supported by the public administration by way of co-financing of investments.\n(88)\nIn order to supplement or amend certain non-essential elements of this Regulation, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 TFEU should be delegated to the Commission in respect of the amendment of the elements contained in certain Annexes to this Regulation, namely for the dimensions and codes for the types of intervention, the templates for partnership agreements and programmes, the templates for the transmission of data, the template for forecasts of payment applications to the Commission, the use of the emblem of the Union, the elements for funding agreements and strategy documents, the electronic data exchange system between the Member States and the Commission, the templates for the description of the management and control system, for the management declaration, for the annual audit opinion, for the annual control report, for the annual audit report for financial instruments implemented by the EIB or other international financial institutions, for the audit strategy, for payment applications, for the accounts, for detailed rules and the template for the reporting of irregularities and for the determination of the level of financial corrections.\n(89)\nThe power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 TFEU should be delegated to the Commission in respect of the amendment of the European code of conduct on partnership in order to adapt that code of conduct to this Regulation, the definition at Union level of unit costs, lump sums, flat rates and financing not linked to costs applicable to all Member States as well as the establishment of standardised off-the-shelf sampling methodologies.\n(90)\nIt is of particular importance that the Commission carries out appropriate, transparent consultations with all interested parties during its preparatory work, including at expert level, and that those consultations be conducted in accordance with the principles laid down in the Interinstitutional Agreement of 13 April 2016 on Better Law-Making. In particular, to ensure equal participation in the preparation of delegated acts, the European Parliament and the Council receive all documents at the same time as Member States’ experts, and their experts systematically have access to meetings of Commission expert groups dealing with the preparation of delegated acts.\n(91)\nIn order to ensure uniform conditions for the adoption of Partnership Agreements, the adoption or amendment of programmes as well as the application of financial corrections, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission. The implementing powers in relation to the establishment of the breakdown of financial allocations for the ERDF, the ESF+ and the Cohesion Fund should be adopted without committee procedures, given that they merely reflect the application of a pre-defined calculation methodology. Likewise, the implementing powers in relation to the temporary measures for the use of the Funds in response to exceptional circumstances should be adopted without committee procedures, given that the scope of application is determined by the Stability and Growth Pact and limited to the measures set out in this Regulation.\n(92)\nThe implementing powers relating to the template for the final performance report should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council (31). Although the implementing act is of a general nature, the advisory procedure should be used for its adoption, given that it only sets out technical aspects, forms and templates.\n(93)\nSince Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council (32) or any act applicable to the 2014–2020 programming period should continue to apply to programmes and operations supported by the Funds covered under the 2014–2020 programming period and since the implementation period of that Regulation is expected to extend over to the programming period covered by this Regulation and in order to ensure continuity of implementation of certain operations approved by that Regulation, phasing provisions should be established. Each individual phase of the phased operation, which serves the same overall objective, should be implemented in accordance with the rules of the programming period under which it receives funding, while the managing authority may proceed with selecting the second phase on the basis of the selection procedure carried out under 2014-2020 programming period for the relevant operation, provided that it satisfies itself that the conditions set out in this Regulation for phased implementation are complied with.\n(94)\nSince the objectives of this Regulation, namely to strengthen economic, social and territorial cohesion and to lay down common financial rules for part of the budget of the Union implemented under shared management, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States by reason of the extent of the disparities between the levels of development of the various regions and the specific challenges faced by the least favoured regions, the limit on the financial resources of the Member States and regions and the need for a coherent implementation framework covering several Union funds under shared management, but can rather be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 TEU. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives.\n(95)\nThis Regulation respects the fundamental rights and observes the principles recognised in particular by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union.\n(96)\nIn view of the adoption of this Regulation after the start of the programming period, and taking into account the need to implement Union Funds covered by this Regulation in a coordinated and harmonised manner, and in order to allow for its prompt implementation, it should enter into force on the day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union,\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nTITLE

SUPPORT\nCHAPTER I\nSubject matter, definitions and general rules\nArticle 1\nSubject matter and scope\n1.   This Regulation lays down:\n(a)\nfinancial rules for the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), the European Social Fund Plus (ESF+), the Cohesion Fund, the Just Transition Fund (JTF), the European Maritime, Fisheries and Aquaculture Fund (EMFAF), the Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund (AMIF), the Internal Security Fund (ISF) and the Instrument for Financial Support for Border Management and Visa Policy (BMVI) (together referred to as the ‘Funds’);\n(b)\ncommon provisions applicable to the ERDF, the ESF+, the Cohesion Fund, the JTF and the EMFAF.\n2.   This Regulation does not apply to the Employment and Social Innovation strand of the ESF+ or to the direct or indirect management components of the EMFAF, the AMIF, the ISF and the BMVI, except for technical assistance at the initiative of the Commission.\n3.   Articles 5, 14, 19, 28 to 34 and 108 to 112 do not apply to the AMIF, the ISF or the BMVI.\n4.   Articles 108 to 112 do not apply to the EMFAF.\n5.   Articles 14, 15, 18, 19, 21 to 27, 37 to 42, Article 43(1) to (4), Articles 44 and 50, Article 55(1) and Articles 73, 77, 80 and 83 to 85 do not apply to Interreg programmes.\n6.   The Fund-specific Regulations listed below may establish rules to complement this Regulation which shall not be in contradiction with this Regulation:\n(a)\nRegulation (EU) 2021/1060 of the European Parliament and of the Council (33) (the ‘ERDF and CF Regulation’);\n(b)\nRegulation (EU) 2021/1060 of the European Parliament and of the Council (34) (the ‘ESF+ Regulation’);\n(c)\nRegulation (EU) 2021/1060 of the European Parliament and of the Council (35) (the ‘Interreg Regulation’);\n(d)\nRegulation (EU) 2021/1060 of the European Parliament and of the Council (36) (the ‘JTF Regulation’).\n(e)\nRegulation of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing the European Maritime, Fisheries and Aquaculture Fund and amending Regulation (EU) 2017/1004 (the ‘EMFAF Regulation’);\n(f)\nRegulation of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing the Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund (the ‘AMIF Regulation’);\n(g)\nRegulation of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing the Internal Security Fund (the ‘ISF Regulation’);\n(h)\nRegulation of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing, as part of the Integrated Border Management Fund, the Instrument for Financial Support for Border Management and Visa Policy (the ‘BMVI Regulation’);\nIn case of doubt about the application between this Regulation and Fund-specific Regulations, this Regulation shall prevail.\nArticle 2\nDefinitions\nFor the purpose of this Regulation, the following definitions apply:\n(1)\n‘relevant country-specific recommendations’ mean Council recommendations adopted in accordance with Articles 121(2) and 148(4) TFEU relating to structural challenges as well as complementary Commission recommendations issued in accordance with Article 34 of Regulation (EU) 2018/1999, which are appropriate to be addressed through multiannual investments that fall within the scope of the Funds as set out in Fund-specific Regulations;\n(2)\n‘enabling condition’ means a prerequisite condition for the effective and efficient implementation of the specific objectives;\n(3)\n‘applicable law’ means Union law and the national law relating to its application;\n(4)\n‘operation’ means:\n(a)\na project, contract, action or group of projects selected under the programmes concerned;\n(b)\nin the context of financial instruments, a programme contribution to a financial instrument and the subsequent financial support provided to final recipients by that financial instrument;\n(5)\n‘operation of strategic importance’ means an operation which provides a significant contribution to the achievement of the objectives of a programme and which is subject to particular monitoring and communication

The Member State shall submit a proposal to amend the relevant programmes within 2 months of the date of submission of the response referred to in paragraph 3.\n5.   Where the Commission has not submitted observations or where it is satisfied that any observations submitted have been duly taken into account, it shall adopt a decision approving the amendments of the relevant programmes no later than 4 months after its submission by the Member State.\n6.   Where the Member State fails to take effective action in response to a request made in accordance with paragraph 1, within the deadlines set out in paragraphs 3 and 4, the Commission may, within 3 months, following its observations under paragraph 3 or following the submission of the proposal of the Member State under paragraph 4, make a proposal to the Council to suspend part or all of the payments for the programmes or priorities concerned. In its proposal, the Commission shall set out the grounds for concluding that the Member State has failed to take effective action. In making its proposal, the Commission shall take account of all relevant information, and shall give due consideration to any elements arising from and opinions expressed through the structured dialogue under paragraph 14.\nThe Council shall decide on that proposal by means of an implementing act. That implementing act shall only apply with respect to payment applications submitted after the date of the adoption of that implementing act.\n7.   The Commission shall make a proposal to the Council to suspend all or part of the commitments or payments for one or more of the programmes of a Member State where the Council decides in accordance with Article 126(8) or (11) TFEU that a Member State has not taken effective action to correct its excessive deficit, unless it has determined the existence of a severe economic downturn in the euro area or in the Union as a whole within the meaning of Articles 3(5) and 5(2) of Council Regulation (EC) No 1467/97 (42).\n8.   The Commission may make a proposal to the Council to suspend all or part of the commitments or payments for one or more of the programmes of a Member State in the following cases:\n(a)\nwhere the Council adopts two successive recommendations in the same excessive imbalance procedure in accordance with Article 8(3) of Regulation (EU) No 1176/2011 on the grounds that a Member State has submitted an insufficient corrective action plan;\n(b)\nwhere the Council adopts two successive decisions in the same excessive imbalance procedure in accordance with Article 10(4) of Regulation (EU) No 1176/2011 establishing non-compliance by a Member State on the grounds that it has not taken the recommended corrective action;\n(c)\nwhere the Commission concludes that a Member State has not taken measures as referred to in Council Regulation (EC) No 332/2002 (43) and as a consequence decides not to authorise the disbursement of the financial assistance granted to that Member State;\n(d)\nwhere the Council decides that a Member State does not comply with the macroeconomic adjustment programme referred to in Article 7 of Regulation (EU) No 472/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council (44), or with the measures requested by a Council decision adopted in accordance with Article 136(1) TFEU.\n9.

Beneficiaries and bodies implementing financial instruments shall acknowledge support from the Funds, including resources reused in accordance with Article 62, to the operation by:\n(a)\nproviding on the beneficiary’s official website, where such a site exists, and social media sites, a short description of the operation, proportionate to the level of support, including its aims and results, and highlighting the financial support from the Union;\n(b)\nproviding a statement highlighting the support from the Union in a visible manner on documents and communication material relating to the implementation of the operation, intended for the public or for participants;\n(c)\ndisplaying durable plaques or billboards clearly visible to the public, that present the emblem of the Union in accordance with the technical characteristics laid down in Annex IX, as soon as the physical implementation of operations involving physical investment starts or purchased equipment is installed, in respect of the following:\n(i)\noperations supported by the ERDF and the Cohesion Fund the total cost of which exceeds EUR 500 000;\n(ii)\noperations supported by the ESF+, the JTF, the EMFAF, the AMIF, the ISF or the BMVI the total cost of which exceeds EUR 100 000;\n(d)\nfor operations not falling under point (c), displaying at a location clearly visible to the public at least one poster of a minimum size A3 or equivalent electronic display with information about the operation highlighting the support from the Funds; where the beneficiary is a natural person, the beneficiary shall ensure, to the extent possible, that appropriate information is available, highlighting the support from the funds, at a location visible to the public or through an electronic display;\n(e)\nfor operations of strategic importance and operations the total cost of which exceeds EUR 10 000 000, organising a communication event or activity, as appropriate, and involving the Commission and the responsible managing authority in a timely manner.\nWhere an ESF+ beneficiary is a natural person or for operations supported under the specific objective set out in point (m) of Article 4(1) of the ESF+ Regulation, the requirement set out in point (d) of the first subparagraph shall not apply.\nBy derogation from points (c) and (d) of the first subparagraph, for operations supported by the AMIF, the ISF and the BMVI, the document setting out the conditions for support may establish specific requirements for the public display of information on the support from the Funds where this is justified by reasons of security and public order in accordance with Article 69(5).\n2.   For small project funds, the beneficiary shall comply with the obligations under Article 36(5) of the Interreg Regulation.\nFor financial instruments, the beneficiary shall ensure by means of the contractual terms that final recipients comply with the requirements set out in point (c) of paragraph 1.\n3.

Grants provided by Member States to beneficiaries may take any of the following forms:\n(a)\nreimbursement of eligible costs actually incurred by a beneficiary or the private partner of PPP operations and paid in implementing operations, contributions in kind and depreciation;\n(b)\nunit costs;\n(c)\nlump sums;\n(d)\nflat-rate financing;\n(e)\na combination of the forms referred to in points (a) to (d), provided that each form covers different categories of costs or where they are used for different projects forming a part of an operation or for successive phases of an operation;\n(f)\nfinancing not linked to costs, provided such grants are covered by a reimbursement of the Union contribution pursuant to Article 95.\n2.   Where the total cost of an operation does not exceed EUR 200 000, the contribution provided to the beneficiary from the ERDF, the ESF+, the JTF, the AMIF, the ISF and the BMVI shall take the form of unit costs, lump sums or flat rates, except for operations for which the support constitutes State aid. Where flat-rate financing is used, only the categories of costs to which the flat -rate applies may be reimbursed in accordance with point (a) of paragraph 1.\nBy way of derogation from the first subparagraph of this paragraph, the managing authority may agree to exempt some operations in the area of research and innovation from the requirement set out in that subparagraph, provided that the monitoring committee has given prior approval for such an exemption. In addition, allowances and salaries paid to participants may be reimbursed in accordance with point (a) of paragraph 1.\n3.   The amounts for the forms of grants referred to under points (b), (c) and (d) of paragraph 1, shall be established in one of the following ways:\n(a)\na fair, equitable and verifiable calculation method based on:\n(i)\nstatistical data, other objective information or an expert judgement;\n(ii)\nthe verified historical data of individual beneficiaries;\n(iii)\nthe application of the usual cost accounting practices of individual beneficiaries;\n(b)\ndraft budget established on a case-by-case basis and agreed ex ante by the body selecting the operation, where the total cost of the operation does not exceed EUR 200 000;\n(c)\nin accordance with the rules for application of corresponding unit costs, lump sums and flat rates applicable in Union policies for a similar type of operation;\n(d)\nin accordance with the rules for application of corresponding unit costs, lump sums and flat rates applied under schemes for grants funded entirely by the Member State for a similar type of operation;\n(e)\nflat rates and specific methods established by or on the basis of this Regulation or the Fund-specific Regulations.\nArticle 54\nFlat-rate financing for indirect costs concerning grants\nWhere a flat rate is used to cover indirect costs of an operation, it may be based on one of the following:\n(a)\nup to 7 % of eligible direct costs, in which case the Member State shall not be required to perform a calculation to determine the applicable rate;\n(b)\nup to 15 % of eligible direct staff costs, in which case the Member State shall not be required to perform a calculation to determine the applicable rate;\n(c)\nup to 25 % of eligible direct costs, provided that the rate is calculated in accordance with point (a) of Article 53(3).\nIn addition, where a Member State has calculated a flat rate in accordance with point (a) of Article 67(5) of Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013, that flat rate may be used for a similar operation for the purposes of point (c) of this Article.\nArticle 55\nDirect staff costs concerning grants\n1.   Direct staff costs of an operation may be calculated at a flat rate of up to 20 % of the direct costs other than the direct staff costs of that operation, without there being a requirement for the Member State to perform a calculation to determine the applicable rate, provided that the direct costs of the operation do not include public works contracts or supply or service contracts which exceed in value the thresholds set out in Article 4 of Directive 2014/24/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council (49) or in Article 15 of Directive 2014/25/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council (50).\nWhere a flat rate is applied in accordance with the first subparagraph for the AMIF, the ISF and the BMVI, that flat rate shall only be applied to the direct costs of the operation not subject to public procurement.\n2.   For the purposes of determining direct staff costs, an hourly rate may be calculated in one of the following ways:\n(a)\nby dividing the latest documented annual gross employment costs by 1 720 hours for persons working full time, or by a corresponding pro-rata of 1 720 hours, for persons working part-time;\n(b)\nby dividing the latest documented monthly gross employment costs by the average monthly working time of the person concerned in accordance with applicable national rules referred to in the employment or work contract or an appointment decision (both referred to as the employment document).\n3.   When applying the hourly rate calculated in accordance with paragraph 2, the total number of hours declared per person for a given year or month shall not exceed the number of hours used for the calculation of that hourly rate.\n4.   Where annual gross employment costs are not available, they may be derived from the available documented gross employment costs or from the employment document, duly adjusted for a 12-month period.\n5.   Staff costs related to individuals who work on part-time assignment on the operation may be calculated as a fixed percentage of the gross employment costs, in line with a fixed percentage of time worked on the operation per month, with no obligation to establish a separate working time registration system. The employer shall issue a document for employees setting out that fixed percentage.\nArticle 56\nFlat rate financing for eligible costs other than direct staff costs concerning grants\n1.   A flat rate of up to 40 % of eligible direct staff costs may be used in order to cover the remaining eligible costs of an operation. The Member State shall not be required to perform a calculation to determine the applicable rate.\n2.   For operations supported by the ERDF, the ESF+, the JTF, the AMIF, the ISF and the BMVI, salaries and allowances paid to participants shall be considered additional eligible costs not included in the flat rate.\n3.   The flat rate referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article shall not be applied to staff costs calculated on the basis of a flat rate as referred to in Article 55(1).\nArticle 57\nGrants under conditions\n1.   Member States may provide grants under conditions to beneficiaries which are fully or partially repayable as specified in the document setting out the conditions for support.\n2.   Repayments by the beneficiary shall be made under the conditions agreed by the managing authority and the beneficiary.\n3.   Member States shall reuse resources paid back by the beneficiary for the same purpose or in accordance with the objectives of the programme concerned by 31 December 2030, in the form of grants under conditions or of a financial instrument or in another form of support. The amounts paid back and information about their reuse shall be included in the final performance report.\n4.   Member States shall adopt the necessary measures to ensure that the resources are kept in separate accounts or under appropriate accounting codes.\n5.   Union resources paid back by beneficiaries at any time, but not reused by 31 December 2030, shall be repaid to the budget of the Union in accordance with Article 88.\nSection II\nFinancial instruments\nArticle 58\nFinancial instruments\n1.   Managing authorities may provide a programme contribution, from one or more programmes to existing or newly created financial instruments set up at national, regional, transnational or cross border level and implemented directly by, or under the responsibility of, the managing authority which contribute to achieving specific objectives.\n2.   Financial instruments shall provide support to final recipients only for investments in both tangible and intangible assets as well as working capital expected to be financially viable and which do not find sufficient funding from market sources. Such support shall be in compliance with applicable Union State aid rules.\nSuch support shall be provided only for the elements of the investments which are not physically completed or fully implemented at the date of the investment decision.\n3.   Appropriate support from the Funds through financial instruments shall be based on an ex ante assessment drawn up under the responsibility of the managing authority. The ex ante assessment shall be completed before managing authorities make programme contributions to financial instruments.\nThe ex ante assessment shall include at least the following elements:\n(a)\nthe proposed amount of programme contribution to a financial instrument and the estimated leverage effect accompanied by a short justification;\n(b)\nthe proposed financial products to be offered, including the possible need for differentiated treatment of investors;\n(c)\nthe proposed target group of final recipients;\n(d)\nthe expected contribution of the financial instrument to the achievement of specific objectives.\nThe ex ante assessment may be reviewed or updated, may cover part or the entire territory of the Member State, and may be based on existing or updated ex ante assessments.\n4.   Support to final recipients may be combined with support from any Fund or another Union instrument and may cover the same expenditure item. In such a case, the Fund’s support under the financial instrument, which is part of a financial instrument operation, shall not be declared to the Commission for support under another form, another Fund or another Union instrument.\n5.   Financial instruments may be combined with programme support in the form of grants in a single financial instrument operation, within a single funding agreement, where both distinct forms of support shall be provided by the body implementing the financial instrument. In such a case, the rules applicable to financial instruments shall apply to that single financial instrument operation. The programme support in the form of grants shall be directly linked and necessary for the financial instrument and shall not exceed the value of the investments supported by the financial product.\n6.   In the case of combined support under paragraphs 4 and 5, separate records shall be kept for each source of support.\n7.   The sum of all forms of combined support shall not exceed the total amount of the expenditure item concerned. Grants shall not be used to reimburse support received from financial instruments. Financial instruments shall not be used to pre-finance grants.\nArticle 59\nImplementation of financial instruments\n1.   Financial instruments implemented directly by the managing authority may only provide loans or guarantees. The managing authority shall set out the terms and conditions of the programme contribution to the financial instrument in a strategy document which shall include the elements set out in Annex X.\n2.

The terms and conditions of programme contributions to financial instruments implemented in accordance with paragraph 2, shall be set out in funding agreements between:\n(a)\nthe duly mandated representatives of the managing authority and the body implementing a holding fund, where applicable;\n(b)\nthe duly mandated representatives of the managing authority, or, where applicable, the body implementing a holding fund and the body implementing a specific fund.\nThose funding agreements shall include all the elements set out in Annex X.\n6.   The financial liability of the managing authority shall not exceed the amount committed by the managing authority to the financial instrument under the relevant funding agreements.\n7.   The bodies implementing the financial instruments concerned, or in the context of guarantees, the body providing the underlying loans, shall support final recipients, taking due account of the programme objectives and the potential for the financial viability of the investment as justified in the business plan or an equivalent document. The selection of final recipients shall be transparent and shall not give rise to a conflict of interest.\n8.   National co-financing of a programme may be provided either by the managing authority or at the level of holding funds, or at the level of specific funds, or at the level of investments in final recipients, in accordance with the Fund-specific rules. When the national co-financing is provided at the level of investments in final recipients, the body implementing financial instruments shall keep documentary evidence demonstrating the eligibility of the underlying expenditure.\n9.   The managing authority implementing directly the financial instrument pursuant to paragraph 1 of this Article, or the body implementing the financial instrument pursuant to paragraph 2 of this Article, shall keep separate accounts or maintain an accounting code for each priority or, for the EMFAF, each specific objective and, where applicable, each category of region for each programme contribution, and separately for resources referred to in Articles 60 and 62, respectively.\nArticle 60\nInterest and other gains generated by support from the Funds to financial instruments\n1.   Support from the Funds paid to financial instruments shall be placed in accounts in financial institutions domiciled within Member States and shall be managed in line with active treasury management and the principle of sound financial management.\n2.   Interest and other gains attributable to support from the Funds paid to financial instruments shall be used under the same objective or objectives, as the initial support from the Funds, including for the payments of management fees and the reimbursement of management costs incurred by the bodies implementing the financial instrument in accordance with point (d) of Article 68(1), either within the same financial instrument; or, following the winding up of the financial instrument, in other financial instruments or other forms of support for further investments in final recipients, until the end of the eligibility period.\n3.   Interest and other gains referred to in paragraph 2 not used in accordance with that provision shall be deducted from the accounts submitted for the final accounting year.\nArticle 61\nDifferentiated treatment of investors\n1.   Support from the Funds to financial instruments invested in final recipients and any type of income generated by those investments, including resources paid back, which are attributable to the support from the Funds, may be used for differentiated treatment of investors operating under the market economy principle through an appropriate sharing of risks and profits, taking into account the principle of sound financial management.\n2.   The level of such differentiated treatment shall not exceed that which is necessary to create incentives for attracting private resources, established either by a competitive process or an independent assessment.\nArticle 62\nRe-use of resources attributable to the support from the Funds\n1.   Resources paid back, before the end of the eligibility period, to financial instruments from investments in final recipients or from the release of resources set aside for guarantee contracts, including capital repayments and any type of generated income that is attributable to the support from the Funds, shall be re-used in the same or other financial instruments for further investments in final recipients, to cover the losses in the nominal amount of the Funds contribution to the financial instrument resulting from negative interest, if such losses occur despite active treasury management, or for any management costs and fees associated to such further investments, taking into account the principle of sound financial management.\n2.   Member States shall adopt the necessary measures to ensure that the resources referred to in paragraph 1 and paid back to financial instruments during a period of at least 8 years after the end of the eligibility period, are re-used in accordance with the policy objectives of the programme or programmes under which they were set up, either within the same financial instrument or, following the exit of those resources from the financial instrument, in other financial instruments or in other forms of support.\nCHAPTER III\nEligibility rules\nArticle 63\nEligibility\n1.   The eligibility of expenditure shall be determined on the basis of national rules, except where specific rules are laid down in, or on the basis of, this Regulation or the Fund-specific Regulations.\n2.

Where a financial instrument is implemented across consecutive programming periods, support may be provided to, or for the benefit of, final recipients, including management costs and fees, based on agreements made under the previous programming period, provided that such support complies with the eligibility rules of the subsequent programming period. In such cases, the eligibility of expenditure submitted in payment applications shall be determined in accordance with the rules of the respective programming period.\n3.   For point (b) of paragraph 1, if the entity benefiting from the guarantees has not disbursed the planned amount of new loans, equity or quasi-equity investments to final recipients in accordance with the multiplier ratio, the eligible expenditure shall be reduced proportionally. The multiplier ratio may be reviewed, where justified by subsequent changes in market conditions. Such a review shall not have retroactive effect.\n4.   For point (d) of paragraph 1, management fees shall be performance based.\nWhere bodies implementing a holding fund are selected through a direct award of contract pursuant to Article 59(3), the amount of management costs and fees paid to those bodies that can be declared as eligible expenditure shall be subject to a threshold of up to 5 % of the total amount of programme contributions disbursed to final recipients in loans or set aside for guarantee contracts and up to 7 % of the total amount of programme contributions disbursed to final recipients in equity and quasi-equity investments.\nWhere bodies implementing a specific fund are selected through a direct award of contract pursuant to Article 59(3), the amount of management costs and fees paid to those bodies that can be declared as eligible expenditure shall be subject to a threshold of up to 7 % of the total amount of programme contributions disbursed to final recipients in loans or set aside for in guarantee contracts and up to 15 % of the total amount of programme contributions disbursed to final recipients in equity or quasi-equity investments.\nWhere bodies implementing a holding fund or specific funds, or both, are selected through a competitive tender in accordance with the applicable law, the amount of management costs and fees shall be established in the funding agreement and shall reflect the result of the competitive tender.\n5.   Where arrangement fees, or any part thereof, are charged to final recipients, they shall not be declared as eligible expenditure.\n6.

For the purposes of Article 63(3) of the Financial Regulation, the Member State shall identify for each programme a managing authority and an audit authority. Where a Member State entrusts the accounting function to a body other than the managing authority in accordance with Article 72(2) of this Regulation, the body concerned shall also be identified as a programme authority. Those same authorities may be responsible for more than one programme.\n2.   The audit authority shall be a public authority. Audit work may be carried out by a public or private body other than the audit authority under its responsibility. The audit authority and any such body carrying out audit work under the responsibility of the audit authority shall be functionally independent from the auditees.\n3.   The managing authority may identify one or more intermediate bodies to carry out certain tasks under its responsibility. Arrangements between the managing authority and intermediate bodies shall be recorded in writing.\n4.

The managing authority shall ensure that the beneficiary is provided with a document setting out all the conditions for support for each operation including the specific requirements concerning the products or services to be delivered, the financing plan, the time limit for its execution and where applicable, the method to be applied for determining the costs of the operation and the conditions for payment of the support.\n4.   For operations attributed a Seal of Excellence, or operations selected under a programme co-funded by Horizon Europe, the managing authority may decide to grant support from the ERDF or the ESF+ directly, provided that such operations meet the requirements set out in points (a), (b) and (g) of paragraph 2.\nIn addition, managing authorities may apply to the operations referred to in the first subparagraph the categories, maximum amounts and methods of calculation of eligible costs established under the relevant Union instrument. These elements shall be set out in the document referred in paragraph 3.\n5.   When the managing authority selects an operation of strategic importance, it shall inform the Commission within 1 month and shall provide all relevant information to the Commission about that operation.\nArticle 74\nProgramme management by the managing authority\n1.   The managing authority shall:\n(a)\ncarry out management verifications to verify that the co-financed products and services have been delivered, that the operation complies with applicable law, the programme and the conditions for support of the operation, and:\n(i)\nwhere costs are to be reimbursed pursuant to point (a) of Article 53(1), that the amount of expenditure claimed by the beneficiaries in relation to these costs has been paid and that beneficiaries maintain separate accounting records or use appropriate accounting codes for all transactions relating to the operation;\n(ii)\nwhere costs are to be reimbursed pursuant to points (b), (c) and (d) of Article 53(1), that the conditions for reimbursement of expenditure to the beneficiary have been met;\n(b)\nensure, subject to the availability of funding, that a beneficiary receives the amount due in full and no later than 80 days from the date of submission of the payment claim by the beneficiary; the deadline may be interrupted if information submitted by the beneficiary does not allow the managing authority to establish whether the amount is due;\n(c)\nhave effective and proportionate anti-fraud measures and procedures in place, taking into account the risks identified;\n(d)\nprevent, detect and correct irregularities;\n(e)\nconfirm that the expenditure entered into the accounts is legal and regular;\n(f)\ndraw up the management declaration in accordance with the template set out in Annex XVIII.\nFor point (b) of the first subparagraph, no amount shall be deducted or withheld and no specific charge or other charge with equivalent effect shall be levied that would reduce amounts due to beneficiaries.\nFor PPP operations, the managing authority shall make payments to an escrow account set up for that purpose in the name of the beneficiary for use in accordance with the PPP agreement.\n2.   Management verifications referred to in point (a) of the first subparagraph of paragraph 1 shall be risk-based and proportionate to the risks identified ex ante and in writing.\nManagement verifications shall include administrative verifications in respect of payment claims made by beneficiaries and on-the-spot verifications of operations. Those verifications shall be carried out before submission of the accounts in accordance with Article 98.\n3.   Where the managing authority is also a beneficiary under the programme, arrangements for the management verifications shall ensure separation of functions.\nWithout prejudice to paragraph 2, the Interreg Regulation may establish specific rules on management verifications applicable to Interreg programmes. The AMIF, the ISF and the BMVI Regulations may establish specific rules on management verifications that are applicable where an international organisation is a beneficiary.\nArticle 75\nSupport of the work of the monitoring committee by the managing authority\nThe managing authority shall:\n(a)\nprovide the monitoring committee in a timely manner with all information necessary to carry out its tasks;\n(b)\nensure the follow-up of the decisions and recommendations of the monitoring committee.\nArticle 76\nThe accounting function\n1.   The accounting function shall consist of the following tasks:\n(a)\ndrawing up and submitting payment applications to the Commission in accordance with Articles 91 and 92;\n(b)\ndrawing up and submitting the accounts confirming completeness, accuracy and veracity of the accounts in accordance with Article 98, and keeping electronic records of all the elements of the accounts, including payment applications;\n(c)\nconverting the amounts of expenditure incurred in another currency into euro by using the monthly accounting exchange rate of the Commission in the month during which the expenditure is registered in the accounting systems of the body responsible for carrying out the tasks set out in this Article.\n2.   The accounting function shall not comprise verifications at the level of beneficiaries.\n3.   By way of derogation from point (c) of paragraph 1, the Interreg Regulation may establish a different method to convert the amounts of expenditure incurred in another currency into euro.\nArticle 77\nFunctions of the audit authority\n1.   The audit authority shall be responsible for carrying out system audits, audits on operations and audits of accounts in order to provide independent assurance to the Commission regarding the effective functioning of the management and control systems and the legality and regularity of the expenditure included in the accounts submitted to the Commission.\n2.   Audit work shall be carried out in accordance with internationally accepted audit standards.\n3.   The audit authority shall draw up and submit to the Commission:\n(a)\nan annual audit opinion in accordance with Article 63(7) of the Financial Regulation and with the template set out in Annex XIX to this Regulation and, based on all audit work carried out, cover the following distinct components:\n(i)\nthe completeness, accuracy and veracity of the accounts;\n(ii)\nthe legality and regularity of the expenditure included in the accounts submitted to the Commission;\n(iii)\nthe effective functioning of the management and control system;\n(b)\nan annual control report fulfilling the requirements of point (b) of Article 63(5) of the Financial Regulation, in accordance with the template set out in Annex XX to this Regulation, which supports the annual audit opinion referred to in point (a) of this paragraph and sets out a summary of findings, including an analysis of the nature and extent of errors and deficiencies in the systems as well as the proposed and implemented corrective actions and the resulting total error rate and residual error rate for the expenditure entered in the accounts submitted to the Commission.\n4.   Where programmes are grouped for the purpose of audits of operations pursuant to the second subparagraph of Article 79(2), the information required under point (b) of paragraph 3 of this Article may be grouped in a single report.\n5.   The audit authority shall transmit to the Commission system audit reports as soon as the contradictory procedure with the relevant auditees is concluded.\n6.   The Commission and the audit authorities shall meet on a regular basis and, unless otherwise agreed, at least once a year to examine the audit strategy, the annual control report and the audit opinion, to coordinate their audit plans and methods, and to exchange views on issues relating to the improvement of management and control systems.\nArticle 78\nAudit strategy\n1.   The audit authority shall, after consulting the managing authority, prepare an audit strategy based on a risk assessment, taking account of the management and control system description provided for in Article 69(11), covering system audits and audits of operations. The audit strategy shall include system audits of newly identified managing authorities and authorities in charge of the accounting function. Such audits shall be carried out within 21 months of the decision approving the programme or the amendment of the programme identifying such an authority. The audit strategy shall be prepared in accordance with the template set out in Annex XXII and shall be updated annually following the first annual control report and audit opinion provided to the Commission. It may cover one or more programmes.\n2.   The audit strategy shall be submitted to the Commission upon request.\nArticle 79\nAudits of operations\n1.   Audits of operations shall cover expenditure declared to the Commission in the accounting year on the basis of a sample. That sample shall be representative and based on statistical sampling methods.\n2.   Where the population consists of less than 300 sampling units, a non-statistical sampling method may be used on the professional judgement of the audit authority. In such cases, the size of the sample shall be sufficient to enable the audit authority to draw up a valid audit opinion. The non-statistical sampling method shall cover a minimum of 10 % of the sampling units in the population of the accounting year, selected randomly.\nThe statistical sample may cover one or more programmes receiving support from the ERDF, the ESF+, the Cohesion Fund and the JTF and, subject to stratification where appropriate, one or more programming periods according to the professional judgement of the audit authority.\nThe sample of operations supported by the EMFAF, the AMIF, the ISF and the BMVI shall cover operations supported by each Fund separately.\n3.   Audits of operations shall include on-the-spot verification of the physical implementation of the operation only where it is required by the type of operation concerned.\nThe ESF+ Regulation may set out specific provisions for programmes or priorities under point (m) of Article 4(1) of that Regulation. The AMIF, the ISF and the BMVI Regulations may establish specific provisions for audit of operations where an international organisation is a beneficiary. The Interreg Regulation may establish specific rules on audits of operations applicable to Interreg programmes.\nAudits shall be conducted on the basis of the rules in force at the time when the activities within the operation were carried out.\n4.   The Commission is empowered to adopt a delegated act in accordance with Article 114 to supplement this Article by setting out standardised off-the-shelf sampling methodologies and modalities to cover one or more programming periods.\nArticle 80\nSingle audit arrangements\n1.   When carrying out audits, the Commission and the audit authorities shall take due account of the principles of single audit and proportionality in relation to the level of risk to the budget of the Union. This shall be, in particular, in order to avoid duplication of audits and management verifications of the same expenditure declared to the Commission with the objective of minimising the cost of management verifications and audits and the administrative burden on beneficiaries.\nThe Commission and audit authorities shall first use all the information and records referred to in point (e) of Article 72(1), including results of management verifications, and only request and obtain additional documents and audit evidence from the beneficiaries concerned where, based on their professional judgement, this is required to support robust audit conclusions.\n2.   For programmes for which the Commission concludes that the opinion of the audit authority is reliable and the Member State concerned participates in the enhanced cooperation on the establishment of the European Public Prosecutor’s Office, the Commission’s own audits shall be limited to auditing the work of the audit authority.\n3.   Prior to the submission of the accounts for the accounting year in which the operation is completed, the Commission or audit authority shall not carry out more than one audit in respect of operations for which the total eligible expenditure does not exceed EUR 400 000 for the ERDF or the Cohesion Fund, EUR 350 000 for the JTF, EUR 300 000 for the ESF+, or EUR 200 000 for the EMFAF, the AMIF, the ISF or the BMVI.\nOther operations shall not be subject to more than one audit per accounting year by either the audit authority or the Commission prior to the submission of the accounts for the accounting year in which the operation is completed. Operations shall not be subject to an audit by the Commission or the audit authority in any year where there has already been an audit in that year by the Court of Auditors, provided that the results of that Court of Auditors’ audit for such operations can be used by the audit authority or the Commission for the purpose of fulfilling their respective tasks.\n4.   Notwithstanding paragraph 3, any operation may be subject to more than one audit, if the audit authority concludes, based on its professional judgement, that it is not possible to draw up a valid audit opinion.\n5.   Paragraphs 2 and 3 shall not apply where:\n(a)\nthere is a specific risk of irregularity or a suspicion of fraud;\n(b)\nthere is a need to re-perform the work of the audit authority for obtaining assurance as to its effective functioning;\n(c)\nthere is evidence of a serious deficiency in the work of the audit authority.\nArticle 81\nManagement verifications and audits of financial instruments\n1.   The managing authority shall carry out on-the-spot management verifications in accordance with Article 74(1) only at the level of bodies implementing the financial instrument and, in the context of guarantee funds, at the level of bodies delivering the underlying new loans. The managing authority may rely on verifications carried out by external bodies and not carry out on-the-spot management verifications, provided that it has sufficient evidence of the competence of these external bodies.\n2.   The managing authority shall not carry out on-the-spot verifications at the level of the EIB or other international financial institutions in which a Member State is a shareholder.\nHowever, the EIB or other international financial institutions in which a Member State is a shareholder shall provide control reports supporting the payment claims to the managing authority.\n3.   The audit authority shall carry out system audits and audits of operations in accordance with Article 77, 79 or 83, as appropriate, at the level of bodies implementing the financial instrument and, in the context of guarantee funds, at the level of bodies delivering the underlying new loans. The audit results of external auditors of bodies implementing the financial instrument may be taken into account by the audit authority for the purposes of the overall assurance and on this basis, the audit authority may decide to limit its own audit work.\n4.   In the context of guarantee funds, the bodies responsible for the audit of programmes may conduct audits of the bodies providing new underlying loans only when one or more of the following situations occur:\n(a)\nsupporting documents, providing evidence of the support from the financial instrument to final recipients, are not available at the level of the managing authority or at the level of the bodies implementing the financial instrument;\n(b)\nthere is evidence that the documents available at the level of the managing authority or at the level of the bodies implementing the financial instrument do not represent a true and accurate record of the support provided.\n5.   The audit authority shall not carry out audits at the level of the EIB or other international financial institutions in which a Member State is a shareholder, for financial instruments implemented by them.\nHowever, the EIB or other international financial institutions in which a Member State is a shareholder shall provide to the Commission and to the audit authority an annual audit report drawn up by their external auditors by the end of each calendar year. This report shall cover the elements included in Annex XXI, and constitute the basis for the audit authority’s work.\n6.   The EIB or other international financial institutions shall provide to the programme authorities all the necessary documents to enable them to fulfil their obligations.\nArticle 82\nAvailability of documents\n1.   Without prejudice to the rules governing State aid, the managing authority shall ensure that all supporting documents related to an operation supported by the Funds are kept at the appropriate level for a 5-year period from 31 December of the year in which the last payment by the managing authority to the beneficiary is made.\n2.   The time period referred to in paragraph 1 shall be interrupted either in the case of legal proceedings or by a request of the Commission.\nCHAPTER III\nReliance on national management systems\nArticle 83\nEnhanced proportionate arrangements\nThe Member State may apply the following enhanced proportionate arrangements for the management and control system of a programme where the conditions set out in Article 84 are fulfilled:\n(a)\nby way of derogation from point (a) of Article 74(1) and Article 74(2), the managing authority may apply only national procedures to carry out management verifications;\n(b)\nby way of derogation from Article 77(1) regarding system audits and Article 79(1) and (3) regarding audits of operations, the audit authority may limit its audit activity to audits of operations covering a sample based on a statistical selection of 30 sampling units for the programme or group of programmes concerned;\nFor the purposes of management verifications referred to in point (a) of the first subparagraph, the managing authority may rely on verifications carried out by external bodies provided that it has sufficient evidence of the competence of those bodies.\nFor point (b) of the first subparagraph, where the population consists of less than 300 sampling units, the audit authority may apply a non-statistical sampling method in accordance with Article 79(2).\nThe Commission shall limit its own audits to a review of the work of the audit authority through re-performance at its level only, unless available information suggests a serious deficiency in the work of the audit authority.\nArticle 84\nConditions for application of enhanced proportionate arrangements\n1.   The Member State may apply the enhanced proportionate arrangements referred to in Article 83 at any time during the programming period, where the Commission has confirmed in its published annual activity reports, for the last 2 years preceding such a decision by the Member State, that the management and control system of the programme is functioning effectively and that the total error rate for each year is 2 % or below. When assessing the effective functioning of the management and control system of the programme, the Commission shall take into account the participation of the Member State concerned in the enhanced cooperation on the establishment of the European Public Prosecutor’s Office.\nWhere a Member State decides to apply the enhanced proportionate arrangements referred to in Article 83, it shall notify the Commission on the application of such arrangements. In such a case the arrangements shall apply from the start of the subsequent accounting year.\n2.   At the start of the programming period, the Member State may apply the enhanced proportionate arrangements referred to in Article 83, provided that the conditions set out in paragraph 1 of this Article are met with respect to a similar programme implemented in 2014-2020 and where the management and control arrangements established for the 2021-2027 programme build largely on those from the previous programme. In such a case, the arrangements shall apply from the start of the programme.\n3.   The Member State shall establish or update accordingly the description of the management and control system and the audit strategy set out in Article 69(11) and Article 78.\nArticle 85\nAdjustment during the programming period\n1.   Where the Commission or the audit authority conclude, based on the audits carried out and the annual control report, that the conditions set out in Article 84 are no longer fulfilled, the Commission shall request the audit authority to carry out additional audit work in accordance with Article 69(3) and satisfy itself that remedial actions are taken.\n2.   Where the subsequent annual control report confirms that the conditions continue not to be fulfilled, thus limiting the assurance provided to the Commission on the effective functioning of the management and control systems and of the legality and regularity of expenditure, the Commission shall request the audit authority to carry out system audits.\n3.   The Commission may, after having given to the Member State the opportunity to present its observations, inform the Member State that the enhanced proportionate arrangements set out in Article 83 shall no longer be applied from the start of the subsequent accounting year.\nTITLE VII\nFINANCIAL MANAGEMENT, SUBMISSION AND EXAMINATION OF ACCOUNTS AND FINANCIAL CORRECTIONS\nCHAPTER I\nFinancial management\nSection I\nGeneral accounting rules\nArticle 86\nBudgetary commitments\n1.   The decision approving the programme in accordance with Article 23 shall constitute a financing decision within the meaning of Article 110(1) of the Financial Regulation and its notification to the Member State concerned shall constitute a legal commitment.\nThat decision shall specify the total Union contribution per Fund and per year. However, for programmes under the Investment for jobs and growth goal, an amount corresponding to 50 % of the contribution for the years 2026 and 2027 (‘flexibility amount’) per programme in each Member State shall be retained and shall only be definitively allocated to the programme after the adoption of the Commission decision following the mid-term review in accordance with Article 18.\n2.   The budgetary commitments of the Union in respect of each programme shall be made by the Commission in annual instalments for each Fund during the period between 1 January 2021 and 31 December 2027.\n3.

Any repayment due to be made to the budget of the Union shall be effected before the due date indicated in the order for recovery drawn up in accordance with Article 98 of the Financial Regulation. The due date shall be the last day of the second month following the issuing of the order.\n2.   Any delay in effecting repayment shall give rise to interest on account of late payment, starting on the due date and ending on the date of actual payment. The rate of such interest shall be one-and-a-half percentage points above the rate applied by the European Central Bank in its main refinancing operations on the first working day of the month in which the due date falls.\nSection II\nRules for payments to Member States\nArticle 89\nTypes of payments\nPayments shall take the form of pre-financing, interim payments and payments of the balance of the accounts for the accounting year.\nArticle 90\nPre-financing\n1.

By way of derogation from paragraph 2, specific rules on pre-financing for Interreg programmes shall be set out in the Interreg Regulation.\n4.   By way of derogation from paragraph 2, specific rules on pre-financing for programmes supported by the AMIF, the ISF and the BMVI shall be set out in the Fund-specific Regulations.\n5.

The accounts shall include at the level of each priority and, where applicable, by fund and by category of region:\n(a)\nthe total amount of eligible expenditure entered into the accounting systems of the body carrying out the accounting function which has been included in the final payment application for the accounting year and the total amount of the corresponding public contribution made or to be made linked to specific objectives for which enabling conditions are fulfilled and operations linked to specific objectives for which enabling conditions are not fulfilled but contribute to the fulfilment of enabling conditions;\n(b)\nthe amounts withdrawn during the accounting year;\n(c)\nthe amounts of public contribution paid to financial instruments;\n(d)\nfor each priority, an explanation on any differences between the amounts declared pursuant to point (a) and the amounts declared in payment applications for the same accounting year.\n4.   The assurance package shall not concern the total amount of eligible expenditure incurred by beneficiaries and paid in implementing operations or the corresponding public contribution made or to be made linked to specific objectives for which enabling conditions are not fulfilled with the exception of operations that contribute to the fulfilment of enabling conditions.\n5.   The accounts shall not be admissible if Member States have not undertaken the necessary corrections to reduce the residual error rate on the legality and regularity of the expenditure included in the accounts to 2 % or below.\n6.   Member States shall in particular deduct from the accounts:\n(a)\nthe irregular expenditure which has been subject to financial corrections in accordance with Article 103;\n(b)\nthe expenditure which is subject to an ongoing assessment of its legality and regularity;\n(c)\nother amounts as necessary to reduce the residual error rate of the expenditure declared in the accounts to 2 % or below.\nThe Member State may include expenditure under point (b) of the first subparagraph in a payment application in subsequent accounting years once its legality and regularity is confirmed.\n7.   The Member State may correct irregular amounts which it has detected after the submission of the accounts in which the amounts were included by making the corresponding adjustments for the accounting year in which the irregularity is detected, without prejudice to Article 104.\n8.   As part of the assurance package, the Member State shall submit for the last accounting year the final performance report referred to in Article 43 or the last annual performance report for the AMIF, the ISF or the BMVI.\nArticle 99\nExamination of accounts\nThe Commission shall satisfy itself that the accounts are complete, accurate and true by 31 May of the year following the end of the accounting year unless Article 102 applies.\nArticle 100\nCalculation of the balance\n1.   When the Commission determines the amount chargeable to the Funds for the accounting year and the consequent adjustments in relation to the payments to the Member State, it shall take into account:\n(a)\nthe amounts in the accounts referred to in point (a) of Article 98(3) and to which the co-financing rate for each priority is to be applied;\n(b)\nthe total amount of interim payments made by the Commission during that accounting year;\n(c)\nfor the ERDF, the ESF+, the Cohesion Fund, the JTF and the EMFAF, for the years 2021 and 2022, the amount of pre-financing.\n2.   Where there is an amount recoverable from the Member State, it shall be subject to a recovery order issued by the Commission which shall be executed, where possible, by offsetting against amounts due to the Member State in subsequent payments to the same programme. Such a recovery shall not constitute a financial correction and shall not reduce support from the Funds to the programme. The amount recovered shall constitute assigned revenue in accordance with Article 21(3) of the Financial Regulation.\nArticle 101\nProcedure for the examination of accounts\n1.   The procedure set out in Article 102 shall apply in either of the following cases:\n(a)\nthe audit authority has provided a qualified or adverse audit opinion due to reasons linked to the completeness, accuracy and veracity of the accounts;\n(b)\nthe Commission has evidence putting into question the reliability of an unqualified audit opinion.\n2.   In all other cases, the Commission shall calculate the amounts chargeable to the Funds in accordance with Article 100 and make the respective payments or recoveries before 1 July. That payment or recovery shall constitute the acceptance of accounts.\nArticle 102\nContradictory procedure for the examination of accounts\n1.   If the audit authority provides an audit opinion which is qualified or adverse due to reasons linked to the completeness, accuracy and veracity of the accounts, the Commission shall request the Member State to revise these accounts and to resubmit the documents referred to in Article 98(1) within 1 month.\nWhere by the time limit set out in the first subparagraph:\n(a)\nthe audit opinion is unqualified, Article 100 shall apply and the Commission shall pay any additional amount due or proceed to a recovery within 2 months;\n(b)\nthe audit opinion is still qualified or documents have not been re-submitted by the Member State, paragraphs 2, 3 and 4 shall apply.\n2.   If the audit opinion remains qualified due to reasons linked to the completeness, accuracy and veracity of the accounts or if the audit opinion remains unreliable, the Commission shall inform the Member State on the amount chargeable to the Funds for the accounting year.\n3.   Where the Member State agrees with the amount referred to in paragraph 2 of this Artcile within 1 month, the Commission shall pay within 2 months any additional amount due or proceed to a recovery in accordance with Article 100.\n4.   Where the Member State does not agree with the amount referred to in paragraph 2 of this Article, the Commission shall establish the amount chargeable to the Funds for the accounting year. Such an act shall not constitute a financial correction and shall not reduce support from the Funds to the programme. The Commission shall pay within 2 months any additional amount due or proceed to a recovery in accordance with Article 100.\n5.   With regard to the final accounting year, the Commission shall pay or recover the annual balance of the accounts for programmes supported by the ERDF, the ESF+, the Cohesion Fund, the JTF and the EMFAF no later than 2 months after the date of acceptance of the final performance report as referred to in Article 43.\nCHAPTER III\nFinancial corrections\nArticle 103\nFinancial corrections by Member States\n1.   Member States shall protect the Union budget and apply financial corrections by cancelling all or part of the support from the Funds to an operation or programme where expenditure declared to the Commission is found to be irregular.\n2.   Financial corrections shall be recorded in the accounts for the accounting year in which the cancellation is decided.\n3.   The support from the Funds cancelled may be reused by the Member State within the programme concerned except for an operation that was subject of that correction or, where a financial correction is made for a systemic irregularity, for any operation affected by the systemic irregularity.\n4.   The Fund-specific rules for the EMFAF may lay down specific bases for financial corrections by the Member States linked to non-compliance with rules applicable under the Common Fisheries Policy.\n5.   By way of derogation from paragraphs 1, 2 and 3, in operations comprising financial instruments, a contribution cancelled in accordance with this Article, as a result of an individual irregularity, may be reused within the same operation under the following conditions:\n(a)\nwhere the irregularity that gives rise to the cancellation of the contribution is detected at the level of the final recipient, only for other final recipients within the same financial instrument;\n(b)\nwhere the irregularity that gives rise to the cancellation of the contribution is detected at the level of the body implementing the specific fund, where a financial instrument is implemented through a structure with a holding fund, only for other bodies implementing specific funds.\nWhere that irregularity that gives rise to the cancellation of the contribution is detected at the level of the body implementing the holding fund, or at the level of the body implementing the specific fund where a financial instrument is implemented through a structure without a holding fund, the contribution cancelled shall not be reused within the same operation.\nWhere a financial correction is made for a systemic irregularity, the contribution cancelled shall not be reused for any operation affected by the systemic irregularity.\n6.   The bodies implementing financial instruments shall reimburse to Member States programme contributions affected by irregularities, together with interest and any other gains generated by these contributions.\nThe bodies implementing financial instruments shall not reimburse to Member States the amounts referred to in the first subparagraph provided that those bodies demonstrate for a given irregularity that the following cumulative conditions are fulfilled:\n(a)\nthe irregularity occurred at the level of final recipients or, in the case of a holding fund, at the level of bodies implementing specific funds or final recipients;\n(b)\nthe bodies implementing financial instruments carried out their obligations, in relation to the programme contributions affected by the irregularity, in accordance with applicable law and acted with the degree of professional care, transparency and diligence expected from a professional body experienced in implementing financial instruments;\n(c)\nthe amounts affected by the irregularity could not be recovered notwithstanding that the bodies implementing financial instruments pursued all applicable contractual and legal measures with due diligence.\nArticle 104\nFinancial corrections by the Commission\n1.   The Commission shall make financial corrections by reducing support from the Funds to a programme where it concludes that:\n(a)\nthere is a serious deficiency which has put at risk the support from the Funds already paid to the programme;\n(b)\nexpenditure contained in accepted accounts is irregular and was not detected and reported by the Member State;\n(c)\nthe Member State has not complied with its obligations under Article 97 prior to the opening of the financial correction procedure by the Commission.\nWhere the Commission applies flat-rate or extrapolated financial corrections, this shall be carried out in accordance with Annex XXV.\n2.   Before taking a decision on a financial correction, the Commission shall inform the Member State of its conclusions and give the Member State the opportunity to present, within 2 months, its observations and to demonstrate that the actual extent of irregularity is less than the Commission’s assessment. The deadline can be extended if mutually agreed.\n3.   Where the Member State does not accept the conclusions of the Commission, the Member State shall be invited to a hearing by the Commission, in order to ensure that all relevant information and observations are available to form the basis for Commission conclusions on the application of the financial correction.\n4.   The Commission shall decide on a financial correction taking into account the extent, the frequency and financial implications of the irregularities or serious deficiencies, by means of an implementing act within 10 months of the date of the hearing or of the submission of additional information as required by the Commission.\nWhen deciding on a financial correction, the Commission shall take account of all information and observations submitted.\nWhere a Member State agrees to the financial correction for cases referred to in points (a) and (c) of the first subparagraph of paragraph 1 before the adoption of the decision referred to in the first subparagraph of this paragraph, the Member State may reuse the amounts concerned. That possibility shall not apply to a case of a financial correction under point (b) of the first subparagraph of paragraph 1.\n5.   The Fund-specific rules for the EMFAF may lay down specific bases for financial corrections by the Commission linked to non-compliance with rules applicable under the Common Fisheries Policy.\n6.   The Fund-specific rules for the JTF may lay down specific bases for financial corrections by the Commission linked to the under-achievement of targets established for the JTF.\nCHAPTER IV\nDecommitment\nArticle 105\nDecommitment principles and rules\n1.   The Commission shall decommit any amount in a programme which has not been used for pre-financing, in accordance with Article 90, or for which a payment application has not been submitted, in accordance with Articles 91 and 92, by 31 December of the third calendar year following the year of the budget commitments for the years 2021 to 2026.\n2.   The part of commitments still open on 31 December 2029 shall be decommitted if the assurance package and the final performance report for programmes supported by the ERDF, the ESF+, the Cohesion Fund, the JTF and the EMFAF have not been submitted to the Commission by the time limit set out in Article 43(1).\nArticle 106\nExceptions to the decommitment rules\n1.   The amount concerned by decommitment shall be reduced by the amounts equivalent to that part of the budget commitment for which:\n(a)\nthe operations are suspended by a legal proceeding or by an administrative appeal having suspensory effect; or\n(b)\nit has not been possible to make a payment application for reasons of force majeure seriously affecting implementation of all or part of the programme.\nThe national authorities claiming force majeure shall demonstrate the direct consequences of the force majeure on the implementation of all or part of the programme.\n2.

The Member State shall have 2 months to agree to the amount to be decommitted or to submit its observations.\n3.   By 30 June, the Member State shall submit to the Commission an amended financing plan reflecting, for the calendar year concerned, the reduced amount of support over one or more priorities of the programme. For programmes supported by more than one Fund, the amount of support shall be reduced by Fund proportionately to the amounts concerned by the decommitment that had not been used in the calendar year concerned.\nIn the absence of such a submission, the Commission shall amend the financing plan by reducing the contribution from the Funds for the calendar year concerned. That reduction shall be allocated to each priority proportionately to the amounts concerned by the decommitment that had not been used in the calendar year concerned.\n4.   The Commission shall amend the decision approving the programme no later than 31 October.\nTITLE VIII\nFINANCIAL FRAMEWORK\nArticle 108\nGeographical coverage of support for the Investment for jobs and growth goal\n1.

Resources from the ERDF and ESF+ for the Investment for jobs and growth goal shall be allocated among the following three categories of NUTS level 2 regions:\n(a)\nless developed regions, whose GDP per capita is less than 75 % of the average GDP per capita of the EU-27 (‘less developed regions’);\n(b)\ntransition regions, whose GDP per capita is between 75 % and 100 % of the average GDP per capita of the EU-27 (‘transition regions’);\n(c)\nmore developed regions, whose GDP per capita is above 100 % of the average GDP per capita of the EU-27 (‘more developed regions’).\nThe classification of regions under one of the three categories of region shall be determined on the basis of how the GDP per capita of each region, measured in purchasing power standards (PPS) and calculated on the basis of Union figures for the period 2015-2017, relates to the average GDP per capita of the EU-27 for the same reference period.\n3.   The Cohesion Fund shall support those Member States whose gross national income (GNI) per capita, measured in PPS and calculated on the basis of Union figures for the period 2015-2017, is less than 90 % of the average GNI per capita of the EU-27 for the same reference period.\n4.   The Commission shall adopt a decision, by means of implementing act, setting out the list of regions fulfilling the criteria of one of the three categories of region and of Member States fulfilling the criteria of paragraph 3. That list shall be valid from 1 January 2021 to 31 December 2027.\nArticle 109\nResources for economic, social and territorial cohesion\n1.   The resources for economic, social and territorial cohesion available for budgetary commitment for the 2021-2027 period under the MFF shall be EUR 330 234 776 621 in 2018 prices for the ERDF, the ESF+ and the Cohesion Fund, and EUR 7 500 000 000 in 2018 prices for the JTF.\nThe resources referred to in the first subparagraph shall be completed by an amount of EUR 10 000 000 000 in 2018 prices for measures referred to in Article 1(2) of Council Regulation (EU) 2020/2094 (53) for the purposes of the JTF Regulation.

impacts of the transition towards the Union’s 2030 targets for energy and climate and a climate-neutral economy of the Union by 2050, based on the Paris Agreement’ supported by the JTF, intervention fields under any policy objectives may be used, provided they are consistent with Articles 8 and 9 of the JTF Regulation and are in accordance with the relevant territorial just transition plan. For that specific objective, the coefficient for the calculation of support to climate change objectives is set at 100 % for all intervention fields used.\n(2)  Where a Member State’s recognised amount in support for climate objectives under its Recovery and Resilience Plan has been increased following the application of point (e) of Article 18(4) of Regulation (EU) 2021/241, an identical proportionate increase in the level of that Member State’s contribution to its support for climate objectives shall also be applied under cohesion policy.\n(3)  The intervention fields are grouped by policy objectives, but their use is not limited to them. Any intervention field can be used under any policy objective.

Italic, underlined variations or font effects shall not be used.\n1.4.\nThe positioning of the text in relation to the emblem shall not interfere with the emblem in any way.\n1.5.\nThe font size used shall be proportionate to the size of the emblem.\n1.6.\nThe colour of the font shall be reflex blue, black or white depending on the background.\n1.7.\nThe emblem shall not be modified or merged with any other graphic elements or texts. If other logos are displayed in addition to the emblem, the emblem shall have at least the same size, measured in height or width, as the biggest of the other logos. Apart from the emblem, no other visual identity or logo must be used to highlight the support from the Union.\n1.8.\nWhere several operations are taking place at the same location, supported by the same or different funding instruments, or where further funding is provided for the same operation at a later date, at least one plaque or billboard shall be displayed.\n1.9.   \nGraphic standards for the emblem and the definition of standard colours:\n(A)\nSYMBOLIC DESCRIPTION\nAgainst a background of blue sky, twelve golden stars form a circle representing the union of the peoples of Europe. The number of stars is fixed, twelve being the symbol of perfection and unity.\n(B)\nHERALDIC DESCRIPTION\nOn an azure field a circle of twelve golden mullets, their points not touching.\n(C)\nGEOMETRIC DESCRIPTION\nThe emblem has the form of a blue rectangular flag of which the fly is one and a half times the length of the hoist. Twelve gold stars situated at equal intervals form an invisible circle whose centre is the point of intersection of the diagonals of the rectangle. The radius of the circle is equal to one third of the height of the hoist. Each of the stars has five points which are situated on the circumference of an invisible circle whose radius is equal to one eighteenth of the height of the hoist. All the stars are upright, i.e. with one point vertical and two points in a straight line at right angles to the mast. The circle is arranged so that the stars appear in the position of the hours on the face of a clock. Their number is invariable.\n(D)\nREGULATION COLOURS\nThe emblem is in the following colours: PANTONE REFLEX BLUE for the surface of the rectangle; PANTONE YELLOW for the stars\n(E)\nFOUR-COLOUR PROCESS\nIf the four-colour process is used, recreate the two standard colours by using the four colours of the four-colour process.\nPANTONE YELLOW is obtained by using 100 % ‘Process Yellow’.\nPANTONE REFLEX BLUE is obtained by mixing 100 % ‘Process Cyan’ and 80 % ‘Process Magenta’.\nINTERNET\nPANTONE REFLEX BLUE corresponds in the web-palette colour RGB:0/51/153 (hexadecimal: 003399) and PANTONE YELLOW corresponds in the web-palette colour RGB: 255/204/0 (hexadecimal: FFCC00).\nMONOCHROME REPRODUCTION PROCESS\nUsing black, outline the rectangle in black and print the stars in black on white.\nUsing blue (Reflex Blue), use 100 % with the stars reproduced in negative white.\nREPRODUCTION ON A COLOURED BACKGROUND\nIf there is no alternative to a coloured background, put a white border around the rectangle, the width of the border being 1/25th of the height of the rectangle.\nThe principles of the use of the Union emblem by third parties are set out in the Administrative agreement with the Council of Europe regarding the use of the European emblem by third parties (1).\n2.\nThe licence on intellectual property rights referred to in Article 49(6) shall

Elements for applying an extrapolated correction\nWhere extrapolated financial corrections are to be applied, the results of the examination of the representative sample are extrapolated to the rest of the population from which the sample was drawn for the purposes of determining the financial correction.\n2.   Elements for consideration when applying a flat rate correction\n(a)\ngravity of the serious deficiency(-ies) in the context of the management and control system as a whole;\n(b)\nthe frequency and extent of the serious deficiency(-ies);\n(c)\nthe degree of financial prejudice to the Union budget.\n3.   The level of flat rate financial correction is determined as follows:\n(a)\nwhere the serious deficiency(-ies) is so fundamental, frequent or widespread that it represents a complete failure of the system that puts at risk the legality and regularity of all expenditure concerned, a flat rate of 100 % is applied;\n(b)\nwhere the serious deficiency(-ies) is so frequent and widespread that it represents an extremely serious failure of the system that puts at risk the legality and regularity of a very high proportion of the expenditure concerned, a flat rate of 25 % is applied;\n(c)\nwhere the serious deficiency(-ies) is due to the system not fully functioning or functioning so poorly or so infrequently that it puts at risk the legality and regularity of a high proportion of the expenditure concerned, a flat rate of 10 % is applied;\n(d)\nwhere the serious deficiency(-ies) is due to the system not functioning consistently so that it puts at risk the legality and regularity of a significant proportion of the expenditure concerned, a flat rate of 5 % is applied.\nWhere, due to a failure of the responsible authorities to take corrective measures following the application of a financial correction in an accounting year, the same serious deficiency (-ies) is identified in a subsequent accounting year, the rate of correction may, due to the persistence of the serious deficiency(-ies) be increased to a level not exceeding that of the next higher category.\nWhere the level of the flat rate is disproportionate following consideration of the elements listed in section 2, the rate of correction may be reduced.\nANNEX XXVI\nMethodology on the allocation of global resources per Member State – Article 109(2)\nAllocation method for the less developed regions eligible under the Investment for jobs and growth goal - point (a) of Article 108(2)\n1.\nEach Member State's allocation shall be the sum of the allocations for its individual eligible regions, calculated in accordance with the following steps:\n(a)\ndetermination of an absolute amount per year (in EUR) obtained by multiplying the population of the region concerned by the difference between that region's GDP per capita, measured in PPS, and the EU-27 average GDP per capita (in PPS);\n(b)\napplication of a percentage to the above absolute amount in order to determine that region's financial envelope; this percentage shall be graduated to reflect the relative prosperity, measured in PPS, as compared to the EU-27 average, of the Member State in which the eligible region is situated, i.e.:\n(i)\nfor regions in Member States whose level of GNI per capita is below 82 % of the EU-27 average: 2,85 %;\n(ii)\nfor regions in Member States whose level of GNI per capita is between 82 % and 99 % of the EU-27 average: 1,25 %;\n(iii)\nfor regions in Member States whose level of GNI per capita is over 99 % of the EU-27 average: 0,75 %;\n(c)\nto the amount obtained in accordance with point (b) is added, if applicable, an amount resulting from the allocation of a premium of EUR 570 per unemployed person per year, applied to the number of persons unemployed in that region exceeding the number that would be unemployed if the average unemployment rate of all the less developed regions applied;\n(d)\nto the amount obtained in accordance with point (c) is added, if applicable, an amount resulting from the allocation of a premium of EUR 570 per young unemployed person (age group 15-24) per year, applied to the number of young persons unemployed in that region exceeding the number that would be unemployed if the average youth unemployment rate of all less developed regions applied;\n(e)\nto the amount obtained in accordance with point (d) is added, if applicable, an amount resulting from the allocation of a premium of EUR 270 per person (age group 25-64) per year, applied to the number of persons in that region that would need to be subtracted in order to reach the average level of low education rate (less than primary, primary and lower secondary education) of all less developed regions;\n(f)\nto the amount obtained in accordance with point (e) is added, if applicable, an amount of EUR 1 per tonne of CO2 equivalent per year applied to the population share of the region of the number of tonnes of CO2 equivalent by which the Member State exceeds the target of greenhouse gas emissions outside the emissions trading scheme set for 2030 as proposed by the Commission in 2016;\n(g)\nto the amount obtained in accordance with point (f) is added, an amount resulting from the allocation of a premium of EUR 405 per person per year, applied to the population share of the regions of net migration from outside the Union to the Member State since 1 January 2014.\nAllocation method for transition regions eligible under the Investment for jobs and growth goal - point (b) of Article 108(2)\n2.\nEach Member State's allocation shall be the sum of the allocations for its individual eligible regions, calculated in accordance with the following steps:\n(a)\ndetermination of the minimum and maximum theoretical aid intensity for each eligible transition region. The minimum level of support is determined by the initial average per capita aid intensity of all more developed regions, i.e. EUR 15,2 per head and per year. The maximum level of support refers to a theoretical region with a GDP per head of 75 % of the EU-27 average and is calculated using the method defined in points (a) and (b) of paragraph 1. Of the amount obtained by this method, 60 % is taken into account;\n(b)\ncalculation of initial regional allocations, taking into account regional GDP per capita (in PPS) through a linear interpolation of the region's relative GDP per capita compared to EU-27;\n(c)\nto the amount obtained in accordance with point (b) is added, if applicable, an amount resulting from the allocation of a premium of EUR 560 per unemployed person per year, applied to the number of persons unemployed in that region exceeding the number that would be unemployed if the average unemployment rate of all the less developed regions applied;\n(d)\nto the amount obtained in accordance with point (c) is added, if applicable, an amount resulting from the allocation of a premium of EUR 560 per young unemployed person (aged 15 to 24) per year, applied to the number of young persons unemployed in that region exceeding the number that would be unemployed if the average youth unemployment rate of all less developed regions applied;\n(e)\nto the amount obtained in accordance with point (d) is added, if applicable, an amount resulting from the allocation of a premium of EUR 250 per person (aged 25 to 64) per year, applied to the number of persons in that region that would need to be subtracted in order to reach the average level of low education rate (less than primary, primary and lower secondary education) of all less developed regions;\n(f)\nto the amount obtained in accordance with point (e) is added, if applicable, an amount of EUR 1 per tonne of CO2 equivalent per year applied to the population share of the region of the number of tonnes of CO2 equivalent by which the Member State exceeds the target of greenhouse gas emissions outside the emissions trading scheme set for 2030 as proposed by the Commission in 2016;\n(g)\nto the amount obtained in accordance with point (f) is added, an amount resulting from the allocation of a premium of EUR 405 per person per year, applied to the population share of the region of net migration from outside the Union to the Member State since 1 January 2014.\nAllocation method for the more developed regions eligible under the Investment for jobs and growth goal - point (c) of Article 108(2)\n3.\nThe total initial theoretical financial envelope shall be obtained by multiplying an aid intensity per head and per year of EUR 15,2 by the eligible population.\n4.\nThe share of each Member State concerned shall be the sum of the shares of its eligible regions, which are determined on the basis of the following criteria, weighted as indicated:\n(a)\ntotal regional population (weighting 20 %);\n(b)\nnumber of unemployed people in NUTS level 2 regions with an unemployment rate above the average of all more developed regions (weighting 12,5 %);\n(c)\nemployment to be added to reach the average employment rate (aged 20 to 64) of all more developed regions (weighting 20 %);\n(d)\nnumber of persons aged 30 to 34 with tertiary educational attainment to be added to reach the average tertiary educational attainment rate (aged 30 to 34) of all more developed regions (weighting 22,5 %);\n(e)\nnumber of early leavers from education and training (aged 18 to 24) to be subtracted to reach the average rate of early leavers from education and training (aged 18 to 24) of all more developed regions (weighting 15 %);\n(f)\ndifference between the observed GDP of the region (measured in PPS), and the theoretical regional GDP if the region were to have the same GDP per head as the most prosperous NUTS level 2 region (weighting 7,5 %);\n(g)\npopulation of NUTS level 3 regions with a population density below 12,5 inhabitants/km2 (weighting 2,5 %).\n5.\nTo the amounts by NUTS level 2 region obtained in accordance with point (4) is added, if applicable, an amount of EUR 1 per tonne of CO2 equivalent per year applied to the population share of the region of the number of tonnes of CO2 equivalent by which the Member State exceeds the target of greenhouse gas emissions outside the emissions trading scheme set for 2030 as proposed by the Commission in 2016.\n6.\nTo the amounts by NUTS level 2 region obtained in accordance with point (5) is added, an amount resulting from the allocation of a premium of EUR 405 per person per year, applied to the population share of the region of net migration from outside the Union to the Member State since 1 January 2014.\nAllocation method for the Member States eligible for the Cohesion Fund - Article 108(3)\n7.\nThe financial envelope shall be obtained by multiplying the average aid intensity per head and per year of EUR 62,9 by the eligible population. Each eligible Member State's allocation of this theoretical financial envelope corresponds to a percentage based on its population, surface area and national prosperity, and shall be obtained by applying the following steps:\n(a)\ncalculation of the arithmetical average of that Member State's population and surface area shares of the total population and surface area of all the eligible Member States. If, however, a Member State's share of total population exceeds its share of total surface area by a factor of five or more, reflecting an extremely high population density, only the share of total population shall be used for this step;\n(b)\nadjustment of the percentage figures so obtained by a coefficient representing one third of the percentage by which that Member State's GNI per capita (in PPS) for the 2015-2017 period exceeds or falls below the average GNI per capita of all the eligible Member States (average expressed as 100 %).\nFor each eligible Member State, the share of the Cohesion Fund shall not be higher than one third of the total allocation minus the allocation for the European territorial cooperation goal (Interreg) after the application of paragraphs 10 to 16. This adjustment shall proportionally increase all other transfers resulting from paragraphs 1 to 6.\nAllocation method for the European territorial cooperation goal (Interreg) – Article 12\n8.\nThe allocation of resources by Member State, covering cross-border, transnational and outermost regions' cooperation is determined as the weighted sum of the shares determined on the basis of the following criteria, weighted as indicated:\n(a)\ntotal population of all NUTS level 3 border regions and of other NUTS level 3 regions of which at least half of the regional population lives within 25 kilometres of the border (weighting 45,8 %);\n(b)\npopulation living within 25 kilometres of the borders (weighting 30,5 %);\n(c)\ntotal population of the Member States (weighting 20 %);\n(d)\ntotal population of outermost regions (weighting 3,7 %).\nThe share of the cross-border strand corresponds to the sum of the weights of criteria (a) and (b). The share of the transnational strand corresponds to the weight of criterion (c). The share of the outermost regions' cooperation corresponds to the weight of criterion (d).\nAllocation method for the additional funding for the outermost regions identified in Article 349 TFEU and the NUTS level 2 regions fulfilling the criteria laid down in Article 2 of Protocol No 6 to the 1994 Act of Accession – point (e) of Article 110(1)\n9.\nAn additional special allocation corresponding to an aid intensity of EUR 40 per inhabitant per year shall be allocated to the outermost NUTS level 2 regions and the northern sparsely populated NUTS level 2 regions. That allocation will be distributed per region and Member State in a manner proportional to the total population of those regions.\nMinimum and maximum levels of transfers from the funds supporting economic, social and territorial cohesion\n10.\nIn order to contribute to achieving adequate concentration of cohesion funding on the least developed regions and Member States and to the reduction of disparities in average per capita aid intensities, the maximum level of transfer (capping) from the Funds to each individual Member State shall be determined as a percentage of the GDP of the Member State, whereby these percentages will be as follows:\n(a)\nfor Member States whose average GNI per capita (in PPS) for the 2015-2017 period is under 55 % of the EU-27 average per capita: 2,3 % of their GDP;\n(b)\nfor Member States whose average GNI per capita (in PPS) for the 2015-2017 period is equal to or above 68 % of the EU-27 average per capita: 1,5 % of their GDP;\n(c)\nfor Member States whose average GNI per capita (in PPS) for the 2015-2017 period is equal to or above 55 % and below 68 % of the EU-27 average per capita: the percentage is obtained through a linear interpolation between 2,3 % and 1,5 % of their GDP leading to a proportional reduction of the capping percentage in line with the increase in prosperity.\nThe capping shall be applied on an annual basis to the GDP projections of the Commission, and shall - if applicable - proportionally reduce all transfers (except for the more developed regions and European territorial cooperation goal (Interreg)) to the Member State concerned in order to obtain the maximum level of transfer.\n11.\nThe rules described in paragraph 10 shall not result in allocations per Member State higher than 107 % of their level in real terms for the 2014-2020 programming period. That adjustment shall be applied proportionately to all transfers (except for the European territorial cooperation goal (Interreg)) to the Member State concerned in order to obtain the maximum level of transfer.\n12.\nThe minimum total allocation from the Funds for a Member State shall correspond to 76 % of its individual 2014-2020 total allocation. The minimum total allocation from the Funds for a Member State where at least one third of the population lives in NUTS level 2 regions with a GDP per capita (in PPS) of less than 50 % of the EU-27 average, shall correspond to 85 % of its individual 2014-2020 total allocation. The adjustments needed to fulfil this requirement shall be applied proportionally to the allocations from the Funds, excluding the allocations under the European territorial cooperation goal (Interreg).\n13.\nThe maximum total allocation from the Funds for a Member State having a GNI per capita (in PPS) of at least 120 % of the EU-27 average shall correspond to 80 % of its individual 2014-2020 total allocation. The maximum total allocation from the funds for a Member State having a GNI per capita (in PPS) equal to or above 110 % and below 120 % of the EU-27 average shall correspond to 90 % of its individual 2014-2020 total allocation. The adjustments needed to fulfil this requirement shall be applied proportionally to the allocations from the Funds, excluding the allocation under the European territorial cooperation goal (Interreg). If a Member State has transition regions for which paragraph 16 applies, 25 % of that Member State's allocation for the more developed regions shall be transferred to the allocation of that Member State's transition regions.\nAdditional provisions\n14.\nFor all regions that were classified as less developed regions for the 2014-2020 programming period, but whose GDP per capita is above 75 % of the EU-27 average per capita, the minimum yearly level of support under the Investment for jobs and growth goal shall correspond to 60 % of their former indicative average annual allocation under the Investment for jobs and growth goal, calculated by the Commission within the multiannual financial framework 2014-2020.\n15.\nNo transition region shall receive less than what it would have received if it had been a more developed region.\n16.\nThe minimum total allocation of a Member State for its transition regions, which were already transition regions in 2014-2020, shall correspond to a minimum of 65 % of the total 2014-2020 allocation for these regions in that Member State.\n17.\nNotwithstanding paragraphs 10 to 13, additional allocations as set out in paragraphs 18 to 23 shall apply.\n18.\nA total of EUR 120 000 000 shall be allocated for the PEACE PLUS programme where it is acting in support of peace and reconciliation and of the continuation of North-South cross border co-operation. In addition, at least EUR 60 000 000 shall be allocated for the PEACE PLUS programme from the allocation for Ireland under the European territorial cooperation goal (Interreg).\n19.\nWhere the population of a Member State has declined, on average, by more than 1% per year, between the periods 2007-2009 and 2016-2018, that Member State shall receive an additional allocation equivalent to the total fall in its population between those two periods multiplied by EUR 500. Where applicable, that additional allocation shall be allocated to the less developed regions in the Member State concerned.\n20.\nThe less developed regions of the Member States which have only started receiving support from the Funds in the 2014-2020 programming period, shall receive an additional allocation of EUR 400 000 000.\n21.\nIn order to recognise the challenges posed by the situation of island Member States and the remoteness of certain parts of the Union, Malta and Cyprus shall receive an additional allocation of EUR 100 000 000 each for the Structural Funds under the Investment for jobs and growth goal. The northern sparsely populated areas of Finland shall receive an additional allocation of EUR 100 000 000 to the amount referred to in paragraph 9.\n22.\nIn order to boost competitiveness, growth and job creation in certain Member States, the Funds shall provide the following additional allocations under the Investment for jobs and growth goal:\n(a)\nEUR 200 000 000 for the transition regions in Belgium;\n(b)\nEUR 200 000 000 for the less developed regions in Bulgaria;\n(c)\nEUR 1 550 000 000 for Czechia under the Cohesion Fund;\n(d)\nEUR 100 000 000 for Cyprus under the Structural Funds;\n(e)\nEUR 50 000 000 for Estonia under the Structural Funds;\n(f)\nEUR 650 000 000 for the transition regions of Germany affected by paragraph 16;\n(g)\nEUR 50 000 000 for Malta under the Structural Funds;\n(h)\nEUR 600 000 000 for the less developed regions in Poland;\n(i)\nEUR 300 000 000 for the transition regions in Portugal;\n(j)\nEUR 350 000 000 for the more developed region of Slovenia.\n23.\nAn additional EUR 100 million shall support cross-border cooperation. It shall complete the allocations of resources by Member States pursuant to the weighted criteria detailed in points (a) and (b) of paragraph 8.", "summary": "Common rules on EU funds (2021–2027)\nCommon rules on EU funds (2021–2027)\nSUMMARY OF:\nRegulation (EU) 2021/1060 laying down common provisions on the European Regional Development Fund, the European Social Fund Plus, the Cohesion Fund, the Just Transition Fund and the European Maritime, Fisheries and Aquaculture Fund and financial rules for those and for the Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund, the Internal Security Fund and the Instrument for Financial Support for Border Management and Visa Policy\nWHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?\n              \nKnown as the Common Provisions Regulation, it sets out a set of common financial rules applying to the following sources of European Union (EU) funding, as well as additional common provisions for the funds marked with an asterisk (*):\nthe European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) (*),\nthe European Social Fund Plus (ESF+) (*),\nthe Cohesion Fund (*),\nthe Just Transition Fund (JTF) (*),\nthe European Maritime, Fisheries and Aquaculture Fund (EMFAF) (*),\nthe Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund (AMIF),\nthe Internal Security Fund (ISF), and\nthe Instrument for Financial Support for Border Management and Visa Policy.\nKEY POINTS\n5 policy objectives\nThe ERDF, the ESF+, the Cohesion Fund and the EMFAF support the following policy objectives:\na more competitive and smarter Europe, promoting innovative and smart economic transformationregional ICT connectivity;\na greener, low-carbon economy, transitioning towards net zero carbon, promoting a clean and fair energy transitiongreen investment (related to conserving natural resources)blue investment (related to oceans, seas and coasts)the circular economyclimate change mitigation and adaptationrisk prevention and managementsustainable urban mobility;\na more connected Europe, by enhancing mobility;\na more social and inclusive Europe, implementing the European Pillar of Social Rights; and\na Europe closer to citizens, achieved through the sustainable and integrated development of all types of territories and local initiatives.\nClimate targets\nThe funds should contribute to the mainstreaming of climate actions and to the achievement of an overall target of 30% of the EU budget expenditure supporting climate objectives. In particular, EU Member States must provide information on how they are supporting environment and climate objectives, with their contribution to the overall target expressed as a percentage of their total ERDF and Cohesion Fund allocation. If there is insufficient progress towards reaching these targets, the Member State and the European Commission agree on remedial measures in the annual review meeting.\nKey principles\nMember States and the Commission implement the budget allocations based on the following principles.\nShared management, between the Commission and Member States. Actions are planned jointly. Member States are responsible for implementing the actions and reimbursing expenditure to beneficiaries, while the Commission monitors implementation, reimburses Member States and is ultimately accountable for the budget.\nPartnership and multi-level governance. Member States must organise and implement a comprehensive partnership including at least the following partners: regional, local, urban and other public authorities;economic and social partners;relevant bodies representing civil society, such as environmental partners, non-governmental organisations, and bodies promoting social inclusion, fundamental rights, rights of persons with disabilities, gender equality, and non-discrimination;research organisations and universities.\nHorizontal principles, ensuring: respect for fundamental rights and compliance with the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights;that equality between men and women, gender mainstreaming and the integration of a gender perspective, and accessibility for persons with disabilities are taken into account;that appropriate steps are taken to prevent any discrimination based on gender, racial or ethnic origin, religion or belief, disability, age or sexual orientation during the preparation, implementation, monitoring, reporting and evaluation of programmes.\nPartnership agreement\nEach Member State prepares a partnership agreement setting out how they intend to make effective and efficient use of the ERDF, the ESF+, the Cohesion Fund, the JTF and the EMFAF for the 2021–2027 period.\nProgramming\nIn cooperation with partners, Member States prepare programmes for funding for 2021–2027 to be submitted to the Commission no later than 3 months after submitting the partnership agreement. The regulation details rules on the following programming aspects:\ncontent;\napproval;\namendment;\njoint support from the ERDF, the ESF+, the Cohesion Fund and the JTF;\ntransfer of resources, including special rules for transfers from the ERDF and the ESF+ to the JTF.\nTerritorial development\nThe integrated territorial development approach is strengthened and can be supported through any of the following forms:\nintegrated territorial investment, allowing Member States to combine funding from several funds, programmes or priorities of the same programme to ensure an integrated strategy for a specific territory;\ncommunity-led local development (CLLD), a tool used at sub-regional level, complementing local-level support to mobilise and involve local communities and organisations, focusing on: capacity building;implementation of operations; andstrategy management, monitoring and evaluation, including communication between stakeholders;\nother territorial tools designed by the Member State.\nTechnical assistance\nAt the Commission’s initiative, the funds may support preparatory, monitoring, control, audit, evaluation, communication, visibility, administrative and technical assistance to implement the regulation and, where appropriate, in non-EU countries.\nAt the initiative of a Member State, the funds may support actions for the effective administration and use of the funds, including capacity building of partners and preparation, training, management, monitoring, evaluation, visibility and communication.\nPerformance\nMember States set up a system to allow them to monitor, report on and evaluate performance, consisting of:\noutput and result indicators linked to specific objectives;\nmilestones to be achieved by the end of 2024 for output indicators; and\ntargets to be achieved by the end of 2029 for output and result indicators.\nMonitoring\nEach Member State sets up a monitoring committee within 3 months of a programme being approved. The committees meet at least once a year to review progress towards achieving the programme objectives. The Member State determines the composition of the committee and must ensure a balanced representation of the relevant bodies and partner representatives.\nEach member of the monitoring committee shall have a vote.
