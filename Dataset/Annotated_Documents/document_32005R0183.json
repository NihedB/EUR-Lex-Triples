{"celex_id": "32005R0183", "reference": "8.2.2005\nEN\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\nL 35/1\nREGULATION (EC) No 183/2005 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL\nof 12 January 2005\nlaying down requirements for feed hygiene\n(Text with EEA relevance)\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 37(2) and Article 152(4)(b) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the Commission,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee (1),\nAfter consulting the Committee of the Regions,\nActing in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty (2),\nWhereas:\n(1)\nLivestock production plays a very important part in the agricultural sector of the Community. Satisfactory results of this activity depend to a large extent on the use of safe and good quality feed.\n(2)\nThe pursuit of a high level of protection of human and animal health is one of the fundamental objectives of food law, as laid down in Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 28 January 2002 laying down the general principles and requirements of food law, establishing the European Food Safety Authority and laying down procedures in matters of food safety (3). That Regulation also lays down other common principles and definitions for national and Community food law, including the aim of achieving free movement of feed within the Community.\n(3)\nCouncil Directive 95/69/EC (4) established the conditions and arrangements applicable to certain categories of establishments and intermediaries in the animal feed sector, to enable them to exercise their activities. Experience has shown that these conditions and arrangements constitute a sound basis for ensuring feed safety. That Directive also established conditions for the approval of establishments producing certain substances listed in Council Directive 82/471/EEC of 30 June 1982 concerning certain products used in animal nutrition (5).\n(4)\nCommission Directive 98/51/EC of 9 July 1998 laying down certain measures for implementing Council Directive 95/69/EC laying down the conditions and arrangements for approving and registering certain establishments and intermediaries operating in the animal feed sector (6), established certain measures that included arrangements for imports from third countries.\n(5)\nExperience has also shown that it is necessary to ensure that all feed businesses, including aquaculture, operate in conformity with harmonised safety requirements and that it is necessary to conduct a general review in order to take into account the need to ensure a higher level of protection of human and animal health, and of the environment.\n(6)\nThe principal objective of the new hygiene rules set out in this Regulation is to ensure a high level of consumer protection with regard to food and feed safety, taking particular account of the following principles:\n(a)\nthat primary responsibility for feed safety rests with the feed business operator;\n(b)\nthe need to ensure feed safety throughout the food chain, starting with primary production of feed, up to and including, the feeding of food-producing animals;\n(c)\nthe general implementation of procedures based on the principles of hazard analysis and critical control points (HACCP), which, together with the application of good hygiene practice, should reinforce feed business operators’ responsibility;\n(d)\nthat guides to good practice are a valuable instrument to help feed business operators at all levels of the feed chain comply with feed hygiene rules and with the application of HACCP principles;\n(e)\nthe establishment of microbiological criteria based on scientific risk criteria;\n(f)\nthe need to ensure that imported feed attains a standard that is at least equivalent to that of feed produced in the Community.\n(7)\nIn order to ensure the complete application of the registration and approval system to all the feed business operators and, consequently, to guarantee full traceability, it is appropriate to ensure that they only source and use feed from establishments which are registered and/or approved in accordance with this Regulation.\n(8)\nAn integrated approach is necessary to ensure feed safety from, and including, primary production of feed up to, and including, its placing on the market or export. The primary production of feed includes products which only undergo simple physical treatment such as cleaning, packaging, storage, natural drying or ensiling.\n(9)\nIn accordance with the principles of proportionality and subsidiarity, Community rules should not apply to certain cases of private domestic production of feed and feeding of certain animals, nor to the direct supply of small quantities of primary production of feed at local level, nor to the retailing of pet food.\n(10)\nFeed hazards present at the level of primary production of feed should be identified and adequately controlled, to ensure that the objectives of this Regulation are met. The fundamental principles of this Regulation should therefore apply to farms which manufacture feed solely for the requirements of their own production, as well as to farms which place feed on the market. It should be taken into consideration that the risk is less if feed is produced and used for feeding animals only used for domestic consumption, or for animals which are not used for food production. The trade of small quantities of feed products at local level and the retailing of pet food shall have particular treatment in the framework of this Regulation.\n(11)\nThe application of HACCP principles to primary production of feed is the medium-term objective of European hygiene legislation. But guides to good practice should already be encouraging the use of appropriate hygiene requirements.\n(12)\nFeed safety depends on a number of factors. Legislation should lay down minimum hygiene requirements. Official controls should be in place to check feed business operators’ compliance. In addition, feed business operators should take measures or adopt procedures to achieve a high level of feed safety.\n(13)\nHACCP principles can help feed business operators attain a higher standard of feed safety. HACCP principles should not be regarded as a method of self-regulation and do not replace official controls.\n(14)\nThe implementation of the HACCP principles requires the full cooperation and commitment of feed businesses’ employees.\n(15)\nHACCP principles in feed production should take into account the principles contained in the Codex Alimentarius, but should allow sufficient flexibility in all situations. In certain feed business, it is not possible to identify critical control points and, in some cases, good practices can replace the monitoring of critical control points. Similarly, the requirement to establish ‘critical limits’, as set out in the Codex Alimentarius, does not require a numerical limit to be fixed in every case. The requirement to retain documents as set out in the same Code needs to be flexible to avoid undue burdens for very small businesses. It should be ensured that operations carried out by a feed business at the level of primary production of feed, including associated operations, as well as the mixing of feed with complementary feedingstuffs for the exclusive requirements of its own holding, are not obliged to follow the HACCP principles.\n(16)\nFlexibility is also necessary to accommodate the needs of feed businesses situated in regions suffering from special geographical constraints or related to structural requirements. But such flexibility should not compromise feed hygiene objectives. Provision should be made for discussion within the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health, where appropriate.\n(17)\nA system of registration and approval by the competent authority of the Member State of all feed businesses is appropriate to ensure traceability from manufacturer to final user and to facilitate the implementation of effective official controls. The existing systems for collection of data concerning feed businesses may be used by the competent authority of the Member States to start up and implement the system provided for in this Regulation.\n(18)\nIt is appropriate that an approval system for feed businesses be maintained for activities which can present a higher risk in the manufacture of feed. Provision should be made for procedures to extend the current scope of the approval system provided for in Directive 95/69/EC.\n(19)\nIn order to be approved or registered, feed businesses should meet several conditions relevant to their operations, concerning facilities, equipment, personnel, production, quality control, storage and documentation, in order to ensure both feed safety and product traceability. Provision should be made for these conditions to be varied, to ensure that they are appropriate to the various types of feed business. Member States should be allowed to grant conditional approval of establishments, if it appears from the on-site visit that the establishment meets all the infrastructure and equipment requirements. However, it is also appropriate to set a maximum length of time for such conditional approval.\n(20)\nProvision should be made for temporarily suspending, amending or revoking the registration or approval, where establishments change or cease their activities or no longer fulfil the conditions applicable to their activity.\n(21)\nThe traceability of feed and feed ingredients throughout the feed chain is an essential element in ensuring feed safety. Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 contains rules to ensure the traceability of feed and feed ingredients and provides a procedure for the adoption of implementing rules applicable to specific sectors.\n(22)\nSuccessive feed crises have shown that failures at any stage in the feed chain can have important economic consequences. The characteristics of feed production and the complexity of the feed distribution chain mean that it is difficult to withdraw feed from the market. The costs of rectifying the economic damage along the feed and food chain is often borne by public funds. The remedying of this economic consequence at a low cost to society could be improved if the operator whose activity causes economic damage in the feed sector is held financially responsible. However, establishing a general mandatory system of financial liability and financial guarantees, for example through insurance, which applies to all feed business operators may not be feasible or appropriate. The Commission should therefore consider this issue in greater depth, taking into account provisions in existing legislation with regard to liability in other spheres, as well as existing systems and practices amongst the Member States. To this end, the Commission should present a report, accompanied where appropriate by legislative proposals.\n(23)\nFeed imported into the Community must satisfy the general requirements laid down in Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 and the import conditions laid down in Regulation (EC) No 882/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on official controls performed to ensure the verification of compliance with feed and food law, animal health and animal welfare rules (7). In order to avoid trade disruptions it is appropriate that, pending the completion of the implementing measures, imports continue to be authorised under the conditions laid down in Directive 98/51/EC.\n(24)\nCommunity products exported to third countries have to satisfy the general requirements laid down in Regulation (EC) No 178/2002.\n(25)\nIt is appropriate to broaden the scope of the rapid alert system for food and feed laid down by Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 to include risks to animal health or the environment from feed used for animals not kept for food production.\n(26)\nCommunity legislation on feed hygiene has to be underpinned by scientific advice. To this end, the European Food Safety Authority should be consulted whenever necessary.\n(27)\nTo take account of technical and scientific progress, there should be close and effective cooperation between the Commission and the Member States within the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health.\n(28)\nThis Regulation takes account of international obligations laid down in the WTO Sanitary and Phytosanitary Agreement and the international food safety standards contained in the Codex Alimentarius.\n(29)\nThe Member States should lay down rules on penalties applicable to infringements of the provisions of this Regulation and ensure that they are implemented. Those penalties have to be effective, proportionate and dissuasive.\n(30)\nThe measures necessary for the implementation of this Regulation should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission (8).\n(31)\nIt is appropriate to provide for a deferred date of application of the Regulation, in order to allow the feed businesses affected by it time to adapt.\n(32)\nFor the above reasons, Directives 95/69/EC and 98/51/EC should be repealed,\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nCHAPTER I\nSUBJECT MATTER, SCOPE AND DEFINITIONS\nArticle 1\nSubject matter\nThis Regulation lays down:\n(a)\ngeneral rules on feed hygiene;\n(b)\nconditions and arrangements ensuring traceability of feed;\n(c)\nconditions and arrangements for registration and approval of establishments.\nArticle 2\nScope\n1.

183/2005 — requirements for feed hygiene\nWHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?\nIts main objective is to ensure a high level of protection of human life as well as the protection of animal health and the environment.\nThis regulation ensures that feed safety is assured at all stages that may have an impact on feed and food safety, including primary production*.\nIt introduces a system of liability and requirements to ensure that animal feed is safe and of good quality by ensuring its traceability throughout the entire animal feed chain.\nKEY POINTS\nScope\nThe regulation applies to the activities of feed businesses operators, ranging from primary production of animal feed up to and including its placing on the market, as well as the feeding of food-producing animals and the imports and exports of feed from and to non-EU countries.\nExclusions\nThe following are excluded from the scope:\nthe private domestic production of feed for food-producing animals kept for private domestic consumption and for animals not kept for food production;\nthe feeding of food-producing animals kept for private domestic consumption;\nthe direct supply, by the producer, of small quantities of primary products to the final consumer or to local retail establishments directly supplying the final consumer;\nthe feeding of animals not kept for food production;\nthe direct supply of small quantities of primary production of feed at local level by the producer to local farms for use on those farms;\nthe retailing of pet food.\nMain elements:\nCompulsory registration of all feed business operators by the competent authority.\nApproval of feed business establishments carrying out operations involving more sensitive substances, such as certain feed additives, premixtures* and compound feedingstuffs*.\nIntroduction of compulsory requirements for feed production at farm level.\nUniform hygiene requirements to be met by all feed businesses.\nGood hygiene practice to be applied at all levels of agriculture production and in the use of feed.\nIntroduction of the Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point (HACCP) principles* for the feed business operators other than at the level of primary production.\nTo encourage the development of EU and national guides to good practice in feed production.\nFeed businesses responsible for the primary production of feed\nThese businesses must prevent, eliminate or reduce feed safety hazards during the production, preparation, cleaning, packaging, storing and transport of these products (Annex I). They must keep records relating to measures put in place to control contamination hazards.\nOther feed business operators\nThese businesses must adopt measures to guarantee the safety of the products that they manufacture, transport or use. These measures are detailed in Annex II and chiefly concern:\nfacilities and equipment;\nstaff training;\nthe organisation and monitoring of different stages of production;\nthe documents which the operators must keep.\nThey must also apply HACCP principles and keep documents demonstrating that they respect these.\nBusinesses must:\ntake corrective actions when monitoring shows that a critical control point (see HACCP principles) is not under control;\nimplement internal procedures to check the measures adopted are working effectively;\nkeep records to demonstrate they have applied these measures.\nRegistration and approval\nFeed businesses (including those responsible for the primary production of feed) must register with their respective country’s competent authorities. They must provide up-to-date information and agree to cooperate in the event of controls.\nWhen required by national or EU legislation, feed businesses operators shall ensure that establishments under their control are approved by the competent authority and may not operate without approval. Each EU country must keep a list of approved establishments. When an establishment no longer complies with the requirements governing its activities, the approval may be temporarily suspended or revoked.\nGuides to good practice\nBoth the Commission and the EU countries issue guides to good practice in the feed sector and on the application of HACCP principles. These must be developed in accordance with the principles of the Codex Alimentarius and in consultation with all interested parties. Where standardised EU guides are prepared, the Standing Committee on Plants, Animals, Food and Feed (also known as PAFF) ensures that the content of these guides is practicable.\nAmendments\nThe regulation’s Annex II has been amended twice (by Regulation (EU) No 225/2012 and Regulation (EU) 2015/1905) with regard to the approval of businesses making products from vegetable oils and blended fats and to the specific requirements for production, storage, transport and dioxin testing.\nFROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?\n              \nIt has applied since 1 January 2006.\nBACKGROUND\n              \nFor more information, see:\nFeed hygiene (European Commission).\nKEY TERMS\n              \nPrimary production: the production of agricultural products, including growing, harvesting, milking, rearing of animals (prior to their slaughter) or fishing resulting exclusively in products that do not undergo any other operation following their harvest, collection or capture apart from simple physical treatment.\nPremixtures: mixtures of feed additives or mixtures of one or more feed additives with feed materials or water used as carriers, not intended for direct feeding to animals.\nCompound feedingstuffs: organic or inorganic substances in mixtures, whether or not containing additives, for oral animal feeding in the form of complete feedingstuffs or complementary feedingstuffs.\nHACCP principles: these lay down the requirements to be met throughout production, processing and distribution in order to identify, by hazard analysis, critical points which need to be kept under control to guarantee food safety.\nMAIN DOCUMENT\n            \nRegulation (EC) No 183/2005 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 January 2005 laying down requirements for feed hygiene (OJ L 35, 8.2.2005, pp. 1-22)\nSuccessive amendments to Regulation (EC) No 183/2005 have been incorporated into the original document.
