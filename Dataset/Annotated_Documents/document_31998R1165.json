whereas new economic, competition, social, environmental and enterprise policies and guidelines call for initiatives and decisions based on valid statistics; whereas the information provided for under existing Community legislation or available in the various Member States is partly inadequate or insufficiently comparable to serve as a reliable basis for the work of the Communities;(3) Whereas the future European Central Bank needs rapid short term statistics in order to assess economic development in the Member States in the context of a single European monetary policy;(4) Whereas standardisation is required to meet Community needs for information concerning economic convergence;(5) Whereas it is necessary to have reliable and rapid statistics available in order to report on the economic development in each Member State of the Union within the framework of the economic policy of the Union;(6) Whereas businesses and their professional associations need such information in order to understand their markets and to know their activity and performance relative to their sector, at national and international level;(7) Whereas the compilation of national accounts according to Council Regulation (EC) No 2223/96 of 25 June 1996 on the European system of national and regional accounts in the Community (7) requires the development of comparable, complete and reliable statistical sources;(8) Whereas by Decision 92/326/EEC (8) the Council adopted a two-year programme (1992 to 1993) for the development of European statistics on services; whereas this programme includes the compilation of harmonised statistics at national and regional levels, particularly for the distributive trades;(9) Whereas in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity the creation of common statistical norms that permit the production of harmonised statistics is an action which can only be undertaken efficiently at Community level and whereas they will be applied in each Member State under the authority of the bodies and institutions in charge of compiling official statistics;(10) Whereas the best method of ascertaining the business cycle consists of compiling statistics which conform to common methodological principles and with common definitions of characteristics; whereas it is only from coordinated compilation that harmonised statistics can be drawn up with reliability, speed, flexibility and the level of detail required to meet the needs of the Commission and of enterprises;(11) Whereas seasonal adjustment and the calculation of trend-cycle series for national data can best be carried out by the national statistical authorities; whereas the transmission to the Commission (Eurostat) of seasonally adjusted data and trend-cycle series will increase the coherence between data disseminated nationally and at an international level;(12) Whereas kind-of-activity units (KAU) correspond to one or more operational subdivisions of the enterprise; whereas for a KAU to be observable, the enterprise's information system must be capable of indicating or calculating for each KAU at least the value of production, intermediate consumption, manpower costs, the operating surplus and employment and gross fixed capital formation; whereas KAUs falling within a particular heading in the statistical classification of economic activities in the European Community (NACE Rev.1) can produce products outside the homogeneous group, on account of secondary activities connected with them which cannot be separately identified from available accounting documents; whereas the enterprise and the KAU are identical when it proves impossible for an enterprise to indicate or calculate information on all of the variables listed in this recital for one or more operational subdivisions;(13) Whereas the statistical data compiled within the Community system must be of a satisfactory quality and this quality, as well as the burden it entails, must be comparable from one Member State to another, and whereas it is therefore necessary to establish jointly the criteria enabling these requirements to be met; whereas short-term statistics must be consistent with the results transmitted in accordance with Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 58/97 of 20 December 1996 concerning structural business statistics (9);(14) Whereas Council Regulation (EC) No 322/97 of 17 February 1997 on Community statistics (10) constitutes the reference framework for the provisions of this Regulation, in particular those which cover access to administrative data sources and statistical confidentiality;(15) Whereas it is necessary to simplify the administrative procedures for enterprises, particularly smaller enterprises, including the promotion of new technologies for data collection and compilation; whereas the use of existing administrative data for statistical purposes is one of the measures to decrease the burden on enterprise; whereas if a direct data collection from businesses is indispensable for compiling the statistics, the methods and techniques must ensure that the data are reliable and up to date, without giving rise for the parties concerned, in particular for small and medium sized businesses, to a burden out of proportion to the results which users of the said statistics can reasonably expect;(16) Whereas it is necessary to have a legal framework common to all business activities and domains of business statistics covering also the activities and domains for which statistics are not yet developed; whereas the scope of the statistics to be compiled can be defined by reference to Council Regulation (EEC) No 696/93 of 15 March 1993 on the statistical units for the observation and analysis of the production system in the Community (11) and Council Regulation (EEC) No 3037/90 of 9 October 1990 on the statistical classification of economic activities in the European Community (NACE Rev.1) (12);(17) Whereas, in order to enable the rules for the collection and statistical processing of data and for processing and transmission of the variables to be clarified further, it is necessary to confer upon the Commission, assisted by the Statistical Programme Committee set up by Council Decision 89/382/EEC, Euratom (13), the power to adopt measures for the application of this Regulation;(18) Whereas the Statistical Programme Committee has been consulted in accordance with Article 3 of Decision 89/382/EEC, Euratom,HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:Article 1 General aims 1.

The observation unit for all variables in this Annex is the enterprise.2. The use of other observation units can be decided in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 18.(c) List of variables 1. The statistics in this Annex comprise the following variables:>TABLE>2. Starting from the beginning of the first reference period the information on persons employed (No 210) may be approximated by the number of employees (No 211). This approximation is permitted for a period of five years from the date of entry into force of the Regulation. The period shall be extended by up to five more years unless decided differently in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 18.(d) Form 1. All of the variables are to be transmitted in an unadjusted form.2. The turnover variable (No 120) is also to be transmitted in a working-day adjusted form.3. In addition Member States may transmit the variables seasonally adjusted and may also transmit the variables in the form of trend cycles. Only if data are not transmitted in these forms, may the Commission (Eurostat) produce seasonally adjusted and trend-cycle series for these variables.4. All variables are to be transmitted either as an index or as absolute figures.(e) Reference period A reference period of a quarter shall apply to all variables in this Annex.(f) Level of detail 1. The turnover variable (No 120) is to be transmitted according to the following groupings of NACE Rev. 1:sum of 50.1, 50.3, 50.4;50.2;50.5;51, 64 each at three-digit;50, 60, 61, 62, 63, 72 each at two-digit;sum of 74.11, 74.12, 74.13, 74.14;sum of 74.2, 74.3;74.4 to 74.8 each at three-digit.2. The persons employed variable (No 210) is to be transmitted at the two-digit level of NACE Rev. 1 for Divisions 50, 51, 55, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 72 and 74.3. For Divisions 50, 51, 64 and 74 of NACE Rev. 1, the turnover variable need only be transmitted at the two-digit level by those Member States whose value added in those divisions of NACE Rev. 1 in a given base year represents less than 5 % of the European Community total.4. For Section I of NACE Rev. 1, the persons employed variable (No 120) need only be transmitted at Section level by those Member States whose total value added in Section I in a given base year represents less than 5 % of the European Community total.(g) Deadlines for data transmission The variables shall be transmitted within three months after the end of the reference period.(h) Pilot studies The priorities for the pilot studies are as follows:1. collect wages and salary information;2. collect information on deflators;3. assess the feasibility and relevance of collection data on:(i) travel agents NACE Rev. 1 Group 63.3;(ii) real estate NACE Rev. 1 Division 70;(iii) renting activity NACE Rev. 1 Division 71;(iv) research and development NACE Rev. 1 Division 73;(v) management activities of holding companies NACE Rev. 1 Class 74.15;(vi) NACE Rev. 1 Sections J, M, N and O;4. produce a more detailed breakdown;5. assess the possibility of earlier data transmission;6. collect information on the number of employees;7. use the kind-of-activity unit as observation unit;8. collect short-term information on the births and deaths of enterprises.(i) First reference period The first reference period for which all variables are to be transmitted is the first quarter 1998.(j) Transition period For all variables a transition period of five years may be conceded from the date of entry into force of the Regulation in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 18.", "summary": "Short-term statistics\nShort-term statistics\nSUMMARY OF:\nRegulation (EC) No 1165/98 concerning short-term indicators\nWHAT IS THE AIM OF THIS REGULATION?\n              \nIt sets out rules for producing and transmitting short-term economic activity indicators in line with the NACE Rev.2 classification. These statistics enable analysingshort-term developments in supply and demand, production factors and prices. They allow users to monitor business competitiveness and performance across the EU.\nIt repeals Directives 72/211/EEC and 78/166/EEC to take account of economic and technical developments.\nKEY POINTS\n              \nShort-term statistics (STS) indices currently cover 4 main areas:\nIndustry — NACE sections B to E, which include: mining,quarrying,energy and water supply, andwaste management and remediation activities;\nConstruction — NACE Section F and building and civil engineering indicators based on the classification of types of constructions;\nWholesale and retail trade — NACE Section G (covers whole and retail trade and repair of motor vehicles and motorbikes);\nServices — NACE Sections, H, I, J, M and N which cover: transportation and storage,accommodation and food services,information and communication,professional, scientific and technical activities, andadministrative and support service activities.\nThe specific requirements for each of the data to be collected (e.g. production volume, turnover, prices, labour input) are described in the regulation’s annexes, as are:\nthe reference periods,\nthe frequency of data collection and\nthe deadlines for data transmission to the European Commission (Eurostat).\nEU countries must each have one national authority responsible for coordinating:\nthe transmission of data and other relevant information to Eurostat;\ndata quality measurement.\nEU countries may acquire the data using a combination of sources but should always ensure to apply the principle of administrative simplification (i.e. placing the least possible burden on businesses, especially small ones). These sources include:\ncompulsory surveys involving the legal units as defined in Regulation (EEC) No 696/93(on the EU’s producation system — statistical units); these surveys are only to be used to obtain information that is not already available from other sources, such as business registers;\nother sources such as administrative data;\nappropriate statistical estimation procedures;\nEuropean sample schemes coordinated by Eurostat.\nEU countries must ensure their data meet quality requirements laid down by Eurostat. EU countries and Eurostat test data quality by comparing them with other statistical information and check for internal consistency.\nEvery 3 years, the European Commission prepares a report for the European Parliament and the Council focusing on the relevance and quality of the statistics and the revision of indicators.\nEurostat, having consulted the European Statistical System (ESS) Committee, published an advisory methodological manual.\nThe Commission may adopt further legislation to implement the short-term statistics (STS) regulation. In this regard, it receives guidance from the ESS Committee.\nFROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?\n              \nIt has applied since 26 June 1998.\nBACKGROUND\n              \nFor more information, see:\nShort-term business statistics (Eurostat).\nMAIN DOCUMENT\n            \nCouncil Regulation (EC) No 1165/98 of 19 May 1998 concerning short-term statistics (OJ L 162, 5.6.1998, pp. 1-15)\nSuccessive amendments to Regulation (EC) No 1165/98 have been incorporated in the original text.
