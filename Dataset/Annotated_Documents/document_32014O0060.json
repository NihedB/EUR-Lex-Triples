Since further amendments are to be made, it should be recast in the interest of clarity.\n(2)\nAchieving a single monetary policy entails defining the tools, instruments and procedures to be used by the Eurosystem, which consists of the European Central Bank (ECB) and the national central banks of those Member States whose currency is the euro (hereinafter the ‘NCBs’), in order to implement such a policy in a uniform manner throughout the Member States whose currency is the euro.\n(3)\nAccording to Article 127(1) and (2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union and Article 3.1 of the Statute of the European System of Central Banks and of the European Central Bank (hereinafter the ‘Statute of the ESCB’), the primary objective of the European System of Central Banks (ESCB) is to maintain price stability, and, as such, it has the basic tasks of defining and implementing the monetary policy of the Union and conducting foreign-exchange operations consistent with the provisions of Article 219 of the Treaty.\n(4)\nThe general framework of the Eurosystem is based on provisions laid down in the Statute of the ESCB. Under Article 127(1) of the Treaty and, as reflected in the Statute of the ESCB, the Eurosystem is required to act in accordance with certain principles, including the principles of an open market economy with free competition, favouring an efficient allocation of resources.\n(5)\nTo the extent deemed possible and appropriate, and with a view to ensuring operational efficiency, the ECB has recourse to the NCBs for carrying out the operations which form part of the tasks of the Eurosystem pursuant to the principle of decentralisation laid down in Article 12.1 of the Statute of the ESCB and subject to the conditions laid down in Article 14.3 of the Statute of the ESCB.\n(6)\nIn the light of Article 12.1 of the Statute of the ESCB, the ECB has the authority to formulate the single monetary policy of the Union and to issue the necessary guidelines to ensure its proper implementation. In accordance with Article 14.3 of the Statute of the ESCB, the NCBs have an obligation to act in accordance with such guidelines. This Guideline is therefore addressed to the Eurosystem. The rules laid down in this Guideline will be implemented by the NCBs in contractual or regulatory arrangements. Counterparties will be required to comply with those rules as implemented by the NCBs in those contractual or regulatory arrangements.\n(7)\nThe first indent of Article 18.1 of the Statute of the ESCB allows the Eurosystem to operate in the financial markets by buying and selling outright (spot and forward) or under repurchase agreements and by lending or borrowing claims and marketable instruments, whether in euro or other currencies, as well as precious metals. The second indent of Article 18.1 allows the Eurosystem to conduct credit operations with credit institutions and other market participants.\n(8)\nIn implementing its monetary policy, the Eurosystem employs the following monetary policy tools: it conducts open market operations, offers standing facilities and requires credit institutions to hold minimum reserves on accounts with the Eurosystem.\n(9)\nIn order to achieve its objectives, the Eurosystem has a set of instruments at its disposal for conducting open market operations, which include reverse transactions, outright transactions, the issuance of ECB debt certificates, foreign exchange swaps for monetary policy purposes and the collection of fixed-term deposits. Such instruments for the conduct of open market operations aim to ensure an orderly functioning of the money market and to help banks meet their liquidity needs in a smooth and well-organised manner.\n(10)\nThe set of instruments at the Eurosystem's disposal for offering standing facilities are the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility, which are aimed at providing and absorbing overnight liquidity respectively, signalling the stance of monetary policy and bounding overnight money market interest rates.\n(11)\nThe Eurosystem's minimum reserve system primarily pursues the monetary policy objectives of: (a) contributing to the stabilisation of money market interest rates by giving institutions an incentive to temper the effects of temporary liquidity fluctuations due to the averaging provision; and (b) creating or enlarging a structural liquidity shortage, which improves the ability of the Eurosystem to operate efficiently as a liquidity supplier. The legal framework of the Eurosystem's minimum reserve system is laid down in Article 19 of the Statute of the ESCB, Council Regulation (EC) No 2531/98 (2) and Regulation (EC) No 1745/2003 of the European Central Bank (ECB/2003/9) (3).\n(12)\nWith regard to their aims, regularity and procedures, the Eurosystem's open market operations can be divided into four categories: (a) main refinancing operations; (b) longer-term refinancing operations; (c) fine-tuning operations; (d) structural operations.\n(13)\nThe main refinancing operations are a category of open market operations conducted by the Eurosystem that play a pivotal role in pursuing the aims of steering interest rates, managing the liquidity situation in the market and signalling the stance of monetary policy.\n(14)\nThe longer-term refinancing operations are aimed at providing counterparties with liquidity that has a maturity longer than that of the main refinancing operations. With longer-term refinancing operations, the Eurosystem does not, as a rule, intend to send signals to the market and therefore normally acts as a rate taker.\n(15)\nFine-tuning operations are executed on an ad hoc basis with the aim of managing the liquidity situation in the market and steering interest rates, in particular in order to smooth the effects on interest rates caused by unexpected liquidity fluctuations in the market. The specific fine-tuning operations are adapted to the types of transactions and the specific objectives pursued by the relevant operations.\n(16)\nStructural operations may be carried out whenever the structural position of the Eurosystem needs to be adjusted with regard to the financial sector.\n(17)\nThe implementation of the Eurosystem's monetary policy framework should ensure that a broad range of counterparties participate under uniform eligibility criteria. These criteria are specified to ensure the equal treatment of counterparties across the Member States whose currency is the euro and to ensure that counterparties fulfil certain prudential and operational requirements.\n(18)\nIn order to protect the Eurosystem from counterparty risk, the second indent of Article 18.1 of the Statute of the ESCB provides that when the Eurosystem conducts credit operations with credit institutions and other market participants, lending should be based on adequate collateral.\n(19)\nIn order to ensure the equal treatment of counterparties, as well as to enhance operational efficiency and transparency, assets must fulfil certain uniform criteria across the Member States whose currency is the euro in order to be eligible as collateral for Eurosystem credit operations.\n(20)\nThe Eurosystem has developed a single framework for assets eligible as collateral so that all Eurosystem credit operations are carried out in a harmonised manner by means of implementing this Guideline in all Member States whose currency is the euro. The single framework for assets eligible as collateral covers marketable and non-marketable assets that fulfil uniform eligibility criteria specified by the Eurosystem. Most eligible assets may be used on a cross-border basis by means of the correspondent central banking model (CCBM) and, in the case of marketable assets, through eligible links between eligible EEA securities settlement systems (SSSs) or eligible links between eligible EEA SSSs in combination with the CCBM.\n(21)\nIntraday credit is provided by the Eurosystem to even out mismatches in payment settlements. As laid down in Article 12 of and Annex III to Guideline ECB/2012/27 (4), the collateral for the provision of intraday credit is required to comply with the same criteria that assets eligible as collateral must fulfil under Part Four.\n(22)\nAll eligible assets for Eurosystem credit operations need to be subject to specific risk control measures in order to protect the Eurosystem against financial losses in circumstances where its collateral has to be realised due to an event of default of a counterparty. Eligible assets are required to meet the Eurosystem's credit quality requirements specified in the Eurosystem credit assessment framework (ECAF) rules.\n(23)\nThe ECB imposes sanctions on institutions which do not comply with obligations arising from ECB regulations and decisions relating to the application of minimum reserves in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) No 2532/98 (5), European Central Bank Regulation (EC) No 2157/1999 (ECB/1999/4) (6), Regulation (EC) No 2531/98 and Regulation (EC) No 1745/2003 (ECB/2003/9). In the event of a serious infringement of the minimum reserve requirements, the Eurosystem may also suspend counterparties' participation in open market operations.\n(24)\nIn accordance with the provisions of the contractual or regulatory arrangements applied by the relevant NCB or by the ECB, if counterparties fail to comply with their obligations under the contractual or regulatory arrangements applied by the NCBs or by the ECB, as set out in this Guideline, the Eurosystem can impose financial penalties or suspend counterparties' participation in open market operations or standing facilities.\n(25)\nIn accordance with the provisions in the contractual or regulatory arrangements applied by the relevant NCB or by the ECB, the Eurosystem may also suspend, limit or exclude counterparties' access to open market operations or standing facilities on the grounds of prudence or if there is an event of default of a counterparty. On the grounds of prudence, the Eurosystem may also reject, limit the use of or apply supplementary haircuts to assets mobilised by specific counterparties as collateral in Eurosystem credit operations.\n(26)\nAll contractual or regulatory arrangements applied by the NCBs with their counterparties should contain minimum common features aimed at ensuring the application of the single monetary policy under terms and conditions which are not materially different among Member States whose currency is the euro,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS GUIDELINE:\nCONTENTS\nPART ONE —\nSUBJECT MATTER, SCOPE

ONE\nSUBJECT MATTER, SCOPE AND DEFINITIONS\nArticle 1\nSubject matter and scope\n1.   This Guideline sets out the uniform rules for the implementation of the single monetary policy by the Eurosystem throughout the Member States whose currency is the euro.\n2.   The Eurosystem shall take all the appropriate measures to implement Eurosystem monetary policy operations in accordance with the principles, tools, instruments, requirements, criteria and procedures laid down in this Guideline.\n3.   The legal relationship between the Eurosystem and its counterparties shall be established in appropriate contractual or regulatory arrangements applied by the relevant NCB, in which the provisions of this Guideline are implemented accordingly.\n4.   The ECB's Governing Council may, at any time, change the tools, instruments, requirements, criteria and procedures for the implementation of Eurosystem monetary policy operations.\n5.   The Eurosystem reserves the right to request and obtain any relevant information from counterparties that is needed to carry out its tasks and achieve its objectives in relation to monetary policy operations. This right is without prejudice to any other existing specific rights of the Eurosystem to request information relating to monetary policy operations.\nArticle 2\nDefinitions\nFor the purposes of this Guideline, the following definitions shall apply:\n(1)\n‘actual/360 day-count convention’ means the convention applied in Eurosystem monetary policy operations which determines the actual number of calendar days included in the calculation of interest by using a 360-day year as the basis;\n(2)\n‘agency’ means entities that the Eurosystem has classified as agencies.

The Eurosystem may conduct open market operations to steer interest rates, manage the liquidity situation in the financial market and signal the stance of monetary policy.\n2.   Depending on their specific purpose, open market operations can be grouped under the following categories:\n(a)\nmain refinancing operations;\n(b)\nlonger-term refinancing operations;\n(c)\nfine-tuning operations;\n(d)\nstructural operations.\n3.   Open market operations shall be conducted by means of the following instruments:\n(a)\nreverse transactions;\n(b)\nforeign exchange swaps for monetary policy purposes;\n(c)\nthe collection of fixed-term deposits;\n(d)\nthe issuance of ECB debt certificates;\n(e)\noutright transactions.\n4.   As regards the specific categories of open market operations laid down in paragraph 2, the following instruments referred to in paragraph 3 shall be applicable:\n(a)\nMROs and LTROs are conducted exclusively by means of reverse transactions;\n(b)\nfine-tuning operations may be conducted by means of:\n(i)\nreverse transactions;\n(ii)\nforeign exchange swaps for monetary policy purposes;\n(iii)\nthe collection of fixed-term deposits;\n(c)\nstructural operations may be conducted by means of:\n(i)\nreverse transactions;\n(ii)\nthe issuance of ECB debt certificates;\n(iii)\noutright transactions.\n5.   The ECB shall initiate open market operations and shall also decide on the terms and conditions for their execution and on the instrument to be used.\nCHAPTER 2\nCategories of open market operations\nArticle 6\nMain refinancing operations\n1.   The Eurosystem shall conduct MROs by means of reverse transactions.\n2.   As regards their operational features, MROs:\n(a)\nare liquidity-providing operations;\n(b)\nare normally conducted each week in accordance with the indicative calendar for the Eurosystem's regular tender operations;\n(c)\nnormally have a maturity of one week, as indicated in the indicative calendar for the Eurosystem's regular tender operations, subject to the exception laid down in paragraph 3;\n(d)\nare executed in a decentralised manner by the NCBs;\n(e)\nare executed by means of standard tender procedures;\n(f)\nare subject to the eligibility criteria laid down in Article 55 which must be fulfilled by all counterparties submitting bids for such operations;\n(g)\nare based on eligible assets as collateral.\n3.   The maturity of MROs may differ on the grounds of varying bank holidays in Member States whose currency is the euro.\n4.   The ECB's Governing Council shall decide on the interest rates for the MROs on a regular basis. The revised interest rates shall become effective from the beginning of the new reserve maintenance period.\n5.   Notwithstanding paragraph 4, the ECB's Governing Council may change the interest rate for the MROs at any point in time. Such decision shall become effective at the earliest from the following Eurosystem business day.\n6.   MROs are executed by means of fixed rate tender procedures or variable rate tender procedures, as decided by the Eurosystem.\nArticle 7\nLonger-term refinancing operations\n1.   The Eurosystem shall conduct LTROs by means of reverse transactions to provide counterparties with liquidity with a maturity longer than that of the MROs.\n2.   As regards their operational features, LTROs:\n(a)\nare liquidity-providing reverse operations;\n(b)\nare conducted regularly each month in accordance with the indicative calendar for the Eurosystem's regular tender operations, subject to the exception laid down in paragraph 4;\n(c)\nnormally have a maturity of three months in accordance with the indicative calendar for the Eurosystem's regular tender operations, subject to the exceptions laid down in paragraphs 3 and 4;\n(d)\nare executed in a decentralised manner by the NCBs;\n(e)\nare executed by means of standard tender procedures;\n(f)\nare subject to the eligibility criteria specified in Article 55 which must be fulfilled by all counterparties submitting bids for such operations;\n(g)\nare based on eligible assets as collateral.\n3.   The maturity of LTROs may differ on the grounds of varying bank holidays in Member States whose currency is the euro.\n4.   The Eurosystem may conduct — on a non-regular basis — LTROs with a maturity other than three months. Such operations are not specified in the indicative calendar for the Eurosystem's regular tender operations.\n5.   LTROs with a maturity of more than three months that are conducted on a non-regular basis, as referred to in paragraph 4, may have an early repayment clause. Such an early repayment clause may represent either an option or a mandatory obligation for counterparties under which they repay all or part of the amounts they were allotted in a given operation. Mandatory early repayment clauses shall be based on explicit and predefined conditions. The dates on which the early repayments become effective shall be announced by the Eurosystem at the time of the announcement of the operations. The Eurosystem may decide in exceptional circumstances to suspend early repayments on specific dates on the grounds of, inter alia, bank holidays in Member States whose currency is the euro.\n6.   LTROs are executed by means of variable rate tender procedures, unless it is decided by the Eurosystem to execute them by means of a fixed-rate tender procedure. In such a case, the rate applicable to fixed-rate tender procedures may be indexed to an underlying reference rate (e.g. average MRO rate) over the life of the operation, with or without a spread.\nArticle 8\nFine-tuning operations\n1.   The Eurosystem may conduct fine-tuning operations by means of reverse transactions, foreign exchange swaps for monetary policy purposes or the collection of fixed-term deposits, in particular to deal with liquidity fluctuations in the market.\n2.   As regards their operational features, fine-tuning operations:\n(a)\nmay be conducted either as a liquidity-providing or as a liquidity-absorbing operation;\n(b)\nhave a frequency and maturity that are normally not standardised;\n(c)\nare normally executed by means of quick tender procedures, unless the Eurosystem decides to conduct the specific fine-tuning operation by other means (standard tender procedure or bilateral procedure) in the light of specific monetary policy considerations or in order to react to market conditions;\n(d)\nare executed in a decentralised manner by the NCBs, without prejudice to Article 45(3);\n(e)\nare subject to the eligibility criteria for counterparties as specified in Part Three, depending on:\n(i)\nthe specific type of instrument for conducting fine-tuning operations; and\n(ii)\nthe applicable procedure for that specific type of instrument;\n(f)\nwhen conducted by means of reverse transactions, they are based on eligible assets as collateral.\n3.   The ECB may conduct fine-tuning operations on any Eurosystem business day to counter liquidity imbalances in the reserve maintenance period. If the trade day, settlement day and reimbursement day are not NCB business days, the relevant NCB may not conduct such operations.\n4.   The Eurosystem shall retain a high degree of flexibility as regards its choice of procedures and operational features in the conduct of fine-tuning operations, in order to react to market conditions.\nArticle 9\nStructural operations\n1.   The Eurosystem may conduct structural operations by means of reverse transactions, the issuance of ECB debt certificates or outright transactions to adjust the structural position of the Eurosystem vis-à-vis the financial system, or pursue other monetary policy implementation purposes.\n2.   As regards their operational features, structural operations:\n(a)\nare liquidity-providing or liquidity-absorbing operations;\n(b)\nhave a frequency and maturity that is not standardised;\n(c)\nare executed by means of tender or bilateral procedures, depending on the specific type of instrument for conducting the structural operation;\n(d)\nare executed in a decentralised manner by the NCBs;\n(e)\nare subject to the eligibility criteria for counterparties as specified in Part Three depending on: (i) the specific type of instrument for conducting structural operations; and (ii) the applicable procedure for that specific type of instrument;\n(f)\nliquidity-providing structural operations are based on eligible assets as collateral, with the exception of outright purchases.\n3.   The Eurosystem shall retain a high degree of flexibility as regards its choice of procedures and operational features in the conduct of structural operations in order to react to market conditions and other structural developments.\nCHAPTER 3\nInstruments for open market operations\nArticle 10\nReverse transactions\n1.   Reverse transactions are specific instruments to conduct open market operations whereby an NCB buys or sells eligible assets under a repurchase agreement or conducts credit operations in the form of collateralised loans depending on the relevant contractual or regulatory arrangements applied by the NCBs.\n2.   Repurchase agreements and collateralised loans shall comply with the additional requirements for such instruments set out in Part Seven.\n3.   Liquidity-providing reverse transactions shall be based on eligible assets as collateral, pursuant to Part Four.\n4.   The operational features of reverse transactions shall depend on the category of open market operation for which they are used.\n5.   Liquidity-absorbing reverse transactions shall be based on assets provided by the Eurosystem. The eligibility criteria of those assets shall be identical to those applied for eligible assets used in liquidity-providing reverse transactions, pursuant to Part Four. No valuation haircuts shall be applied in liquidity-absorbing reverse transactions.\nArticle 11\nForeign exchange swaps for monetary policy purposes\n1.   Foreign exchange swaps for monetary policy purposes consist of simultaneous spot and forward transactions in euro against a foreign currency.\n2.   Foreign exchange swaps for monetary policy purposes shall comply with the additional requirements for such instruments set out in Part Seven.\n3.   Unless decided otherwise by the ECB's Governing Council, the Eurosystem shall operate only in widely traded currencies and in accordance with standard market practice.\n4.   In each foreign exchange swap for monetary policy purposes, the Eurosystem and the counterparties shall agree on the swap points for the transaction that are quoted in accordance with general market conventions.

As regards their operational features, foreign exchange swaps for monetary policy purposes:\n(a)\nmay be conducted either as liquidity-providing or as liquidity-absorbing operations;\n(b)\nhave a frequency and maturity that is not standardised;\n(c)\nare executed by means of quick tender procedures or bilateral procedures, unless the Eurosystem decides to conduct the specific operation by other means (standard tender procedure), in the light of specific monetary policy considerations or in order to react to market conditions;\n(d)\nare executed in a decentralised manner by the NCBs, without prejudice to Article 45(3).\n6.   Counterparties participating in foreign exchange swaps for monetary policy purposes shall be subject to the eligibility criteria specified in Part Three, depending on the applicable procedure for the relevant operation.\nTable 2\nThe exchange rate terms of foreign exchange swaps for monetary policy purposes\nS\n=\nspot (on the transaction date of the foreign exchange swap) of the exchange rate between the euro (EUR) and a foreign currency ABC\nFM\n=\nforward exchange rate between the euro and a foreign currency ABC on the repurchase date of the swap (M)\nΔΜ\n=\nforward points between the euro and ABC at the repurchase date of the swap (M)\nN(.)\n=\nspot amount of currency; N(.)M is the forward amount of currency:\nor\nor\nArticle 12\nCollection of fixed-term deposits\n1.   The Eurosystem may invite counterparties to place fixed-term deposits with their home NCBs.\n2.   The deposits accepted from counterparties shall be for a fixed term and a fixed rate of interest shall be applied.\n3.   The interest rates applied to fixed-term deposits may be: (a) positive; (b) set at zero per cent; (c) negative.\n4.   The interest rate applied to the fixed-term deposit shall be a simple interest rate based on the actual/360 day-count convention. The interest shall be paid at maturity of the deposit. In cases of a negative interest rate, its application to fixed-term deposits shall entail a payment obligation of the deposit holder to the home NCB, including the right of that NCB to debit the account of the counterparty accordingly. The NCBs shall not provide any collateral in exchange for the fixed-term deposits.\n5.   Fixed-term deposits shall be held in accounts with the home NCB, even where such operations are to be executed in a centralised manner by the ECB under Article 45(3).\n6.   As regards their operational features, the collection of fixed-term deposits:\n(a)\nis conducted in order to absorb liquidity;\n(b)\nmay be conducted on the basis of a pre-announced schedule of operations with pre-defined frequency and maturity or may be conducted ad hoc to react to liquidity condition developments, e.g. the collection of fixed-term deposits may be conducted on the last day of a reserve maintenance period to counter liquidity imbalances which may have accumulated since the allotment of the last main refinancing operation;\n(c)\nis executed by means of quick tender procedures, unless it is decided by the ECB to conduct the specific operation by other means (bilateral procedure or standard tender procedure), in the light of specific monetary policy considerations or in order to react to market conditions;\n(d)\nis executed in a decentralised manner by the NCBs, without prejudice to Article 45(3).\n7.   Counterparties participating in the collection of fixed term deposits shall be subject to the eligibility criteria specified in Part Three, depending on the applicable procedure for the relevant operation.\nArticle 13\nIssuance of ECB debt certificates\n1.   ECB debt certificates constitute a debt obligation of the ECB in relation to the certificate holder.\n2.   ECB debt certificates shall be issued and held in book-entry form in securities depositories in Member States whose currency is the euro.\n3.   The ECB shall not impose any restrictions on the transferability of ECB debt certificates.\n4.   The ECB may issue ECB debt certificates at:\n(a)\na discounted issue amount that is below the nominal amount; or\n(b)\nan amount above the nominal amount,\nwhich are to be redeemed at maturity at a nominal amount.\nThe difference between the issue and the nominal (redemption) amount shall equal the interest accrued on the issue amount, at the agreed interest rate, over the maturity of the certificate. The interest rate applied shall be a simple interest rate based on the actual/360 day-count convention. The calculation of the issue amount shall be made in accordance with Table 3.\nTable 3\nIssuance of ECB debt certificates\nThe issue amount is:\nwhere:\nN\n=\nnominal amount of the ECB debt certificate\nrI\n=\ninterest rate (in %)\nD\n=\nmaturity of the ECB debt certificate (in days)\nPT\n=\nissue amount of the ECB debt certificate\n5.

Standing facilities shall consist of the following categories:\n(a)\nthe marginal lending facility;\n(b)\nthe deposit facility.\n3.   The terms and conditions of the standing facilities shall be identical in all Member States whose currency is the euro.\n4.   The NCBs shall only grant access to the standing facilities in accordance with the ECB's objectives and general monetary policy considerations.\n5.   The ECB may adapt the conditions of the standing facilities or suspend them at any time.\n6.   The ECB's Governing Council shall decide on the interest rates for the standing facilities on a regular basis. The revised interest rates shall become effective from the beginning of the new reserve maintenance period, as defined in Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 1745/2003 (ECB/2003/9). The ECB publishes a calendar of the reserve maintenance periods at least three months before the start of each calendar year.\n7.   Notwithstanding paragraph 6, the ECB's Governing Council may change the interest rate for the standing facilities at any point in time. Such decision shall become effective at the earliest from the following Eurosystem business day.\nCHAPTER 1\nMarginal lending facility\nArticle 18\nCharacteristics of the marginal lending facility\n1.   Counterparties may use the marginal lending facility to obtain overnight liquidity from the Eurosystem through a reverse transaction with their home NCB at a pre-specified interest rate using eligible assets as collateral.\n2.   The NCBs shall provide liquidity under the marginal lending facility by means of repurchase agreements or collateralised loans under the NCBs' applicable contractual or regulatory arrangements.\n3.   There shall be no limit on the amount of liquidity that may be provided under the marginal lending facility, subject to the requirement to provide adequate collateral under paragraph 4.\n4.   Counterparties are required to present sufficient eligible assets as collateral prior to using the marginal lending facility. These assets should be either pre-deposited with the relevant NCB or delivered with the request for access to the marginal lending facility.\nArticle 19\nAccess conditions for the marginal lending facility\n1.   Institutions fulfilling the eligibility criteria under Article 55 and which have access to an account with the NCB where the transaction can be settled, notably in TARGET2, may access the marginal lending facility.\n2.   Access to the marginal lending facility shall be granted only on days when TARGET2 is operational. On days when the SSSs are not operational, access to the marginal lending facility shall be granted on the basis of eligible assets which have already been pre-deposited with the NCBs.\n3.   If an NCB or any of its branches are not open for the purpose of conducting monetary policy operations on certain Eurosystem business days due to national or regional bank holidays, the home NCB shall inform its counterparties in advance of the arrangements to be made for access to the marginal lending facility on that bank holiday.\n4.   Access to the marginal lending facility can be granted either based on a specific request of the counterparty or automatically, as specified in paragraph 5 and 6 respectively.\n5.   A counterparty may send a request to its home NCB for access to the marginal lending facility. Provided that the request is received by the home NCB at the latest 15 minutes following the TARGET2 closing time, the NCB shall process the request on the same day in TARGET2. The deadline for requesting access to the marginal lending facility shall be postponed by an additional 15 minutes on the last Eurosystem business day of a reserve maintenance period. The request for access to the marginal lending facility shall specify the amount of credit required. The counterparty shall deliver sufficient eligible assets as collateral for the transaction, unless such assets have already been pre-deposited by the counterparty with the home NCB pursuant to Article 18(4).\n6.   At the end of each business day, a negative balance on a counterparty's settlement account with its home NCB after finalisation of the end-of-day control procedures shall automatically be considered as a request for recourse to the marginal lending facility. In order to meet the requirement in Article 18(4), counterparties shall have pre-deposited sufficient eligible assets as collateral for the transaction with the home NCB prior to such an automatic request arising. Failure to comply with this access condition shall be subject to sanctions in accordance with Articles 154 to 157.\nArticle 20\nMaturity and interest rate of the marginal lending facility\n1.   The maturity of credit extended under the marginal lending facility shall be overnight. For counterparties participating directly in TARGET2, the credit shall be repaid on the next day on which: (a) TARGET2; and (b) the relevant SSSs are operational, at the time at which those systems open.\n2.   The interest rate remunerating the marginal lending facility shall be announced in advance by the Eurosystem and shall be calculated as a simple interest rate based on the actual/360 day-count convention. The interest rate applied to the marginal lending facility is referred to as the marginal lending facility rate.\n3.   Interest under the marginal lending facility shall be payable together with repayment of the credit.\nCHAPTER 2\nDeposit facility\nArticle 21\nCharacteristics of the deposit facility\n1.   Counterparties may use the deposit facility to make overnight deposits with the Eurosystem through the home NCB, to which a pre-specified interest rate shall be applied.\n2.   The interest rate applied to the deposit facility may be: (a) positive; (b) set at zero per cent; (c) negative.\n3.   The NCBs shall not give any collateral in exchange for the deposits.\n4.   There shall be no limit on the amount a counterparty may deposit under the deposit facility.\nArticle 22\nAccess conditions to the deposit facility\n1.   Institutions fulfilling the eligibility criteria under Article 55 and which have access to an account with the NCB where the transaction can be settled, notably in TARGET2, may access the deposit facility. Access to the deposit facility shall be granted only on days when TARGET2 is operational.\n2.   To be granted access to the deposit facility, the counterparty shall send a request to its home NCB. Provided that the request is received by the home NCB at the latest 15 minutes following the TARGET2 closing time, the home NCB shall process the request on the same day in TARGET2. The deadline for requesting access to the deposit facility shall be postponed by an additional 15 minutes on the last Eurosystem business day of a reserve maintenance period. The request shall specify the amount to be deposited under the facility.\n3.   Due to the existence of different account structures across the NCBs, the NCBs, subject to the ECB's prior approval, may apply access conditions which are different from those referred to in this Article. The NCBs shall provide information to the counterparties on any such deviations from the access conditions described in this Article.\nArticle 23\nMaturity and interest rate of the deposit facility\n1.   The maturity of deposits under the deposit facility shall be overnight. For counterparties participating directly in TARGET2, deposits held under the deposit facility shall mature on the next day on which TARGET2 is operational, at the time at which this system opens.\n2.   The interest rate that applies to the deposit shall be announced in advance by the Eurosystem and shall be calculated as a simple interest rate based on the actual/360 day-count convention.\n3.   Interest on the deposits shall be payable on maturity of the deposit. In cases of negative interest rates, the application of the interest rate to the deposit facility shall entail a payment obligation of the deposit holder to the home NCB, including the right of that NCB to debit the account of the counterparty accordingly.\nTITLE III\nPROCEDURES FOR EUROSYSTEM MONETARY POLICY OPERATIONS\nCHAPTER 1\nTender and bilateral procedures for Eurosystem open market operations\nArticle 24\nTypes of procedures for open market operations\nOpen market operations shall be executed through tender procedures or bilateral procedures.\nSection 1\nTender Procedures\nArticle 25\nOverview of tender procedures\n1.   Tender procedures shall be performed in six operational steps, as specified in Table 4.\nTable 4\nOperational steps for tender procedures\nStep 1\nTender announcement\n(a)\nAnnouncement by the ECB through public wire services and the ECB's website\n(b)\nAnnouncement by the NCBs through national wire services and directly to individual counterparties (if deemed necessary)\nStep 2\nCounterparties' preparation and submission of bids\nStep 3\nCompilation of bids by the Eurosystem\nStep 4\nTender allotment and announcement of tender results\n(a)\nECB allotment decision\n(b)\nAnnouncement of the allotment results through public wire services and the ECB's website\nStep 5\nCertification of individual allotment results\nStep 6\nSettlement of the transactions\n2.   Tender procedures shall be conducted in the form of standard tender procedures or quick tender procedures. The operational features of standard and quick tender procedures are identical, except for the time frame (Tables 5 and 6) and the range of counterparties.\nTable 5\nIndicative time frame for the operational steps in standard tender procedures (times are stated in Central European Time\n (13)\n)\nTable 6\nIndicative time frame for the operational steps in quick tender procedures (times are stated in CET)\n3.   The Eurosystem may conduct either fixed-rate or variable rate tender procedures.\nArticle 26\nStandard tender procedures\n1.   The Eurosystem shall use standard tender procedures for the execution of: (a) MROs; (b) LTROs; (c) specific structural operations, i.e. structural reverse operations and the issuance of ECB debt certificates.\n2.   The Eurosystem may also use standard tender procedures to conduct fine-tuning operations and structural operations executed by means of outright transactions in the light of specific monetary policy considerations or in order to react to market conditions.\n3.   For standard tender procedures, as a rule: (a) a maximum of 24 hours shall elapse from the announcement of the tender procedure to the certification of the allotment result; and (b) the time between the submission deadline and the announcement of the allotment result is approximately two hours.\n4.   The ECB may decide to adjust the time frame in individual operations, if deemed appropriate.\nArticle 27\nQuick tender procedures\n1.   The Eurosystem normally uses quick tender procedures for the execution of fine-tuning operations, but may also use quick tender procedures for structural operations executed by means of outright transactions in the light of specific monetary policy considerations or in order to react to market conditions.\n2.   Quick tender procedures are executed within 105 minutes of the announcement of the tender procedure, with certification taking place immediately after the public announcement of the allotment result.\n3.   The ECB may decide to adjust the time frame in individual operations, if deemed appropriate.\n4.   The Eurosystem may select, according to the criteria and procedures specified in Article 57, a limited number of counterparties to participate in quick tender procedures.\nArticle 28\nExecution of standard tender procedures for MROs and regular LTROs, based on the tender calendar\n1.   The tender procedures for MROs and regular LTROs shall be executed in accordance with the indicative calendar for the Eurosystem's regular tender operations.\n2.   The indicative calendar for the Eurosystem's regular tender operations is published on the website of the ECB and NCBs at least three months before the start of the calendar year for which it is valid.\n3.   The indicative trade days for MROs and regular LTROs are specified in Table 7.\nTable 7\nNormal trade days for MROs and regular LTROs\nCategory of open market operations\nNormal trade day (T)\nMROs\nEach Tuesday (14)\nRegular LTROs\nThe last Wednesday of each calendar month (15)\nArticle 29\nExecution of tender procedures for fine-tuning and structural operations without a tender operation calendar\n1.   Fine-tuning operations are not executed according to any pre-specified calendar. The ECB may decide to conduct fine-tuning operations on any Eurosystem business day. Only NCBs in relation to which the trade day, the settlement day and the reimbursement day are NCB business days participate in such operations.\n2.   Structural operations executed by means of standard tender procedures are not performed according to any pre-specified calendar. They are normally conducted and settled on days which are NCB business days in all Member States whose currency is the euro.\nSection 2\nOperational steps for tender procedures\nSubsection 1\nAnnouncement of tender procedures\nArticle 30\nAnnouncement of standard and quick tender procedures\n1.   Standard tender procedures shall be announced by the ECB publicly in advance by means of wire services and on the ECB's website. In addition, the NCBs may announce standard tender procedures via national wire services and directly to counterparties, if deemed necessary.\n2.   Quick tender procedures may be announced by the ECB publicly in advance by means of wire services and on the ECB's website. In quick tender procedures that are publicly announced in advance, the NCB may contact the selected counterparties directly if deemed necessary. In quick tender procedures that are not announced publicly in advance, the selected counterparties shall be contacted directly by the NCBs.\n3.   The tender announcement represents an invitation to counterparties to submit bids, which are legally binding. The announcement does not represent an offer by the ECB or the NCBs.\n4.   The information to be included in the public announcement of a tender procedure is laid down in Annex II.\n5.   The ECB may take any action it deems appropriate to correct any error in the announcement of tender procedures, including cancelling or interrupting a tender procedure under execution.\nSubsection 2\nPreparation and submission of bids by counterparties\nArticle 31\nForm and place of submission of bids\n1.   The bids must be submitted to a counterparty's home NCB. The bids of an institution may only be submitted to the home NCB by one establishment in each Member State whose currency is the euro where the institution is established, i.e. either by the head office or by a designated branch.\n2.   Counterparties shall submit bids in a format that follows the templates provided by the NCB for the relevant operation.\nArticle 32\nSubmission of bids\n1.   In fixed-rate tender procedures, counterparties shall state in their bids the amount that they are willing to transact with the NCBs.\n2.   In fixed-rate foreign exchange swap tender procedures, the counterparties shall state the amount of currency kept fixed that they intend to sell and buy back, or buy and sell back, at that rate.\n3.   In variable rate tender procedures, counterparties may submit bids for up to 10 different interest rates, prices or swap points. Under exceptional circumstances, the Eurosystem may impose a limit on the number of bids that may be submitted by each counterparty. In each bid, counterparties shall state the amount that they are willing to transact and the relevant interest rate or price or swap point. A bid for an interest rate or swap point shall be expressed as multiples of 0,01 percentage points. A bid for a price shall be expressed as multiples of 0,001 percentage points.\n4.   For variable rate foreign exchange swap tender procedures, the counterparties shall state the amount of the currency to be kept fixed and the swap point quotation at which they intend to enter into the operation.\n5.   For variable rate foreign exchange swap tender procedures, the swap points shall be quoted in accordance with standard market conventions and bids shall be expressed as multiples of 0,01 swap points.\n6.   With regard to the issuance of ECB debt certificates, the ECB may decide that bids shall be expressed in the form of a price rather than an interest rate. In such cases, prices shall be quoted as a percentage of the nominal amount, with three decimal places.\nArticle 33\nMinimum and maximum bid amounts\n1.   For MROs, the minimum bid amount shall be EUR 1 000 000. Bids exceeding this amount shall be expressed as multiples of EUR 100 000. The minimum bid amount shall apply to each individual interest rate level.\n2.   For LTROs, each NCB shall set a minimum bid amount in the range from EUR 10 000 to EUR 1 000 000. Bids exceeding the minimum bid amount shall be expressed as multiples of EUR 10 000. The minimum bid amount shall be applied to each individual interest rate level.\n3.   For fine-tuning and structural operations, the minimum bid amount shall be EUR 1 000 000. Bids exceeding this amount shall be expressed as multiples of EUR 100 000. The minimum bid amount shall apply to each individual interest rate, price or swap point, depending on the specific type of transaction.\n4.   The ECB may impose a maximum bid amount, which is the largest acceptable bid from an individual counterparty, to prevent disproportionately large bids. If imposed, the ECB shall include details of such a maximum bid amount in the public tender announcement.\nArticle 34\nMinimum and maximum bid rate\n1.   In liquidity-providing variable rate tender procedures, the ECB may impose a minimum bid rate, which is a lower limit to the interest rate at which counterparties may submit bids.\n2.   In liquidity-absorbing variable rate tender procedures, the ECB may impose a maximum bid rate, which is an upper limit to the interest rate at which counterparties may submit bids.\nArticle 35\nDeadline for submission of bids\n1.   Counterparties may revoke their bids at any time up to the deadline for the submission of bids.\n2.   Bids submitted after the deadline shall not be considered and shall be treated as ineligible.\n3.   The home NCB shall determine if a counterparty has complied with the deadline for the submission of bids.\nArticle 36\nRejection of bids\n1.   An NCB shall reject:\n(a)\nall of a counterparty's bids, if the aggregate amount bid exceeds any maximum bid limit established by the ECB;\n(b)\nany bid of a counterparty, if the bid is below the minimum bid amount;\n(c)\nany bid of a counterparty, if the bid is below the minimum accepted interest rate, price, or swap point or above the maximum accepted interest rate, price or swap point.\n2.   An NCB may reject bids that are incomplete or do not follow the appropriate template.\n3.   If the home NCB decides to reject a bid, it shall inform the counterparty of such decision prior to the tender allotment.\nSubsection 3\nTender allotment\nArticle 37\nAllotment in liquidity-providing and liquidity-absorbing fixed-rate tender procedures\n1.   In a fixed-rate tender procedure, the bids of counterparties shall be allotted in the following manner:\n(a)\nThe bids shall be added together.\n(b)\nIf the aggregate amount bid exceeds the total amount of liquidity to be allotted, the submitted bids shall be satisfied pro rata, based on the ratio of the amount to be allotted to the aggregate amount bid, in accordance with Table 1 of Annex III.\n(c)\nThe amount allotted to each counterparty shall be rounded to the nearest euro.\n2.   The ECB may decide to allot:\n(a)\na minimum allotment amount, which is a lower limit on the amount that may be allotted to each bidder; or\n(b)\na minimum allotment ratio, which is a lower limit, expressed in percentage terms, on the ratio of bids at the marginal interest rate that may be allotted to each bidder.\nArticle 38\nAllotment in liquidity-providing variable rate tender procedures in euro\n1.   In a liquidity-providing variable rate tender procedure in euro, the bids of counterparties shall be allotted in the following manner:\n(a)\nBids shall be listed in descending order of offered interest rates or ascending order of offered prices.\n(b)\nBids with the highest interest rate (lowest price) levels shall be satisfied first and subsequently bids with successively lower interest rates (higher price) shall be accepted, until the total liquidity to be allotted is exhausted.\n(c)\nIf at the marginal interest rate (highest accepted price), the aggregate amount bid exceeds the remaining amount to be allotted, the remaining amount shall be allocated pro rata among the bids based on the ratio of the remaining amount to be allotted to the total amount bid at the marginal interest rate (highest accepted price), in accordance with Table 2 of Annex III.\n(d)\nThe amount allotted to each counterparty shall be rounded to the nearest euro.\n2.   The ECB may decide to allot a minimum allotment amount to each successful bidder.\nArticle 39\nAllotment in liquidity-absorbing variable rate tender procedures in euro\n1.   In a liquidity-absorbing variable rate tender procedure in euro, used for the issuance of ECB debt certificates and the collection of fixed term deposits, the bids of counterparties shall be allotted in the following manner:\n(a)\nBids shall be listed in ascending order of offered interest rates or descending order of offered prices.\n(b)\nBids with the lowest interest rate (highest price) levels shall be satisfied first and subsequently bids with successively higher interest rates (lower price bids) shall be accepted until the total liquidity to be absorbed is exhausted.\n(c)\nIf at the marginal interest rate (lowest accepted price), the aggregate bid amount exceeds the remaining amount to be allotted, the remaining amount shall be allocated pro rata among the bids, based on the ratio of the remaining amount to be allotted to the total bid amount at the marginal interest rate (lowest accepted price), in accordance with Table 2 of Annex III.\n(d)\nThe amount allotted to each counterparty shall be rounded to the nearest euro. With regard to the issuance of ECB debt certificates, the allotted nominal amount shall be rounded to the nearest multiple of EUR 100 000.\n2.   The ECB may decide to allot a minimum allotment amount to each successful bidder.\nArticle 40\nAllotment in liquidity-providing variable rate foreign exchange swap tender procedures\n1.   In a liquidity-providing variable rate foreign exchange swap tender procedure, the bids of counterparties shall be allotted in the following manner:\n(a)\nBids shall be listed in ascending order of swap point quotations by taking into account the sign of the quotation.\n(b)\nThe sign of quotation depends on the sign of the interest rate differential between the foreign currency and the euro. For the maturity of the swap:\n(i)\nif the foreign currency interest rate is higher than the corresponding interest rate for the euro, the swap point quotation is positive, i.e. the euro is quoted at a premium to the foreign currency; and\n(ii)\nif the foreign currency interest rate is lower than the corresponding interest rate for the euro, the swap point quotation is negative, i.e. the euro is quoted at a discount to the foreign currency.\n(c)\nThe bids with the lowest swap point quotations shall be satisfied first and subsequently successively higher swap point quotations shall be accepted until the total amount of the fixed currency to be allotted is exhausted.\n(d)\nIf, at the highest swap point quotation accepted, i.e. the marginal swap point quotation, the aggregate amount bid exceeds the remaining amount to be allotted, the remaining amount shall be allocated pro rata among the bids, based on the ratio of the remaining amount to be allotted to the total amount bid at the marginal swap point quotation, in accordance with Table 3 of Annex III.\n(e)\nThe amount allotted to each counterparty shall be rounded to the nearest euro.\n2.   The ECB may decide to allot a minimum allotment amount to each successful bidder.\nArticle 41\nAllotment in liquidity-absorbing variable rate foreign exchange swap tender procedures\n1.   In a liquidity-absorbing variable rate foreign exchange swap tender procedure, the bids of counterparties shall be allotted in the following manner:\n(a)\nBids shall be listed in descending order of offered swap point quotations by taking into account the sign of the quotation.\n(b)\nThe sign of the quotation depends on the sign of the interest rate differential between the foreign currency and the euro. For the maturity of the swap:\n(i)\nif the foreign currency interest rate is higher than the corresponding interest rate for the euro, the swap point quotation is positive, i.e. the euro is quoted at a premium to the foreign currency; and\n(ii)\nif the foreign currency interest rate is lower than the corresponding interest rate for the euro, the swap point quotation is negative, i.e. the euro is quoted at a discount to the foreign currency.\n(c)\nBids with the highest swap point quotations shall be satisfied first and subsequently successively lower swap point quotations shall be accepted until:\n(i)\nthe total amount of the fixed currency to be absorbed is exhausted; and\n(ii)\nat the lowest swap point quotation accepted, i.e. the marginal swap point quotation, the aggregate amount bid exceeds the remaining amount to be allotted.\n(d)\nThe remaining amount shall be allocated pro rata among the bids, based on the ratio of the remaining amount to be allotted to the total amount bid at the marginal swap point quotation, in accordance with Table 3 of Annex III. The amount allotted to each counterparty shall be rounded to the nearest euro.\n2.   The ECB may decide to allot a minimum allotment amount to each successful bidder.\nArticle 42\nType of auction for variable rate tender procedures\nFor variable rate tender procedures, the Eurosystem may apply either a single rate auction (Dutch auction) or multiple rate auction (American auction).\nSubsection 4\nAnnouncement of tender results\nArticle 43\nAnnouncement of tender results\n1.   The ECB shall publicly announce its tender allotment decision with respect to the tender results by means of wire services and on the ECB's website. In addition, the NCBs may announce the ECB's tender allotment decision through national wire services and directly to counterparties if they deem it necessary.\n2.   The information to be included in the public announcement with respect to the tender results is laid down in Annex IV.\n3.   If the allotment decision contains erroneous information with respect to any of the information contained in the public tender result announcement referred to in paragraph 1, the ECB may take any action it deems appropriate to correct such erroneous information.\n4.   After the public announcement of the ECB's tender allotment decision on the tender results as referred to in paragraph 1, the NCBs shall directly certify the individual allotment results to counterparties, whereby each counterparty shall receive an individual and certain confirmation of its success in the tender procedure and the exact amount allotted to it.\nSection 3\nBilateral procedures for Eurosystem open market operations\nArticle 44\nOverview of bilateral procedures\n1.   The Eurosystem may execute any of the following open market operations by means of bilateral procedures:\n(a)\nfine-tuning operations (reverse transactions, foreign exchange swaps or the collection of fixed-term deposits); or\n(b)\nstructural operations (outright transactions).\n2.   Bilateral procedures, depending on the specific transaction, may be executed by means of direct contact with counterparties, as laid down in Article 45, or through stock exchanges and market agents, as laid down in Article 46.\nArticle 45\nBilateral procedures executed by means of direct contact with counterparties\n1.   Bilateral procedures for fine-tuning operations and structural operations conducted by means of outright transactions may be executed by means of direct contact with counterparties.\n2.   The NCBs shall directly contact one or more institutions selected in accordance with the eligibility criteria laid down in Article 57. The NCBs shall follow the ECB's instructions in deciding whether to enter into a transaction with those institutions.\n3.   Without prejudice to paragraph 2, the ECB's Governing Council may decide that, under exceptional circumstances, the ECB or one or more NCBs, acting as the ECB's operating arm, shall conduct fine-tuning operations or structural operations conducted by means of outright transactions executed through bilateral procedures. In such an event, the procedures for those operations shall be adapted accordingly. The ECB shall decide whether to enter into a transaction with the contacted institutions.\nArticle 46\nBilateral procedures executed by means of stock exchanges and market agents\n1.   Without prejudice to Article 45, bilateral procedures for structural operations conducted by means of outright transactions may be executed through stock exchanges and market agents.\n2.   The range of counterparties shall not be restricted, as provided for in Article 57.\n3.   The procedures shall be adapted to the market conventions for the debt instruments transacted.\nArticle 47\nAnnouncement of operations executed by means of bilateral procedures\n1.   Fine-tuning operations or structural operations conducted by means of outright transactions executed by means of bilateral procedures are not announced publicly in advance, unless the ECB decides otherwise.\n2.   The ECB may decide not to announce the results of such bilateral procedures publicly.\nArticle 48\nOperating days for bilateral procedures\n1.   The ECB may decide to conduct bilateral procedures for fine-tuning operations on any Eurosystem business day. Only NCBs in relation to which the trade day, the settlement day and the reimbursement day are NCB business days may participate in such operations.\n2.   Bilateral procedures for structural operations conducted by means of outright transactions are normally executed and settled on days which are NCB business days in all Member States whose currency is the euro.\nCHAPTER 2\nSettlement procedures for Eurosystem monetary policy operations\nArticle 49\nOverview of settlement procedures\n1.   Payment orders relating to the participation in open market operations or use of the standing facilities shall be settled on the counterparties' accounts with an NCB or on the accounts of a settlement bank participating in TARGET2.\n2.   Payment orders relating to the participation in open market liquidity-providing operations or use of the marginal lending facility shall only be settled at the moment of or after the final transfer of the eligible assets as collateral to the operation. For this purpose, counterparties shall:\n(a)\npre-deposit the eligible assets at an NCB; or\n(b)\nsettle the eligible assets with an NCB on a delivery-versus-payment basis.\nArticle 50\nSettlement of open market operations\n1.   The Eurosystem shall endeavour to settle transactions related to its open market operations at the same time in all Member States whose currency is the euro with all counterparties that have provided sufficient eligible assets as collateral. However, owing to operational constraints and technical features (e.g. of SSSs), the timing within the day of the settlement of open market operations may differ across the Member States whose currency is the euro.\n2.   The indicative settlement dates are summarised in Table 8.\nTable 8\nIndicative settlement dates for Eurosystem open market operations\n (16)\nMonetary policy instrument\nSettlement date for open market operations based on standard tender procedures\nSettlement date for open market operations based on quick tender procedures or bilateral procedures\nReverse transactions\nT + 1\nT\nOutright transactions\nAccording to market convention for the eligible assets\nIssuance of ECB debt certificates\nT + 2\n—\nForeign exchange swaps\nT, T + 1 or T + 2\nCollection of fixed-term deposits\nT\nArticle 51\nSettlement of open market operations executed by means of standard tender procedures\n1.   The Eurosystem shall endeavour to settle open market operations executed by means of standard tender procedures, on the first day following the trade day on which TARGET2 and all relevant SSSs are open.\n2.   The settlement dates for MROs and regular LTROs are specified in advance in the indicative calendar for the Eurosystem's regular tender operations. If the normal settlement date coincides with a bank holiday, the ECB may decide to apply a different settlement date, with the option of same-day settlement. The Eurosystem shall endeavour to ensure that the time of settlement of MROs and regular LTROs coincides with the time of reimbursement of a previous operation of corresponding maturity.\n3.   The issuance of ECB debt certificates shall be settled on the second day following the trade day on which TARGET2 and all relevant SSSs are open.\nArticle 52\nSettlement of open market operations conducted by means of quick tender procedures or bilateral procedures\n1.   The Eurosystem shall endeavour to settle open market operations executed by means of quick tender procedures and bilateral procedures on the trade day. Other settlement dates may be applied, in particular for outright transactions and foreign exchange swaps.\n2.   Fine-tuning operations and structural operations conducted by means of outright transactions executed by means of bilateral procedures shall be settled in a decentralised manner through the NCBs.\nArticle 53\nFurther provisions relating to settlement and end-of-day procedures\n1.   Without prejudice to the requirements laid down in this Chapter, additional provisions relating to settlement may be laid down in the contractual or regulatory arrangements applied by the NCBs, or the ECB, for the specific monetary policy instrument.\n2.   The end-of-day procedures are specified in the documentation relating to the TARGET2 framework.\nArticle 54\nReserve holdings and excess reserves\n1.   Pursuant to Article 6(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1745/2003 (ECB/2003/9), a counterparty's settlement account with an NCB may be used as a reserve account. Reserve holdings on settlement accounts may be used for intraday settlement purposes. The daily reserve holding of a counterparty shall be calculated as the end-of-day balance on its reserve account. For the purposes of this Article, ‘reserve account’ shall have the same meaning as that in Regulation (EC) No 1745/2003 (ECB/2003/9).\n2.   Reserve holdings that exceed the minimum reserves required pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 2531/98 and Regulation (EC) No 1745/2003 (ECB/2003/9) shall be remunerated at zero per cent or the deposit facility rate, whichever is lower.\nPART THREE\nELIGIBLE COUNTERPARTIES\nArticle 55\nEligibility criteria for participation in Eurosystem monetary policy operations\nWith regard to Eurosystem monetary policy operations, subject to Article 57, the Eurosystem shall only allow participation by institutions that fulfil the criteria laid down in this Article.\n(a)\nThey shall be subject to the Eurosystem's minimum reserve system pursuant to Article 19.1 of the Statute of the ESCB and shall not have been granted an exemption from their obligations under the Eurosystem's minimum reserve system pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 2531/98 and Regulation (EC) No 1745/2003 (ECB/2003/9).\n(b)\nThey must be financially sound.\n(c)\nThey shall be one of the following:\n(i)\nsubject to at least one form of harmonised Union/EEA supervision by competent authorities in accordance with Directive 2013/36/EU and Regulation (EU) No 575/2013;\n(ii)\npublicly-owned credit institutions, within the meaning of Article 123(2) of the Treaty, subject to supervision of a standard comparable to supervision by competent authorities under Directive 2013/36/EU and Regulation (EU) No 575/2013;\n(iii)\ninstitutions subject to non-harmonised supervision by competent authorities of a standard comparable to harmonised Union/EEA supervision by competent authorities under Directive 2013/36/EU and Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, e.g. branches established in Member States whose currency is the euro of institutions incorporated outside the EEA;\n(d)\nThey shall fulfil any operational requirements specified in the contractual or regulatory arrangements applied by the home NCB or ECB in respect of the specific instrument or operation.\nArticle 56\nAccess to open market operations executed by means of standard tender procedures and to standing facilities\n1.   Institutions fulfilling the eligibility criteria under Article 55 shall have access to any of the following Eurosystem monetary policy operations:\n(a)\nstanding facilities;\n(b)\nopen market operations executed by means of standard tender procedures.\n2.   Access to the standing facilities or open market operations executed by means of standard tender procedures shall only be granted to institutions fulfilling the eligibility criteria under Article 55 through their home NCB.\n3.   Where an institution fulfilling the eligibility criteria under Article 55 has establishments, e.g. head office or branches, in more than one Member State whose currency is the euro, each establishment fulfilling the eligibility criteria under Article 55 may access the standing facilities or the open market operations executed by means of standard tender procedures through its home NCB.\n4.   Bids for open market operations executed by means of standard tender procedures and for recourse to the standing facilities shall be submitted by only one establishment in each Member State whose currency is the euro, i.e. either by the head office or by a designated branch.\nArticle 57\nSelection of counterparties for access to open market operations executed by means of quick tender procedures or bilateral procedures\n1.   For open market operations executed by means of quick tender procedures or bilateral procedures, counterparties shall be selected in accordance with paragraphs 2 to 4.\n2.   For structural operations conducted by means of outright transactions that are executed by means of bilateral procedures, there shall be no restriction on the range of counterparties. For structural operations conducted by means of outright transactions, which are executed by means of quick tender procedures, the eligibility criteria laid down in Article 57(3)(b) shall apply.\n3.   For fine-tuning operations that are executed by means of quick tender procedures or bilateral procedures, counterparties shall be selected as follows:\n(a)\nFor fine-tuning operations that are conducted by means of foreign exchange swaps for monetary policy purposes and executed by means of quick tender or bilateral procedures, the range of counterparties shall be identical to the range of entities that are selected for Eurosystem foreign exchange intervention operations and are established in the Member States whose currency is the euro. Counterparties for foreign exchange swaps for monetary policy purposes by means of quick tender or bilateral procedures do not need to fulfil the criteria laid down in Article 55. The selection criteria for counterparties participating in Eurosystem foreign exchange intervention operations are based on the principles of prudence and efficiency, as laid down in Annex V. The NCBs may apply limit-based systems in order to control credit exposures vis-à-vis individual counterparties participating in foreign exchange swaps for monetary policy purposes.\n(b)\nFor fine-tuning operations conducted by means of reverse transactions or through the collection of fixed-term deposits and executed by means of quick tender procedures or bilateral procedures, each NCB shall select, for a specific transaction, a set of counterparties from among the institutions that fulfil the eligibility criteria laid down in Article 55 and are established in its Member State whose currency is the euro. The selection shall be primarily based on the relevant institution's activity in the money market. Additional selection criteria may be applied by the NCB, such as the efficiency of the trading desk and the bidding potential.\n4.   If the ECB's Governing Council, pursuant to Article 45(3), decides that the ECB shall conduct, by itself or by means of one or more NCBs fine-tuning operations executed by means of bilateral procedures, the ECB shall select its counterparties in accordance with a rotation scheme among the counterparties that are eligible to participate in quick tender procedures and bilateral procedures.\n5.   Without prejudice to paragraphs 1 to 4, open market operations executed by means of quick tender procedures or bilateral procedures may also be conducted with a broader range of counterparties than those indicated in paragraphs 2 to 4, if the ECB's Governing Council so decides.\nPART FOUR\nELIGIBLE ASSETS\nTITLE I\nGENERAL PRINCIPLES\nArticle 58\nEligible assets and accepted collateralisation techniques to be used for Eurosystem credit operations\n1.   The Eurosystem shall apply a single framework for eligible assets common to all Eurosystem credit operations as laid down in this Guideline.\n2.   In order to participate in Eurosystem credit operations, counterparties shall provide the Eurosystem with assets that are eligible as collateral for such operations. Given that Eurosystem credit operations include intraday credit, collateral provided by counterparties in respect of intraday credit shall also comply with the eligibility criteria laid down in this Guideline, as outlined in Guideline ECB/2012/27.\n3.   Counterparties shall provide eligible assets by:\n(a)\nthe transfer of ownership, which takes the legal form of a repurchase agreement; or\n(b)\nthe creation of a security interest, i.e. a pledge, assignment or a charge granted over the relevant assets, which takes the legal form of a collateralised loan,\nin either case pursuant to the national contractual or regulatory arrangements established and documented by the home NCB.\n4.   Where counterparties provide eligible assets as collateral, the home NCB may require either earmarking or pooling of eligible assets, depending on which type of collateral management system it uses.\n5.   No distinction shall be made between marketable and non-marketable assets with regard to the quality of the assets and their eligibility for the various types of Eurosystem credit operations.\n6.   Without prejudice to the obligation in paragraph 2 that counterparties provide the Eurosystem with assets that are eligible as collateral, the Eurosystem may, upon request, provide counterparties with advice regarding the eligibility of marketable assets if they have already been issued or regarding the eligibility of non-marketable assets when they have already been requested for submission. The Eurosystem shall not provide any advice in advance of these events.\nArticle 59\nGeneral aspects of the Eurosystem credit assessment framework for eligible assets\n1.   As one of the criteria for eligibility, assets shall meet the high credit standards specified in the Eurosystem credit assessment framework (ECAF).\n2.   The ECAF shall lay down the procedures, rules and techniques to ensure that the Eurosystem's requirement for high credit standards for eligible assets is maintained and that eligible assets comply with the credit quality requirements defined by the Eurosystem.\n3.   For the purposes of the ECAF, the Eurosystem shall define credit quality requirements in the form of credit quality steps by establishing threshold values for the probability of default (PD) over a one-year horizon, as follows.\n(a)\nThe Eurosystem considers, subject to regular review, a maximum probability of default over a one-year horizon of 0,10 % as equivalent to the credit quality requirement of credit quality step 2 and a maximum probability of default over a one-year horizon of 0,40 % as equivalent to the credit quality requirement of credit quality step 3.\n(b)\nAll eligible assets for Eurosystem credit operations shall comply, as a minimum, with a credit quality requirement corresponding to credit quality step 3. Additional credit quality requirements for specific assets shall be applied by the Eurosystem in accordance with Titles II and III of Part Four.\n4.   The Eurosystem shall publish information on credit quality steps on the ECB website in the form of the Eurosystem's harmonised rating scale, including the mapping of credit assessments, provided by the accepted external credit assessment institutions (ECAIs) and third-party rating tools (RTs) providers, to credit quality steps.\n5.   In the assessment of the credit quality requirements, the Eurosystem takes into account credit assessment information from credit assessment systems belonging to one of four sources in accordance with Title V of Part Four.\n6.   As part of its assessment of the credit standard of a specific asset, the Eurosystem may take into account institutional criteria and features ensuring similar protection for the asset holder, such as guarantees. The Eurosystem reserves the right to determine whether an issue, issuer, debtor or guarantor fulfils the Eurosystem's credit quality requirements on the basis of any information that the Eurosystem may consider relevant for ensuring adequate risk protection of the Eurosystem.\n7.   The ECAF follows the definition of ‘default’ laid down in Directive 2013/36/EU and Regulation (EU) No 575/2013.\nTITLE II\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA AND CREDIT QUALITY REQUIREMENTS FOR MARKETABLE ASSETS\nCHAPTER 1\nEligibility criteria for marketable assets\nArticle 60\nEligibility criteria relating to all types of marketable assets\nIn order to be eligible as collateral for Eurosystem credit operations, marketable assets shall be debt instruments fulfilling the eligibility criteria laid down in Section 1, except in the case of certain specific types of marketable assets, as laid down in Section 2.\nArticle 61\nList of eligible marketable assets and reporting rules\n1.   The ECB shall publish an updated list of eligible marketable assets on its website, in accordance with the methodologies indicated on its website and shall update it every weekday. Assets assessed in accordance with Article 87(3) shall not be published on this list of eligible marketable assets.\n2.   As a rule, the NCB reporting a specific marketable asset to the ECB is the NCB of the country in which the marketable asset is admitted to trading.\nSection 1\nGeneral eligibility criteria for marketable assets\nArticle 62\nPrincipal amount of marketable assets\n1.   In order to be eligible, until their final redemption, debt instruments shall have:\n(a)\na fixed and unconditional principal amount; or\n(b)\nan unconditional principal amount that is linked, on a flat basis, to only one euro area inflation index at a single point in time, containing no other complex structures.\n2.   Debt instruments with a principal amount linked to only one euro area inflation index at a single point in time shall also be permissible, given that the coupon structure is as defined in Article 63(1)(b)(i) fourth indent and linked to the same euro area inflation index.\n3.   Assets with warrants or similar rights attached shall not be eligible.\nArticle 63\nAcceptable coupon structures for marketable assets\n1.   In order to be eligible, debt instruments shall have either of the following coupon structures until final redemption:\n(a)\nfixed, zero or multi-step coupons with a pre-defined coupon schedule and pre-defined coupon values that may not result in a negative cash flow; or\n(b)\nfloating coupons that may not result in a negative cash flow and that have the following structure: coupon rate = (reference rate * l) ± x, with f ≤ coupon rate ≤ c, where:\n(i)\nthe reference rate is only one of the following at a single point in time:\n—\na euro money market rate, e.g. EURIBOR, LIBOR or similar indices;\n—\na constant maturity swap rate e.g. CMS, EIISDA, EUSA;\n—\nthe yield of one or an index of several euro area government bonds that have a maturity of one year or less;\n—\na euro area inflation index; and\n(ii)\nf (floor), c (ceiling), l (leveraging/deleveraging factor) and x (margin) are, if present, numbers that are either pre-defined at issuance, or may change over time only according to a path pre-defined at issuance, where f and c are greater than or equal to zero and l is greater than zero throughout the entire lifetime of the asset. For floating coupons with an inflation index reference rate, l shall be equal to one.\n2.   Debt instruments with a floating coupon, as referred to in paragraph 1(b), shall be considered ineligible if at any time following the application of the coupon rate formula, the coupon rate results in a negative value.\n3.   Any coupon structure that does not comply with paragraphs 1 and 2 shall not be eligible, including instances where only part of the remuneration structure, such as a premium, is non-compliant.\n4.   For the purpose of this Article, if the coupon is either of a fixed multi-step type or of a floating multi-step type, the assessment of the relevant coupon structure shall be based on the entire lifetime of the asset with both a forward- and backward-looking perspective.\n5.   Acceptable coupon structures shall have no issuer optionalities, i.e. during the entire lifetime of the asset, based on a forward- and backward-looking perspective, changes in the coupon structure that are contingent on an issuer's decision shall not be acceptable.\nArticle 64\nNon-subordination with respect to marketable assets\nEligible debt instruments shall not give rise to rights to the principal and/or the interest that are subordinated to the rights of holders of other debt instruments of the same issuer.\nArticle 65\nCurrency of denomination of marketable assets\nIn order to be eligible, debt instruments shall be denominated in euro or in one of the former currencies of the Member States whose currency is the euro.\nArticle 66\nPlace of issue of marketable assets\n1.   Subject to paragraph 2, in order to be eligible, debt instruments shall be issued in the EEA with a central bank or with an SSS that has been positively assessed pursuant to the Eurosystem User Assessment Framework.\n2.   In respect of debt instruments issued or guaranteed by a non-financial corporation for which no credit assessment has been provided by an accepted ECAI system for the issue, issuer or guarantor, the place of issue must be within the euro area.\n3.   International debt instruments issued through the ICSDs Euroclear Bank and Clearstream Banking Luxembourg shall comply with the following criteria, as applicable.\n(a)\nInternational debt instruments issued in global bearer form shall be issued in the form of new global notes (NGNs) and shall be deposited with a common safekeeper which is an ICSD or a CSD that has been positively assessed pursuant to the Eurosystem User Assessment Framework. By way of derogation, this shall not apply to international debt instruments issued in global bearer form issued in the form of classical global notes prior to 1 January 2007 and fungible tap issuances of such notes issued under the same ISIN irrespective of the date of the tap-issuance.\n(b)\nInternational debt instruments issued in global registered form shall be issued under the new safekeeping structure for international debt instruments. By way of derogation, this shall not apply to international debt instruments issued in global registered form prior to 1 October 2010.\n(c)\nInternational debt instruments in individual note form shall not be eligible unless they were issued in individual note form prior to 1 October 2010.\nArticle 67\nSettlement procedures for marketable assets\n1.   In order to be eligible, debt instruments shall be transferable in book-entry form and shall be held and settled in Member States whose currency is the euro through an account with an NCB or with an SSS that has been positively assessed pursuant to the Eurosystem User Assessment Framework, so that perfection and realisation of collateral are subject to the law of a Member State whose currency is the euro.\n2.   If the CSD/SSS where the asset is issued and the CSD/SSS where the asset is held, are not identical, for the purposes of eligibility, the two must be connected by an eligible link positively assessed pursuant to the Eurosystem User Assessment Framework in accordance with Article 150.\nArticle 68\nAcceptable markets for marketable assets\n1.   In order to be eligible, debt instruments shall be those which are admitted to trading on a regulated market as defined in Directive 2014/65/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council (17), or admitted to trading on certain acceptable non-regulated markets.\n2.   The ECB shall publish the list of acceptable non-regulated markets on its website and shall update it at least once a year.\n3.   The assessment of non-regulated markets by the Eurosystem shall be based on the following principles of safety, transparency and accessibility.\n(a)\nSafety refers to certainty with regard to transactions, in particular certainty in relation to the validity and enforceability of transactions.\n(b)\nTransparency refers to unimpeded access to information on the market's rules of procedure and operation, the financial features of the assets, the price formation mechanism, and the relevant prices and quantities, e.g. quotes, interest rates, trading volumes, outstanding amounts.\n(c)\nAccessibility refers to the ability of the Eurosystem to take part in and access the market. A market is considered accessible if its rules of procedure and operation allow the Eurosystem to obtain information and conduct transactions when needed for collateral management purposes.\n4.   The selection process for non-regulated markets shall be defined exclusively in terms of the performance of the Eurosystem collateral management function and should not be regarded as an assessment by the Eurosystem of the intrinsic quality of any market.\nArticle 69\nType of issuer or guarantor for marketable assets\n1.   In order to be eligible, debt instruments shall be issued or guaranteed by central banks of Member States, public sector entities, agencies, credit institutions, financial corporations other than credit institutions, non-financial corporations, multilateral development banks or international organisations.\n2.   In addition to those banks and organisations identified in Article 117(2) and Article 118 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, the Eurosystem may recognise any entity as a multilateral development bank or international organisation for the purposes of this Guideline based upon an assessment relating to all of the following criteria:\n(a)\nit is an organisation with a global or regional mandate, transcending national boundaries;\n(b)\nit is funded predominantly by contributions from national governments, or organisations or entities linked with national governments;\n(c)\nthe mission of the entity is in line with the Union's policies.\nArticle 70\nPlace of establishment of the issuer or guarantor\n1.   In order to be eligible, debt instruments shall be issued by an issuer established in the EEA or in a non-EEA G10 country, subject to the exceptions in paragraphs 3 to 6.\n2.   In order to be eligible, guarantors of debt instruments shall be established in the EEA, unless a guarantee is not needed to establish the credit quality requirements for specific debt instruments, subject to the exceptions laid down in paragraphs 3 and 4. The possibility to use an ECAI guarantor rating to establish the relevant credit quality requirements for specific debt instruments is laid down in Article 84.\n3.   For debt instruments issued or guaranteed by non-financial corporations for which no credit assessment from an accepted ECAI system exists for the issue, the issuer or the guarantor, the issuer or guarantor shall be established in a Member State whose currency is the euro.\n4.   For debt instruments issued or guaranteed by multilateral development banks or international organisations, the criterion in respect of place of establishment shall not apply and they shall be eligible irrespective of their place of establishment.\n5.   For asset-backed securities, the issuer must be established in the EEA in accordance with Article 74.\n6.   Debt instruments issued by issuers established in non-EEA G10 countries shall only be considered eligible if the Eurosystem has ascertained to its satisfaction that its rights would be protected in an appropriate manner under the laws of the relevant non-EEA G10 country. For this purpose, a legal assessment shall be submitted to the relevant NCB, in a form and substance acceptable to the Eurosystem, before the relevant debt instruments may be considered eligible.\nArticle 71\nCredit quality requirements for marketable assets\nIn order to be eligible, debt instruments shall meet the credit quality requirements specified in Chapter 2, except where otherwise stated.\nSection 2\nSpecific eligibility criteria for certain types of marketable assets\nSubsection 1\nSpecific eligibility criteria for asset-backed securities\nArticle 72\nEligibility criteria for asset-backed securities\nIn order to be eligible for Eurosystem credit operations, asset-backed securities shall comply with the general eligibility criteria relating to all types of marketable assets laid down in Section 1, with the exception of the requirements laid down in Article 62 relating to the principal amount, and in addition, the specific eligibility criteria laid down in this subsection.\nArticle 73\nHomogeneity and composition of the cash-flow generating assets\n1.   In order for ABSs to be eligible, all cash-flow generating assets backing the ABSs shall be homogenous, i.e. it shall be possible to report them according to one of the existing loan-level templates, which shall be one of the following:\n(a)\nresidential mortgages;\n(b)\ncommercial real estate mortgages;\n(c)\nloans to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs);\n(d)\nauto loans;\n(e)\nconsumer finance loans;\n(f)\nleasing receivables;\n(g)\ncredit card receivables.\n2.   The Eurosystem may consider an ABS not to be homogenous upon assessment of the data submitted by a counterparty.\n3.   ABSs shall not contain any cash-flow generating assets originated directly by the SPV issuing the ABSs.\n4.   The cash-flow generating assets shall not consist, in whole or in part, actually or potentially, of tranches of other ABSs. This criterion shall not exclude ABSs where the issuance structure includes two SPVs and the ‘true sale’ criterion is met in respect of those SPVs so that the debt instruments issued by the second SPV are directly or indirectly backed by the original pool of assets and all cash flows from the cash-flow generating assets are transferred from the first to the second SPV.\n5.   The cash-flow generating assets shall not consist, in whole or in part, actually or potentially, of credit-linked notes, swaps or other derivatives instruments, synthetic securities or similar claims. This restriction shall not encompass swaps used in ABS transactions strictly for hedging purposes.\n6.   Without prejudice to the eligibility criteria of this subsection, the cash-flow generating assets backing commercial mortgage-backed securities shall not contain loans which are at any time structured, syndicated or leveraged. For the purposes of this criterion, ‘structured loan’ means a structure involving subordinated tranches, ‘syndicated loan’ means a loan provided by a group of lenders in a lending syndicate and ‘leveraged loan’ means a loan provided to a company that already has a considerable degree of indebtedness, such as buy-out or take-over-financing, where the loan is used for the acquisition of the equity of a company which is also the obligor of the loan.\n7.   If the cash-flow generating assets backing the ABSs comprise leasing receivables with residual value leases, those ABSs that were on the list of eligible assets on 1 May 2015 shall maintain their eligibility until 31 August 2015.\nArticle 74\nGeographical restrictions concerning asset-backed securities and cash-flow generating assets\n1.   The issuer of ABSs shall be an SPV established in the EEA.\n2.   The cash-flow generating assets shall be originated by an originator incorporated in the EEA and sold to the SPV by the originator or by an intermediary incorporated in the EEA.\n3.   For the purpose of paragraph 2, a mortgage trustee or receivables trustee shall be considered to be an intermediary. ABSs on the list of eligible marketable assets as on 1 May 2015 that do not comply with paragraph 2 as regards the place of incorporation of a mortgage trustee or receivables trustee shall remain eligible until 1 May 2016 provided all other applicable eligibility criteria are met.\n4.   The obligors and the creditors of the cash-flow generating assets shall be incorporated, or, if they are natural persons, shall be resident in the EEA. Any related security shall be located in the EEA and the law governing the cash-flow generating assets shall be the law of an EEA country.\nArticle 75\nAcquisition of cash-flow generating assets by the SPV\n1.   The acquisition of the cash-flow generating assets by the SPV shall be governed by the law of a Member State.\n2.   The cash-flow generating assets shall have been acquired by the SPV from the originator or from an intermediary as laid down in Article 74(2) in a manner which the Eurosystem considers to be a ‘true sale’ that is enforceable against any third party, and which is beyond the reach of the originator and its creditors or the intermediary and its creditors, including in the event of the originator's or the intermediary's insolvency.\nArticle 76\nAssessment of clawback rules for asset-backed securities\n1.   ABSs shall only be considered eligible if the Eurosystem has ascertained that its rights would be protected in an appropriate manner against clawback rules considered relevant by the Eurosystem under the law of the relevant EEA country. For this purpose, before the ABSs may be considered eligible, the Eurosystem may require:\n(a)\nan independent legal assessment in a form and substance acceptable to the Eurosystem that sets out the applicable clawback rules in the relevant country; and/or\n(b)\nother documents, such as a solvency certificate from the transferor for the suspect period, which is a certain period of time during which the sale of cash-flow generating assets backing the ABSs may be invalidated by a liquidator.\n2.   Clawback rules, which the Eurosystem considers to be severe and therefore not acceptable, shall include:\n(a)\nrules under which the sale of cash-flow generating assets backing the ABSs can be invalidated by a liquidator solely on the basis that the sale was concluded within the suspect period, as referred to in paragraph 1(b), before the declaration of insolvency of the seller; or\n(b)\nrules where such invalidation can only be prevented by the transferee if they can prove that they were not aware of the insolvency of the seller at the time of the sale.\nFor the purposes of this criterion, the seller may be the originator or intermediary, as applicable.\nArticle 77\nNon-subordination of tranches for asset-backed securities\n1.   Only tranches or sub-tranches of ABSs that are not subordinated to other tranches of the same issue over the lifetime of the ABS shall be considered eligible.\n2.   A tranche or sub-tranche shall be considered to be non-subordinated to other tranches or sub-tranches of the same issue if, in accordance with the post-enforcement priority of payments, and if applicable, the post-acceleration priority of payments as set out in the prospectus, no other tranche or sub-tranche shall be given priority over that tranche or sub-tranche in respect of receiving payment, i.e. principal and interest, and thereby such tranche or sub-tranche shall be last in incurring losses among the different tranches or sub-tranches.\nArticle 78\nAvailability of loan level data for asset-backed securities\n1.   Comprehensive and standardised loan-level data on the pool of cash-flow generating assets backing the ABSs shall be made available in accordance with the procedures set out in Annex VIII, which includes the information on the required data quality score. In its eligibility assessment, the Eurosystem takes account of: (a) any failure to deliver data; and (b) how frequently individual loan-level data fields are found not to contain meaningful data.\n2.   Notwithstanding the required scoring values set out in Annex VIII in respect of loan-level data, the Eurosystem may accept as collateral asset-backed securities with a score lower than the required scoring value (A1) after completion of the relevant transitional period applicable in accordance with Annex VIII, on a case-by-case basis and subject to the provision of adequate explanations for the failure to achieve the required score. For each adequate explanation, the Eurosystem shall specify a maximum tolerance level and a tolerance horizon, as further specified on the ECB's website. The tolerance horizon shall indicate the time period within which the data quality for the ABSs must improve.\nArticle 79\nData requests for asset-backed securities\nThe Eurosystem shall reserve the right to request from any third party it considers relevant, including but not restricted to, the issuer, the originator and/or the arranger, any clarification and/or legal confirmation that it considers necessary to assess the eligibility of ABSs and with regard to the provision of loan-level data. If a third party fails to comply with a particular request, the Eurosystem may decide not to accept the ABSs as collateral or may decide to suspend the eligibility of such collateral.\nSubsection 2\nSpecific eligibility criteria for covered bonds backed by asset-backed securities\nArticle 80\nEligibility criteria for covered bonds backed by asset-backed securities\n1.   In the case of covered bonds backed by asset-backed securities, the cover pool of the covered bond shall only contain ABSs that comply with all of the following.\n(a)\nThe cash-flow generating assets backing the ABSs meet the criteria laid down in Article 129(1)(d) to (f) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 in respect of ABSs backing covered bonds.\n(b)\nThe cash-flow generating assets were originated by an entity closely linked to the issuer of the covered bonds, as described in Article 138.\n(c)\nThey are used as a technical tool to transfer mortgages or guaranteed real estate loans from the originating entity into the cover pool of the respective covered bond.\n2.   Subject to paragraph 4, the NCBs shall use the following measures to verify that the cover pool of covered bonds backed by ABSs does not contain ABSs that do not comply with paragraph 1.\n(a)\nOn a quarterly basis, the NCBs shall request a self-certification and undertaking of the issuer confirming that the cover pool of covered bonds backed by ABSs does not contain ABSs that do not comply with paragraph 1. The NCB's request shall specify that the self-certification must be signed by the issuer's Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Chief Financial Officer (CFO) or a manager of similar seniority, or by an authorised signatory on their behalf.\n(b)\nOn an annual basis, NCBs shall request an ex post confirmation by external auditors or cover pool monitors from the issuer, confirming that the cover pool of covered bonds backed by ABSs does not contain ABSs that do not comply with paragraph 1 for the monitoring period.\n3.   If the issuer fails to comply with a particular request or if the Eurosystem deems the content of a confirmation incorrect or insufficient to the extent that it is not possible to verify that the cover pool of covered bonds backed by ABSs comply with criteria in paragraph 1, the Eurosystem shall decide not to accept the covered bonds as eligible collateral or to suspend their eligibility.\n4.   Where the applicable legislation or prospectus exclude the inclusion of ABSs that do not comply with paragraph 1 as cover pool assets, no verification pursuant to paragraph 2 shall be required.\n5.   For the purposes of paragraph 1(b), the close links shall be determined at the time that the senior units of the asset-backed securities are transferred into the cover pool of the covered bond.\nSubsection 3\nSpecific eligibility criteria for debt certificates issued by the Eurosystem\nArticle 81\nEligibility criteria for debt certificates issued by the Eurosystem\n1.   Debt certificates issued by the ECB and debt certificates issued by the NCBs prior to the date of adoption of the euro in their respective Member State whose currency is the euro shall be eligible as collateral for Eurosystem credit operations.\n2.   Debt certificates issued by the Eurosystem shall not be subject to the criteria laid down in this Chapter.\nCHAPTER 2\nEurosystem's credit quality requirements for marketable assets\nArticle 82\nEurosystem's credit quality requirements for marketable assets\n1.   Further to the general rules set out in Article 59 and to the specific rules set out in Article 84, marketable assets shall comply with the following credit quality requirements in order to be eligible as collateral for Eurosystem credit operations:\n(a)\nWith the exception of ABSs, all marketable assets shall have a credit assessment provided by at least one accepted ECAI system, expressed in the form of a public credit rating, in compliance with, as a minimum, credit quality step 3 in the Eurosystem's harmonised rating scale.\n(b)\nABSs shall have credit assessments that are provided by at least two different accepted ECAI systems expressed in the form of two public credit ratings, one provided by each of these ECAI systems, in compliance with, as a minimum, credit quality step 2 in the Eurosystem's harmonised rating scale.\n2.   The Eurosystem may request any clarification that it considers necessary as regards the public credit rating referred to in paragraph 1.\nArticle 83\nTypes of ECAI credit assessments used for credit quality assessments of marketable assets\nThe following types of ECAI credit assessments from accepted ECAIs shall be used in determining compliance with the credit quality requirements applicable to marketable assets.\n(a)   An ECAI issue rating: this rating refers to an ECAI credit assessment assigned to either an issue or, in the absence of an issue rating from the same ECAI, the programme or issuance series under which an asset is issued. An ECAI assessment for a programme or issuance series shall only be relevant if it applies to the particular asset in question and a different issue rating from the same ECAI does not exist. For ECAI issue ratings, the Eurosystem shall make no distinction in respect of the original maturity of the asset. Any ECAI rating assigned to the issue or programme or issuance series shall be acceptable.\n(b)   An ECAI issuer rating: this rating refers to an ECAI credit assessment assigned to an issuer. For ECAI issuer ratings, the Eurosystem shall make a distinction in respect of the original maturity of the asset as regards the acceptable ECAI credit assessment. The distinction shall be made between:\n(i)\nshort-term assets, i.e. those assets with an original maturity of up to and including 390 days; and\n(ii)\nlong-term assets, i.e. those assets with an original maturity of more than 390 days. For short-term assets, ECAI short-term and long-term issuer ratings shall be acceptable. For long-term assets, only ECAI long-term issuer ratings shall be acceptable.\n(c)   An ECAI guarantor rating: this rating refers to an ECAI credit assessment assigned to a guarantor, if the guarantee meets the requirements of Title IV. For ECAI guarantor ratings, the Eurosystem shall make no distinction in respect of the original maturity of the asset. Only ECAI long-term guarantor ratings shall be acceptable.\nArticle 84\nPriority of ECAI credit assessments in respect of marketable assets\nFor marketable assets, ECAI credit assessments which determine the compliance of the asset with the credit quality requirements shall be taken into account by the Eurosystem in accordance with the following rules:\n(a)\nFor marketable assets other than marketable assets issued by central governments, regional governments, local governments, agencies, multilateral development banks or international organisations and ABSs, the following rules shall apply.\n(i)\nThe Eurosystem shall consider ECAI issue ratings in priority to ECAI issuer or ECAI guarantor ratings. Without prejudice to the application of this priority rule, in accordance with Article 82(1)(a), at least one ECAI credit assessment must comply with the Eurosystem's applicable credit quality requirements.\n(ii)\nIf multiple ECAI issue ratings are available for the same issue, then the first-best of those ECAI issue ratings shall be taken into account by the Eurosystem. If the first-best ECAI issue rating does not comply with the Eurosystem's credit quality threshold for marketable assets, the asset shall not be eligible, even if a guarantee that is acceptable under Title IV exists.\n(iii)\nIn the absence of any ECAI issue rating, an ECAI issuer or ECAI guarantor rating may be considered by the Eurosystem. If multiple ECAI issuer and/or ECAI guarantor ratings are available for the same issue, then the first-best of those ratings shall be taken account by the Eurosystem.\n(b)\nFor marketable assets issued by central governments, regional governments, local governments, agencies, multilateral development banks or international organisations, the following rules shall apply.\n(i)\nIn accordance with Article 82(1)(a), at least one ECAI credit assessment must comply with the Eurosystem's applicable credit quality requirements. The Eurosystem shall only consider ECAI issuer or ECAI guarantor ratings.\n(ii)\nIf multiple ECAI issuer and ECAI guarantor ratings are available, the first-best of those ratings shall be taken into account by the Eurosystem.\n(iii)\nCovered bonds issued by agencies shall not be assessed in accordance with the rules in this point and shall instead be assessed in accordance with point (a).\n(c)\nFor ABSs, the following rules shall apply.\n(i)\nIn accordance with Article 82(1)(b), at least two ECAI credit assessments shall comply with the Eurosystem's applicable credit quality requirements. The Eurosystem shall only consider ECAI issue ratings.\n(ii)\nIf more than two ECAI issue ratings are available, the first- and second-best of such ECAI issue ratings shall be taken into account by the Eurosystem.\nArticle 85\nMulti-issuer securities\nFor marketable assets with more than one issuer (multi-issuer securities), the applicable ECAI issuer rating shall be determined on the basis of each issuer's potential liability as follows:\n(a)\nIf each issuer is jointly and severally liable for the obligations of all other issuers under the issue or, if applicable, for the programme, or issuance series, the ECAI issuer rating to be considered shall be the highest rating among the first-best ECAI issuer ratings of all the relevant issuers; or\n(b)\nIf any issuer is not jointly and severally liable for the obligations of all other issuers under the issue or, if applicable, for the programme, or issuance series, the ECAI issuer rating to be considered shall be the lowest rating among the first-best ECAI issuer ratings of all the relevant issuers.\nArticle 86\nNon-euro ratings\nFor the purpose of ECAI issuer ratings, a foreign currency rating shall be acceptable. If the asset is denominated in the domestic currency of the issuer, the local currency rating shall also be acceptable.\nArticle 87\nCredit quality assessment criteria for marketable assets in the absence of a credit assessment provided by an accepted ECAI\n1.   In the absence of an appropriate credit assessment provided by an accepted ECAI for the issue, issuer or guarantor, as would be applicable pursuant to Article 84(a) or (b), an implicit credit assessment of marketable assets (with the exception of ABSs) shall be derived by the Eurosystem in accordance with the rules laid down in paragraphs 2 and 3. This implicit credit assessment is required to comply with the Eurosystem's credit quality requirements.\n2.   If the debt instruments are issued or guaranteed by a regional government or a local authority or a ‘public sector entity’ as defined in Article 4(8) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 (hereinafter a ‘CRR public sector entity’) established in a Member State whose currency is the euro, the credit assessment shall be performed by the Eurosystem in accordance with the following rules.\n(a)\nIf the issuers or guarantors are regional governments, local authorities or CRR public sector entities, which according to competent authorities are treated for capital requirements purposes pursuant to Articles 115(2), 116(1) and 116(4) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 equally to the central government in whose jurisdiction they are established, the debt instruments issued or guaranteed by these entities shall be allocated the credit quality step corresponding to the best credit rating provided by an accepted ECAI to the central government in whose jurisdiction these entities are established.\n(b)\nIf the issuers or guarantors are regional governments, local authorities and CRR public sector entities, which according to competent authorities are treated for capital requirements purposes pursuant to Articles 115(1) and 116(2) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 equally to credit institutions, the debt instruments issued or guaranteed by these entities shall be allocated the credit step corresponding to one credit quality step below the best credit rating provided by an accepted ECAI in relation to the central government in which jurisdiction these entities are established.\n(c)\nIf the issuers or guarantors are CRR public sector entities that are not referred to in points (a) and (b), no implicit credit assessment is derived and they shall be treated equally to private sector entities.\n3.   If the debt instruments are issued or guaranteed by non-financial corporations established in a Member State whose currency is the euro, the credit quality assessment shall be performed by the Eurosystem based on the credit quality assessment rules applicable to the credit quality assessment of credit claims in Chapter 2 of Title III. Assets in relation to which the credit quality is assessed in accordance with the rules contained in this paragraph shall not be included in the public list of eligible marketable assets.\nTable 9\nImplicit credit assessments for issuers or guarantors without an ECAI credit assessment\nAllocation of issuers or guarantors under Regulation (EU) No 575/2013\nECAF derivation of the implicit credit assessment of the issuer or guarantor belonging to the corresponding class\nClass 1\nRegional governments, local authorities and CRR public sector entities (CRR PSEs) that, according to the competent authorities, can be treated in the same manner as the central government for capital requirements purposes\nAllocated the ECAI credit assessment of the central government of the country in which it is established\nClass 2\nRegional governments, local authorities and CRR PSEs that according to competent authorities can be treated equally to credit institutions for capital requirements purposes\nAllocated a credit assessment one credit quality step (18) below the ECAI credit assessment of the central government of the country in which it is established\nClass 3\nOther CRR PSEs\nTreated like private sector issuers or debtors\nArticle 88\nAdditional credit quality requirements for asset-backed securities\n1.   For ABSs, the credit quality assessment shall be based on a public issue rating that is explained in a publicly available credit rating report, i.e. a new issue report. The publicly available credit rating report shall include, inter alia, a comprehensive analysis of structural and legal aspects, a detailed collateral pool assessment, an analysis of the transaction participants, as well as an analysis of any other relevant details of a transaction.\n2.   Further to the requirement in paragraph 1, regular surveillance reports published by the accepted ECAIs are required for asset-backed securities. The publication of these reports shall take place no later than four weeks after the coupon payment date of the ABSs. The reference date of these reports shall be the most recent coupon payment date except for ABSs paying the coupon on a monthly basis, in which case the surveillance report shall be published at least quarterly. The surveillance reports shall contain, as a minimum, the key transaction data, e.g. composition of the collateral pool, transaction participants, capital structure, as well as performance data.\nTITLE III\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA AND CREDIT QUALITY REQUIREMENTS FOR NON-MARKETABLE ASSETS\nCHAPTER 1\nEligibility criteria for non-marketable assets\nSection 1\nEligibility criteria for credit claims\nArticle 89\nEligible type of asset\n1.   The eligible type of asset shall be a credit claim that is a debt obligation of a debtor vis-à-vis a counterparty.\n2.   Types of credit claims that have a ‘reducing balance’, i.e. where the principal and interest are paid off according to a pre-agreed schedule, as well as drawn credit lines, shall be eligible types of credit claim.\n3.   Current account overdrafts, letters of credit and undrawn credit lines, e.g. undrawn facilities of revolving credit claims, which authorise the use of credit but are not credit claims per se, shall not be eligible types of credit claim.\n4.   A syndicated loan share shall be an eligible type of credit claim. For the purposes of this Section, a syndicated loan share means a credit claim resulting from the participation of a lender in a loan provided by a group of lenders in a lending syndicate.\n5.   A credit claim granted in a context other than a mere lending relationship may constitute an eligible type of asset. A claim inherent to certain leasing or factoring structures may qualify as an eligible type of asset, if it constitutes a credit claim. Claims purchased under a factoring only qualify as an eligible type of asset to the extent they actually constitute credit claims as opposed to other claims, such as purchase price claims.\nArticle 90\nPrincipal amount and coupons of credit claims\nIn order to be eligible, credit claims shall comply, until final redemption, with the following requirements:\n(a)\na fixed, unconditional principal amount; and\n(b)\nan interest rate that cannot result in a negative cash flow, whereby the interest rate shall be one of the following:\n(i)\na ‘zero-coupon’;\n(ii)\nfixed;\n(iii)\nfloating, i.e. linked to another interest rate reference or to the inflation rate.\nArticle 91\nNon-subordination\nCredit claims may not afford rights to the principal and/or the interest that are subordinated to: (a) the rights of holders of other unsecured debt obligations of the debtor including other shares or sub-shares in the same syndicated loan; and (b) the rights of holders of debt instruments of the same issuer.\nArticle 92\nCredit quality requirements for credit claims\nThe credit quality of credit claims is assessed on the basis of the credit quality of the debtor or guarantor. The relevant debtor or guarantor shall comply with the Eurosystem's credit quality requirements as specified in the ECAF rules for credit claims laid down in Chapter 2 of Title III of Part Four.\nArticle 93\nMinimum size of credit claims\nFor domestic use, credit claims shall, at the time of their submission as collateral by the counterparty, meet a minimum size threshold laid down by the home NCB. For cross-border use, a minimum size threshold of EUR 500 000 shall apply.\nArticle 94\nCurrency of denomination of credit claims\nCredit claims shall be denominated in euro or in one of the former currencies of the Member States whose currency is the euro.\nArticle 95\nType of debtor or guarantor\n1.   The debtors and guarantors of eligible credit claims shall be non-financial corporations, public sector entities, multilateral development banks or international organisations. For the purposes of this Article, a multilateral development bank or an international organisation may be recognised by the Eurosystem in the same manner as described in Article 69(2).\n2.   If a credit claim has more than one debtor, each debtor shall be individually and severally liable for the full repayment of the entire credit claim.\nArticle 96\nLocation of the debtor or guarantor\n1.   The debtor in respect of a credit claim shall be established in a Member State whose currency is the euro.\n2.   The guarantor in respect of a credit claim shall also be established in a Member State whose currency is the euro, unless a guarantee is not needed to establish the credit quality requirements for non-marketable assets because there is an adequate credit assessment of the debtor.\n3.   For debtors or guarantors that are multilateral development banks or international organisations, the rules in paragraphs 1 and 2 shall not apply and they shall be eligible irrespective of their place of establishment.\nArticle 97\nGoverning laws\nThe credit claim agreement and the agreement between the counterparty and the home NCB mobilising the credit claim as collateral shall both be governed by the law of a Member State whose currency is the euro. Furthermore, there shall be no more than two governing laws in total that apply to the:\n(a)\ncounterparty;\n(b)\ncreditor;\n(c)\ndebtor;\n(d)\nguarantor (if relevant);\n(e)\ncredit claim agreement;\n(f)\nthe agreement between the counterparty and the home NCB mobilising the credit claim as collateral.\nArticle 98\nHandling procedures\nCredit claims shall be handled in accordance with the Eurosystem procedures laid down in the relevant national documentation of the NCBs.\nArticle 99\nAdditional legal requirements for credit claims\n1.   In order to ensure that a valid security is created over credit claims and that the credit claim can be swiftly realised in the event of a counterparty default, additional legal requirements shall be met. These legal requirements relate to:\n(a)\nverification of the existence of credit claims;\n(b)\nnotification of the debtor about mobilisation of the credit claim or the registration of such mobilisation;\n(c)\nan absence of restrictions on the mobilisation of the credit claim;\n(d)\nan absence of restrictions on the realisation of the credit claim;\n(e)\nan absence of restrictions related to banking secrecy and confidentiality.\n2.   The content of these legal requirements is set out in Articles 100 to 105. Further details of the specific features of the national jurisdictions are provided in the relevant national documentation of the NCBs.\nArticle 100\nVerifications of the procedures used to submit credit claims\nNCBs, or supervisors or external auditors, shall conduct a one-off verification of the appropriateness of the procedures used by the counterparty to submit the information on credit claims to the Eurosystem.\nArticle 101\nVerification of existence of credit claims\n1.   The NCBs shall, as a minimum, take all of the following steps to verify the existence of credit claims mobilised as collateral:\n(a)\nThey shall obtain a written confirmation from counterparties, at least each quarter, by which counterparties shall confirm:\n(i)\nthe existence of the credit claims (this confirmation could be replaced with cross-checks of information held in central credit registers, where these exist);\n(ii)\nthe compliance of credit claims with the eligibility criteria applied by the Eurosystem;\n(iii)\nthat such credit claim is not used simultaneously as collateral to the benefit of any third party and that the counterparty shall not mobilise such credit claim as collateral to any third party;\n(iv)\nthat the counterparty will undertake to communicate to the relevant NCB no later than within the course of the next business day, any event that materially affects the contractual relationship between the counterparty and the NCB, in particular early, partial or total repayments, downgrades and material changes in the conditions of the credit claim.\n(b)\nThey, or relevant central credit registers, banking supervision competent authorities or external auditors, shall perform random checks in respect of the quality and accuracy of the written confirmation of counterparties, by means of delivery of physical documentation or through on-site visits. The information checked in relation to each credit claim shall cover as a minimum the characteristics that determine the existence and the eligibility of credit claims. For counterparties with ECAF-approved internal ratings-based (IRB) systems, additional checks on the credit quality assessment of credit claims shall be carried out involving checks of PDs with respect to debtors of credit claims that are used as collateral in Eurosystem credit operations.\n2.   For the checks that are undertaken in accordance with Article 100 or paragraphs 1(a) and (b) of this Article by NCBs, supervisors, external auditors or central credit registers, those undertaking the checks shall be authorised to carry out these investigations, if necessary contractually or in accordance with the applicable national requirements.\nArticle 102\nValidity of the agreement for the mobilisation of credit claims\nThe agreement for the mobilisation of the credit claim as collateral shall be valid between the counterparty and the relevant NCB under the applicable national law. All the necessary legal formalities to ensure the validity of the agreement and to ensure the mobilisation of a credit claims as collateral shall be fulfilled by the counterparty and/or the transferee, as appropriate.\nArticle 103\nFull effect of the mobilisation vis-à-vis third parties\n1.   The agreement for the mobilisation of the credit claim as collateral shall be valid vis-à-vis third parties under the applicable national law. All legal formalities necessary to ensure valid mobilisation shall be fulfilled by the counterparty and/or the transferee, as appropriate.\n2.   As regards notification of the debtor, the following shall apply, depending on the applicable national law.\n(a)\nIf debtor notification or public registration of the mobilisation of a credit claim as collateral is necessary to ensure full effectiveness of the mobilisation vis-à-vis third parties, and in particular to ensure the priority of the home NCB's security interest vis-à-vis other creditors, these notification or registration requirements shall be completed in advance or at the time of the credit claim's actual mobilisation as collateral.\n(b)\nIf ex ante notification of the debtor or public registration of the mobilisation of a credit claim as collateral is not required in accordance with point (a), as specified in the applicable national documentation, ex post notification of the debtor is required. Ex post notification means that the debtor shall be notified by the counterparty or the home NCB, as specified by the national documentation, about the credit claim being mobilised as collateral by the counterparty to the benefit of the NCB immediately following an event of default or similar credit event as further specified in the applicable national documentation.\n(c)\nThe NCBs may decide to require ex ante notification or public registration in advance or at the time of mobilisation, even if these formalities are not necessary for the purposes set out in point (a).\n(d)\nFor credit claims that are bearer instruments, the home NCB may require that such bearer instruments are physically transferred to it or to a third party in advance, or at the time of actual mobilisation as collateral. The notification requirements set out in points (a) and (b) shall not apply to credit claims that are bearer instruments.\n3.   The above are minimum requirements. NCBs may decide to require ex ante notification or registration in addition to the situations above, including in the case of bearer instruments.\nArticle 104\nAbsence of restrictions concerning mobilisation and realisation of credit claims\n1.   Credit claims shall be fully transferable and capable of being mobilised without restriction for the benefit of the Eurosystem. The credit claim agreement or other contractual arrangements between the counterparty and the debtor shall not contain any restrictive provisions on mobilisation as collateral, unless national legislation provides that such contractual restrictions are without prejudice to the Eurosystem with respect to the mobilisation of collateral.\n2.   The credit claim agreement or other contractual arrangements between the counterparty and the debtor shall not contain any restrictive provisions regarding the realisation of the credit claim used as collateral for Eurosystem credit operations, including any form, time or other requirement with regard to realisation.\n3.   Notwithstanding paragraphs 1 and 2, the provisions restricting the assignment of syndicated loan shares to banks, financial institutions and entities which are regularly engaged in or established for the purpose of creating, purchasing or investing in loans, securities or other financial assets shall not be considered as a restriction on the realisation of the credit claim.\n4.   Notwithstanding paragraphs 1 and 2, a facility agent for the collection and distribution of payments and administration of the loan shall not be considered as a restriction on the mobilisation and realisation of a syndicated loan share, provided that: (a) the facility agent is a credit institution located in the Union; and (b) the service relationship between the relevant syndicate member and the facility agent can be transferred alongside or as part of the syndicated loan share.\nArticle 105\nAbsence of restrictions concerning banking secrecy and confidentiality\nThe counterparty and the debtor shall have agreed contractually that the debtor unconditionally consents to disclosure by the counterparty to the Eurosystem of details in respect of the credit claim and on the debtor that are required by the home NCB for the purpose of ensuring that a valid security is created over credit claims and that the credit claims can be swiftly realised in the event of a counterparty default. This requirement shall not be necessary if unrestricted provision of such information is ensured under the applicable national law, as specified in the applicable national documentation of the home NCB.\nSection 2\nEligibility criteria for fixed-term deposits\nArticle 106\nEligibility criteria for fixed-term deposits\nFixed-term deposits, as described in Article 12, that are held by a counterparty shall be eligible assets as collateral for Eurosystem credit operations.\nSection 3\nEligibility criteria for RMBDs\nArticle 107\nEligibility criteria for RMBDs\n1.   An RMBD shall be a promissory note or a bill of exchange that is secured by a pool of residential mortgages but falls short of full securitisation. Substitution of assets in the underlying pool shall be possible and a mechanism shall be in place to ensure that the home NCB enjoys priority over creditors other than those exempted for public policy reasons.\n2.   RMBDs shall have a fixed, unconditional principal amount and an interest rate that cannot result in a negative cash flow.\n3.   RMBDs shall comply with the Eurosystem's credit quality requirements specified in the ECAF rules for RMBDs as laid down in Chapter 2 of Title III of this Part Four.\n4.   RMBDs shall be issued by credit institutions that are counterparties which are established in a Member State whose currency is the euro.\n5.   RMBDs shall be denominated in euro or in one of the former currencies of Member States whose currency is the euro.\n6.   An issuer of RMBDs shall self-certify, as a minimum on a monthly basis, that the residential mortgages that form the cover pool comply with the eligibility criteria specified in the national arrangements established by the home NCB and on which the credit assessment is based.\n7.   The mobilisation, use and handling procedures in respect of RMBDs shall be subject to the Eurosystem procedures as defined in the national documentation of the home NCB.\nCHAPTER 2\nEurosystem's credit quality requirements for non-marketable assets\nArticle 108\nEurosystem's credit quality requirements for non-marketable assets\nIn order for non-marketable assets to be eligible, the following Eurosystem credit quality requirements shall apply.\n(a)\nFor credit claims, the credit quality of credit claims shall be assessed on the basis of the credit quality of the debtor or guarantor, which shall comply, as a minimum, with credit quality step 3, as specified in the Eurosystem's harmonised rating scale.\n(b)\nFor RMBDs, a credit quality assessment shall comply, as a minimum, with credit quality step 2, as specified in the Eurosystem's harmonised rating scale.\nSection 1\nEurosystem's credit quality requirements for credit claims\nArticle 109\nGeneral rules for the credit quality assessment of credit claims\n1.   The Eurosystem shall assess the credit quality of credit claims on the basis of the credit quality of the debtors or guarantors provided by the credit assessment system or source selected by the counterparty in accordance with Article 110.\n2.   Counterparties shall within the course of the next business day inform the relevant NCB of any credit event, including a delay in payments by the debtors of the credit claims mobilised as collateral, that is known to the counterparty and, if requested by the relevant NCB, withdraw or replace the assets.\n3.   Counterparties shall be responsible for ensuring that they use the most recent credit quality assessment available from their selected credit assessment system or source for the debtors or guarantors of credit claims mobilised as collateral.\nArticle 110\nSelection of the credit assessment system or source\n1.   Counterparties mobilising credit claims as collateral shall select one credit assessment system from one of the four credit assessment sources accepted by the Eurosystem in accordance with the general acceptance criteria in Title V of Part Four. Where the ECAI source is selected by counterparties, any ECAI system may be used.\n2.   Further to paragraph 1, NCBs may allow counterparties to use more than one credit assessment system or source upon submission of a reasoned request to the home NCB supported by an adequate business case based on the lack of sufficient coverage of the ‘main’ credit assessment source or system.\n3.   In cases where counterparties are allowed to use more than one credit assessment system or credit assessment source, the ‘main’ system or source is expected to be the one providing the credit quality assessment of the largest number of debtors from the credit claims mobilised as collateral. If a credit assessment for a debtor or guarantor is available from this main system or source, only this credit assessment shall determine the eligibility and valuation haircuts applicable to the debtor or guarantor.\n4.   Counterparties shall use the selected credit assessment systems or sources for a minimum period of 12 months.\n5.   After the period specified in paragraph 4, counterparties may submit an explicit reasoned request to the home NCB to change the selected credit assessment system or source.\n6.   In certain circumstances and particularly when a counterparty phases-in its IRB system or begins using credit claims as collateral, upon submission of a reasoned request, an NCB may exceptionally grant a derogation to a counterparty with respect to the 12-month minimum period restriction specified in paragraph 4 and allow the counterparty to change its selected credit assessment system or source within that period.\n7.   If the counterparty has chosen the ECAI credit assessment source, it may use an ECAI debtor or ECAI guarantor rating. If multiple ECAI debtor and/or ECAI guarantor ratings are available for the same credit claim, then the best available ECAI credit assessment of those may be used.\nArticle 111\nCredit assessment of credit claims with public sector entities, or non-financial corporations, as debtors or guarantors\n1.   The Eurosystem shall assess the credit quality of credit claims with public sector entities acting as debtors or guarantors in accordance with the following rules, applied in the following order.\n(a)\nIf a credit assessment from the system or source selected by the counterparty exists, the Eurosystem shall use it to establish whether the public sector entity acting as debtor or guarantor meets the Eurosystem's credit quality requirements for non-marketable assets laid down in Article 108.\n(b)\nIn the absence of a credit assessment under point (a), the Eurosystem shall use an ECAI credit assessment provided by an accepted ECAI system for the public sector entity acting as debtor or guarantor.\n(c)\nIf a credit assessment is unavailable pursuant to points (a) or (b), the procedure laid down in Article 87 for marketable assets shall apply to the relevant public sector entity as debtor or guarantor.\n2.   The Eurosystem shall assess the credit quality of credit claims with non-financial corporations as debtors or guarantors as follows: the credit assessment provided by the credit assessment system or source selected by the counterparty shall meet the Eurosystem's credit quality requirements for non-marketable assets laid down in Article 108.\nSection 2\nEurosystem's credit quality requirements for RMBDs\nArticle 112\nEstablishment of Eurosystem's credit quality requirements for RMBDs\nFor the purpose of meeting the credit quality requirements laid down in Article 108, the home NCB shall assess the credit quality of RMBDs on the basis of a jurisdiction-specific credit quality assessment framework laid down in the applicable national documentation.\nTITLE IV\nGUARANTEES FOR MARKETABLE AND NON-MARKETABLE ASSETS\nArticle 113\nApplicable requirements for guarantees\n1.   The Eurosystem's credit quality requirements may be established on the basis of credit assessments provided in respect of guarantors in accordance with Articles 82 to 84 in respect of marketable assets and Article 108 in respect of credit claims.\n2.   Guarantees provided by guarantors that are required to establish the Eurosystem's credit quality requirements shall comply with this Title.\n3.   For the purposes of paragraph 1, the relevant guarantor shall be separately assessed on the basis of its credit assessment and shall meet the Eurosystem's credit quality requirements.\nArticle 114\nFeatures of the guarantee\n1.   In accordance with the terms of the guarantee, the guarantor shall provide an unconditional and irrevocable first-demand guarantee in respect of the obligations of the issuer or debtor in relation to the payment of the principal, interest and any other amounts due under the marketable asset or credit claim to the holders or creditor thereof, until the marketable asset or credit claim is discharged in full. In this regard, a guarantee shall not be required to be specific to the marketable asset or credit claim but may apply to the issuer or debtor only, provided that the relevant marketable asset or credit claim is covered by the guarantee.\n2.   The guarantee shall be payable on first demand independently of the guaranteed marketable asset or credit claim. Guarantees given by public sector entities with the right to levy taxes shall either be payable on first demand or otherwise provide for prompt and punctual payment following any default.\n3.   The guarantee shall be legally valid, binding and enforceable against the guarantor.\n4.   The guarantee shall be governed by the law of a Member State.\n5.   If the guarantor is not a public sector entity with the right to levy taxes, a legal confirmation concerning the legal validity, binding effect and enforceability of the guarantee shall be submitted to the relevant NCB in a form and substance acceptable to the Eurosystem before the marketable assets or credit claim supported by the guarantee can be considered eligible. The legal confirmation shall also state that the guarantee is not a personal one and is only enforceable by the holders of the marketable assets or the creditor of the credit claim. If the guarantor is established in a jurisdiction other than the one of the law governing the guarantee, the legal confirmation shall also confirm that the guarantee is valid and enforceable under the law of the jurisdiction in which the guarantor is established. For marketable assets, the legal confirmation shall be submitted by the counterparty for review to the NCB that is reporting the relevant asset supported by a guarantee for inclusion in the list of eligible assets. For credit claims, the legal confirmation shall be submitted by the counterparty seeking to mobilise the credit claim for review to the NCB in the jurisdiction of the law governing the credit claim. The requirement of enforceability is subject to any insolvency or bankruptcy laws, general principles of equity and other similar laws and principles applicable to the guarantor and generally affecting creditors' rights against the guarantor.\nArticle 115\nNon-subordination of the obligations of the guarantor\nThe obligations of the guarantor under the guarantee shall at least rank equally, pari passu, and rateably, pro rata, with all other unsecured obligations of the guarantor.\nArticle 116\nCredit quality requirements for guarantors\nThe guarantor shall comply with the Eurosystem's credit quality requirements specified under the ECAF rules for guarantors of marketable assets laid down in Articles 82 to 84 or with the rules for guarantors of credit claims laid down in Article 108.\nArticle 117\nType of guarantor\nThe guarantor shall be:\n(a)\nfor marketable assets in accordance with Article 69: a central bank of a Member State, a public sector entity, an agency, a credit institution, a financial corporation other than a credit institution, a non-financial corporation, a multilateral development bank or an international organisation; or\n(b)\nfor credit claims in accordance with Article 95: a non-financial corporation, a public sector entity, a multilateral development bank or an international organisation.\nArticle 118\nPlace of establishment of guarantor\n1.   The guarantor shall be established:\n(a)\nin the case of marketable assets in accordance with Article 70, in the EEA, unless a guarantee is not needed to establish the credit quality requirements for a specific debt instrument. The possibility to use an ECAI guarantor rating to establish the relevant credit quality requirements for marketable assets is addressed in Article 84.\n(b)\nfor debt instruments guaranteed by non-financial corporations for which no credit assessment has been provided by an accepted ECAI for the issue, the issuer or the guarantor, in accordance with Article 70, the guarantor shall be established in a Member State whose currency is the euro;\n(c)\nin the case of credit claims in accordance with Article 96, in a Member State whose currency is the euro, unless a guarantee is not needed to establish the credit quality requirements for non-marketable assets. The option to use a credit assessment in respect of a guarantor to establish the relevant credit quality requirements for credit claims is addressed in Article 108.\n2.   Notwithstanding paragraph 1, in accordance with Articles 70 and 96, multilateral development banks and international organisations shall be eligible guarantors irrespective of their place of establishment.\nTITLE V\nEUROSYSTEM CREDIT ASSESSMENT FRAMEWORK FOR ELIGIBLE ASSETS\nArticle 119\nAccepted credit assessment sources and systems\n1.   The credit assessment information on which the Eurosystem bases the eligibility assessment of assets eligible as collateral for Eurosystem credit operations shall be provided by credit assessment systems belonging to one of the four following sources:\n(a)\nECAIs;\n(b)\nNCBs' in-house credit assessment systems (ICASs);\n(c)\ncounterparties' internal rating-based (IRB) systems;\n(d)\nthird-party rating tool (RT) providers.\n2.   Under each credit assessment source listed in paragraph 1 there may be a set of credit assessment systems. Credit assessment systems shall comply with the acceptance criteria laid down in this Title. A list of the accepted credit assessment systems, i.e. the list of accepted ECAIs, ICASs and RTs, is published on the ECB's website.\n3.   All accepted credit assessment systems shall be subject to the ECAF performance monitoring process as laid down in Article 126.\n4.   By publishing information on the accepted credit assessment systems in conjunction with its Eurosystem credit operations, the Eurosystem shall not assume any responsibility for its evaluation of accepted credit assessment systems.\n5.   In the event of an infringement of the ECAF rules and procedures, the relevant credit assessment system may be excluded from the ECAF-accepted systems.\nArticle 120\nGeneral acceptance criteria for external credit assessment institutions as credit assessment systems\n1.   For the purposes of the ECAF, the general acceptance criteria for ECAIs shall be the following:\n(a)\nECAIs shall be registered or certified by the European Securities and Markets Authority, in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1060/2009.\n(b)\nECAIs shall fulfil operational criteria and provide relevant coverage so as to ensure the efficient implementation of the ECAF. In particular, the use of an ECAI credit assessment is subject to the availability to the Eurosystem of information on these assessments, as well as information for the comparison and the assignment, i.e. mapping, of the assessments to the Eurosystem's credit quality steps and for the purposes of the performance monitoring process, under Article 126.\n2.   The Eurosystem reserves the right to decide whether it accepts an ECAI for the purposes of ECAF, taking into account, among other factors, the criteria and rules of the ECAF performance monitoring process.\n3.   Together with the submitted data for ECAF performance monitoring in accordance with Article 126, the ECAI shall submit a signed certification from the CEO of the ECAI, or authorised signatory with responsibility for the audit or compliance function within the ECAI, confirming the accuracy and validity of the submitted performance monitoring information.\nArticle 121\nGeneral acceptance criteria and operational procedures for the NCBs' in-house credit assessment systems\n1.   NCBs may decide to use their own ICAS for the purpose of credit assessment. The decision of an NCB to use its own ICAS shall be subject to a validation procedure by the Eurosystem.\n2.   A credit assessment by means of ICAS may be performed in advance, or on a counterparty's specific request upon submission of an asset to the NCB using ICAS (the ‘ICAS NCB’).\n3.   With regard to paragraph 2, upon submission of an asset to the ICAS NCB in respect of which the eligibility of a debtor or guarantor shall be assessed, the ICAS NCB informs the counterparty either of its eligibility status or of the lead time necessary to establish a credit assessment. If an ICAS is limited in scope and only assesses specific types of debtors or guarantors, or if the ICAS NCB is unable to receive the information and data necessary for its credit assessment, the ICAS NCB will inform the counterparty thereof without delay. In both cases, the relevant debtor or guarantor is considered ineligible, unless the assets are compliant with credit quality requirements in accordance with an alternative credit assessment source or credit assessment system which the counterparty is allowed to use according to Article 110. In the event that mobilised assets become ineligible due to the deterioration of the creditworthiness of the debtor or the guarantor, the asset shall be removed at the earliest possible date. Since there is neither a contractual relationship between the non-financial corporations and the ICAS NCB, nor any legal obligation for these corporations to provide non-public information to the ICAS NCB, the information is provided on a voluntary basis.\n4.   In countries in which RMBDs are mobilised as collateral for Eurosystem credit operations, the home NCB shall implement a credit assessment framework for this type of asset in accordance with the ECAF. Such frameworks shall be subject to a validation procedure by the Eurosystem and to a yearly performance monitoring process, as further specified in Article 126.\nArticle 122\nGeneral acceptance criteria for internal ratings-based systems\n1.   To obtain ECAF approval of an IRB system, a counterparty shall file a request with the home NCB.\n2.   The requirement in paragraph 1 shall apply to all counterparties intending to use an IRB system regardless of their status, i.e. parent, subsidiary or branch, and regardless of whether the endorsement of the IRB system comes from the competent authority in the same country, for a parent company and possibly for subsidiaries, or from a competent authority in the home country of the parent, for branches and possibly for subsidiaries.\n3.   A request filed by a counterparty in accordance with paragraph 1 shall include the following information and documents which, if necessary, shall be translated into a working language of the home NCB:\n(a)\na copy of the decision of the competent authority authorising the counterparty to use its IRB system for capital requirements purposes on a consolidated or non-consolidated basis, together with any specific conditions for such use;\n(b)\na copy of the most up-to-date assessment of the counterparty's IRB system by the competent authority;\n(c)\ninformation on any changes to the counterparty's IRB system recommended or required by the competent authority, together with the deadline by which such changes must be implemented;\n(d)\ninformation on its approach to assigning probabilities of default to debtors, as well as data on the rating grades and associated one-year probabilities of default used to determine eligible rating grades;\n(e)\na copy of the latest Pillar 3 (market discipline) information that the counterparty is required to publish on a regular basis in accordance with the requirements on market discipline under the Basel III Framework, Directive 2013/36/EU and Regulation (EU) No 575/2013;\n(f)\nthe name and the address of the competent authority and the external auditor;\n(g)\ninformation on the historical record of the counterparty's IRB system's observed default rates per rating grades covering the five calendar years preceding the relevant request. If the competent authority granted the IRB system's authorisation for capital requirements purposes during these calendar years, the information shall cover the time since the IRB system's authorisation for capital requirements purposes. The historical annual data on the observed default rates and potential additional information shall comply with the provisions for performance monitoring in Article 126 as if the IRB system had been subject to these provisions over this time period;\n(h)\ninformation required for performance monitoring outlined in Article 126 as requested from already ECAF-approved IRB systems for the ongoing calendar year at the time of the filing of the request.\n4.   A counterparty shall not be required to file the information under points (a) to (c) when such information is transmitted directly by the competent authority to the home NCB upon the NCB's request.\n5.   The request made by the counterparty under paragraph 1 shall be signed by the counterparty's CEO, CFO or a manager of similar seniority, or by an authorised signatory on behalf of one of them.\nArticle 123\nReporting obligations of counterparties using an internal ratings-based system\n1.   Counterparties shall communicate information to the home NCB on Article 122(3)(b) to (f) on an annual basis, or as and when required by the home NCB, unless such information is transmitted directly by the competent authority to the home NCB upon the NCB's request.\n2.   The annual communication referred to in paragraph 1 shall be signed by the counterparty's CEO, CFO or a manager of similar seniority, or by an authorised signatory on behalf of one of them. The competent authority and, where applicable, the external auditor of the counterparty shall receive a copy of this letter from the Eurosystem.\n3.   As part of the regular monitoring on IRB systems, the NCB shall perform on- and off-site inspections on the statistical information provided by counterparties for the purpose of the annual performance monitoring process. The objective of such controls shall be to verify that static pools are correct, accurate and complete.\n4.   Counterparties shall fulfil any further operational criteria specified in the relevant contractual or regulatory arrangements applied by the home NCB, including provisions in relation to:\n(a)\nad hoc checks on the procedures in place for communicating a credit claim's features to the home NCB;\n(b)\nannual checks by the home NCB (or, where relevant, the competent authority or external auditor) to establish the accuracy and validity of static pools as referred to in Annex IX;\n(c)\nthe provision, no later than within the course of the next business day, of information in respect of eligibility changes and the immediate withdrawal of relevant credit claims, if necessary;\n(d)\nnotifications to the home NCB of facts or circumstances that could materially influence the continued use of the IRB system for ECAF purposes or the way in which the IRB system leads to the establishment of eligible collateral, including in particular material changes to a counterparty's IRB system which may impact on the manner in which the IRB system's rating grades or probabilities of default correspond with the Eurosystem harmonised rating scale.\nArticle 124\nGeneral acceptance criteria for third-party rating tool providers as credit assessment systems\n1.   The third-party rating tool (RT) provider source shall encompass entities that assess the credit quality of debtors by using primarily quantitative models in a systematic and mechanical manner, relying amongst other information on audited accounts, and whose credit assessments are not intended for general public disclosure.\n2.   An RT provider wishing to participate in the ECAF shall submit a request to the relevant NCB, using the template provided by the Eurosystem, supplemented by additional documentation as specified in the template provided on the ECB's website.\n3.   Counterparties wishing to use a specific RT provider for ECAF purposes that is not accepted by the Eurosystem shall submit a request to the relevant NCB, using the template provided on the ECB's website, supplemented by additional documentation as specified in this template.\n4.   In respect of submissions made under paragraphs 2 and 3, the Eurosystem shall decide whether to accept the RT provider based on an evaluation of compliance with the acceptance criteria set by the Eurosystem, as published on the ECB's website.\n5.   Counterparties using a RT provider shall promptly inform the relevant RT provider of any credit event that is known only to the counterparty that may indicate a deterioration of the credit quality, including a delay in payments by the debtors of the eligible assets mobilised as collateral.\nArticle 125\nReporting obligation for third-party rating tool providers\n1.   The RT provider shall communicate the required information for the purposes of the ECAF performance monitoring report to the relevant NCB together with a signed certification from the CEO, or authorised signatory with responsibility for the audit or compliance function within the RT, confirming the accuracy and validity of the submitted performance monitoring data.\n2.   The RT provider shall undertake to keep internal records of static pools and default details for five years.\nArticle 126\nECAF performance monitoring process\n1.   On an annual basis, all accepted credit assessment systems shall be subject to the ECAF performance monitoring process, in accordance with Annex IX, for the purpose of ensuring that the mapping of the credit assessment information provided by the credit assessment system to the Eurosystem's harmonised rating scale remains appropriate and that the results from credit assessments are comparable across systems and sources.\n2.   The Eurosystem reserves the right to request any additional information required to conduct the performance monitoring process.\n3.   The performance monitoring process may result in a correction of the manner in which the credit assessment information provided by the credit assessment system corresponds to the Eurosystem's harmonised rating scale.\n4.   The Eurosystem may decide to suspend or exclude a credit assessment system on the basis of the outcome of the performance monitoring process.\n5.   In the event of an infringement of a rule related to the ECAF performance monitoring process, the relevant credit assessment system may be excluded from the list of ECAF-accepted systems.\nTITLE VI\nRISK CONTROL AND VALUATION FRAMEWORK OF MARKETABLE AND NON-MARKETABLE ASSETS\nArticle 127\nPurpose of the risk control and valuation framework\n1.   Eligible assets mobilised as collateral for Eurosystem credit operations shall be subject to the risk control measures laid down in Article 128(1), which aim to protecting the Eurosystem against the risk of financial loss in the event of a counterparty's default.\n2.   The Eurosystem may at any time apply additional risk control measures, as laid down in Article 128(2), if required to ensure adequate risk protection of the Eurosystem in line with Article 18.1 of the Statute of the ESCB. Additional risk control measures may also be applied at the level of individual counterparties, if required to ensure such protection.\n3.   All risk control measures applied by the Eurosystem shall ensure consistent, transparent and non-discriminatory conditions for any type of mobilised eligible asset across the Member States whose currency is the euro.\nArticle 128\nRisk control measures\n1.   The Eurosystem shall apply the following risk control measures for eligible assets:\n(a)\nvaluation haircuts;\n(b)\nvariation margins (marking-to-market):\nthe Eurosystem requires the haircut-adjusted market value of the eligible assets used in its liquidity-providing reverse transactions to be maintained over time. If the value of the eligible assets, which are measured on a daily basis, falls below a certain level, the home NCB shall require the counterparty to supply additional assets or cash by way of a margin call. Similarly, if the value of the eligible assets exceeds a certain level following their revaluation, the NCB may return the excess assets or cash;\n(c)\nlimits in relation to the use of unsecured debt instruments issued by a credit institution or by any other entity with which that credit institution has close links as described in Article 138;\n(d)\nvaluation markdowns.\n2.   The Eurosystem may apply the following additional risk control measures:\n(a)\ninitial margins, meaning that counterparties provide eligible assets with a value at least equal to the liquidity provided by the Eurosystem plus the value of the relevant initial margin;\n(b)\nlimits in relation to issuers, debtors or guarantors:\nthe Eurosystem may apply additional limits, other than those applied to the use of unsecured debt instruments referred to in paragraph (1)(c), to the exposure vis-à-vis issuers, debtors or guarantors;\n(c)\nsupplementary haircuts;\n(d)\nadditional guarantees from guarantors meeting the Eurosystem's credit quality requirements in order to accept certain assets;\n(e)\nthe exclusion of certain assets from use as collateral in Eurosystem credit operations.\nCHAPTER 1\nRisk control measures for marketable assets\nArticle 129\nEstablishment of risk control measures for marketable assets\n1.   For the purpose of establishing the applicable risk control measures, eligible marketable assets shall be allocated to one of the following five haircut categories, based on the type of issuer and/or type of asset and as reflected in Table 10:\n(a)\ndebt instruments issued by central governments, ECB debt certificates and debt certificates issued by NCBs prior to the date of adoption of the euro in their respective Member State whose currency is the euro are included in haircut category I;\n(b)\ndebt instruments issued by local and regional government, entities classified as agencies by the Eurosystem, multilateral development banks and international organisations, as well as jumbo covered bonds, are included in haircut category II;\n(c)\ntraditional covered bonds, other covered bonds and debt instruments issued by non-financial corporations are included in haircut category III;\n(d)\nunsecured debt instruments issued by credit institutions and by financial corporations other than credit institutions are included in haircut category IV;\n(e)\nasset-backed securities are included in haircut category V, regardless of the classification of the issuer.\n2.   The haircut categories for marketable assets are summarised in the table below, taking into account the classification of the issuer.\nTable 10\nHaircut categories for marketable assets\nCategory I\nCategory II\nCategory III\nCategory IV\nCategory V\nDebt instruments issued by central governments\nECB debt certificates\nDebt certificates issued by NCBs prior to the date of adoption of the euro in their respective Member State\nDebt instruments issued by local and regional governments\nDebt instruments issued by entities classified as agencies by the Eurosystem\nDebt instruments issued by multilateral development banks and international organisations\nJumbo covered bonds\nTraditional covered bonds and other covered bonds\nDebt instruments issued by non-financial corporations\nUnsecured debt instruments issued by credit institutions\nUnsecured debt instruments issued by financial corporations other than credit institutions\nAsset-backed securities\nArticle 130\nValuation haircuts for marketable assets\n1.   Marketable assets shall be subject to specific valuation haircuts, applied by deducting a certain percentage from the market value of the relevant asset. The specific valuation haircuts applied to debt instruments included in haircut categories I to IV as laid down in Annex X differ in accordance with any or all of the following factors:\n(a)\nresidual maturity;\n(b)\ncoupon structure;\n(c)\ncredit quality step;\n(d)\nhaircut category, as determined pursuant to Article 129.\n2.   Marketable assets included in category V shall be subject to a haircut of 10 % regardless of maturity or coupon structure.\n3.   ABSs, covered bonds and unsecured debt instruments issued by credit institutions that are theoretically valued in accordance with the rules contained in Article 134 shall be subject to an additional valuation haircut in the form of a valuation markdown of 5 %.\n4.   Own-use covered bonds shall be subject to an additional valuation haircut applied directly to the value of the entire issuance of the individual debt instrument in the form of a valuation markdown of: (a) 8 % for own-use covered bonds in credit quality steps 1 and 2, and (b) 12 % for own-use covered bonds in credit quality step 3. For the purposes of this paragraph, ‘own-use covered bonds’ means covered bonds issued by either a counterparty or entities closely linked to it, and used in a percentage greater than 75 % of the outstanding notional amount by that counterparty and/or its closely linked entities. ‘Close links’ for the purposes of this paragraph shall be determined in accordance with Article 138. This valuation markdown applies to all counterparties mobilising the covered bond in question.\n5.   The valuation haircut applied to marketable assets included in haircut categories I to IV with floating coupons shall be that applied to the zero-to-one-year residual maturity of fixed coupon marketable assets in the haircut category and credit quality step to which the asset is assigned. For the purposes of this Article, coupon payments for which the resetting period is longer than one year are treated as fixed rate payments, and the relevant maturity for the valuation haircut to be applied shall be the residual maturity of the marketable asset.\n6.   The valuation haircuts applicable to marketable assets included in categories I to IV with more than one type of coupon payment shall solely depend on the coupon payments arising during the remaining life of the instrument. The valuation haircut applicable to such an instrument shall equal the highest haircut applicable to a marketable asset with the same residual maturity and credit quality step, and coupon payments of any one of the types occurring in the remaining life of the instrument may be considered.\n7.   The valuation haircut levels applied to fixed coupon debt instruments shall also apply to debt instruments where the relevant coupon is linked to inflation-indexed debt instruments.\n8.   No valuation haircuts shall be applied in liquidity-absorbing operations.\nCHAPTER 2\nRisk control measures for non-marketable assets\nArticle 131\nEstablishment of risk control measures for credit claims\n1.   Individual credit claims with a fixed rate of interest payment and credit claims with a rate of interest payments linked to the inflation rate shall be subject to specific valuation haircuts determined according to the residual maturity, the credit quality step and the valuation methodology applied by the NCB, as laid down in Annex X.\n2.   Individual credit claims with a variable interest rate shall be subject to the valuation haircut applied to the credit claims with fixed interest rate classified in the zero-to-one-year residual maturity corresponding to the same credit quality step and the same valuation methodology as applied by the NCB. For the purposes of this Article, an interest payment shall be treated as a variable rate payment if it is linked to a reference interest rate and if the resetting period corresponding to this payment is no longer than one year. Interest payments for which the resetting period is longer than one year shall be treated as fixed-rate payments, with the relevant maturity for the haircut being the residual maturity of the credit claim.\n3.   The valuation haircut applied to a credit claim with more than one type of interest payment shall depend only on the interest payments during the remaining life of the credit claim. If there is more than one type of interest payment during the remaining life of the credit claim, the remaining interest payments shall be treated as fixed-rate payments, with the relevant maturity for the haircut being the residual maturity of the credit claim.\nArticle 132\nRisk control measures for RMBDs\nNon-marketable RMBDs shall be subject to a valuation haircut of 39,5 %.\nArticle 133\nRisk control measures for fixed-term deposits\nFixed-term deposits shall not be subject to valuation haircuts, in line with the approach for marketable assets laid down in Article 130 for liquidity-absorbing operations.\nCHAPTER 3\nValuation rules for marketable and non-marketable assets\nArticle 134\nValuation rules for marketable assets\nFor the purposes of determining the value of assets used as collateral in open market operations conducted by means of reverse transactions, the NCBs shall apply the following rules.\n(a)\nFor each eligible marketable asset, the Eurosystem shall define the most representative price to be used for the calculation of the market value.\n(b)\nA marketable asset's value shall be calculated on the basis of the most representative price on the business day preceding its valuation date. In the absence of a representative price for a particular asset the Eurosystem shall define a theoretical price.\n(c)\nThe market or theoretical value of a marketable asset shall be calculated including accrued interest.\n(d)\nDepending on differences in national legal systems and operational practices, the treatment of income flows, e.g. coupon payments that are related to an asset and are received during the life of a Eurosystem credit operation, may differ between NCBs. If the income flow is transferred to the counterparty, the home NCB shall ensure that the relevant operations will still be fully covered by a sufficient amount of eligible assets before the transfer of the income takes place. Each NCB shall aim to ensure that the economic effect of the treatment of income flows is equivalent to a situation in which the income is transferred to the counterparty on the payment day.\nArticle 135\nValuation rules for non-marketable assets\nNon-marketable assets shall be assigned a value by the Eurosystem corresponding either to the theoretical price or to the outstanding amount.\nArticle 136\nMargin calls\n1.   Assets mobilised as collateral for Eurosystem credit operations shall be subject to daily valuation by NCBs, in accordance with the valuation rules laid down in Articles 134 and 135. If tri-party services are used, the daily valuation process shall be delegated to the relevant TPA and shall be based on information sent by the relevant NCB to the TPA.\n2.   If, after valuation and haircuts, the mobilised assets do not match the requirements as calculated on that day, margin calls shall be performed. If the value of the eligible assets mobilised as collateral by a counterparty, following their revaluation, exceeds the amount owed by the counterparty plus the variation margin, the NCB may return the excess assets or any cash that the counterparty has provided for a margin call.\n3.   In order to reduce the frequency of margin calls, an NCB may apply a threshold of 0,5 % of the amount of liquidity provided. Depending on the applicable national law, if the value of the mobilised assets as collateral falls below the lower threshold, NCBs may require margin calls to be effected either through the supply of additional assets or by means of cash payments by the counterparty. Conversely, if the value of the assets used as collateral exceeds the upper threshold, the NCB may return the excess assets (or cash submitted to meet a margin call) to the counterparty.\n4.   The deposit facility rate shall also apply to cash margins.\nTITLE VII\nACCEPTANCE OF NON EURO-DENOMINATED COLLATERAL IN CONTINGENCIES\nArticle 137\nAcceptance of non-euro-denominated collateral in contingencies\n1.   The ECB's Governing Council may decide to accept certain marketable assets issued by non-euro area G10 central governments in their national currency as collateral. Upon such a decision by the ECB's Governing Council, counterparties shall be informed about the applicable:\n(a)\neligibility criteria;\n(b)\nprocedures for selection and mobilisation;\n(c)\nsources and principles of valuation;\n(d)\nrisk control measures;\n(e)\nsettlement procedures.\n2.   The general eligibility criteria for marketable assets laid down in Title II of Part Four shall apply, except that marketable assets:\n(a)\nmay be issued, held and settled outside the EEA; and\n(b)\nmay be denominated in currencies other than the euro.\n3.   Counterparties that are branches of credit institutions incorporated outside the EEA or Switzerland shall not be entitled to mobilise as collateral the marketable assets laid down in this Article.\nTITLE VIII\nRULES FOR THE USE OF ELIGIBLE ASSETS\nArticle 138\nClose links between counterparties and the issuer, debtor or guarantor of eligible assets\n1.   Irrespective of the fact that an asset is eligible, a counterparty shall not submit or use as collateral assets issued, owed or guaranteed by itself or by any other entity with which it has close links.\n2.   ‘Close links’ means any of the following situations in which the counterparty and the other entity referred to in paragraph 1 are linked:\n(a)\nthe counterparty owns directly, or indirectly through one or more other undertakings, 20 % or more of the capital of that other entity;\n(b)\nthat other entity owns directly, or indirectly through one or more other undertakings, 20 % or more of the capital of the counterparty;\n(c)\na third party owns, either directly or indirectly through one or more undertakings, 20 % or more of the capital of the counterparty and 20 % or more of the capital of the other entity.\nFor the purposes of assessing the existence of close links in the case of multi-cédulas, the Eurosystem shall apply a ‘look-through approach’, i.e. it shall consider close links between each of the underlying cédulas issuers and the counterparty.\n3.   Paragraph 1 shall not apply with respect to any of the following:\n(a)\nclose links between the counterparty and an EEA public sector entity that has the right to levy taxes, or cases where a debt instrument is guaranteed by one or more EEA public sector entities that have the right to levy taxes and the relevant guarantee complies with the features laid down in Article 114;\n(b)\ncovered bonds meeting the requirements set out in Article 129(1) to (3) and (6) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013;\n(c)\ndebt instruments protected by specific legal safeguards comparable to covered bonds meeting the requirements set out in Article 129(1) to (3) and 129(6) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013. Such specific legal safeguards shall require a ring-fenced cover pool that ensures the satisfaction of bondholder claims in the event of insolvency of the issuer from the ring-fenced cover pool. An assessment of the existence and comparability of legal safeguards, for which the requirements set out under point (b) shall serve as a benchmark, shall be conducted by the Eurosystem on a case-by-case basis and shall require an external legal opinion.\nExamples of debt instruments protected by specific legal safeguards comparable to covered bonds referred to in point (b) are:\n(i)\nnon-marketable RMBDs; and\n(ii)\nmulti-cédulas issued before the application date of this Guideline where the underlying cédulas comply with the criteria set out in Article 129(1) to (3) and (6) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013.\nArticle 139\nUse of guaranteed unsecured debt instruments issued by a counterparty or its closely linked entity\n1.   Unsecured debt instruments issued by a counterparty or any other entity closely linked to that counterparty, as defined in Article 138, and fully guaranteed by one or several EEA public sector entities which have the right to levy taxes shall not be mobilised as collateral for Eurosystem credit operations by that counterparty either:\n(a)\ndirectly; or\n(b)\nindirectly, where they are included in a pool of covered bonds,\n2.   In exceptional cases, the ECB's Governing Council may decide on temporary derogations from the restriction laid down in paragraph 1 for a maximum of three years. A request for a derogation shall be accompanied by a funding plan by the requesting counterparty that indicates the manner in which the mobilisation of the respective assets will be phased out within three years following the granting of the derogation. Such a derogation shall only be provided where the nature of the guarantee provided by one or several EEA central governments, regional governments, local authorities or other public sector entities which have the right to levy taxes complies with the requirements for guarantees laid down in Article 114.\nArticle 140\nClose links with respect to asset-backed securities and currency hedges\nA counterparty may not mobilise as collateral any asset-backed securities if the counterparty, or any entity with which it has close links, as laid down in Article 138, provides a currency hedge to the asset-backed securities by entering into a currency hedge transaction with the issuer as a hedge counterparty.\nArticle 141\nLimits with respect to unsecured debt instruments issued by credit institutions and their closely linked entities\n1.   A counterparty shall not submit or use as collateral unsecured debt instruments issued by a credit institution or by any other entity with which that credit institution has close links to an extent that exceeds 5 % of the total value of the assets used as collateral by that counterparty after the applicable haircut. This 5 % threshold shall not apply in either of the following cases:\n(a)\nif the value of such assets does not exceed EUR 50 million after any applicable haircut; or\n(b)\nif such assets are guaranteed by a public sector entity which has the right to levy taxes by way of a guarantee that complies with the features laid down in Article 114.\n2.   For the purposes of paragraph 1, the establishment of a close link between two or more issuers of unsecured debt instruments shall only be considered from one year after the date of the establishment of the close link.\n3.   For the purposes of this Article, ‘close links’ has the same meaning as laid down in Article 138.\nArticle 142\nLiquidity support in respect of asset-backed securities\n1.   With effect from 1 November 2015, a counterparty may not mobilise as collateral any asset-backed securities if the counterparty or any entity with which it has close links provides liquidity support as specified below. The Eurosystem takes into account two forms of liquidity support for asset-backed securities: cash reserves and liquidity facilities.\n2.   For liquidity support in the form of cash reserves, a counterparty shall not be permitted to mobilise as collateral any asset-backed securities if the following three conditions are met simultaneously:\n(a)\nthe counterparty has close links with the issuer account bank in the asset-backed securities transaction;\n(b)\nthe current amount of the reserve fund of the asset-backed securities transaction is greater than 5 % of the initial outstanding amount of all senior and subordinated tranches of the asset-backed securities transaction;\n(c)\nthe current amount of the reserve fund of the asset-backed securities transaction is greater than 25 % of the current outstanding amount of the subordinated tranches of the asset-backed securities transaction.\n3.   For liquidity support in the form of liquidity facilities, a counterparty shall not be permitted to mobilise as collateral any asset-backed securities if the following two conditions are met simultaneously:\n(a)\nthe counterparty has close links with a liquidity facility provider; and\n(b)\nthe current amount of the liquidity facility of the asset-backed securities transaction is greater than 20 % of the initial outstanding amount of all senior and subordinated tranches of the asset-backed securities transaction.\n4.   Close links in respect of this Article shall have the same meaning as laid down in Article 138(2).\nArticle 143\nTransitional provisions regarding liquidity support in respect of asset-backed securities\n1.   Until Article 142 takes effect, the transitional provisions in this Article shall apply, as laid down in Article 191.\n2.   A counterparty may not mobilise asset-backed securities as collateral if the counterparty, or any entity with which it has close links as defined in Article 138 provides liquidity support for 20 % or more of the outstanding amount of the asset-backed security.\n3.   For the purposes of this Article, ‘liquidity support’ shall refer to any structural feature that can be used to cover any temporary cash flow shortfalls that may occur during the lifetime of the transaction.\nArticle 144\nNon-acceptance of eligible assets for operational reasons\nIrrespective of the fact that an asset is eligible, an NCB may, for operational reasons, request the counterparty to remove such asset before the occurrence of a cash flow, including payment of principal or coupons, as further defined in the relevant national documentation.\nArticle 145\nNotification, valuation and removal of assets that are ineligible or contravene the rules for the use of eligible assets\n1.   If a counterparty has submitted or used assets that it is not or is no longer permitted to use as collateral, including due to the identity of the issuer, debtor or guarantor, or the existence of close links, it shall immediately notify the home NCB thereof.\n2.   The assets referred to in paragraph 1 shall be valued at zero on the next valuation date at the latest and a margin call may be triggered.\n3.   A counterparty that has submitted or used any assets referred to in paragraph 1 shall remove such assets on the earliest possible date.\n4.   A counterparty shall provide the Eurosystem with accurate and up-to-date information affecting the value of collateral.\nArticle 146\nSanctions for non-compliance with the rules for the use of eligible assets\nNon-compliance with the rules laid down in this Title shall be subject to sanctions, as applicable, in accordance with Articles 154 to 157. Sanctions shall be applicable, regardless of whether a counterparty is actively participating in monetary policy operations.\nArticle 147\nInformation sharing within the Eurosystem\nFor monetary policy implementation purposes, in particular to monitor compliance with the rules for the use of eligible assets, the Eurosystem shall share information on capital holdings provided by the competent authority for such purposes. The information shall be subject to the same secrecy standards as those applied by the competent authority.\nTITLE IX\nCROSS-BORDER USE OF ELIGIBLE ASSETS\nArticle 148\nGeneral principles\n1.   Counterparties may use eligible assets on a cross-border basis throughout the euro area for the handling of all types of Eurosystem credit operations.\n2.   Counterparties may mobilise eligible assets other than fixed-term deposits, for cross-border use in accordance with the following.\n(a)\nMarketable assets shall be mobilised via: (i) eligible links (as described in Article 150) between EEA SSSs which have been positively assessed pursuant to the Eurosystem User Assessment Framework; (ii) the applicable procedures of the CCBM; (iii) eligible links in combination with the CCBM; and\n(b)\nCredit claims and RMBDs shall be mobilised in accordance with the applicable procedures of the CCBM as they cannot be transferred through SSSs.\n3.   Marketable assets may be used through an NCB account in a SSS located in a country other than that of the NCB in question if the Eurosystem has approved the use of such an account.\n4.   De Nederlandsche Bank shall be authorised to use its account with Euroclear Bank to settle collateral transactions in the Eurobonds issued in that ICSD. The Central Bank of Ireland shall be authorised to open a similar account with Euroclear Bank. This account can be used for all eligible assets held in Euroclear Bank, i.e. including eligible assets transferred to Euroclear Bank through eligible links.\n5.   Counterparties shall execute the transfer of eligible assets via their securities settlement accounts with an SSS that has been positively assessed pursuant to the Eurosystem User Assessment Framework.\n6.   Counterparties without a safe custody account with an NCB or without a securities settlement account with an SSS that has been positively assessed pursuant to the Eurosystem User Assessment Framework may settle the transactions through the securities settlement account or the safe custody account of a correspondent credit institution.\nArticle 149\nCCBM\n1.   Under the CCBM, the cross-border relationship is between the NCBs. The NCBs acts as custodians (hereinafter the ‘correspondents’) for each other and for the ECB in respect of marketable assets accepted in their local depository, TPA or settlement system. Specific procedures apply under the CCBM for credit claims and RMBDs. Details on the CCBM and the applicable procedures are set out in Annex VI and in the brochure entitled ‘Correspondent central banking model (CCBM) procedure for Eurosystem counterparties’, which is published on the ECB's website.\n2.   Assets deposited with a correspondent central bank shall only be used to collateralise Eurosystem credit operations.\nArticle 150\nEligible links between SSSs\n1.   In addition to the CCBM, counterparties may use links that have been positively assessed pursuant to the Eurosystem User Assessment Framework (hereinafter the ‘eligible links’) for the cross-border transfer of marketable assets.\n2.   Eligible links may only be established between SSSs that have been positively assessed pursuant to the Eurosystem User Assessment Framework and shall consist of a set of procedures and arrangements for the transfer of securities through a book-entry process.\n3.   There shall be two types of eligible links which are established by contractual and technical agreements between the SSSs involved:\n(a)\ndirect links established between two SSSs without involving an intermediary; and\n(b)\nrelayed links that allow two SSSs that are not directly connected to each other to exchange securities transactions or transfers through a third SSS acting as the intermediary.\n4.   Only links that have been assessed and approved by the Eurosystem pursuant to the Eurosystem User Assessment Framework shall be considered eligible. The ECB shall publish an up-to-date list of eligible links on its website.\n5.   Assets held through an eligible link may be used for Eurosystem credit operations, as well as for any other purpose selected by the counterparty.\n6.   A table detailing the use of eligible links between SSSs is laid down in Annex VI.\nArticle 151\nCCBM in combination with eligible links\n1.   Counterparties may use direct and relayed links referred to Article 150 in combination with the CCBM to mobilise eligible marketable assets on a cross-border basis.\n2.   When using eligible links between SSSs in combination with the CCBM, counterparties shall hold the assets issued in the issuer SSS in an account with an investor SSS directly or via a custodian. In the case of eligible relayed links, a third SSS may act as an intermediary SSS.\n3.   Assets mobilised under paragraph 2 may be issued in a non-euro area EEA SSS that has been positively assessed under the Eurosystem User Assessment Framework, provided that a link between the issuer SSS and the investor SSS has been positively assessed pursuant to the Eurosystem User Assessment Framework.\n4.   A table detailing the use of CCBM in combination with eligible links is laid down in Annex VI.\nArticle 152\nCCBM and tri-party collateral management services\n1.   Cross-border tri-party collateral management services shall allow a counterparty to increase or decrease the amount of collateral which it mobilises with its home NCB, through recourse to collateral held with a TPA.\n2.   The CCBM (including the CCBM in combination with eligible links) may be used as a basis for the cross-border use of tri-party collateral management services. Cross-border use of tri-party collateral management services shall involve a NCB, where tri-party collateral management services are offered for cross-border Eurosystem use, acting as a correspondent for NCBs whose counterparties have requested to use such tri-party collateral management services on a cross-border basis for the purposes of Eurosystem credit operations. In order to facilitate cross-border use in accordance with this paragraph, the relevant TPA shall need to be positively assessed by the Eurosystem.\n3.   A table detailing the use of CCBM with tri-party collateral management services is laid down in Annex VI.\nPART FIVE\nSANCTIONS IN THE EVENT OF A FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH COUNTERPARTY OBLIGATIONS\nArticle 153\nSanctions for non-compliance as regards minimum reserves\n1.   The ECB shall impose sanctions pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 2532/98, Regulation (EC) No 2157/1999 (ECB/1999/4), Regulation (EC) No 2531/98 or Regulation (EC) No 1745/2003 (ECB/2003/9) on institutions which do not comply with obligations arising from ECB regulations and decisions relating to the application of minimum reserves. The relevant sanctions and procedural rules for their application are specified in those regulations.\n2.   Without prejudice to paragraph 1, in the event of a serious infringement of the minimum reserve requirements, the Eurosystem may suspend a counterparty's participation in open market operations.\nArticle 154\nSanctions for non-compliance with certain operational rules\n1.   In accordance with the provisions of the contractual or regulatory arrangements applied by it, the NCB shall impose one or more sanctions if a counterparty fails to comply with any of the following obligations:\n(a)\nas regards reverse transactions and foreign exchange swaps for monetary policy purposes, the obligations to adequately collateralise and settle the amount the counterparty has been allotted over the whole term of a particular operation; or the outstanding amount of a particular operation in the case of early termination executed by the NCB over the remaining term of an operation, as laid down in Article 15;\n(b)\nas regards collection of fixed-term deposits, outright transactions and the issuance of ECB debt certificates, the obligation to settle the transaction, as laid down in Article 16;\n(c)\nas regards the use of eligible assets, the obligation to mobilise or use only eligible assets and comply with the rules for the use of eligible assets in Title VIII of Part Four;\n(d)\nas regards end-of-day procedures and access conditions for the marginal lending facility, the obligation to present sufficient eligible assets in advance as collateral in cases where there is any remaining negative balance on a counterparty's settlement account in TARGET2 after finalisation of the end-of-day control procedures and an automatic request for recourse to the marginal lending facility is therefore considered to arise, as laid down in Article 19(6).\n2.   A sanction imposed pursuant to this Article shall involve:\n(a)\na financial penalty only; or\n(b)\nboth a financial penalty and a non-financial penalty.\nArticle 155\nFinancial penalties for non-compliance with certain operational rules\nIf a counterparty fails to comply with any of the obligations referred to in Article 154(1), the Eurosystem shall impose a financial penalty for each case of non-compliance. The applicable financial penalty shall be calculated in accordance with Annex VII.\nArticle 156\nNon-financial penalties for non-compliance with certain operational rules\n1.   If a counterparty fails to comply with an obligation referred to in either Article 154(1)(a) or (b) on more than two occasions in a 12-month period and in respect of each failure:\n(a)\na financial penalty was applicable;\n(b)\neach decision to impose a financial penalty was notified to the counterparty;\n(c)\neach occasion of non-compliance relates to the same type of non-compliance,\nthe Eurosystem shall suspend the counterparty on the occasion of the third failure and each such subsequent failure to comply with an obligation of that same type in the relevant 12-month period. The 12-month period shall be calculated from the date of the first failure to comply with an obligation referred to in either Article 154(1)(a) or (b), as applicable.\n2.   Any suspension imposed by the Eurosystem under paragraph 1 shall apply in respect of any subsequent open market operation which is of the same type as the open market operation which resulted in a sanction under paragraph 1.\n3.   The period of suspension imposed in accordance with paragraph 1 shall be determined in accordance with Annex VII.\n4.   If a counterparty fails to comply with an obligation referred to in Article 154(1)(c) on more than two occasions in a 12-month period and in respect of each failure\n(a)\na financial penalty was applicable;\n(b)\neach decision to impose a financial penalty was notified to the counterparty;\n(c)\neach occasion of non-compliance relates to the same type of non-compliance,\nthe Eurosystem shall suspend the counterparty from the subsequent open market operation on the occasion of the third failure and each such subsequent failure in the relevant 12-month period. The 12-month period shall be calculated from the date of the first failure to comply with an obligation referred to in Article 154(1)(c).\n5.   In exceptional cases, the Eurosystem may suspend a counterparty for a period of three months in respect of all future Eurosystem monetary policy operations for any failure to comply with any of the obligations laid down in Article 154(1). In such a case, the Eurosystem shall have regard to the seriousness of the case and, in particular, to the amounts involved and to the frequency and duration of non-compliance.\n6.   The period of suspension imposed by the Eurosystem pursuant to this Article shall be applied in addition to the relevant financial penalty applicable in accordance with Article 155.\nArticle 157\nApplication of non-financial penalties to branches for non-compliance with certain operational rules\nWhen the Eurosystem suspends a counterparty in accordance with Article 156(5), that suspension may also be applied to branches of that counterparty established in other Member States whose currency is the euro.\nPART SIX\nDISCRETIONARY MEASURES\nArticle 158\nDiscretionary measures on the grounds of prudence or following an event of default\n1.   On the grounds of prudence, the Eurosystem may take any of the following measures:\n(a)\nsuspend, limit or exclude a counterparty's access to Eurosystem open market operations or standing facilities, pursuant to any contractual or regulatory arrangements applied by the home NCB or by the ECB;\n(b)\nexempt a counterparty from minimum reserves requirements, pursuant to any contractual or regulatory arrangements applied by the home NCB or by the ECB;\n(c)\nreject, limit the use of or apply supplementary haircuts to assets mobilised as collateral in Eurosystem credit operations by a specific counterparty on the basis of any information the Eurosystem considers relevant, in particular if the credit quality of the counterparty appears to exhibit a high correlation with the credit quality of the assets mobilised as collateral.\n2.   In the event that a discretionary measure as described in paragraph 1 is based on prudential information, the Eurosystem shall use any such information, transmitted either by counterparties or by supervisors, in a manner strictly commensurate with, and necessary for, the performance of the Eurosystem's tasks of conducting monetary policy.\n3.   In the case of an occurrence of an event of default, the Eurosystem may suspend, limit or exclude access to Eurosystem open market operations or standing facilities with regard to counterparties that are in default pursuant to any contractual or regulatory arrangements applied by the Eurosystem.\n4.   All discretionary measures under paragraphs 1 and 3 shall be applied in a proportionate and non-discriminatory manner and shall be duly justified by the Eurosystem.\nArticle 159\nDiscretionary measures relating to the Eurosystem's credit quality assessment\n1.

The Eurosystem may reject, limit the mobilisation or use of assets or apply supplementary haircuts on the grounds provided for in paragraph 1, if such decision is required in order to ensure adequate risk protection of the Eurosystem.\n3.   In the event that a rejection as referred to in paragraph 2 is based on prudential information, the Eurosystem shall use any such information, transmitted either by counterparties or by supervisors, in a manner that is strictly commensurate with, and necessary for, the performance of the Eurosystem's tasks of conducting monetary policy.\n4.   The Eurosystem may exclude the following assets from the list of eligible marketable assets:\n(a)\nassets issued or guaranteed by entities subject to freezing of funds and/or other measures imposed by the Union under Article 75 of the Treaty or by a Member State restricting the use of funds; and/or\n(b)\nassets issued or guaranteed by entities in respect of which the ECB's Governing Council has issued a decision suspending or excluding their access to Eurosystem open market operations or standing facilities.\nPART SEVEN\nADDITIONAL MINIMUM COMMON FEATURES IN RELATION TO EUROSYSTEM MONETARY POLICY OPERATIONS\nArticle 160\nLegal relationship between the Eurosystem central banks and counterparties\nThe Eurosystem shall ensure that their contractual or regulatory arrangements in respect of their counterparties as referred to in Article 1(3) are in conformity with the provisions of Part Seven.\nCHAPTER 1\nAdditional minimum common features applicable to all arrangements for Eurosystem monetary policy operations\nArticle 161\nAmendments to the implementation of the Eurosystem monetary policy framework\n1.

In the event of conflict between this Annex and the legal framework for the Eurosystem's minimum reserve system as described in paragraph 1, the latter prevails.\n1.\nPursuant to Article 19 of the Statute of the European System of Central Banks and of the European Central Bank (hereinafter the ‘Statue of the ESCB’), the European Central Bank (ECB) requires credit institutions to hold minimum reserves on accounts with national central banks (NCBs) within the framework of the Eurosystem's minimum reserve system. The legal framework for this system is laid down in Article 19 of the Statute of the ESCB, Regulation (EC) No 2531/98 and Regulation (EC) No 1745/2003 (ECB/2003/9). The application of Regulation (EC) No 1745/2003 (ECB/2003/9) ensures that the terms and conditions of the Eurosystem's minimum reserve system are uniform throughout Member States whose currency is the euro.\n2.\nThe Eurosystem's minimum reserves system primarily pursues the aims of stabilising money market interest rates and creating (or enlarging) a structural liquidity shortage.\n3.\nIn accordance with Article 2(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1745/2003 (ECB/2003/9), the Eurosystem's minimum reserve system applies to credit institutions established in Member States whose currency is the euro. In addition, branches in the euro area of credit institutions not incorporated in the euro area are also subject to the Eurosystem's minimum reserve system. However, branches established outside the euro area of credit institutions incorporated in the euro area are not subject to this system.\n4.\nPursuant to Article 2(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1745/2003 (ECB/2003/9), institutions will be automatically exempt from reserve requirements from the start of the maintenance period within which their authorisation is withdrawn or surrendered, or within which a decision to submit the institution to winding-up proceedings is taken by a judicial authority or any other competent authority of a Member State.\n5.\nPursuant to Article 2(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1745/2003 (ECB/2003/9), the ECB may exempt, on a non-discriminatory basis, the institutions listed in points (a) to (c) thereof from reserve requirements. Such institutions include, inter alia, institutions subject to reorganisation measures and institutions subject to the freezing of funds and/or other measures imposed by the Union under Article 75 of the Treaty or by a Member State restricting the use of their funds or a decision of the ECB's Governing Council suspending or excluding their access to open market operations or the Eurosystem's standing facilities.\n6.\nPursuant to Article 2(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1745/2003 (ECB/2003/9), the ECB establishes and maintains a list of institutions subject to the Eurosystem's minimum reserve system.\n7.\nThe ECB also publishes a list of any institutions exempt from their obligations under this system for reasons other than their being subject to reorganisation measures or the freezing of funds and/or other measures imposed by the Union under Article 75 of the Treaty or by a Member State restricting the use of their funds or in respect of which the ECB's Governing Council issued a decision suspending or excluding their access to open market operations or the Eurosystem's standing facilities.\n8.\nThe reserve base of each institution is determined in relation to elements of its balance sheet. The balance sheet data are reported to the NCBs within the general framework of the ECB's monetary and financial statistics. Institutions calculate the reserve base in respect of a particular maintenance period on the basis of the data relating to the month that is two months prior to the month within which the maintenance period starts pursuant to Article 3(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1745/2003 (ECB/2003/9), subject to the exceptions for tail institutions, as laid down in Article 3(4) of the same Regulation.\n9.\nThe reserve ratios are determined by the ECB subject to the maximum limit specified in Regulation (EC) No 2531/98.\n10.\nThe amount of minimum reserves to be held by each institution in respect of a particular maintenance period are calculated by applying the reserve ratios to each relevant item of the reserve base for that period. The minimum reserves identified by the relevant participating NCB and by the institution in accordance with the procedures mentioned in Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1745/2003 (ECB/2003/9) constitute the basis for: (a) remuneration of holdings of required reserves; and (b) assessment of an institution's compliance with the obligation to hold the required amount of minimum reserves.\n11.\nIn order to pursue the aim of stabilising interest rates, the Eurosystem's minimum reserve system enables institutions to make use of averaging provisions, implying that compliance with reserve requirements is determined on the basis of the average of the end-of-calendar-day balances on the counterparties' reserve accounts over a maintenance period. Compliance with the reserve requirement is determined on the basis of an institution's average daily reserve holdings over the maintenance period. The maintenance period is defined in Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 1745/2003 (ECB/2003/9).\n12.\nIn accordance with Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 1745/2003 (ECB/2003/9), institutions' holdings of required reserves are remunerated at the average, over the maintenance period, of the ECB's rate (weighted according to the number of calendar days) on the main refinancing operations according to the following formula (whereby the result is rounded to the nearest cent):\nWhere:\nRt\n=\nremuneration to be paid on holdings of required reserves for the maintenance period t;\nHt\n=\naverage daily holdings of required reserves for the maintenance period t;\nnt\n=\nnumber of calendar days in the maintenance period t;\nrt\n=\nrate of remuneration on holdings of required reserves for the maintenance period t. Standard rounding of the rate of remuneration to two decimals shall be applied;\ni\n=\nith calendar day of the maintenance period t;\nMR\ni\n=\nmarginal interest rate for the most recent main refinancing operation settled on or before calendar day i.\nWhere an institution fails to comply with other obligations under ECB regulations and decisions relating to the Eurosystem's minimum reserve system (e.g. if relevant data are not transmitted in time or are not accurate), the ECB is empowered to impose sanctions in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 2532/98 and Regulation (EC) No 2157/1999 (ECB/1999/4). The ECB's Executive Board may specify and publish the criteria according to which it will apply the sanctions provided for in Article 7(1) of Regulation (EC) No 2531/98.\nANNEX II\nANNOUNCEMENT OF

intervention operations is based on two sets of criteria relating to the principles of prudence and efficiency.\n2.\nThe criteria relating to efficiency are only applied once the criteria relating to the principle of prudence have been applied.\n3.\nThe criteria relating to the principle of prudence comprise the following:\n(a)\ncreditworthiness of the counterparty, which is assessed using a combination of different methods, e.g. using credit ratings available from commercial agencies and the in-house analysis of capital and other business ratios;\n(b)\na counterparty is supervised by a recognised supervisor;\n(c)\na counterparty has a good reputation and observes high ethical standards.\n4.\nThe criteria relating to the principle of efficiency comprise, inter alia, the following:\n(a)\na counterparty's competitive pricing behaviour and its ability to conduct large-volume foreign exchange operations efficiently under all market conditions; and\n(b)\nthe quality and coverage of information provided by the counterparty.\n5.\nIn order to be able to intervene efficiently in different geographical locations, the national central banks may select counterparties for their foreign exchange intervention operations in any international financial centre.\nANNEX VI\nCROSS-BORDER USE OF ELIGIBLE ASSETS\nI.   THE CORRESPONDENT CENTRAL BANKING MODEL (CCBM)\nTable 1\nThe correspondent central banking model (CCBM)\nUse of eligible assets deposited in country B by a counterparty established in country A in order to obtain credit from the national central bank (NCB) of country A\n1.\nAll NCBs maintain securities accounts with each other for the cross-border use of eligible assets. The precise procedure of the CCBM depends on whether the eligible assets are earmarked for each individual transaction or whether they are held in a pool of underlying assets.\n2.\nIn an earmarking system, as soon as a counterparty's bid for credit is accepted by its home NCB the counterparty instructs, via its own custodian if necessary, the securities settlement systems (SSS) in the country in which its marketable assets are held, to transfer them to the central bank of that country (hereinafter the ‘correspondent central bank’) for the account of the home NCB. Once the home NCB has been informed by the correspondent central bank that the collateral has been received, it transfers the funds to the counterparty. The NCBs do not advance funds until they are certain that the counterparties' marketable assets have been received by the correspondent central bank. Where necessary to meet settlement deadlines, counterparties may be able to pre-deposit assets with correspondent central banks for the account of their home NCB using the CCBM procedures.\n3.\nIn a pooling system, the counterparty may at any time provide the correspondent central bank with marketable assets for the account of the home NCB. Once the home NCB has been informed by the correspondent central bank that the marketable assets have been received, it will add these marketable assets to the pool account of the counterparty.\n4.\nSpecific procedures for cross-border use have been developed for certain non-marketable assets, i.e. credit claims and retail mortgage-backed debt instruments (RMBDs). When credit claims are used as collateral in a cross-border context, a CCBM variant is applied to credit claims, using a transfer of ownership, an assignment or a pledge in favour of the home NCB, or a charge in favour of the correspondent central bank, acting as the agent for the home NCB. A further ad-hoc variant based on the charge in favour of the correspondent central bank acting as the agent for the home NCB is applied to allow the cross-border use of RMBDs.\n5.\nThe CCBM is available to counterparties, both for marketable and non-marketable assets, as a minimum from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. CET on each TARGET2 business day. A counterparty wishing to make use of the CCBM must advise the NCB from which it wishes to receive credit, i.e. its home NCB, before 4 p.m. CET. The counterparty must ensure that the collateral for securing the credit operation is delivered to the account of the correspondent central bank by 4.45 p.m. CET at the latest. Instructions or deliveries that do not respect this deadline will only be dealt with on a best effort basis and may be considered for credit that will be given on the following TARGET2 business day. When counterparties foresee a need to use the CCBM late in the day, they should, where possible, pre-deposit the assets. Under exceptional circumstances or when required for monetary policy purposes, the ECB may decide to extend the CCBM's closing time until the TARGET2 closing time, in cooperation with central securities depositories regarding their availability to extend their cut-off times for marketable assets.\nII.   ELIGIBLE LINKS BETWEEN SSSS\nTable 2\nLinks between securities settlement systems\nUse of eligible assets issued in the SSS of country B held by a counterparty established in country A through a link between the SSSs in countries A and B in order to obtain credit from the NCB of country A.\n1.\nEligible links between two SSSs in the European Economic Area (EEA) consist of a set of procedures and arrangements for the cross-border transfer of securities through a book-entry process. They take the form of an omnibus account opened by an SSS (hereinafter the ‘investor SSS’) in another SSS (hereinafter the ‘issuer SSS’).\n2.\nEligible links allow a participant in one SSS in the EEA to hold securities issued in another SSS in the EEA without being a participant therein. When using links between SSSs, the counterparties hold the assets on their own account with their home SSS and have no need for a custodian.\nIII.   CCBM IN COMBINATION WITH ELIGIBLE LINKS\nTable 3\nCCBM in combination with eligible links\nUse of eligible assets issued in the SSS of country C and held in the SSS of country B by a counterparty established in country A through a direct link between the SSSs in countries B and C in order to obtain credit from the NCB of country A.\nWhere eligible assets in the form of securities are to be transferred via the CCBM with links, counterparties must ensure that the securities are delivered to an account at the relevant investor SSS by 4 p.m. CET on the settlement date in order to ensure settlement of same-day value operations. Any request for mobilisation received by home NCBs from their counterparties after 4 p.m. CET, or any request for the delivery of eligible assets to an account at the relevant investor SSS after 4 p.m. CET, is dealt with on a best efforts basis, according to the cut-off times of the SSSs involved.\nIV.   CCBM WITH TRI-PARTY COLLATERAL MANAGEMENT SERVICES\nTable 4\nCross-border tri-party services\nUse of eligible assets held in the tri-party agent (TPA) of country B by a counterparty established in country A in order to obtain credit from the NCB of country A.\nThe arrow ‘Information on collateral’ between counterparty A and NCB A may not be relevant in the case of certain TPAs, depending on the contractual model chosen, and in such cases the counterparty does not send an instruction to NCB A or receive a confirmation from NCB A.\nANNEX VII\nCALCULATION OF SANCTIONS TO BE APPLIED IN ACCORDANCE WITH PART FIVE\nI.   CALCULATION OF FINANCIAL PENALTIES FOR BREACH OF CERTAIN COUNTERPARTY OBLIGATIONS\n1.\nWhere a financial penalty is to be imposed by a national central bank(NCB) on any of its counterparties in accordance with Part Five, the NCB shall calculate the penalty in accordance with a pre-specified penalty rate, as follows.\n(a)\nFor failure to comply with an obligation referred to in Article 154(1)(a), (b) or (c) a financial penalty is calculated using the marginal lending facility rate that applied on the day when the non-compliance began plus 2,5 percentage points.\n(b)\nFor failure to comply with an obligation referred to in Article 154(1)(d), a financial penalty is calculated using the marginal lending facility rate that applied on the day when the non-compliance began plus 5 percentage points. For repeated infringements of the obligation referred to in Article 154(1)(d) within a 12-month period, taken into account from the day of the first infringement, the penalty rate increases by a further 2,5 percentage points for each infringement.\n2.\nFor failure to comply with an obligation referred to in Article 154(1)(a) or (b), a financial penalty is calculated by applying the penalty rate, in accordance with paragraph 1(a), to the amount of collateral or cash that the counterparty could not deliver or settle, multiplied by the coefficient X/360, where X is the number of calendar days, with a maximum of seven, during which the counterparty was unable to collateralise or settle: (a) the allotted amount as specified in the certification of individual tender allotment results during the maturity of an operation; or (b) the remaining amount of a particular operation if there are early terminations executed by the NCB over the remainder of the term of the operation.\n3.\nFor failure to comply with an obligation referred to in Article 154(1)(c), a financial penalty is calculated by applying the penalty rate, in accordance with paragraph 1(a), to the value of the ineligible assets or the assets that may not be mobilised or used by the counterparty after haircuts, as follows:\n(a)\nin the case of ineligible assets which are provided by the counterparty to an NCB, the value of the ineligible assets after haircuts are taken into account; or\n(b)\nin the case of assets which were originally eligible but became ineligible or may no longer be mobilised or used by the counterparty, the value after haircuts of the assets that have not been removed by or before the start of the eighth calendar day, following an event after which the eligible assets became ineligible or may no longer be mobilised or used by the counterparty, are taken into account.\n4.\nThe amounts referred to in paragraph 3(a) and (b) are multiplied by the coefficient X/360, where X is the number of calendar days, with a maximum of seven, during which the counterparty failed to comply with its obligations in respect of the use of assets submitted as collateral for Eurosystem credit operations. In the case of paragraph 3(b), the calculation of X begins after the expiry of the grace period of seven calendar days.\n[EUR [value of ineligible assets after haircuts on the first day of the infringement] * (the applicable marginal lending facility rate on the day when the infringement began + 2,5 %) * [X]/360 = EUR […]]\n5.\nFor limit breaches as regards unsecured debt instruments issued by a credit institution or its closely linked entities as laid down in Article 141, the application of a grace period is determined as follows:\n(a)\nA grace period of seven calendar days applies if the breach resulted from a change in the valuation, without a submission of additional such unsecured debt instruments, on the basis of the following:\n(i)\nthe value of those already submitted unsecured debt instruments has increased; or\n(ii)\nthe total collateral pool has been lowered.\nIn such cases the counterparty is required to adjust the value of its total collateral pool or the value of such unsecured debt instruments within the grace period, to ensure compliance with the applicable limit.\n(b)\nThe submission of additional unsecured debt instruments issued by a credit institution or its closely linked entities breaching the applicable limit does not entitle the counterparty to a grace period.\n6.\nIf the counterparty has provided information that affects the value of its collateral negatively from the Eurosystem's perspective with regard to Article 145(4), e.g. incorrect information on the outstanding amount of a used credit claim that is or has been false or out of date, the amount (value) of the collateral that has been negatively affected is taken into account for the calculation of the financial penalty under paragraph 3. If the incorrect information is corrected within the grace period, no penalty is to be applied.\n7.\nFor failure to comply with the obligations referred to in Article 154(1)(d), a financial penalty is calculated by applying the penalty rate, in accordance with paragraph 1(b), to the amount of the counterparty's unauthorised access to the marginal lending facility.\n8.\nAn NCB will impose a minimum financial penalty of EUR 500 where the calculation in accordance with this Annex results in an amount of less than EUR 500. A financial penalty will not be imposed where a breach is rectified within an applicable grace period.\nII.   CALCULATION OF NON-FINANCIAL PENALTIES IN CASE OF BREACH OF CERTAIN COUNTERPARTY OBLIGATIONS\nSuspension for non-compliance with obligations referred to in Article 154(1)(a) or (b)\n9.\nWhere a suspension period applies in accordance with Article 156(1), an NCB will impose the suspension in accordance with the following:\n(a)\nif the amount of non-delivered collateral or cash is up to 40 % of the total collateral or cash to be delivered, a suspension of one month applies;\n(b)\nif the amount of non-delivered collateral or cash is between 40 % and 80 % of the total collateral or cash to be delivered, a suspension of two months applies;\n(c)\nif the amount of non-delivered collateral or cash is between 80 % and 100 % of the total collateral or cash to be delivered, a suspension of three months applies.\n10.\nWith regard to I and II above, if a sanction relates to a transaction between a counterparty and the ECB in a bilateral procedure, the above provisions are interpreted to cater for the imposition of sanctions by the ECB.\nANNEX VIII\nLOAN-LEVEL DATA REPORTING REQUIREMENTS FOR ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES\nThis Annex applies to the provision of comprehensive and standardised loan-level data on the pool of cash-flow generating assets backing the asset-backed securities (ABSs), as specified in Article 78.\nI.   SUBMISSION OF LOAN-LEVEL DATA\n1.\nLoan-level data must be submitted by the relevant parties to a loan-level data repository designated by the Eurosystem. The loan-level data repository publishes such data electronically. In order to be designated, loan-level data repositories must comply with the applicable Eurosystem requirements, including open access, coverage, non-discrimination, appropriate governance structure and transparency.\n2.\nLoan-level data must be submitted for each individual transaction together with the up-to-date relevant loan-level data reporting template, published on the ECB's website, depending on the type of asset backing the ABS, as defined in Article 73(1).\n3.\nLoan-level data must be reported at least on a quarterly basis, but no later than one month following a due date for the payment of interest on the relevant ABSs. As regards the data submitted, the pool cut-off date may not be more than two months old, i.e. the ‘date of submission of report’ less the ‘pool cut-off date’ must be less than two months. The ‘pool cut-off date’ is defined as the date on which a snapshot of the performance of the underlying assets was captured for the respective report.\n4.\nTo ensure compliance with the requirements in paragraphs 2 and 3, the loan-level data repository conducts automated consistency and accuracy checks on reports of new and updated loan-level data for each transaction.\nII.   LEVEL OF REQUIRED DETAIL\n1.\nAfter the date of application of loan-level data reporting requirements for the specific class of cash-flow generating assets backing the ABSs as specified on the European Central Bank's (ECB's) website, detailed loan-by-loan level information must be provided for ABSs to become or remain eligible.\n2.\nWithin a period of three months, the ABSs must achieve a compulsory minimum compliance level, assessed by reference to the availability of information, in particular the data fields of the loan-level data reporting template.\n3.\nTo capture non-available fields, a set of six ‘no data’ (ND) options are included in the loan-level data templates and must be filled in whenever particular data cannot be submitted in accordance with the loan-level data template. There is also a seventh ND option, which only applies for the loan-level data template for commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBSs).\nTable 1\nExplanation of the ND options\n‘no data’ options\nExplanation\nND1\nData not collected as not required by the underwriting criteria\nND2\nData collected on application but not loaded into the reporting system on completion\nND3\nData collected on application but loaded it on a separate system from the reporting one\nND4\nData collected but will only be available from YYYY-MM\nND5\nNot relevant\nND6\nNot applicable for the jurisdiction\nND7\nOnly for CMBS loans with a value below EUR 500 000, i.e. the value of the whole commercial loan balance at origination\nIII.   TRANSITIONAL PERIOD\n1.\nThe following nine-month transitional period applies to all ABSs, depending on the date on which the loan-level data reporting requirements apply for the relevant asset class backing the ABSs:\n(a)\nduring the first three months (first quarter) following the date of application, loan-level data must be reported, but there are no specific limits regarding the number of mandatory fields containing ND1 to ND7;\n(b)\nfrom the beginning of the fourth month to the end of the sixth month (second quarter), the number of mandatory fields that contain ND1 may not exceed 30 % of the total number of mandatory fields and the number of mandatory fields which contain ND2, ND3 or ND4 may not exceed 40 % of the total number of mandatory fields;\n(c)\nfrom the beginning of the seventh month to the end of the ninth month (third quarter) the number of mandatory fields that contain ND1 may not exceed 10 % of the total number of mandatory fields and the number of mandatory fields which contain ND2, ND3 or ND4 may not exceed 20 % of the total number of mandatory fields;\n(d)\nat the end of the nine-month transitional period, there must be no mandatory fields in the loan-level data containing ND1, ND2, ND3 or ND4 values for an individual transaction.\n2.\nApplying these thresholds, the loan-level data repository generates and assigns a score to each ABS transaction upon submission and processing of loan-level data.\n3.\nThis score reflects the number of mandatory fields that contain ND1 and the number of mandatory fields that contain ND2, ND3 or ND4, compared in each case against the total number of mandatory fields. In this regard, the options ND5, ND6 and ND7 may only be used if the relevant data fields in the relevant loan-level data reporting template so permit. Combining the two threshold references produces the following range of loan-level data scores.\nTable 2\nLoan-level data scores\nScoring value matrix\nND1 fields\n0\n≤ 10 %\n≤ 30 %\n> 30 %\nND2\nor\nND3\nor\nND4\n0\nA1\nB1\nC1\nD1\n≤ 20 %\nA2\nB2\nC2\nD2\n≤ 40 %\nA3\nB3\nC3\nD3\n> 40 %\nA4\nB4\nC4\nD4\n4.\nAccording to the transitional period set out above, the score must gradually improve for each quarter, in accordance with the following overview:\nTable 3\nScoring value\nTimeline\nScoring value (eligibility treatment)\nfirst quarter\n(no minimum scoring value enforced)\nsecond quarter\nC3 (as a minimum)\nthird quarter\nB2 (as a minimum)\nfrom the fourth quarter onwards\nA1\nANNEX IX\nEUROSYSTEM CREDIT ASSESSMENT FRAMEWORK PERFORMANCE MONITORING PROCESS\n1.\nFor each credit assessment system, the Eurosystem credit assessment framework (ECAF) performance monitoring process consists of an annual ex post comparison of:\n(a)\nthe observed default rates for all eligible entities and debt instruments rated by the credit assessment system, whereby these entities and instruments are grouped into static pools based on certain characteristics, e.g. credit rating, asset class, industry sector, credit quality assessment model; and\n(b)\nthe maximum probability of default associated with the respective credit quality step of the Eurosystem's harmonised rating scale.\n2.\nThe first element of the process is the annual compilation by the credit assessment system provider of the list of entities and debt instruments with credit quality assessments that satisfy the Eurosystem credit quality requirements at the beginning of the monitoring period. This list must then be submitted by the credit assessment system provider to the Eurosystem, using the template provided by the Eurosystem, which includes identification, classification and credit quality assessment-related fields.\n3.\nThe second element of the process takes place at the end of the 12-month monitoring period. The credit assessment system provider updates the performance data for the entities and debt instruments on the list. The Eurosystem reserves the right to request any additional information required in order to conduct performance monitoring.\n4.\nThe observed default rate of the static pools of a credit assessment system recorded over a one-year horizon is input to the ECAF performance monitoring process, which comprises an annual rule and a multi-period assessment.\n5.\nIn the event of a significant deviation between the observed default rate of the static pools and the maximum probability of default of the relevant credit quality step over an annual and/or a multi-annual period, the Eurosystem will consult the credit assessment system provider to analyse the reasons for that deviation.\nANNEX X\nLEVELS OF VALUATION HAIRCUTS\nTable 1\nLevels of valuation haircuts applied to eligible marketable assets\nHaircut categories\nCredit quality\nResidual maturity (years) (2)\nCategory I\nCategory II (1)\nCategory III (1)\nCategory IV (1)\nCategory V (1)\nfixed coupon\nzero coupon\nfixed coupon\nzero coupon\nfixed coupon\nzero coupon\nfixed coupon\nzero coupon\nSteps 1 and 2\n[0, 1)\n0,5\n0,5\n1,0\n1,0\n1,0\n1,0\n6,5\n6,5\n10,0\n[1, 3)\n1,0\n2,0\n1,5\n2,5\n2,0\n3,0\n8,5\n9,0\n[3, 5)\n1,5\n2,5\n2,5\n3,5\n3,0\n4,5\n11,0\n11,5\n[5, 7)\n2,0\n3,0\n3,5\n4,5\n4,5\n6,0\n12,5\n13,5\n[7, 10)\n3,0\n4,0\n4,5\n6,5\n6,0\n8,0\n14,0\n15,5\n[10, ∞)\n5,0\n7,0\n8,0\n10,5\n9,0\n13,0\n17,0\n22,5\nHaircut categories\nCredit quality\nResidual maturity (years) (2)\nCategory I\nCategory II (1)\nCategory III (1)\nCategory IV (1)\nCategory V (1)\nfixed coupon\nzero coupon\nfixed coupon\nzero coupon\nfixed coupon\nzero coupon\nfixed coupon\nzero coupon\nStep 3\n[0, 1)\n6,0\n6,0\n7,0\n7,0\n8,0\n8,0\n13,0\n13,0\nNot eligible\n[1, 3)\n7,0\n8,0\n10,0\n14,5\n15,0\n16,5\n24,5\n26,5\n[3, 5)\n9,0\n10,0\n15,5\n20,5\n22,5\n25,0\n32,5\n36,5\n[5, 7)\n10,0\n11,5\n16,0\n22,0\n26,0\n30,0\n36,0\n40,0\n[7, 10)\n11,5\n13,0\n18,5\n27,5\n27,0\n32,5\n37,0\n42,5\n[10, ∞)\n13,0\n16,0\n22,5\n33,0\n27,5\n35,0\n37,5\n44,0\nTable 2\nLevels of valuation haircuts applied to credit claims with fixed interest payments\nValuation methodology\nCredit quality\nResidual maturity (years) (3)\nFixed interest payment and a valuation based on a theoretical price assigned by the national central bank (NCB)\nFixed interest payment and a valuation according to the outstanding amount assigned by the NCB\nSteps 1 and 2\n[0, 1)\n10,0\n12,0\n[1, 3)\n12,0\n16,0\n[3, 5)\n14,0\n21,0\n[5, 7)\n17,0\n27,0\n[7, 10)\n22,0\n35,0\n[10, ∞)\n30,0\n45,0\nValuation methodology\nCredit quality\nResidual maturity (years) (3)\nFixed interest payment and a valuation based on a theoretical price assigned by the NCB\nFixed interest payment and a valuation according to the outstanding amount assigned by the NCB\nStep 3\n[0, 1)\n17,0\n19,0\n[1, 3)\n29,0\n34,0\n[3, 5)\n37,0\n46,0\n[5, 7)\n39,0\n52,0\n[7, 10)\n40,0\n58,0\n[10, ∞)\n42,0\n65,0\n(1)  \nNote: asset-backed securities, covered bonds and unsecured debt instruments issued by credit institutions may be subject to an additional valuation haircut pursuant to the provisions laid down in Part Four.\n(2)  ‘[0, 1)’ is to be interpreted as residual maturity less than one year; ‘[1, 3)’ as residual maturity equal or greater than one year and less than three years; ‘[3, 5)’ as residual maturity equal or greater than three years and less than five years, etc.\n(3)  ‘[0, 1)’ is to be interpreted as residual maturity less than one year; ‘[1, 3)’ as residual maturity equal or greater than one year and less than three years; ‘[3, 5)’ as residual maturity equal or greater than three years and less than five years, etc.\nANNEX XI\nSECURITY FORMS\nOn 13 June 2006 the European Central Bank (ECB) announced the new global notes (NGN) criteria for international global bearer form securities that would be eligible as collateral for Eurosystem credit operations from 1 January 2007. On 22 October 2008 the ECB announced that international debt securities in global registered form issued after 30 September 2010, would only be eligible as collateral for Eurosystem credit operations when the new safekeeping structure for international debt securities (NSS) is used.\nThe following table summarises the eligibility rules for the different forms of securities with the introduction of the NGN criteria.\nTable 1\nEligibility rules for different security forms\nGlobal/individual\nBearer/registered\nNGN/classic global note (CGN)\nIn the case of NGN/NSS, is the common safekeeper (CSK) an ICSD (1)?\nEligible?\nGlobal\nBearer\nNGN\nYes\nYes\nNo\nNo\nGlobal\nBearer\nCGN\nN/A\nNo, but those securities issued before 1 January 2007 will be grandfathered until maturity, plus any tap issues from 1 January 2007 when the ISINs are fungible.\nGlobal\nRegistered\nCGN\nN/A\nBonds issued under this structure after 30 September 2010 are no longer eligible.\nGlobal\nRegistered\nNSS\nYes\nYes\nNo\nNo\nIndividual\nBearer\nN/A\nN/A\nBonds issued under this structure after 30 September 2010 are no longer eligible.

EXAMPLE 6: RISK CONTROL MEASURES\n1.\nThis example illustrates the risk control framework applied to assets mobilised as collateral in the Eurosystem credit operations. It is based on the assumption that, in the calculation of the need for a margin call, accrued interest on the liquidity provided is taken into account and a trigger point of 0,5 % of the liquidity provided is applied. The example is based on the assumption that a counterparty participates in the following Eurosystem monetary policy operations:\n(a)\na main refinancing operation starting on 30 July 2014 and ending on 6 August 2014 where the counterparty is allotted EUR 50 million at an interest rate of 0,15 %;\n(b)\na longer-term refinancing operation starting on 31 July 2014 and ending on 23 October 2014 where the counterparty is allotted EUR 45 million at an interest rate of 0,15 %;\n(c)\na main refinancing operation starting on 6 August 2014 and ending on 13 August 2014 where the counterparty is allotted EUR 35 million at an interest rate of 0,15 %.\n2.\nThe characteristics of the marketable assets mobilised by the counterparty to cover these operations are specified in Table 1.\nTable 1\nMarketable assets mobilised in the transactions\nCharacteristics\nName\nAsset class\nMaturity date\nCoupon definition\nCoupon frequency\nResidual maturity\nHaircut\nAsset A\nJumbo covered bond\n30.8.2018\nFixed rate\n6 months\n4 years\n2,50 %\nAsset B\nCentral government bond\n19.11.2018\nVariable rate\n12 months\n4 years\n0,50 %\nAsset C\nCorporate bond\n12.5.2025\nZero coupon rate\n> 10 years\n13,00 %\nPrices in percentages (including accrued interest) (1)\n30.7.2014\n31.7.2014\n1.8.2014\n4.8.2014\n5.8.2014\n6.8.2014\n7.8.2014\n101,61\n101,21\n99,50\n99,97\n99,73\n100,01\n100,12\n98,12\n97,95\n98,15\n98,56\n98,59\n98,57\n53,71\n53,62\nEARMARKING SYSTEM\nFirst, it is assumed that the transactions are carried out with a national central bank (NCB) using a system where underlying assets are earmarked for each transaction. The valuation of assets mobilised as collateral is carried out on a daily basis. The risk control framework can then be described as follows (see also Table 2 below):\n1.\nOn 30 July 2014, the counterparty enters into a repurchase transaction with the NCB, which purchases EUR 50,6 million of Asset A. Asset A is a jumbo covered bond with a fixed coupon maturing on 30 August 2018 and allocated to credit quality step 1-2. It thus has a residual maturity of four years, therefore requiring a valuation haircut of 2,5 %. The market price of Asset A on its reference market on that day is 101,61 %, which includes the accrued interest on the coupon. The counterparty is required to provide an amount of Asset A, which, after deduction of the 2,5 % valuation haircut, exceeds the allotted amount of EUR 50 million. The counterparty therefore delivers Asset A for a nominal amount of EUR 50,6 million, the adjusted market value of which is EUR 50 129 294 on that day.\n2.\nOn 31 July 2014, the counterparty enters into a repurchase transaction with the NCB, which purchases EUR 21 million of Asset A (market price 101,21 %, valuation haircut 2,5 %) and EUR 25 million of Asset B (market price 98,02 %). Asset B is a central government bond with variable rate coupon payments and allocated to credit quality step 1-2, to which a 0,5 % valuation haircut is applied. The adjusted market value of Asset A and Asset B on that day is EUR 45 130 098, thus exceeding the required amount of EUR 45 000 000.\n3.\nOn 31 July 2014, the assets underlying the main refinancing operation initiated on 30 July 2014 are revalued. With a market price of 101,21 %, the haircut-adjusted market value of Asset A is still within the lower and upper trigger amounts. The collateral that was mobilised initially is consequently considered to cater for both the initial amount of liquidity provided and the accrued interest amounting to EUR 208.\n4.\nOn 1 August 2014, the underlying assets are revalued: the market price of Asset A is 99,50 % and the market price of Asset B is 97,95 %. Accrued interest amounts to EUR 417 on the main refinancing operation initiated on 30 July 2014 and EUR 188 on the longer-term refinancing operation initiated on 31 July 2014. As a result, the adjusted market value of Asset A in the first transaction falls below the transaction's amount to be covered, i.e. the liquidity provided plus the accrued interest, by EUR 912 092, but also below the lower trigger level of EUR 49 750 415. The counterparty delivers EUR 950 000 of Asset A in nominal value terms, which, after deducting a 2,5 % haircut from the market value based on a price of 99,50 %, restores sufficient collateral coverage. NCBs may perform margin calls in cash rather than securities.\nA margin call is also needed on the second transaction since the adjusted market value of the underlying assets used in this transaction (EUR 44 737 688) is below the lower trigger level (EUR 44 775 187). The counterparty therefore provides EUR 270 000 of Asset B with an adjusted market value of EUR 263 143.\n5.\nOn 4 and 5 August 2014, the underlying assets are revalued, without resulting in any margin call for the transactions entered into on 30 and 31 July 2014.\n6.\nOn 6 August 2014, the counterparty repays the liquidity provided under the main refinancing operation initiated on 30 July 2014, including the accrued interest of EUR 1 458. The NCB returns EUR 51 550 000 of Asset A in nominal value.\nOn the same day the counterparty enters into a new repurchase transaction with the NCB, which purchases EUR 75 million of Asset C in nominal value terms. Since Asset C is a zero coupon corporate bond with a residual maturity of more than 10 years and allocated to credit quality step 1-2, requiring a valuation haircut of 13 %, the corresponding haircut-adjusted market value on that day is of EUR 35 045 775. The revaluation of assets underlying the long-term refinancing operation initiated on 31 July 2014 reveals that the adjusted market value of the assets provided exceeds the upper trigger level and leads to the NCB returning EUR 262 000 of Asset B in nominal value to the counterparty. If a margin had to be paid to the counterparty by the NCB in relation to the second transaction, such a margin could, in certain cases, be netted out with the margin paid to the NCB by the counterparty in relation to the first transaction. As a result, there would only be one margin settlement.\nPOOLING SYSTEM\nSecond, it is assumed that the transactions are carried out with an NCB using a pooling system where assets included in the pool of assets used by the counterparty are not earmarked for specific transactions:\n1.\nThe same sequence of transactions is used in this example as in the above example illustrating an earmarking system. The main difference is that, on the revaluation dates, the adjusted market value of all the assets in the pool has to cover the total amount of all of the counterparty's outstanding operations with the NCB. The margin call of EUR 1 174 592 occurring on 1 August 2014 is identical in this example to the one required in the earmarking system case. The counterparty delivers EUR 1 300 000 of Asset A in nominal value terms, which, after deducting a 2,5 % haircut from the market value based on a price of 99,50 %, restores sufficient collateral coverage.\n2.\nMoreover, on 6 August 2014, when the main refinancing operation entered into on 30 July 2014 matures, the counterparty may keep the assets on its pool account. An asset can also be exchanged for another asset as shown in the example, where EUR 51,9 million of Asset A in nominal value are replaced with EUR 75,5 million of Asset C in nominal value to cover the liquidity provided and the accrued interest under all refinancing operations.\n3.\nThe risk control framework in the pooling system is described in Table 3.\nTable 2\nEarmarking System\nDate\nOutstanding transactions\nStart date\nEnd date\nInterest rate\nLiquidity provided\nAccrued interest\nTotal amount to be covered\nLower trigger amount\nUpper trigger amount\nAdjusted market value\nMargin call\n30.7.2014\nMain refinancing\n30.7.2014\n6.8.2014\n0,15\n50 000 000\n—\n50 000 000\n49 750 000\n50 250 000\n50 129 294\n—\n31.7.2014\nMain refinancing\n30.7.2014\n6.8.2014\n0,15\n50 000 000\n208\n50 000 208\n49 750 207\n50 250 209\n49 931 954\n—\nLonger-term refinancing\n31.7.2014\n29.10.2014\n0,15\n45 000 000\n—\n45 000 000\n44 775 000\n45 225 000\n45 130 098\n—\n1.8.2014\nMain refinancing\n30.7.2014\n6.8.2014\n0,15\n50 000 000\n417\n50 000 417\n49 750 415\n50 250 419\n49 088 325\n– 912 092\nLonger-term refinancing\n31.7.2014\n29.10.2014\n0,15\n45 000 000\n188\n45 000 188\n44 775 187\n45 225 188\n44 737 688\n– 262 500\n4.8.2014\nMain refinancing\n30.7.2014\n6.8.2014\n0,15\n50 000 000\n1 042\n50 001 042\n49 751 036\n50 251 047\n50 246 172\n—\nLonger-term refinancing\n31.7.2014\n29.10.2014\n0,15\n45 000 000\n750\n45 000 750\n44 775 746\n45 225 754\n45 147 350\n—\n5.8.2014\nMain refinancing\n30.7.2014\n6.8.2014\n0,15\n50 000 000\n1 250\n50 001 250\n49 751 244\n50 251 256\n50 125 545\n—\nLonger-term refinancing\n31.7.2014\n29.10.2014\n0,15\n45 000 000\n938\n45 000 938\n44 775 933\n45 225 942\n45 201 299\n—\n6.8.2014\nMain refinancing\n6.8.2014\n13.8.2014\n0,15\n35 000 000\n—\n35 000 000\n34 825 000\n35 175 000\n35 045 775\n—\nLonger-term refinancing\n31.7.2014\n29.10.2014\n0,15\n45 000 000\n1 125\n45 001 125\n44 776 119\n45 226 131\n45 266 172\n265 047\n7.8.2014\nMain refinancing\n6.8.2014\n13.8.2014\n0,15\n35 000 000\n146\n35 000 146\n34 825 145\n35 175 147\n34 987 050\n—\nLonger-term refinancing\n31.7.2014\n29.10.2014\n0,15\n45 000 000\n1 313\n45 001 313\n44 776 306\n45 226 319\n45 026 704\n—\nTable 3\nPooling System\nDate\nOutstanding transactions\nStart date\nEnd date\nInterest rate\nLiquidity provided\nAccrued interest\nTotal amount to be covered\nLower trigger amount (2)\nUpper trigger amount (3)\nAdjusted market value\nMargin call\n30.7.2014\nMain refinancing\n30.7.2014\n6.8.2014\n0,15\n50 000 000\n—\n50 000 000\n49 750 000\nNot applicable\n50 129 294\n—\n31.7.2014\nMain refinancing\n30.7.2014\n6.8.2014\n0,15\n50 000 000\n208\n95 000 208\n94 525 207\nNot applicable\n95 062 051\n—\nLonger-term refinancing\n31.7.2014\n29.10.2014\n0,15\n45 000 000\n—\n1.8.2014\nMain refinancing\n30.7.2014\n6.8.2014\n0,15\n50 000 000\n417\n95 000 604\n94 525 601\nNot applicable\n93 826 013\n– 1 174 592\nLonger-term refinancing\n31.7.2014\n29.10.2014\n0,15\n45 000 000\n188\n4.8.2014\nMain refinancing\n30.7.2014\n6.8.2014\n0,15\n50 000 000\n1 042\n95 001 792\n94 526 783\nNot applicable\n95 470 989\n—\nLonger-term refinancing\n31.7.2014\n29.10.2014\n0,15\n45 000 000\n750\n5.8.2014\nMain refinancing\n30.7.2014\n6.8.2014\n0,15\n50 000 000\n1 250\n95 002 188\n94 527 177\nNot applicable\n95 402 391\n—\nLonger-term refinancing\n31.7.2014\n29.10.2014\n0,15\n45 000 000\n938\n6.8.2014\nMain refinancing\n6.8.2014\n13.8.2014\n0,15\n35 000 000\n—\n80 001 125\n79 601 119\nNot applicable\n80 280 724\n—\nLonger-term refinancing\n31.7.2014\n29.10.2014\n0,15\n45 000 000\n1 125\n7.8.2014\nMain refinancing\n6.8.2014\n13.8.2014\n0,15\n35 000 000\n146\n80 001 458\n79 601 451\nNot applicable\n80 239 155\n—\n30.7.2014\nLonger-term refinancing\n31.7.2014\n29.10.2014\n0,15\n45 000 000\n1 313\n(1)  The prices shown for a specific valuation date correspond to the most representative price on the business day preceding this valuation date.\n(2)  In a pooling system, the lower trigger amount is the lowest threshold for margin calls. In practice most NCBs require additional collateral whenever the haircut adjusted market value of the collateral pool falls below the total amount to be covered.\n(3)  In a pooling system, the notion of upper trigger amount is not relevant, since the counterparty will constantly target an excess amount of collateral provided in order to minimise operational transactions.\nANNEX XIII\nCORRELATION

the Eurosystem monetary policy framework\nSUMMARY OF:\nGuideline (EU) 2015/510 on the implementation of the Eurosystem monetary policy framework\nWHAT IS THE AIM OF THE GUIDELINE?\n              \nIt sets out uniform rules for implementing the Eurosystem monetary policy for EU countries whose currency is the euro.\nKEY POINTS\n              \nIn order to achieve its primary objective of maintaining price stability for the euro area as a whole, the Eurosystem uses a set of monetary policy instruments and procedures. These provide the operational framework for the implementation of monetary policy decisions in practice.\nThe guideline covers the Eurosystem monetary instruments and procedures.\nThe monetary policy instruments are: open market operations, aiming to steer interest rates, regulate the money supply in the financial market and signal the monetary policy stance;standing facilities, aiming to provide and absorb overnight liquidity;minimum reserve requirements (the minimum amount of reserves a commercial bank must hold with their central bank), which are specified in Regulation (EC) No 2531/98 and Regulation (EC) No 1745/2003 (ECB/2003/9).\nThe Eurosystem open market operations are executed through tender procedures and may either involve tenders or be bilateral procedures, where the central bank deals directly with only one or a few counterparties*.\nEligible counterparties\nCounterparties to the Eurosystem’s monetary policy operations must fulfil the following criteria to participate in these operations: meet the minimum reserve requirements;be supervised by competent authorities according to Directive 2013/36/EU on prudential supervision of credit institutions and investment firms (see summary) and Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 on prudential requirements for credit institutions and investment firms (see summary);be financially sound;satisfy all the contractual requirements specified by the European Central Bank (ECB) or the national central bank.\nEligible assets\nIn order to participate in Eurosystem credit operations, counterparties must provide the Eurosystem with assets that are accepted as collateral for such operations. The eligibility of assets is assessed by the national central banks according to the criteria specified in a single framework common to all Eurosystem credit operations.\nSanctions in the event of a failure to comply with counterparty obligations\nThe Eurosystem can impose penalties, both financial and non-financial, on counterparties that fail to satisfy the minimum reserve requirements or to comply with operational rules.\nDiscretionary measures\nThe Eurosystem may opt to apply certain measures due to concerns about the counterparty’s financial soundness or other justified concerns. It can:\nsuspend, limit or exclude, on grounds of prudence, a counterparty’s access to its monetary policy operations;\nreject or limit the use of assets if it considers an issue, issuer, debtor or guarantor fails to meet the system’s credit quality requirements;\nlimit the counterparties’ access to Eurosystem monetary policy operations if they are deemed to be ‘failing or likely to fail’ by the relevant authorities.\nThe guideline also provides for additional minimum common features in relation to Eurosystem monetary policy operations.\nThey cover the legal relationship between Eurosystem central banks and counterparties and various issues such as the implementation of the guideline defaults, remedies, third-party rights and governing law and jurisdiction.\nNational central banks may share information with each other on counterparties if necessary to implement the Eurosystem monetary policy.\nCounterparties must comply with all anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing legislation.\nFROM WHEN DOES THE GUIDELINE APPLY?\n              \nThe guideline has applied since 1 May 2015, except Article 142 (liquidity support in respect of asset-backed securities), which has applied since 1 November 2015.\nBACKGROUND\n              \nArticle 127(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union states that the basic tasks of the European System of Central Banks (ESCB) are to:\ndefine and implement the monetary policy of the EU;\nconduct foreign-exchange operations;\nhold and manage EU countries’ official foreign reserves;\npromote the smooth operation of payment systems.\nThe Statute of the ESCB and of the ECB provides that:\nthe ECB and the national central banks may conduct open market and credit operations;\nthe ECB may require credit institutions established in EU countries to hold minimum reserves on accounts with the ECB and national central banks in pursuance of monetary policy objectives.\nKEY TERMS\n              \nCounterparty: an institution which meets the Eurosystem’s eligibility criteria to access its monetary policy operations.\nMAIN DOCUMENT\n            \nGuideline (EU) 2015/510 of the European Central Bank of 19 December 2014 on the implementation of the Eurosystem monetary policy framework (ECB/2014/60) (recast) (OJ L 91, 2.4.2015, pp. 3-135)\nSuccessive amendments to Guideline (EU) 2015/510 have been incorporated into the original text.
