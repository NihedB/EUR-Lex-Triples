This Directive lays down minimum standards for the protection of animals bred or kept for farming purposes.2. It shall not apply to:(a) animals living in the wild;(b) animals intended for use in competitions, shows, cultural or sporting events or activities;(c) experimental or laboratory animals;(d) any invertebrate animal.3.

The freedom of movement of an animal, having regard to its species and in accordance with established experience and scientific knowledge, must not be restricted in such a way as to cause it unnecessary suffering or injury.Where an animal is continuously or regularly tethered or confined, it must be given the space appropriate to its physiological and ethological needs in accordance with established experience and scientific knowledge.Buildings and accommodation 8. Materials to be used for the construction of accommodation, and in particular for the construction of pens an equipment with which the animals may come into contact, must not be harmful to the animals and must be capable of being throughly cleaned and disinfected.9.

No animal shall be kept for farming purposes unless it can reasonably be expected, on the basis of its genotype or phenotype, that it can be kept without detrimental effect on its health or welfare.(1) Council Directive 96/22/EC of 29 April 1996 concerning the prohibition on the use in stockfarming of certain substances having a hormonal or thyrostatic action and of beta-agonists (OJ L 125, 23. 5. 1996, p. 3).", "summary": "Protection of farmed animals\nProtection of farmed animals\nSUMMARY OF:\nDirective 98/58/EC — protection of animals kept for farming purposes\nWHAT IS THE AIM OF THE DIRECTIVE?\nIt lays down general rules concerning the protection of farmed animals, irrespective of the species.\nThese apply to farmed animals destined for the production of foodstuffs, wool, skin or fur, or for other farming purposes, including fish, reptiles and amphibians.\nKEY POINTS\nAll EU countries have ratified the European Convention for the Protection of Animals Kept for Farming Purposes. The main articles of this relate to the provision of housing, feed and care appropriate to the needs of these animals.\nEU countries must take account of these animal welfare requirements when drawing up and implementing EU legislation, especially in the area of agricultural policy.\nAnimals\nThis directive applies to animals (including fish, reptiles and amphibians) reared or kept for the production of food, wool, skin or fur or for other farming purposes. It does not apply to:\nwild animals\nanimals intended for use in sporting or cultural events (shows)\nexperimental or laboratory animals\ninvertebrate animals.\nTo learn more details about specific categories of animals, see also:\nProtection of laying hens\nProtection of calves\nProtection of pigs.\nRearing conditions\nEU countries must adopt rules to ensure that the owners or keepers of animals look after the welfare of their animals and see that those animals are not caused any unnecessary pain, suffering or injury. Based on past experience and current scientific knowledge, the rearing conditions relate to the following.\nStaff: animals must be looked after by a sufficient number of staff who have the appropriate professional skills, knowledge and competence.\nInspections: all animals kept in husbandry systems must be inspected at least once a day. Injured or ill animals must be treated immediately and isolated if necessary in suitable premises.\nMaintaining records: the owner or keeper of the animals must keep a record of any medical treatment for at least three years.\nFreedom of movement: all animals, even if tethered, chained or confined, must be given enough space to move without unnecessary suffering or injury.\nBuildings and accommodation: materials used in the construction of buildings must be capable of being cleaned and disinfected. Air circulation, dust levels, temperature and relative humidity should be kept within acceptable limits. Animals kept in buildings must not be kept in permanent darkness or constantly exposed to artificial lighting.\nAutomatic or mechanical equipment: automatic or mechanical equipment essential for the health and well-being of the animals must be inspected at least once a day. Where an artificial ventilation system is in use, an appropriate backup system must be in place to guarantee sufficient air renewal.\nFeed, water and other substances: the animals must be given a wholesome and appropriate diet, fed to them in sufficient quantities and at regular intervals. All other substances are prohibited, unless given for therapeutic or prophylactic reasons or for the purposes of zootechnical treatment. In addition, the feeding and watering equipment must minimise the risks of contamination.\nMutilations: national rules on mutilation apply.\nRearing methods: rearing methods that cause suffering or injury must not be used unless their impact is minimal, brief or expressly allowed by the national authorities. No animal should be kept on a farm if it is harmful to its health or welfare.\nInspections\nEU countries must take the necessary steps to ensure that the competent national authorities carry out inspections. They must report on these inspections to the European Commission, which will use the reports to formulate proposals on harmonising inspections.\nEvaluation and implementation\nEvery 5 years, the Commission must report to the Council on the implementation of this directive, with proposals for improvement, if appropriate. The Council adopts this report by qualified majority vote.\nEU countries are allowed to keep or introduce stricter provisions.\nOfficial controls regulation\nRegulation (EU) 2017/625, the EU’s new legislation on the official controls of human food and animal feed, amends certain minor technical details of the directive. These changes will apply from 14 December 2019.\nFROM WHEN DOES THE DIRECTIVE APPLY?\n              \nIt has applied since 8 August 1998. EU countries had to incorporate it into national law by 31 December 1999.\nBACKGROUND\n              \nFor more information, see:\nAnimal welfare on the farm (European Commission).\nMAIN DOCUMENT\n            \nCouncil Directive 98/58/EC of 20 July 1998 concerning the protection of animals kept for farming purposes (OJ L 221, 8.8.1998, pp. 23–27)\nSuccessive amendments to Directive 98/58/EC have been incorporated into the original document.
