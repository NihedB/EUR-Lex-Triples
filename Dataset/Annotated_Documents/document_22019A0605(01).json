DEFINITION\nINTRODUCTION\nThe Legality Definition (“LD”) sets out principles, criteria, indicators and verifiers for legal timber according to the laws and regulations of Viet Nam. The LD shall be updated as and when required during the implementation of this Agreement in accordance with the provisions of Article 24 of this Agreement. The LD forms an integral part of the Viet Nam Timber Legality Assurance System (“VNTLAS”) described in Annex V.\nThis Annex has been developed by a multi-sector working group through a comprehensive consultation process with government agencies, industry associations, enterprises, non-governmental organisations, households, individuals and local communities. The forms of consultation have included stakeholder workshops, online and written comments and contributions by organisations and individuals on drafts of the LD.\nVietnamese legal documents referred to in Appendices 1A and 1B to this Annex include laws and ordinances of the National Assembly, decrees of the Government, decisions of the Prime Minister, decisions of ministries and circulars of ministries which are publicly disclosed.\nSTRUCTURE AND CONTENT OF THE LEGALITY DEFINITION MATRIX\nThe LD is developed for two target groups, namely Organisations and Households, as defined in Section 2.2.1 of Annex V, to reflect compliance requirements of various regulations that apply to those two target groups and to design a clear, specific and feasible VNTLAS as described in Annex V.\nThe LD for Organisations is set out in Appendix 1A to this Annex and the LD for Households is set out in Appendix 1B to this Annex.\nThe LD is divided into seven principles, as follows:\n1.   Organisations\n—\nPrinciple I: Harvesting of domestic timber complies with regulations on land use rights, forest use rights, management, environment and society.\n—\nPrinciple II: Compliance with regulations on handling confiscated timber.\n—\nPrinciple III: Compliance with regulations on importing timber.\n—\nPrinciple IV: Compliance with regulations on timber transportation and trade.\n—\nPrinciple V: Compliance with regulations on timber processing.\n—\nPrinciple VI: Compliance with regulations on customs procedures for export.\n—\nPrinciple VII: Compliance with regulations on tax and employees.\n2.   Households\n—\nPrinciple I: Harvesting of domestic timber complies with regulations on land use rights, forest use rights, management, environment and society.\n—\nPrinciple II: Compliance with regulations on handling confiscated timber.\n—\nPrinciple III: Compliance with regulations on importing timber.\n—\nPrinciple IV: Compliance with regulations on timber transportation and trade.\n—\nPrinciple V: Compliance with regulations on timber processing.\n—\nPrinciple VI: Compliance with regulations on customs procedures for export.\n—\nPrinciple VII: Compliance with regulations on tax.\nThe LD for Organisations and the LD for Households consist of seven principles; however, under some principles the number of criteria, indicators and verifiers varies. In general, some of the regulations that apply to Households are simpler than those for Organisations. The most significant differences are reflected in Principle I, IV and VII, as follows:\n—\nUnder Principle I (Harvesting of domestic timber complies with regulations on land use rights, forest use rights, management, environment and society), both the LD for Organisations and the LD for Households include eight criteria; however, some of the criteria vary between the two categories. The LD for Organisations includes Criterion 1 (Compliance with regulations on main harvesting of natural forest timber), but that Criterion is not applicable to Households. The LD for Households includes Criterion 7 (Compliance with regulations on harvesting timber from plantations in home gardens, farms and dispersed trees), but that Criterion is not applicable to Organisations (described further below).\n—\nUnder Principle IV (Compliance with regulations on timber transportation and trade), the LD for Organisations includes 10 criteria and the LD for Households includes seven criteria. The additional criteria under the LD for Organisations, which are not applicable to Households, relate to compliance with regulations on business registration, and internal transportation of timber and timber products within a province and between provinces.\n—\nUnder Principle VII, the LD for Organisations covers compliance with regulations on tax and employees (three criteria), while the LD for Households covers compliance with taxation regulations (one criterion). This reflects difference in the regulations on labour applied to Households as compared to Organisations.\nIn the LD and under the VNTLAS, there is a distinction between static and dynamic verifiers as defined in Section 4.1 of Annex V. Static verifiers (denoted “S” in the LD matrix) relate to the establishment and operations of Organisations and Households, including but not limited to verifiers such as business registration, forest land use rights, taxation and environmental and labour regulation. Dynamic verifiers (denoted “D” in the LD matrix) relate to batches of timber in the supply chain, including but not limited to verifiers such as timber packing lists and sales invoices, included in the timber product dossier at each stage of the supply chain.\nEXPLANATION OF ELEMENTS OF THE LEGALITY DEFINITION\n1.   Explanation of verifiers for land use rights and forest use rights\nThe Government of Viet Nam aims to ensure that conducive conditions are created whereby domestic timber growers can produce and sell their products. The LD therefore sets out a comprehensive and inclusive framework of verifiers on land use rights and forest use rights as described under Principle I. The number of verifiers varies according to the category of user (Organisations or Households) and the category of forest (criterion). In order to determine legal land use rights, Organisations and Households only need one of the verifiers which are specified in Principle I of the LD.\nThe main reason for including several verifiers for land use rights and forest use rights is the evolution of the land policy of Viet Nam in different periods. Verifiers on land use rights and forest use rights introduced under previous regulations may still be valid according to the Land Law of 2013.\nLand use rights certificates (red book certificates) were first introduced through the Land Law of 1993. Since 1993, the issuance of land use rights certificates has been progressively extended to all land users and all categories of land throughout the country. That process is still underway and there are some circumstances in which legal forest land users have not yet been granted land use rights certificates. In this situation, a number of alternative verifiers may apply and can be used to demonstrate legal land use rights and legal forest use rights. Such alternative verifiers include: decisions on land allocation; decisions on forest allocation; decisions on forest land allocation; decisions on forest allocation combined with land allocation; decisions on land leasing; decisions on contracting forest land; forest registration books; and written confirmation from the Commune People’s Committee.\nAccording to the Land Law of 2013, in cases where Households do not have land use rights certificates, or any other documentary evidence of land use rights, certification by the Commune People’s Committee that the land is currently used and is not subject to any dispute can be used as a verifier of legal land use.\n2.   Harvesting timber from home gardens, farms and dispersed trees\nThe LD for Households does not include verifiers that regulate land use rights for trees harvested from home gardens, farms and dispersed trees, because those trees do not meet criteria of concentrated plantation forests, or are planted in areas that cannot be granted land use rights certificates, such as roadsides or canal banks.\nWhen there is a need for harvesting, households submit, before exploitation, a report on the harvesting location, species and volume of timber harvested from their home gardens, farms and dispersed trees to the Commune People’s Committee for monitoring and controlling. After exploitation, households prepare and self-certify their timber packing list.\n3.   Compliance with regulations on export\nThe procedure for FLEGT licensing for shipments of timber for export to markets of the Union takes place before customs procedures for export, as described in Annex IV. Therefore, Principle VI is used to classify Organisations under the Organisations Classification System (OCS) as specified in Annex V.\n4.   Definitions\nIn the context of this Agreement, the following terms are understood as follows:\nPrinciple\nA principle is an area of Vietnamese law and legislation that Organisations and Households have to comply with at each stage of the supply chain as indicated in this Annex and Annex V.\nCriterion\nA criterion is a legal requirement for Organisations and Households to implement in order to assure compliance with a principle.\nIndicator\nAn indicator is a specific measure, or set of measures, that Organisations and Households have to comply with to fulfil a criterion.\nVerifier\nA verifier is a piece of evidence to prove the fulfilment of an indicator and criterion.\nForest owner (forest title holder)\nForest owner refers to Organisations or Households that are assigned or leased forest land or forest by the Government for forestry-related production or business in accordance with the Law on Forest Protection and Development of 2004.\nHarvesting design statement\nThe harvesting design statement is a document describing the basic situation of the harvesting area, harvesting techniques, harvesting and salvage volume, and categories and detailed tables on forest harvesting technical standards.\nDesign unit\nA design unit is an entity authorised by a competent agency with the mandate to design forest harvesting operations.\nMain harvesting\nMain harvesting of timber of natural forests refers to the logging of timber for economic purposes while ensuring the stable development and use of forest determined in the scheme for sustainable forest management in accordance with the current regulations of Viet Nam. Main harvesting in natural forests is not applied to Households.\nTree marking list\nThe tree marking list is a document recording the name and size of the trees that can be felled in the harvesting design area.\nReport on harvesting location and volume of harvested timber products\nThe report on harvesting location and volume of harvested timber products lists information on the harvested area and the harvested volume according to different categories of domestic timber source, including natural forest, planted forest, rubber wood and scattered trees.\nForest product packing list (“packing list”)\nThe forest product packing list is a mandatory document in the timber product dossier at each stage of the timber supply chain from the point of harvest or import to the point of export, including timber trade, entry and exit of each processing or storage sites, or transportation by one vehicle. A packing list is subject to check and verification/approval at each stage by the relevant entities.\nThe packing list for forest products in circulation includes information on the name and type of timber products, unit of measurement, form of the forest products, quantity and volume of forest products at the end of each page indicating the total quantity.\nList of anticipated timber to be harvested\nThe list of anticipated timber to be harvested includes information on the location, species and quantity (volume and diameter) of products to be harvested.\nEntry and exit books\nEntry and exit books are used to record the entry to and exit from the facilities of forest products of the harvesting, processing and trading Organisations.\nUnprocessed timber products\nUnprocessed timber products are those not impacted by tools or equipment of any kind after being harvested, imported and handled (if confiscated) and still in their original shape and parameters.\nSalvage harvesting and salvage collection\nSalvage harvesting of timber means the harvesting of timber during the implementation of silvicultural measures, scientific research and site clearance for projects involving conversion of forest use purposes.\nSalvage collection of timber means the collection of fallen or dead trees due to natural disaster; burnt, rotten or dry timber; and branches of timber remaining in forests.\nLegal timber product dossier (“timber product dossier”)\nThe legal timber product dossier is a set of records related to timber products which are prepared, stored in the timber-product-producing and -trading Organisations and Households and circulated together with timber products in the process of harvesting, trading, transporting, processing, storing and exporting.\nProduction forest\nProduction forests are forests used mainly for the production and sale of timber and non-timber forest products, in combination with environmental protection.\nProtection forest\nProtection forests are forests used mainly for the protection of water sources and soil, the prevention of erosion and desertification, the restriction of natural disasters, climate regulation and environmental protection.\nSpecial-use forest\nSpecial-use forests are forests used mainly for nature conservation, the preservation of standard specimens of the national ecosystems and forest biological gene sources, scientific research, the protection of historical and cultural relics and landscape preservation for recreation and tourism purposes, in combination with environmental protection.\nAPPENDIX 1A\nLEGALITY DEFINITION FOR ORGANISATIONS\nPRINCIPLE I: HARVESTING OF DOMESTIC TIMBER COMPLIES WITH REGULATIONS ON LAND USE RIGHTS, FOREST USE RIGHTS, MANAGEMENT, ENVIRONMENT AND SOCIETY (ORGANISATIONS)\nCriterion\nIndicators\nVerifiers\nType of verifier\nS=static\nD=dynamic\nLegal references for verifiers\nCriterion 1: Compliance with regulations on main harvesting of natural forest timber\nIndicator 1.1: Compliance with legal regulations on land use right and forest use right – one of the following documents is required:\n1.1.1.\nDecision on land allocation (prior to 15/10/1993);\nS\nNo specific legislation prior to 1993 on land allocation\n1.1.2.\nDecision on forest allocation (from 15/10/1993 to 1/7/2004);\nS\nArticles 5, 13 and 14, Decree No. 02.

INTRODUCTION\nThe Viet Nam Timber Legality Assurance System (“VNTLAS”) aims to ensure that timber and timber products as described in Annex I (hereinafter referred to as “timber”) are legal. Timber exported to the European Union (hereinafter referred to as “the Union”) are subject to specific provisions for FLEGT licensing as described in Annex IV.\nThe VNTLAS is based on regulations relevant to each step of the timber supply chain, including harvesting, import, transportation, processing, trade and exports of timber.\nThe VNTLAS is based on the national legislation in force, together with regulations introduced to implement this Agreement, which includes the participation of ministries, sectors, localities, and private-sector and civil-society organisations relevant to forestry and the trade of timber.\nThe VNTLAS consists of seven system elements, as follows:\n1.\nTimber Legality Definition (LD): Organisations and Households;\n2.\nDevelopment, verification and approval of verifiers at all stages of supply chains;\n3.\nOrganisation Classification System (OCS) and risk-based verification;\n4.\nSupply chain control;\n5.\nFLEGT licensing;\n6.\nInternal inspection, complaints and feedback mechanisms;\n7.\nIndependent evaluation.\nThis Annex describes the key content of the aforementioned system elements and how, in principle, the VNTLAS shall work in practice. Other Annexes and Appendices to this Annex also provide additional information on the system functionalities.\nThis Annex has the following Appendices:\n—\nAppendix 1A (Development, verification and approval of legality verifiers for Organisations);\n—\nAppendix 1B (Development, verification and approval of legality verifiers for Households)\n—\nAppendix 2 (Supply chain control);\n—\nAppendix 3 (Standard form for self-declaration of imported timber sources).\n2.   SCOPE OF APPLICATION\n2.1   Timber sources\n2.1.1   Timber sources controlled by the VNTLAS\nThe following timber sources are controlled by the VNTLAS:\n—\nTimber from domestic natural forests – defined as timber from main harvesting, salvage harvesting and salvage collection from domestic natural forest as defined and regulated by law.\n—\nTimber from domestic concentrated plantation forests – defined as timber from main harvesting, salvage harvesting and salvage collection from concentrated plantation forests, including both planted protection forest and planted production forest, having an area of 0.5 hectares or more and a forest strip of at least 20 metres long and three tree rows or more.\n—\nTimber from home gardens, farms and dispersed trees – defined as timber exploited from trees outside planned areas for forest land and concentrated plantations, including trees around the house and garden, on roadsides, embankments and field-sides, and around temples and pagodas.\n—\nRubber wood – defined as rubber wood from harvesting from domestic rubber plantations on both agriculture and forest land.\n—\nConfiscated timber – defined as timber impounded as a result of either administrative violations or criminal violations, which is handled as state assets by the Vietnamese competent authorities and thereafter put under auction as required by law.\n—\nImported timber – defined as all timber, including rubber wood, brought into the territory of Viet Nam from foreign countries, or to special zones in the territory of Viet Nam which are regarded as exclusive customs zones, in accordance with provisions of the law. In the VNTLAS, a distinction is made between primary and complex timber products impacting on the requirement for documentation to be provided to demonstrate the legality of imported timber. Primary products include both logs and sawn timber under the HS codes 4403, 4406 and 4407. Complex products include timber products under all the other HS codes of Chapter 44 and Chapter 94.\nDetails on the verification of timber sources entering the VNTLAS are given in Section 6.3.\n2.1.2   Timber in transit\nTimber in transit is not included in the VNTLAS.\n“Timber products in transit” means any timber products originating from a third country, which enter the territory of Viet Nam under customs control and leave it in the same form whilst retaining their country of origin.\nTransit timber remains segregated from timber entering the VNTLAS supply chain and is under customs supervision from the entry point into Viet Nam until exit from Viet Nam unprocessed in accordance with the laws and regulations of Viet Nam. Transit timber is not subject to VNTLAS legality verification and is not covered by the FLEGT licensing scheme.\n2.2   Scope of control\nThe scope of control of the VNTLAS applies to:\n—\nall timber sources listed in Section 2.1.1;\n—\nall timber product categories listed in Annex I;\n—\nall operators (Organisations and Households) in the timber supply chain.\nAll principles, criteria, indicators and verifiers included in the LD for Organisations and Households are part of the VNTLAS.\nFigure 1 illustrates the relationship between the seven main elements of the VNTLAS.\nThe VNTLAS is a national system that applies to (a) all Organisations and Households and (b) all domestic and export timber markets, to which the following system elements apply:\n1.\nTimber Legality Definition, as specified in Section 3 of this Annex and in Annex II;\n2.\nDevelopment, verification and approval of verifiers at all stages of supply chains, as specified in Section 4 of this Annex;\n3.\nOrganisation Classification System (OCS) and risk-based verification, as specified in Section 5 of this Annex;\n4.\nSupply chain control, as specified in Sections 6 and 7 of this Annex and Appendix 2 thereto;\n5.\nFLEGT licensing, as specified in Section 8 of this Annex and in Annex IV;\n6.\nInternal inspection, complaints and feedback mechanisms, as specified in Section 9;\n7.\nIndependent evaluation, as specified in Section 10 of this Annex and in Annex VI.\nSystem element 5 applies to timber exports to the Union market only.\nSystem elements 6 and 7 cover all stages of supply chains up to and including the point of FLEGT licensing (system elements 1 to 5).\nText of image\nFigure 1. Elements of the VNTLAS\nNational system applied to all domestic and export markets\nMeasures applied to the EU market\n(1) Timber Legality Definition (LD): Organisations and Households\n(2) Development, verification and approval of verifiers at all stages of supply chains\n(3) Organisation Classification System (OCS) and risk-based verification\n(4) Supply chain control\n(5) FLEGT licensing\n(6) Internal inspection, complaintsand feedback mechanisms\n(7) Independent evaluation\n2.2.1   Definition of Organisations and Households\nOrganisations subject to the VNTLAS include forestry companies, state forest enterprises, protection forest management boards, special-use forest management boards, and cooperatives and enterprises involved at any stage of the supply chain and that have business registration.\nHouseholds subject to the VNTLAS include domestic households, individuals, village communities and all other entities not belonging to the Organisations category above. Household businesses employing more than 10 labourers on a regular basis are required to register as enterprises and are considered to be Organisations in the application of the VNTLAS.\n2.2.2   Definition of government agencies\nIn the context of this Agreement, government agencies include several ministries and sectors at central level, technical departments under the Provincial and District Peoples Committee and Commune People’s Committees which are involved in the implementation of the VNTLAS, as identified in Appendices 1A and 1B to this Annex and summarised in Table 1.\n2.2.3   Definition of the Verification Authority and verification entities\nIn the context of this Agreement, the Verification Authority comprises the Forest Protection agencies at all levels, namely the Central Forest Protection Department (Central FPD) under the Viet Nam Administration of Forestry (VNFOREST) under the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (MARD), and the Provincial Forest Protection Department (Provincial FPD), including provincial and district offices of the FPD (hereinafter referred to as the “local FPD”).\nVerification entities are government agencies and local government authorities, or other units, agencies or individuals in accordance with government regulation, that have responsibility for the development, verification and approval of verifiers under their area of jurisdiction as identified in Appendices 1A and 1B to this Annex and summarised in Table 1.\n2.3   Recognition by the VNTLAS of voluntary certification and national certification schemes\nA voluntary certification scheme is a market-based non-regulatory mechanism subject to third-party evaluation.\nA national certification scheme is a voluntary or regulatory mechanism based on a defined set of criteria subject to government assessment and monitoring.\nRecognised voluntary certification and national certification schemes are taken into account as a supplementary verifier for the risk-based verification of timber imports as specified in Section 6.3.7. Imported timber with a FLEGT licence or CITES permit are automatically recognised as legal as specified in Section 6.3.7.\nViet Nam shall assess voluntary certification and national certification schemes in accordance with VNTLAS requirements and decide on a list of certification schemes, which shall be shared with the Joint Implementation Committee (JIC) for information.\nThe assessment of voluntary certification and national certification schemes shall be conducted on the basis of a methodology approved by both parties in the JIC and the methodology shall be ready before the joint assessment of the VNTLAS (Annex VII). The list of recognised schemes may also be re-assessed, updated and brought to the attention of the JIC during implementation.\n3.   LEGALITY DEFINITION\nThe Legality Definition (LD) sets out the core requirements of legislation applicable to timber in Viet Nam as presented in Annex II.\nThe LD is based on existing laws and legislation in place and has been developed through consultation with government, private-sector and civil-society stakeholders in Viet Nam.\nAfter ratification of this Agreement, Viet Nam shall notify the Union of any changes pertaining to verifiers or legal references in the LD through the JIC, and the JIC shall examine the extent of the changes and the impacts on the LD at least every second year during the implementation of this Agreement as specified in Annex IX.\nViet Nam shall make public all relevant legislation referred to in the LD and any amendments thereto, as specified in Annex VIII.\n3.1   Structure and content of the Legality Definition\nThe LD is divided into two parts: one for Organisations and one for Households, in order to cater for: (i) differences in the regulations that apply to these two target groups; (ii) differences in the size of investment and the scope and arrangement of their activities; and (iii) assuring compatibility of the LD for these two groups and making the VNTLAS clear, specific and implementable.\nThe differences between the LD for Organisations and the LD for Households are specified further in the introduction to Annex II.\nEach part of the LD consists of seven principles, with each principle divided into criteria, indicators and verifiers:\n—\nPrinciple I: Harvesting of domestic timber complies with regulations on land use rights, forest use rights, management, environment and society;\n—\nPrinciple II: Compliance with regulations on handling confiscated timber;\n—\nPrinciple III: Compliance with regulations on importing timber;\n—\nPrinciple IV: Compliance with regulations on timber transportation and trade;\n—\nPrinciple V: Compliance with regulations on timber processing;\n—\nPrinciple VI: Compliance with regulations on customs procedures for export;\n—\nPrinciple VII (Organisations): Compliance with regulations on tax and employees;\n—\nPrinciple VII (Households): Compliance with regulations on tax.\nTo comply with the LD, Organisations and Households shall comply with all the applicable indicators under the seven principles enforced by the Verification Authority and verification entities as defined under Section 2.2.3 and Table 1.\nThe compliance of the indicators is assessed on the basis of the applicable corresponding verifiers.\nFor an indicator to be compliant, all the relevant verifiers must be checked and conform.\nTable 1.

DEVELOPMENT, VERIFICATION AND APPROVAL OF VERIFIERS AT ALL STAGES OF THE SUPPLY CHAIN\n4.1   Definition of verifiers\nVerifiers are documents referred to in Annex II that are used for Organisations and Households to demonstrate legal compliance with the corresponding indicator. For clarifying verification methodologies applied under the VNTLAS, a distinction is made between “static” and “dynamic” verifiers, as identified for each verifier in Annex II.\n4.1.1   Static verifiers\nStatic verifiers, as referred to in the LD, are used to verify the legal compliance of the establishment and operations of Organisations and Households in timber harvesting, processing, transportation and trade.\nStatic verifiers:\n—\nare developed and approved on a one-time basis and may be renewed on a periodic basis;\n—\nare verified and approved by the verification entities for each verifier on a periodic basis as required by law;\n—\nare used as a criterion as a part of the regular OCS assessment;\n—\nare made available if needed to support the exercise of ensuring the accuracy of the information and the legality of all timber when sourcing timber domestically;\n—\ninclude but are not limited to verifiers such as business registration, forest land use rights, and tax, labour and environment regulations.\n4.1.2   Dynamic verifiers\nDynamic verifiers, as referred to in the LD, are used to verify the legal compliance of timber origin and timber in circulation at each stage of the supply chain. Dynamic verifiers are assessed by the Verification Authority and other responsible verification entities through the regular and frequent control process in the timber supply chain and in the OCS assessment for Organisations.\nDynamic verifiers:\n—\nare developed and approved to demonstrate the legal compliance of individual batches of timber;\n—\nare made available if needed to support the exercise of due diligence and are used to verify the legality of individual batches of timber in the VNTLAS supply chain;\n—\ninclude but are not limited to verifiers such as timber packing lists and invoices as regulated by Ministry of Finance for Organisations which are included in the timber product dossier at each critical control point in the supply chain;\n—\nare (i) verified and approved by the Verification Authority and other responsible verification entities based on frequency in accordance with the regulations applicable for each verifier and (ii) assessed systematically as part of (a) the OCS, (b) the supply chain controls and (c) verification for export.\nThe static and dynamic verifiers as identified in Annex II may be modified, supplemented or replaced. Annex II shall be updated and supplemented in accordance with Article 24 of this Agreement.\n4.2   Development of verifiers\nThe development of verifiers is the preparation of a document or dossier of documents by Organisations and Households, or by verification entities, in accordance with Vietnamese laws and regulations as set out in Annex II and in Appendices 1A and 1B to this Annex.\nIn accordance with the legal requirements set out in Annex II, verifiers can be developed by Organisations and Households involved in the timber supply chain or by verification entities for each stage of the timber supply chain.\nThe responsible entities in charge of developing verifiers are defined in the “Prepared by” column of Appendices 1A and 1B to this Annex.\n4.3   Verification and approval/certification of verifiers\nThe verification and approval of verifiers is conducted as described below.\nVerification of verifiers is the process of checking the legality, validity and conformity of verifiers based on documentary and/or physical checks by the verification entities in accordance with regulations as set out in Annex II.\nThe approval of verifiers by verification entities is the recognition of the compliance of each verifier in accordance with regulations as set out in Annex II and in Appendices 1A and 1B to this Annex.\nThe term of certification of verifiers is used for approval of the packing list.\nThe responsible entities in charge of verifying and approving verifiers are defined in the “Approved -certified by” column of Appendices 1A and 1B to this Annex. The responsible entities in charge of checking each verifier are defined in the “Checked by” column of Appendices 1A and 1B to this Annex.\n4.4   Responsibilities of relevant actors\n4.4.1   Responsibilities of Organisations\n1.\nOrganisations shall take responsibility for the accuracy of the information and the legality of all timber sources, including timber from domestic sources. For imported timber, Organisations shall exercise due diligence as specified in Section 6.3.7.\n2.\nOrganisations are responsible for the development, verification and approval of verifiers or requiring verification entities to develop, verify and approve the verifiers for each timber purchase at each point of the supply chain.\n3.\nWhen purchasing timber from any source, Organisations shall check and keep records of the verifiers of legality of the purchased timber.\n4.\nChecks by Organisations entail ascertaining the validity, authenticity and conformity of the timber product dossier, including correlation with the timber, to ensure that the sourced timber is from legal sources. In the case of any suspicion of risk of illegal timber, the Organisations shall not purchase the timber.\n5.\nOrganisations shall assess if the timber supplier conducts the checking and documentation of verifiers for legality of the purchased timber.\nThe appraisal and verification of Organisations in the OCS as specified in Section 5 shall review whether Organisations have adequately checked and documented verifiers of legality of the purchased timber.\n4.4.2   Responsibilities of Households\n1.\nHouseholds shall take responsibility for the accuracy of the information and the legality of all timber sources, including timber from domestic sources. For imported timber, Households shall exercise due diligence as specified in Section 6.3.7.\n2.\nHouseholds shall take responsibility for development, verification and approval of verifiers or requiring verification entities to develop, verify and approve the verifiers for each timber purchase at each point of the supply chain.\n3.\nWhen purchasing timber from any source, Households shall check and keep records of the verifiers of legality of the purchased timber.\n4.\nChecks by Households entail ascertaining the validity, authenticity and conformity of the timber product dossier, including correlation with the timber, to ensure that the sourced timber is from a legal source. In the case of any suspicion of risk of illegal timber, the Households shall not purchase the timber.\n5.\nHouseholds shall assess if the timber supplier conducts the checking and documentation of verifiers for legality of the purchased timber.\n4.4.3   Responsibilities of government agencies\nThe responsibilities of government agencies in the development, verification and approval of verifiers are specified in Appendices 1A and 1B to this Annex and summarised in Table 1.\n5.   ORGANISATION CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM AND RISK-BASED VERIFICATION\n5.1   Purpose of the Organisation Classification System\nThe Organisation Classification System (OCS) is an integral component of the risk-based verification under the VNTLAS.\nThe purpose of the OCS is to:\n(i)\nassess the risk level of all Organisations under the VNTLAS with regard to their compliance with VNTLAS requirements in order to apply appropriate verification measures in an effective, efficient and timely manner;\n(ii)\nassess the legal compliance of Organisations with respect to static and dynamic verifiers as specified in the LD; and\n(iii)\nreduce administrative procedures, facilitate the production and business activities of Organisations and encourage Organisations to comply with the law.\nThe OCS shall apply to all Organisations in the VNTLAS supply chain.\n5.2   Criteria and risk categories\nOrganisations are classified on the basis of the following criteria:\n1.\ncompliance with dynamic / supply chain control verifiers to ensure that only legal timber enters the supply chain (as defined in Section 4.1);\n2.\nfulfilment of supply chain control declaration and reporting requirements (as described in Section 6.5);\n3.\ncompliance with static verifiers (as defined in Section 4.1);\n4.\nrecord of violations (as described in Section 11).\nViet Nam shall consider how voluntary certification schemes, voluntary due diligence and chain-of-custody systems recognised under the VNTLAS can be integrated into the OCS methodology.\nOn the basis of these criteria, Organisations are classified into two risk categories:\n—\nCategory 1 (compliant): Organisations that meet the criteria;\n—\nCategory 2 (non-compliant): Organisations that do not fully meet the criteria or newly established Organisations.\nThe application of the criteria to the two risk categories is explained in Table 2.\nTable 2. Minimum criteria and risk categories in the OCS\nCriteria\nOrganisations Risk Category and minimum criteria for acceptance\nCategory 1\nCategory 2\n1.\nCompliance with dynamic / supply chain control verifiers to ensure that only legal timber enters the supply chain\nFully compliant\nAny non-compliance\n2.\nFulfilment of supply chain declaration and reporting requirements\nFully compliant\nFailure to submit declarations and reports in accordance with legal requirement\n3.\nCompliance with static verifiers\nFully compliant\nNon-compliance\n4.\nRecord of violations and sanctions\nNo record of violations and sanctions\nAny record of violations and sanctions\n5.\nOther criteria\nNewly established Organisations\n5.3   Implementation of the Organisation Classification System\nThe OCS shall be operated on a continuous basis through self-assessment by Organisations and appraisal and verification by the Provincial FPD or other entities authorised by the Government.\nThe Government of Viet Nam shall issue legislation guiding the implementation of the VNTLAS, including the OCS. Regulations, criteria, procedures, frequencies, methodology and responsibilities of relevant actors shall be elaborated in the VNTLAS implementation guidelines.\nThe OCS procedure, methodology and responsibilities are described in Figure 2.\nFigure 2.

On the basis of the OCS risk categories, Organisations shall prepare the corresponding timber product dossier for export, as described in Section 7 of this Annex and in Annex IV.\nThe OCS and the customs risk assessment system are two separate but complementary systems with different data coverage. The customs authority of Viet Nam and the FPD shall regularly exchange information on the respective risk classification of Organisations. Whenever a change in the risk classification of Organisations takes place, this shall be notified between the two agencies and shall be taken into due consideration.\n5.4   Responsibilities of relevant actors\n5.4.1   Responsibilities of Organisations\nAll Organisations in the supply chain are responsible for registering with the OCS and submitting self-assessment in accordance with the specified criteria to the Provincial FPD or other entities authorised by the Government for appraisal.\nOrganisations shall conduct periodic self-reassessment as described in Table 3 and submit the self-reassessment to the Provincial FPD or other entities authorised by the Government for appraisal.\n5.4.2   Responsibilities of government agencies\nThe Government of Viet Nam assigns overall responsibility for the organisation classification system and risk-based verification to the Central FPD and the Provincial FPD.\nThe Central FPD has responsibility for:\n—\npreparing implementation guidelines on the OCS based on regulations issued by the government;\n—\ncreating and managing the centralised Organisations classification and OCS database;\n—\nmanaging the centralised database of violations of the Law on Forest Protection and Development;\n—\ndeciding on the risk-category status of Organisations based on the appraisal results notified by the Provincial FPD or other entities authorised by the government;\n—\npublicising and updating the list of Organisations in each risk category on the FPD website.\nThe Provincial FPD or other entities authorised by the government has responsibility for:\n—\nreceiving the self-assessment of Organisations registering into the system and appraising the self-assessment;\n—\nreassessing the classification status of Organisations as specified in Table 3;\n—\nmonitoring the compliance of Organisations with the classification criteria in a timely manner through documentary and field checks to detect any non-compliance and to propose to the Central FPD any change in the category status of Organisations from Category 1 to Category 2;\n—\nliaising with other provincial government agencies and verification entities to verify the compliance status of Organisations;\n—\nreporting the results of the appraisal to the Central FPD for decision and public announcement by the Central FPD;\n—\nreporting to the Central FPD any cases of non-compliance by Organisations in the assessment period, which shall be managed and maintained in the Organisation classification and OCS database by the Central FPD.\n6.   SUPPLY CHAIN CONTROL\n6.1   Overview\nSupply chain control aims to prevent the entrance of illegal timber or unverified timber into the VNTLAS supply chain. To achieve this overarching goal, the supply chain control system ensures that:\n(a)\nall Organisations involved in any stages of the timber supply chain are registered in the OCS;\n(b)\nall Organisations in the timber supply chain registered in the OCS report to the Forest Protection agencies in accordance with legal requirements;\n(c)\nsupply chain reports are compiled and reconciled by Forest Protection agencies to identify any suspicious timber flow;\n(d)\nsystematic, random and ad hoc physical checks by the Forest Protection agencies ensure that timber is consistent with the content of the corresponding documentation as declared by Organisations and Households, including in terms of (i) number of items, (ii) volume, and (iii) class of timber and/or species, at all stages of the supply chain;\n(e)\nidentified suspicious timber flows are investigated by the Forest Protection agencies;\n(f)\nsupply chain control is based on the documents required in the timber product dossier at each stage of the supply chain, as specified in Appendix 2;\n(g)\nCompliance with supply chain control verifiers and supply chain reporting requirements are criteria under the OCS as specified in Section 5 and Table 2.\nAppendix 2 specifies requirements for reliable management of information associated with the timber product dossier at the different critical points of the supply chain.\n6.2   Critical control points in the VNTLAS supply chain\nCritical control points in the VNTLAS supply chain relate to\n(i)\nthe verification of timber sources entering the VNTLAS (as described in Section 6.3); and\n(ii)\nstages in the supply chain from the point of harvest or import to the point of export.\nThe six critical control points in the supply chain under the VNTLAS are as follows:\n1.\nTimber sources entering the VNTLAS:\n1a.\nTimber from main harvesting of domestic natural forest (Organisations);\n1b.\nTimber from salvage harvesting and salvage collection of domestic natural forest (Organisations and Households);\n1c.\nTimber from main harvesting, salvage harvesting and salvage collection of planted protection forests (Organisations and Households);\n1d.\nTimber from main harvesting, salvage harvesting and salvage collection of planted production forests (Organisations and Households);\n1e(1).\nRubber wood (Organisations);\n1e(2).\nRubber wood; timber from home gardens, farms and dispersed trees (Households);\n1f.\nHandled confiscated timber (Organisations and Households);\n1g.\nImported timber (Organisations and Households).\n2.\nFirst transport and trade transaction of timber products.\n3.\nSecond transport and trade transaction of timber products.\n4.\nAny subsequent transportation and trade of products.\n5.\nProcessing site.\n6.\nExport.\n6.3   Verification of timber sources entering the VNTLAS\nAs specified under Section 2.1, all timber entering the VNTLAS is subject to specific regulations pertaining to the specific sources of timber. The verifiers for these timber sources entering the VNTLAS are specified in the LD and in Appendices 1A and 1B to this Annex.\nCritical control points are established within the VNTLAS for all timber sources entering the system, as described in Section 6.2 and in Appendix 2.\nAppendix 2 provides a detailed list of documents to be archived by Organisations and Households and the local FPD at each critical control point of the supply chain. Organisations should make those documents available to the Provincial FPD or other entities authorised by the Government during the OCS appraisal.\n6.3.1   Timber from main harvesting of domestic natural forest (critical control point 1a)\nViet Nam maintains strict control over the management and harvesting of timber from domestic natural forest. Timber from main harvesting from domestic natural forest entering the VNTLAS is required to come from forest with approved Sustainable Forest Management Plans in addition to other specific environmental and supply chain controls as described under Criterion 1 of Principle I in Annex II (Organisations).\n6.3.2   Timber from planted production and protection forests (critical control points 1c and 1d)\nThe policy of the Government of Viet Nam is to encourage the development of plantation forest, in support of which favourable conditions are applied for timber growers (Organisations and Households) as from the decision of land allocation or leasing and encompassing the time of planting, harvesting, transportation and trade of timber.\nLegal requirements apply to timber from concentrated plantations depending on different forest categories, including planted protection forests and planted production forests, as specified in Criteria 2 and 3 of Principle I in Annex II (Organisations and Households).\n6.3.3   Timber from salvage harvesting and salvage collection (critical control points 1b, 1c and 1d)\nSalvage harvesting from natural forest when converting land use from forest use into other uses requires measures on compensation for site clearance approved by the Vietnamese competent authority. Criterion 4 under Principle I in Annex II (Organisations and Households) regulates the legal basis for the decision on land use change, the approval of measures on compensation for site clearance, and the approval of the environmental impact assessment.\nSalvage timber may come from salvage harvesting and salvage collection from natural forest or concentrated plantation forest.\nSalvage harvesting of timber means the harvesting of timber during the implementation of silvicultural measures, scientific research and site clearance of projects upon conversion of forest use purposes. Salvage collection of timber means the collection of fallen or dead trees due to natural disaster; burnt, rotten or dry timber; and branches of timber remaining in forests.\nRegulations for salvage harvesting and collection are specified in Criteria 2 to 7 of Principle I in Annex II (Organisations and Households), including the following:\n—\nCriteria 2 and 3: Compliance with regulations on salvage harvesting and salvage collection from planted protection forest and planted production forests.\n—\nCriterion 4: Compliance with regulations on salvaging harvesting of natural forested areas converted from forest land use to other land uses.\n—\nCriterion 5: Compliance with regulations on salvage harvesting of natural forest while implementing silvicultural measures, scientific research and training.\n—\nCriterion 6: Compliance with regulations on salvage collection of stumps, roots, branches in natural forests.\n—\nCriterion 7: Compliance with regulations on salvage collection of stumps, roots, branches in plantation forests.\n6.3.4   Timber from home gardens, farms and dispersed trees (critical control point 1e(2))\nVNTLAS requirements related to the harvesting of timber from home gardens, farms and dispersed trees only apply to Households, and are specified in Criterion 7 under Principle I in Annex II (Households). The harvesting of timber from this source is described in Annex II.\n6.3.5   Rubber wood from domestic sources (critical control points 1e(1) and 1e(2))\nRubber trees in Viet Nam are considered to be a multi-purpose industrial crop and are planted and harvested from both agricultural and forest land. For rubber wood and products manufactured from rubber wood that are harvested from any domestic sources entering the VNTLAS, it is necessary to present a timber product dossier that demonstrates legal origin, in line with the requirements set out under Principle I in Annex II (Criterion 8 for Organisations and Criterion 8 for Households).\nImported rubber wood is considered to be imported timber and is subject to the provisions of Section 6.3.7.\n6.3.6   Handled confiscated timber (critical control point 1f)\nConfiscated timber, as a State asset, is handled and managed in accordance with the law and regulations of Viet Nam. Handled confiscated timber is allowed to enter the VNTLAS supply chain and is eligible for FLEGT licensing on the condition that the steps for handling confiscated timber described below have been followed.\n—\nStep 1: Decisions on handling the administrative violations or handling the evidence of violation by State agencies with jurisdiction for confiscation of violated forest products, together with written minutes of treating the violation and a list of confiscated products.\n—\nStep 2. Preparation by local forest rangers of a list of the confiscated forest products (with hammer marks for round timber with diameter of ≥ 25 cm and length ≥ 1 m).\n—\nStep 3: Establishment of asset-valuation council to determine the starting price for auction of confiscated evidence/assets, with the starting price complying with provisions of the law on the enforcement of civil judgments.\n—\nStep 4: Contract for asset auction: authorisation of asset auction by the professional auction centre or auction business (for material evidence of administrative violations authorised by central or provincial authorities); or authorisation of asset auction by the district council (for material evidence of administrative violations authorised by the district authorities).\n—\nStep 5. Publicisation of the auction event.\n—\nStep 6. Registration of auction participants.\n—\nStep 7. Organisation of the auction.\n—\nStep 8. Contract for the purchase of auctioned assets.\n—\nStep 9. Payment for purchase of the assets, delivery of the assets.\n—\nStep 10. Issuance of certificates of ownership of auctioned assets.\nConfiscated timber is legally allowed to enter the VNTLAS and the supply chain on evidence of a contract for the purchase of auctioned assets, a certificate of ownership and utilisation rights of auctioned assets, a VAT Invoice and a packing list of auctioned forest products, as described under Principle II in Annex II (Organisations and Households).\nData on the quantity and type of confiscated timber at (a) the point of confiscation and (b) post-auction are recorded in the FPD database on violations of the Law on Forest Protection and Development as described Section 11 of this Annex, and monitored and checked throughout the supply chain by the Forest Protection Agencies.\n6.3.7   Imported timber (critical control point 1g)\nThe control and management of imported timber to Viet Nam is subject to legislation and regulations described in Principle III in Annex II (Organisations and Households) and the following three risk-based verification filters and measures shall apply:\n1.\nCustoms risk assessment system;\n2.\nSpecies risk categories;\n3.\nRisk associated with geographic origin of timber.\nThe use of the above three filters shall determine:\n(a)\nthe need for additional dossier checks and additional physical checks; and\n(b)\nthe need for additional documentation to demonstrate the legality of imported timber.\nThe procedures for the control and management of timber imported into Viet Nam are shown in Figure 3.\nThe need for additional physical checks and additional documentation to demonstrate the legality of imported timber is specified in Table 4.\nOne of the following three alternative ways to demonstrate the legality of imported timber is required:\n1.\na valid FLEGT licence or equivalent export licence covering the entire shipment from an exporting country which has concluded a VPA with the Union and has an operational FLEGT licensing system in place;\n2.\na valid CITES permit covering the entire shipment; or\n3.\na self-declaration demonstrating due diligence and additional documentation in accordance with the risk-category status of the imported timber as specified in Table 4.\nThe controls described in this Section apply to all customs declarants including Organisations and individuals as defined by Viet Nam customs regulations, and Organisations and Households as defined under the VNTLAS.\n6.3.7.1   Due diligence and self-declaration requirements for importers\nIn addition to the verification activities carried out by verification entities, importers shall take responsibility for the legality of imported timber in accordance with the relevant legislation of the country of harvest. For this purpose, they shall exercise due diligence over the legal origin of imported timber, which covers collection of information, risk assessment and mitigation of any risk identified. Importers shall be required to obtain information, and additional documentation on the legality of timber in the country of harvest, independent of the type of product (primary or complex) or length of the supply chain.\n“Relevant legislation” means the legislation in force in the country of harvest covering the following matters:\n—\nRights to harvest: granting of rights to harvest timber, including compliance with legislation and procedures on forest land allocation and forest use and land use rights.\n—\nForestry activities: compliance with legal requirements regarding forest management and timber processing, including compliance with relevant environmental and labour legislation.\n—\nTaxation and fees: compliance with legal requirements on taxes, royalties and fees directly related to timber harvesting and timber trade.\n—\nTrade and customs: compliance with legal requirements on trading and customs procedures.\nThe due diligence shall be documented through a self-declaration as specified in the template provided in Appendix 3. The self-declaration shall be required for all imported timber shipments without a CITES permit, or FLEGT licence or equivalent export licence covering the entire shipment from an exporting country which has concluded a VPA with the Union and has an operational FLEGT licensing system in place. The self-declaration shall be submitted together with applicable customs documentation.\nThe self-declaration includes:\n(a)\na description of the shipment;\n(b)\nidentification of potential risk related to the legality of the shipment in accordance with the relevant legislation in the country of harvest;\n(c)\nmitigation measures for any identified potential risk related to the legal origin;\n(d)\na list of any attached additional documentation as evidence of legal origin as indicated in Table 4.\nWhen required, additional documentation to be included in the self-declaration shall consist of at least one of the three following elements:\n1.\nvoluntary certification or national certification schemes recognised by the VNTLAS;\n2.\nthe harvesting document in accordance with the legislation of the country of harvest corresponding to the imported shipment for primary products;\n3.\nalternative additional documentation demonstrating the legality of the timber in accordance with the legislation of the country of harvest, where the harvesting document is not required for primary products in the country of harvest, or where the importers cannot obtain the harvesting document for complex products.\nRegarding the alternative additional documentation requirements, Viet Nam shall develop specific implementation guidelines to implement this Agreement.\nOn suspicion of risk, the verification entities shall carry out additional checks on the legality of the imported shipment. The importer may use the information from due diligence to demonstrate the legality of the imported shipment.\nViet Nam shall issue legislation requiring importers to conduct due diligence as indicated in this Section. In the event of non-compliance with such legislation, adequate, proportionate and dissuasive administrative or criminal sanctions shall be imposed in accordance with the applicable legislation of Viet Nam.\n6.3.7.2   Handling of violations\nIn the case of detection of illegal timber imports by the customs authority or any other agencies, the relevant Vietnamese competent authority under its area of jurisdiction or in coordination with law enforcement agencies shall handle the violation, including the rejection or seizure of the shipment in line with the laws and regulations of Viet Nam.\nIn the case of detection of illegal timber imports, the agency which has detected the illegal timber imported shall coordinate with other relevant agencies and shall notify the FPD of the detected violation. The FPD shall update the database on violations of the Law on Forest Protection and Development in accordance with Section 11.2.1 of this Annex.\n6.3.7.3   Customs risk assessment system\nIn accordance with the applicable customs legislation of Viet Nam, the classification of levels of risk incurred from import and export shall be carried out on the basis of the degree of the customs declarant’s compliance with the law.\nIn the process of risk-level classification, the customs authorities shall consider related factors including but not limited to: the customs declarants’ compliance with customs and tax regulations; the frequency, nature and severity of any violations; the nature of the commodities; the origin of imports and exports; the route and mode of transportation; and other factors relating to import and export.\nThe customs authorities shall evaluate and classify risks imposed on customs declarants and import and export shipments according to different levels (red, yellow and green) in order to apply proper measures for customs examination, supervision and inspection.\n—\nRed (high risk): the customs authority shall conduct physical checks at the border gate. All shipments in the red customs category shall be physically checked. The specific percentage of the checking within each shipment is from 5 % to 100 % of the volume of the shipment and depends on the decision by the head of the customs post.\n—\nYellow (medium risk): the customs authority shall conduct dossier checks of the shipment. If necessary, the customs authority shall conduct physical checks of the shipment.\n—\nGreen (no risk): the customs authority shall allow automatic clearance based on the customs declaration. If necessary, the customs authority shall conduct physical checks of the shipment.\nCustoms inspection may be conducted at the border gate or through post-customs clearance procedures according to the level of risk. Post-customs clearance can be applied to import shipments including timber. In line with customs legislation, the customs authority shall apply risk management methods to decide on the scope, contents and method of post-clearance inspection of the imported shipment. Post-clearance inspection of the customs dossiers and goods granted clearance shall be carried out within five years of the registration date of the customs declaration.\nClose coordination is maintained between the customs authorities and Forest Protection agency in the control and check of timber imports, including both border-gate and post-customs clearance checks on a regular/systematic basis and in addressing cases of suspicion of risk.\n6.3.7.4   Species risk categories\nImporters shall be required to declare the species name (including the scientific name and the common name) in the importation process. In case of any doubt on the species declaration, inspection shall be conducted by the competent Vietnamese technical authority to confirm species identification.\nImported timber species shall be classified into two groups – high-risk and low-risk – based on the following criteria:\n—\nHigh-risk species are defined as: those listed in Appendices I, II and III to CITES; critically endangered, precious, and rare species in Group IA and IIA in accordance with the legislation of Viet Nam on controlled timber species; and species illegally traded according to the FPD database of violations of the Law on Forest Protection and Development and the database of the customs authority of Viet Nam.\nThe Joint Implementation Committee (JIC) shall consider additional species which are at risk of being endangered in the country of harvest or illegally traded, as officially proposed by Viet Nam or the Union to the JIC, or based on information from the United Nations Organisation for Drugs and Crimes (UNODC), Interpol, the CITES Secretariat or the World Customs Organization (WCO), for inclusion on the list of high-risk species.\nSpecies which are imported into Viet Nam for the first time shall be considered to be high-risk unless otherwise decided by the JIC.\nComplex timber products that combine both high-risk and low-risk species shall be treated as high-risk.\n—\nLow-risk species are defined as those not belonging to the above category.\nThe applied criteria and methodology shall result in a list of high-risk species that shall be reviewed, supplemented and adjusted during the implementation of this Agreement and decided by the JIC during its meetings.\nBased on the decision of the JIC, the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development shall issue legislation presenting the list of high-risk species. That legislation shall be updated periodically as required in accordance with the decision of the JIC. The customs authorities shall take into account that legislation to change their procedures regarding the obligation of importers to provide additional documentation for timber import as defined in Table 4.\n6.3.7.5   Risk associated with geographic origin of imported timber\nInformation on legal requirements for timber export in the country of origin shall be taken into account in the risk-based approach to assess the legal origin of imported timber.\nThe risk associated with geographic origin of imported timber shall be considered in the control and management of timber imported into Viet Nam.\nA country shall be considered low-risk if:\n(a)\nit has an operative timber legality assurance system in place for issuing FLEGT licences; or\n(b)\nit has a binding national regulatory framework on due diligence for timber legality covering the whole supply chain up to the country of harvest, recognised by Viet Nam as meeting the VNTLAS criteria; or\n(c)\nthe indicator for effectiveness of government according to the World Bank Worldwide Governance Indicators (WGIs) is 0 or above, a regulatory system for CITES implementation is rated I-level as announced by the CITES Secretariat, and one of the two following conditions is met:\n(i)\nViet Nam has a bilateral agreement on timber legality with that country, recognised by Viet Nam as meeting the VNTLAS criteria, and that agreement has been published, or\n(ii)\nthat country has a national regulatory timber certification scheme recognised by Viet Nam as meeting the VNTLAS criteria.\nThe applied criteria and methodology shall result in a list of low-risk countries and territories that shall be reviewed, supplemented and adjusted during the implementation of this Agreement and brought to the attention of the JIC during its meetings.\nThe Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development shall issue legislation presenting the list of low-risk countries. That legislation shall be updated periodically as required in accordance with the decision of the JIC. The customs authorities shall take into account this legislation to change their procedures regarding the obligations of importers to provide additional documentation for timber import as defined in Table 4.\n6.3.7.6   Risk-based control and management of imported timber\nIn accordance with the criteria for risk management described above, timber imported into Viet Nam is controlled and managed by the customs authorities as described in Figure 3.\nThe customs authorities shall carry out systematic documentary checks for imported timber on the basis of the applicable customs documentation, and:\n(a)\na self-declaration, including any relevant additional documentation, or\n(b)\na valid CITES permit, or\n(c)\na valid FLEGT licence.\nThe risk-based control and management of timber imports to Viet Nam is set out in Table 4.\nTable 4.

Verification of timber at those stages in the supply chain can include:\n—\nchecking and certification of the timber product dossier in accordance with Appendices 1A and 1B to this Annex;\n—\nverification of information in input and output monitoring books of Organisations in accordance with Appendices 1A and 1B to this Annex;\n—\nsystematic, random and ad hoc physical inspections in accordance with Section 6.6.2;\n—\nreview of the archived documents of Organisations during OCS appraisal in accordance with Section 5.3;\n—\nreview of the checks and documenting of verifiers of legality of purchased timber as conducted by Organisations in accordance with Section 4.4.1.\n6.5   Supply chain reporting requirements\nAll Organisations are responsible for submitting regular reports on supply chain in line with legal requirements, as follows:\n(a)\nOrganisations involved in timber harvesting must submit monthly reports to the Forest Protection Agency;\n(b)\nOrganisations involved in timber processing and trade must submit quarterly reports to the Forest Protection Agency.\n(c)\nOrganisations involved in the supply chain must maintain input and output monitoring books, the information from which is aggregated on monthly basis.\nRequirements for the composition and archiving of the timber product dossier at critical control points in supply chain are specified in Appendix 2.\nConsolidated reports are developed by Forest Protection agency at all levels according to periodicity defined by current regulations and the reconciliation requirements in Section 6.6.2.\nFurther details on the management and storage of supply chain information are set out in Section 12.\n6.6   Responsibilities of relevant actors\n6.6.1   Responsibilities of Organisations and Households\nOrganisations and Households shall take responsibility when sourcing timber to ensure that only legal timber enters the supply chain, including when sourcing timber domestically, and shall exercise due diligence when sourcing imported timber, as specified in Section 4.4.\nOrganisations and Households are responsible for documenting and reporting timber inputs and outputs, complying with reporting requirements to the relevant government agencies as stipulated by the legislation and regulations, in order to allow for volume-based reconciliation and identification of suspicious timber flows as stipulated in Section 6.6.2. Those responsibilities are specified in Appendix 2.\n6.6.2   Responsibilities of government agencies\nThe timber supply chain control system is conducted by a number of government agencies, of which the local Forest Protection Agencies have the main responsibility for conducting checks at each stage of the supply chain and archiving documents, as specified in Appendix 2.\nThe responsibility of Forest Protection Agencies for supply chain control includes:\n(a)\nreception, entry and archiving of supply chain declarations by Organisations and Households;\n(b)\nsystematic, random and ad hoc physical inspections, in particular on the basis of the analyses of supply chain data;\n(c)\nanalysis of data to provide for volume-based reconciliations between:\n(i)\nquantitative data at different stages of the supply chain as identified in Section 6.2;\n(ii)\nquantitative data of suppliers and buyers;\n(iii)\ndata declared by Organisations and Households and the physical batch of timber;\n(iv)\ninput and output analysis at processing sites;\n(v)\nOrganisations and Households in the context of investigations of suspicious timber flows;\n(d)\nverification and endorsement of information in input and output monitoring books of Organisations handling timber from domestic natural forests;\n(e)\ninspection of input and output monitoring books of Organisations as part of systematic inspection and ad hoc inspection on suspicion of risk.\nThe above reconciliation functions are carried out at each stage of the supply chain in accordance with existing procedures as well as data-collection and management systems, to be revised or developed before the FLEGT licensing regime is operational.\nSupply chain control is conducted in accordance with a plan including systematic and random checks. Ad hoc checks are conducted on identifying or receiving any information on any sign of violation by Organisations and Households.\nAt each stage of the supply chain, the checks by the Forest Protection Agency include the following elements:\n(a)\nconformity between the timber product dossier and actual timber;\n(b)\narchiving of the timber product dossier;\n(c)\nexamination of other verifiers relevant to different categories of timber at each stage of the supply chain for Households and Organisations;\n(d)\non identification of suspicious timber flows, checking conformity between suppliers and buyers.\nThe responsibility of the customs authority for the control of transit timber includes:\n(a)\nreception, entry and archiving of customs dossiers by traders;\n(b)\nsystematic, random and ad hoc documentary and physical inspections, in particular on the basis of the customs risk assessment system;\n(c)\ncarrying out and providing data for volume-based reconciliations between points of entry and exit of transit timber.\nThe management of violations of supply chain control is described further in Section 11.\n7.   VERIFICATION FOR EXPORT\n7.1   General principles for the verification for export\nVerification for export aims at assessing whether a shipment of timber to be exported is fully compliant with all VNTLAS requirements.\nThe level of verification for export for Organisations is based on the OCS and risk-based verification as described in Section 5 and Table 2. Different levels of verification apply to each Organisation risk category, as well as to Households, as follows:\n—\nCategory 1 Organisations: No additional verification.\n—\nCategory 2 Organisations: Documentary checks and physical checks on all shipments. Physical checks shall be carried out on a minimum of 20 % of the volume of each shipment of the Organisation.\n—\nHouseholds: Documentary checks and physical checks on all shipments. Physical checks shall be carried out on a minimum of 20 % of the volume of each shipment of the Household.\nTimber is subject to verification at every stage of the supply chain prior to exporting. At the exporting stage, exporters (Organisations and Households) shall prepare and submit the Timber Export Dossier.\nThe verification of the Timber Export Dossier shall apply to both Organisations and Households as described below and in Figures 4 and 5.\n7.1.1   Verification for export for Category 1 Organisations\nThe sequence of preparation and verification of the Timber Export Dossier for Category 1 Organisations shall include the following steps:\n—\nStep 1: Organisations shall measure and calculate the volume of each type of timber for preparation of the timber packing list, then self-certify the packing list.\n—\nStep 2: Organisations shall issue invoices as regulated by the Ministry of Finance in accordance with the timber packing list.\n—\nStep 3: Organisations shall prepare the timber export dossier, including:\n(i)\nthe sales contract or equivalent;\n(ii)\ninvoices as required by the Ministry of Finance;\n(iii)\nthe timber packing list; and\n(iv)\none or more additional documents subject to specific stages of the supply chain of different timber sources (e.g. minutes of placing forest hammer marks) providing evidence of timber legality for such shipment as defined in Appendix 2.\n—\nStep 4: Organisations shall perform export procedures:\n(a)\nWhere timber is exported to non-Union markets: Organisations shall submit the Timber Export Dossier and applicable customs documents to the border customs authorities for exporting timber, as specified in Principle VI in Annex II (Organisations).\n(b)\nWhere timber is exported to the Union market: Organisations shall submit the Timber Export Dossier together with a FLEGT licence application to the Licensing Authority for the issuance of a FLEGT licence, then submit the Timber Export Dossier, FLEGT licence and applicable customs documents to the border customs authorities for exporting timber, as specified in Principle VI in Annex II (Organisations).\nFor non-Union markets, upon receipt of the Timber Export Dossier from the exporter, the customs authorities shall check the OCS database to ensure the accuracy of the risk category declared by the exporter in the Timber Export Dossier and that the timber packing list has been duly certified in line with the risk-category status of the Organisation.\nFor the Union market, the FLEGT Licensing Authority shall check the risk category declared by the exporter in the Timber Export Dossier prior to the issuance of a FLEGT licence, and the customs authorities shall ensure that a valid FLEGT licence is submitted.\nThe customs authorities, in cooperation with verification entities, shall perform checks in the case of suspicion and based on the customs risk category.\nFigure 4.

INTERNAL INSPECTION, COMPLAINTS AND FEEDBACK MECHANISMS\n9.1   Internal inspection\nAs an element of the VNTLAS, internal inspection is carried out in accordance with the Law on Inspection. Inspection activities aim to detect loopholes in laws, regulations and management mechanisms and to recommend solutions to the relevant government agencies; to prevent and combat corruption; to detect and handle violations of the law; to assist government agencies, Organisations and individuals in properly observing the law; to protect the interests of the State and the legitimate rights and interests of Organisations and individuals; and to meet the requirements of the settlement of complaints as described in Section 9.2.\nInternal inspection shall apply to system elements 1 to 5 of the VNTLAS as described under Section 2.2. Internal inspection is carried out as a separate function of the State administration agencies and is not directly linked to individual FLEGT licensing decisions. Outcomes of internal inspections related to the implementation of VNTLAS shall be communicated in a timely manner to the JIC and the Independent Evaluation or according to the provisions of applicable Vietnamese law. Internal inspection of the VNTLAS may be carried out at the request of the JIC.\nInternal inspection is conducted at all levels by competent agencies that include: national, provincial and district inspectorates; inspection units within central government ministries and provincial technical departments; and people’s inspection boards. Inspection activities are carried out in the form of planned and regular inspection, and unexpected inspection upon detecting signs of violations of the law by government agencies, Organisations or individuals.\nInternal inspection covers both administrative inspection and specialised inspection in specific sectors and domains, including the implementation of laws, regulations and management mechanisms, the performance of tasks and exercise of powers by government agencies and by Organisations and individuals under the management of such agencies.\n9.2   Complaints, denunciations and feedback mechanisms\nComplaints by Organisations and Households concerning VNTLAS application and FLEGT licensing are regulated by the Law on Complaints. The Law regulates procedures for lodging complaints by domestic or foreign Organisations or individuals and the settlement of complaints against administrative decisions or acts of administrative agencies or persons in these agencies. The receipt of, response to and settlement of complaints is further subject to the procedures for internal inspection as described in Section 9.1.\nQuestions, complaints and denunciations from Organisations or individuals shall be received by the Verification Authority and the FLEGT Licensing Authority either directly through VNFOREST or through established feedback mechanisms through the representative timber industry associations and socio-political organisations. This includes denunciations without the name or address of the denunciators provided that they are clear and supply concrete evidence in relation to acts of corruption or violations of the law. All identified denunciators shall be protected.\nFeedback on VNTLAS implementation may go through policy dialogues and forums organised by the government, representative industry associations, socio-political organisations and non-governmental organisations in accordance with the laws of Viet Nam. The JIC shall be regularly informed of the outcome of any policy dialogues or forums related to VNTLAS implementation.\n10.   INDEPENDENT EVALUATION\nThe independent evaluation is the periodic evaluation of the implementation, efficiency and credibility of the VNTLAS. The independent evaluation shall also identify potential weaknesses and risks in the structures and implementation arrangements of the VNTLAS and propose solutions in this regard.\nThe Terms of Reference for the independent evaluation, including the objectives, overall scope, qualification requirements of the Independent Evaluator, methodology and intervals of evaluation, are set out in Annex VI.\n11.   MANAGEMENT OF VIOLATIONS\n11.1   Management of violations\nExisting laws and regulations of Viet Nam apply for handling non-compliance with the LD and supply chain controls. Depending on the severity of the violation, administrative sanctions, the suspension of activities and/or the prosecution of the Organisation or Household may apply.\nFor Organisations: the record of violations is taken into account as one criterion under the OCS as specified in Section 5 and Table 2. If Organisations have repeated administrative violations or criminal violations of the law related to forest protection and development and control of forest products, stricter sanctions shall be applied.\nFor Households: the record of violations is used as a basis for consideration of applying stricter sanctions if Households have repeated administrative violations or criminal violations of the law related to forest protection and development and control of forest products.\nIt is required that any violations be addressed in accordance with the procedures and timeframe prescribed by the laws and regulations of Viet Nam.\n11.2   Record of violations\nIf the systematic or random checks detect non-compliance within the timber supply chain, the Forest Protection Agency shall conduct additional verification.\nWhere violations are detected, violation minutes shall be prepared by the Forest Protection Agency in accordance with the laws and regulations of Viet Nam.\nViolations are recorded on a central violations database as described below.\nThe record of violations includes violations of the law in forestry and other key sectors under the LD. Adequate records of violations and records of corresponding remedial actions are kept in relevant databases on the handling of violations recorded in the OCS database and taken into account in the verification process prior to FLEGT licensing.\n11.2.1   Database of violations of the Law on Forest Protection and Development\nThis database, in which forest-related violations of the law by Organisations and Households at the national scale is continuously updated and integrated, is used to assess the legal compliance of all Organisations and Households, not only at their headquarter-based localities but also in other regions where they engage in forest production and business activities.\nThis database is managed by the Central FPD and is connected with the Provincial FPD nationwide through an internet-based platform.\n11.2.2   Databases of violations of other government agencies\nInformation on non-compliance and violations stored on the portals or databases managed by other verification entities shall be considered in the OCS assessment process as also described under Section 12.2.6.\n12.

Management of information on timber sources for Organisations – points of entry in the supply chain;\n—\nTable 2. Management of information on timber in circulation in the VNTLAS after points of entry in the supply chain for timber from natural forest, imported timber and handled confiscated timber for Organisations;\n—\nTable 3. Management of information on timber in circulation in the VNTLAS after points of entry in the supply chain for timber from concentrated plantation forest, gardens, farms, dispersed trees and rubber wood for Organisations.\nFor Households:\n—\nTable 4. Management of information on timber sources for Households – points of entry in the supply chain;\n—\nTable 5. Management of information on timber in circulation in the VNTLAS after points of entry in the supply chain for timber from natural forest, imported timber and handled confiscated timber for Households;\n—\nTable 6. Management of information on timber in circulation in the VNTLAS after points of entry in the supply chain for timber from concentrated plantation forest, gardens, farms, dispersed trees and rubber wood for Households.\nThe timber product dossier is an essential element of the VNTLAS. In accordance with Government regulations, the timber product dossier should be established at each critical control point of the supply chain for both Organisations and Households. The timber product dossier includes a set of documents that contribute to demonstrating the legal compliance of the corresponding batch of timber products.\nAs set out in Section 6 of Annex V, the critical control points of the supply chains in the VNTLAS are as follows:\n1.\nTimber sources entering the VNTLAS:\n1a.\nTimber from main harvesting of domestic natural forest (Organisations);\n1b.\nTimber from salvage harvesting and salvage collection of domestic natural forest (Organisations and Households);\n1c.\nTimber from main harvesting, salvage harvesting and salvage collection of planted protection forests (Organisations and Households);\n1d.\nTimber from main harvesting, salvage harvesting and salvage collection of planted production forests (Organisations and Households);\n1e(1).\nRubber wood (Organisations);\n1e(2).\nRubber wood; timber from home gardens, farms and dispersed trees (Households);\n1f.\nHandled confiscated timber (Organisations and Households);\n1g.\nImported timber (Organisations and Households).\n2.\nFirst Transport and trade transaction of timber products.\n3.\nSecond transport and trade transaction of timber products.\n4.\nAny subsequent transportation and trade of products.\n5.\nProcessing site.\n6.\nExport.\nUnder the VNTLAS, the timber product dossier can be checked under different circumstances:\n—\nApproval, certification and check of verifiers: as defined in Appendices IA and IB to Annex V, documents in the timber product dossier are subject to approval, certification and checks by the FPD and other verification entities.\n—\nOCS assessment: the legal compliance of Organisations is regularly assessed in the context of the Organisation Classification System (OCS). The frequency of OCS assessments is defined on the basis of the organisation risk category (Category 1 or 2). The documents included in all timber product dossiers under the responsibility of the Organisation are subject to checks (with up to five years of archiving).\n—\nDue diligence: Organisations and Households shall take responsibility for the accuracy of the information and the legality of all timber sources, including timber from domestic sources. The timber product dossier is one of the main sources of information for Organisations and Households to carry out due diligence in the context of a transaction of timber products.\nAdditionally, the timber product dossier is the basis for monthly or quarterly reporting of timber inputs and outputs by Organisations, complying with reporting requirements to the relevant Government agencies as stipulated by the legislation and regulations allowing for volume-based reconciliation.\nAs illustrated in Figure 1, at all transaction stages of the supply chain, the timber seller prepares a packing list for the batch of timber that is being sold. The packing list is transferred to the timber buyer and is archived by the timber buyer, and the timber seller archives a copy of the packing list:\n—\nPacking list 1 is prepared by the first owner of the batch of timber at the entry points of the supply chain in the VNTLAS (i.e. harvesting, import, confiscated timber, etc.) and is archived by the first owner.\n—\nPacking list 2 is prepared by the first timber owner who sells a batch of timber to the second owner. Packing list 2 accompanies the batch of timber that is transferred to the second owner. Packing list 2 is archived by the second owner and the first owner retains the copy of packing list 2.\n—\nPacking list 3 is prepared by the second timber owner who sells a batch of timber to the third owner. Packing list 3 accompanies the batch of timber that is transferred to the third owner. Packing list 3 is archived by the third owner and the second owner retains the copy of packing list 3.\n—\nSubsequent transactions along the supply chain follow similar procedure.\nText of image\nFigure 1. VNTLAS supply chain control chart\nNOTE:\nPacking lists (original) mads by each timber when selling or transportation occurs as a mandatory part of the Timber Product Dossier and circulating with timber. The copy of the packing list is archived by the timber owner. The number of transactions in the supply chain varies according fo the specific timber products and stages at which the products are sold onto the domestic or export market.\nCRITICAL\nCONTROL POINTS:\n1.

The assessment criteria set out in this Annex shall form the basis for the Terms of Reference.\nThe assessment aims to:\n—\nreview the VNTLAS as described in this Agreement and how it will operate;\n—\nassess the readiness of the VNTLAS to be put into operation, including whether the measures underpinning the FLEGT licensing scheme adequately fulfil their functions;\n—\nassess whether Organisations and Households along the supply chain are ready for implementation of the VNTLAS;\n—\nassess aspects related to the capacity of the relevant verification entities for verification, licensing, data management and information systems; and\n—\nexamine any revisions, agreed by the Parties, made to the VNTLAS after this Agreement is signed.\nMethodology for implementation of the assessment\nThe assessment of the VNTLAS shall be carried out according to a stepwise approach whereby gaps and weaknesses in the VNTLAS which may be identified during the assessment are progressively addressed through the planned implementation of corrective measures.\nAssessment criteria\nPart 1\nDefinition of legality\nLegally produced timber is defined in point (j) of Article 2 of this Agreement. The definition of legally produced timber (hereinafter referred to as “the Legality Definition” or “LD”) is clear, objectively verifiable and operationally workable, and refers at least to relevant provisions in the following areas:\n—\nRights to harvest: Granting of rights to harvest timber, including compliance with legislation and procedures on forest land allocation and forest use and land use rights.\n—\nForestry activities: Compliance with legal requirements regarding forest management and timber processing, including compliance with relevant environmental and labour legislation.\n—\nTaxation and fees: Compliance with legal requirements on taxes, royalties and fees directly related to timber harvesting and timber trade.\n—\nTrade and customs: Compliance with legal requirements on trading and customs procedures.\nKey questions on relevant laws and regulations:\n1.1.1:\nAre the legal provisions clearly identified in the LD?\n1.1.2:\nIs it clear which legislation and specific regulations apply to each principle, criterion and indicator of the LD?\n1.1.3:\nAre principles, criteria and indicators that can be used to test compliance with each element of the LD specified?\n1.1.4:\nAre the verifiers which are used to verify compliance with each principle and criterion of the LD specifically based on documented legal references?\n1.1.5:\nAre the verifiers clear, objective and operationally workable?\n1.1.6:\nAre the roles and responsibilities of all relevant stakeholders and verification entities identified clearly for each verifier?\n1.1.7:\nDoes the LD cover the main contents of current laws and regulations related to the VNTLAS? If not, why are some contents not reflected in the LD?\n1.1.8:\nHave the contents of relevant legal regulations been considered through stakeholder engagement in developing the LD?\n1.1.9:\nHave the recommendations made by stakeholders during such consultations been included in the LD?\n1.1.10:\nWas the LD matrix adjusted after the signing this Agreement? Are verifiers identified to ensure the verification of such adjustments?\nIn the case of any amendments to the LD after the signing of this Agreement, the key additional questions are:\n1.2.1:\nHave relevant stakeholders been consulted on the amendment and have their recommendations been taken into account?\n1.2.2:\nIs it clear what legislation and specific regulations apply to each new element of the LD? Are criteria and indicators that can be used to test compliance with each element of the LD specified? Are the criteria and indicators clear, objective and operationally workable?\n1.2.3:\nHave indicators and criteria been defined to ensure verification of these changes? Do the verifiers clearly identify the roles and responsibilities of the relevant stakeholders and verification entities?\nPart 2\nControl of the supply chain\nThe supply chain control system must be reliable in terms of tracing the origins of timber products throughout the supply chain from harvesting or import to the point of export. It is not always necessary to trace the origin of the timber, timber consignment or timber product from the point of export back to the forest of origin; however, detailed traceability is necessary from the point of import or harvesting location to the first mixing facilities (e.g. processing facility).\n2.1.   Timber use rights\nThere is clear delineation of areas where forest land use rights have been allocated and the holders of those rights have been clearly identified. Use rights over confiscated timber are clearly identified. Key questions include:\n2.1.1:\nDoes the control system ensure that only timber harvested from land clearly allocated in accordance with the LD is allowed to enter the supply chain?\n2.1.2:\nDoes the control system ensure that confiscated timber is allowed to enter the supply chain only under the defined conditions?\n2.1.3:\nDoes the control system ensure that harvesting Organisations and Households have been granted the usage rights for such forests?\n2.1.4:\nAre the procedures to grant the usage rights and information on those rights as well as on the corresponding holders made public?\n2.2.   Control of the supply chain\nThere are effective mechanisms and procedures for the control of flows of timber and timber products throughout the supply chain from harvesting or point of import to the point of final sale in Viet Nam or export. Key questions include:\n2.2.1:\nHas each critical control point in the supply chain been identified and described in the VNTLAS?\n2.2.2:\nDo the control measures (a) regulate and document the origin of timber and (b) prevent the mixing of timber of unknown origin in the supply chain?\n2.2.3:\nWhich agencies are responsible for the control of timber flows? Do these agencies have sufficient staff and resources to implement these control measures?\n2.2.4:\nIs information archived by Organisations, Households and the Forest Protection Department (FPD) at each control point as specified in Appendix 2 to Annex V?\n2.2.5:\nIs information from monthly and quarterly reports from Organisations collected and reconciled in order to meet the requirements identified in points 2.3.4, 2.3.5, 3.4.5 and 3.4.6?\n2.3.   Quantities\nThere are robust and effective mechanisms for measuring and recording the quantities of timber or timber products at each stage of the supply chain, including reliable pre-harvesting estimates of the volume of standing timber in each harvesting site. Key questions include:\n2.3.1:\nIs the control system capable of providing quantitative data on inputs and outputs at the critical control points of the supply chain?\n2.3.2:\nIs the function of information systems for legality verification of the supply chain clearly defined?\n2.3.3:\nWhich agencies are responsible for putting these quantitative data into the control system?

Agreement between the European Community and Ghana on FLEGT\nDecision 2010/151/EC on the signing and conclusion of a voluntary partnership agreement between the European Community and Ghana on FLEGT\nWHAT IS THE AIM OF THE AGREEMENTS AND THE DECISIONS?\nThe agreements aim to ensure that timber and timber products imported from the countries with whom the European Union (EU) has a Voluntary Partnership Agreement (VPA) are legally produced.\nThe decisions mark the signing and the conclusion of the agreements on behalf of the EU.\nKEY POINTS\nTimber legality assurance systems\nCountries entering into a VPA with the EU are required to set up and implement a timber legality assurance system (TLAS).\nA TLAS verifies that timber and timber products have been legally produced.\nOnly verified shipments are exported to the EU, covered by a forest law enforcement, governance and trade (FLEGT) licence.\nThe system must include compliance checks and procedures to ensure that timber of illegal or unknown origin does not enter the supply chain.\nAn independent evaluation will assess the implementation, effectiveness and credibility of the TLAS and the FLEGT licensing scheme.\nThe product scope of the FLEGT licensing scheme covers a core list of mandatory products, as listed under Annex II to the FLEGT regulation, as well as additional country-specific products to be listed in Annex III (in line with the product scope agreed in the relevant VPA).\nForest law enforcement, governance and trade\nThe agreements envisage setting up FLEGT licensing schemes, once both parties to the agreement conclude on the basis of a joint assessment of operational readiness whether the TLAS underpinning the licensing scheme adequately fulfils its functions.\nThey also set out the procedures and requirements to check and, in the case of exports to the EU, attest, by means of FLEGT licences, that timber products shipped to the EU have been legally produced. FLEGT licences were set up by Regulation (EC) No 2173/2005 (see summary).\nOnce the FLEGT licensing scheme has entered into force for timber and timber products covered by the agreement, the EU will only accept timber shipments from the country concerned that are covered by valid FLEGT licences. Timber with a valid FLEGT licence will be considered legally harvested within the meaning of the EU timber regulation, Regulation (EU) No 995/2010, (see summary). Operators importing FLEGT licensed timber will thus not have to carry out due diligence under that regulation.\nLicensing authority\nThe exporting country must appoint a licensing authority (LA).\nThe LA verifies that timber products have been legally produced and issues FLEGT licences for shipments of such products to the EU.\nIt will not issue FLEGT licences for: any shipment of timber products that has not been legally produced under its country’s laws as specified in the agreement; orin the case of imported timber, timber products that have not been harvested, produced or exported in accordance with the law of the country of harvest and the country of production.\nThe procedure for issuing FLEGT licences must be publicly accessible and records must be kept of all shipments covered by such licences.\nReceiving and verifying FLEGT licences\nThe FLEGT competent authority of the EU Member State concerned must check that each shipment is covered by a valid FLEGT licence before releasing it for free circulation in the EU.\nThis release can be suspended and the shipment held if there are doubts regarding the validity of the licence.\nIrregularities\nEach party must inform the other if they suspect or have evidence of irregularities in the licensing scheme or any attempt to circumvent it, including:\ntrade being redirected from the exporting country concerned to the EU via a non-EU country with the intention of avoiding licensing;\nFLEGT licences covering timber products which contain timber from non-EU countries that is suspected of being illegally produced;\nfraud in obtaining or using FLEGT licences.\nDATE OF ENTRY INTO FORCE\nCountry\nDate of entry into force of agreement\nDate of ratification of agreement\nDate of signature of agreement\nStart of FLEGT licensing\nHonduras\nJune 2021\n23 February 2021\nVietnam\n1 June 2019\n                \nMay 2019\n19 October 2018\nIndonesia\n1 May 2014\n                \nApril 2014\n30 September 2013\n15 November 2016\nLiberia\n1 December 2013\n                \nDecember 2013\n11 July 2011\nCongo\n1 March 2013\n                \nFebruary 2013\n17 May 2010\nCameroon\n1 December 2011\n                \n2 March 2011 – EU9 August 2011 – Cameroon\n6 October 2010\nCentral African Republic\n1 July 2012\n1 July 2012\n28 November 2011\nGhana\n1 December 2009\n19 November 2009\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo\nStill under negotiation\nCôte d’Ivoire\nStill under negotiation\nGabon\nStill under negotiation\nGuyana\nStill under negotiation\nBACKGROUND\n              \nFor more information, see:\nFLEGT regulation — FLEGT Voluntary Partnership Agreements (European Commission).\nMAIN DOCUMENTS\n            \nVoluntary Partnership Agreement between the European Union and the Republic of Honduras on forest law enforcement, governance and trade in timber products to the European Union (OJ L 217, 18.6.2021, pp. 3–136).\nCouncil Decision (EU) 2020/2185 of 18 December 2020 on the signing, on behalf of the Union, of the Voluntary Partnership Agreement between the European Union and the Republic of Honduras on forest law enforcement, governance and trade in timber products to the European Union (OJ L 435, 23.12.2020, pp. 63–64).\nCouncil Decision (EU) 2021/964 of 26 May 2021 on the conclusion of the Voluntary Partnership Agreement between the European Union and the Republic of Honduras on forest law enforcement, governance and trade in timber products to the European Union (OJ L 217, 18.6.2021, pp. 1–2).\nVoluntary Partnership Agreement between the European Union and the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam on forest law enforcement, governance and trade (OJ L 147, 5.6.2019, pp. 3–209).\nCouncil Decision (EU) 2018/1528 of 11 October 2018 on the signing, on behalf of the Union, of the Voluntary Partnership Agreement between the European Union and the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam on forest law enforcement, governance and trade (OJ L 257, 15.10.2018, pp. 1–2).\nCouncil Decision (EU) 2019/854 of 15 April 2019 on the conclusion of the Voluntary Partnership Agreement between the European Union and the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam on forest law enforcement, governance and trade (OJ L 147, 5.6.2019, pp. 1–2).\nVoluntary Partnership Agreement between the European Union and the Republic of Indonesia on forest law enforcement, governance and trade in timber products into the European Union (OJ L 150, 20.5.2014, pp. 252–330).\nAmendments to the agreement have been incorporated into the original text.
