It concerns the release of N-nitrosamines and of substances capable of being converted into  N-nitrosamines, hereinafter called 'N-nitrosatable substances`, from teats and soothers, made of  elastomer or rubber. Article 2 The teats and soothers referred to in Article 1 must not pass on to release-test liquid  (saliva test solution) under the conditions specified in Annex I any N-nitrosamine and  N-nitrosatable substance detectable by a validated method which complies with the criteria laid  down in Annex II and which can detect the following quantities: -  0,01 mg in total of N-nitrosamines released/kg (of the parts of teat or soother made of  elastomer or rubber), -  0,1 mg in total of N-nitrosatable substances/kg (of the parts of teat or soother made of  elastomer or rubber). Article 3 1.  Member States shall bring into force the laws, regulations and administrative  provisions necessary to comply with this Directive as from 1 April 1994. They shall immediately  inform the Commission thereof. Member States shall: -  permit, as from 1 April 1994, the trade in and use of teats and soothers complying with this  Directive, -  prohibit, as from 1 April 1995, the trade in and use of teats and soothers which do not comply  with this Directive. 2.  When Member States adopt the measures referred to in paragraph 1, these shall contain a  reference to this Directive or shall be accompanied by such reference to this Directive or shall be  accompanied by such reference at the time of their official publication. The procedure for such  reference shall be adopted by Member States. Article 4 This Directive is addressed to the Member States. Done at Brussels, 15 March 1993. For the Commission Martin BANGEMANN Member of the Commission  ANNEX I BASIC RULES FOR DETERMINING THE RELEASE OF N-NITROSAMINES AND N-NITROSATABLE  SUBSTANCES 1.  Release-test liquid (saliva test solution) To obtain the release-test liquid, dissolve 4,2 g of sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3), 0,5 g of sodium  chloride (NaCl), 0,2 g of potassium carbonate (K2CO3) and 30,0 mg of sodium nitrite (NaNO2) in one  litre of distilled water or water of equivalent quality. The solution must have a pH value of 9. 2.  Test conditions Samples of material obtained from an appropriate number of teats or soothers are immersed in the  test-release liquid for 24 hours at a temperature of 40 ± 2  °C. ANNEX II CRITERIA APPLICABLE TO THE METHOD FOR DETERMINING THE RELEASE OF N-NITROSAMINES  AND N-NITROSATABLE SUBSTANCES 1.  The release of N-nitrosamines is determined in one aliquot of  each solution obtained according to Annex I. The N-nitrosamines are extracted from the aliquot with  nitrosamine-free dichloromethane (DCM) and determined by gas chromatography. 2.  The release of N-nitrosatable substances is determined in another aliquot of each solution  obtained according to Annex I. The nitrosatable substances are converted into nitrosamines by  acidification of the aliquot with hydrochloric acid. Subsequently the nitrosamines are extracted  from the solution with DCM and determined by gas chromatography.", "summary": "Release of N-nitrosamines from rubber teats\nRelease of N-nitrosamines from rubber teats\nCommunity legislation is harmonising the provisions relating to the release of N-nitrosamines and N-nitrosable substances from elastomer or rubber teats and soothers.\nACT\nCommission Directive 93/11/EEC of 15 March 1993 concerning the release of N-nitrosamines and N-nitrosatable substances from elastomer or rubber teats and soothers.\nSUMMARY\nThis Directive is a specific\nmeasure within the meaning of Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1935/2004 on materials and articles intended to come into contact with food.\nElastomer or rubber teats and soothers are capable of releasing N-nitrosamines and N-nitrosable substances (substances likely to be transformed into N-nitrosamines) which, by virtue of their toxicity, pose a threat to human health.\nAccordingly, the migration of substances must not exceed the following limits:\n0.01 mg of the total quantity of N-nitrosamines released per kg (parts of elastomer or rubber teats and soothers)\n0.1 mg of the total quantity of N-nitrosatable substances (parts of elastomer or rubber teats and soothers).\nThese limits must be checked by means of a test, subject to the conditions set out in the annex to this Directive. The analytical method to be employed is also laid down in this annex.\nTeats and soothers which do not comply with this Directive are prohibited from 1 April 1995.\nReferences\nAct\nEntry into force\nDeadline for transposition in the Member States\nOfficial Journal\nDirective 93/11/EEC\n24.3.1993\n1.4.1994\nOJ L 93 of 17.4.1993\nSee also\nThe website of the Directorate-General for Health and Consumers.\nLast updated: 19.11.2009", "tags": ["early childhood", "foodstuff", "toxic substance", "health risk", "synthetic rubber", "analytical chemistry"], "subjects": ["Foodstuffs", "Approximation of laws", "Internal market - Principles"], "split": "train", "reference_annotations": {}, "summary_annotations": {}}
