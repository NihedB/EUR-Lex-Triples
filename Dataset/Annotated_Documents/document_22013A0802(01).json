The Contracting Parties reaffirm the application of the provisions of Chapter 3 (\"Competition\") of Title IV of the Association Agreement to this Agreement.\n2.   The Contracting Parties acknowledge that it is their joint objective to have a fair and competitive environment for the operation of air services. The Contracting Parties recognise that fair competitive practices by air carriers are most likely to occur where these air carriers operate on a fully commercial basis and are not subsidised, and where neutral and non-discriminatory access to airport facilities, services, and slot allocation is ensured.\n3.   If one Contracting Party finds that conditions exist in the territory of the other Contracting Party, in particular due to subsidy, which would adversely affect the fair and equal opportunity of its air carriers to compete, it may submit observations to the other Contracting Party. Furthermore, it may request a meeting of the Joint Committee, as provided for in Article 22 of this Agreement. Consultations shall start within 30 days of receipt of such a request. Failure to reach a satisfactory agreement within 30 days from the start of consultations shall constitute grounds for the Contracting Party that requested the consultations to take action to refuse, withhold, revoke, suspend or impose appropriate conditions on the authorisations of the air carrier(s) concerned, consistent with Article 4.\n4.   The actions referred to in paragraph 3 shall be appropriate, proportionate and restricted with regard to scope and duration to what is strictly necessary. They shall be exclusively directed towards the air carrier(s) benefiting from the conditions referred to in paragraph 3, and shall be without prejudice to the right of either Contracting Party to take action under Article 23.\n5.   The Contracting Parties agree that the participation of the Israeli Government to help cover additional security expenses incurred by the Israeli air carriers as a result of Israeli Government instructions, is not an unfair competitive practice and is not considered as a subsidy for the purpose of this article provided that:\n(a)\nsuch support covers exclusively costs necessarily incurred by the air carriers of Israel when implementing extra security measures required by the Israeli authorities which are not imposed on, or incurred by, air carriers of the European Union; and\n(b)\nsuch security costs are clearly identified and quantified by Israel; and\n(c)\nthe Joint Committee receives, once a year, a report describing the total sum of the security expenses and the rate of participation of the Israeli government in the previous year.\n6.

Where such constraints preclude self-handling and where there is no effective competition between suppliers that provide groundhandling services, all such services shall be available on both an equal and non-discriminatory basis to all air carriers; prices of such services shall not exceed their full cost including a reasonable return on assets, after depreciation.\n4.   Any air carrier of each Contracting Party may engage in the sale of air transport in the territory of the other Contracting Party directly and/or, at the air carrier's discretion, through its sales agents, other intermediaries appointed by the air carrier or through the internet or any other available channel.

In operating or holding out services under this Agreement, any air carrier of a Contracting Party may enter into cooperative marketing arrangements, such as blocked-space agreements or code-sharing arrangements, with:\n(a)\nany air carrier or carriers of the Contracting Parties; and\n(b)\nany air carrier or carriers of a third country; and\n(c)\nany surface, land or maritime carriers;\nprovided that (i) the operating carrier holds the appropriate traffic rights and (ii) the marketing carriers hold the appropriate route rights within the relevant bilateral provisions and (iii) the arrangements meet the requirements relating to safety and competition normally applied to such arrangements. In respect of passenger transport sold involving code-shares, the purchaser shall be informed at the point of sale, or in any case at check-in, or on boarding where no check-in is required for a connecting flight, which transportation providers will operate each sector of the service.\n8.\n(a)\nIn relation to the transport of passengers, surface transport providers shall not be subject to laws and regulations governing air transport on the sole basis that such surface transport is held out by an air carrier under its own name. Surface transport providers have the discretion to decide whether to enter into cooperative arrangements. In deciding on any particular arrangement, surface transport providers may consider, among other things, consumer interests and technical, economic, space, and capacity constraints.\n(b)\nMoreover, and notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, air carriers and indirect providers of cargo transport of the Contracting Parties shall be permitted, without restriction, to employ in connection with international air transport any surface transport for cargo to or from any points in Israel and the European Union, or in third countries, including transport to and from all airports with customs facilities, and including, where applicable, the right to transport cargo in bond under applicable laws and regulations. Such cargo, whether moving by surface or by air, shall have access to airport customs processing and facilities. Air carriers may elect to perform their own surface transport or to provide it through arrangements with other surface carriers, including surface transport operated by other air carriers and indirect providers of cargo air transport. Such intermodal cargo services may be offered at a single, through price for the air and surface transport combined, provided that shippers are not misled as to the facts concerning such transport.\n9.\n(a)\nThe air carriers of each Contracting Party shall be entitled to provide the agreed services using aircraft leased with or without crew from any air carrier, including from third countries, provided that all participants in such arrangements meet the conditions prescribed under the laws and regulations normally applied by the Contracting Parties to such arrangements.\n(b)\nNeither Contracting Party shall require the air carriers leasing out their equipment to hold traffic rights under this Agreement.\n(c)\nThe leasing with crew (wet-leasing) of an aircraft of an air carrier of a third country, other that those mentioned in Annex III, by an Israeli air carrier or by an air carrier of the European Union, in order to exploit the rights envisaged in this Agreement, shall remain exceptional or meet temporary needs.

The air carriers of each Contracting Party shall be entitled to enter into franchising or branding arrangements with companies, including air carriers, of either Contracting Party or third countries, provided that the air carriers hold the appropriate authority and meet the conditions prescribed under the laws and regulations applied by the Contracting Parties to such arrangements, particularly those requiring the disclosure of the identity of the air carriers operating the service.\n11.   Each Contracting Party shall ensure that its procedures, guidelines and regulations to manage slots applicable at airports in its territory are applied in a transparent, effective and non-discriminatory manner.\n12.

While entering, within, or leaving the territory of one Contracting Party, its laws and regulations relating to the sale, supply, and use of aircraft fuel shall be complied with by the other Contracting Party's air carriers.\n4.   The regular airborne, as well as the material, supplies and spare parts referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Article normally retained on board aircraft operated by an air carrier of one Contracting party may be unloaded in the territory of the other Contracting Party only with the approval of the customs authorities of that Contracting Party and may be required to be kept under the supervision or control of the said authorities up to such time as they are re-exported or otherwise disposed in accordance with customs regulation.\n5.   The exemptions provided by this Article shall also be available where the air carriers of one Contracting Party have contracted with another air carrier, which similarly enjoys such exemptions from the other Contracting Party, for the loan or transfer in the territory of the other Party of the items specified in paragraphs 1 and 2.\n6.   Nothing in this Agreement shall prevent either Party from imposing taxes, levies, duties, fees or charges on goods sold other than for consumption on board to passengers during a sector of an air service between two points within its territory at which embarkation or disembarkation is permitted.\n7.   The stipulations of the present Agreement shall not affect the field of VAT, with the exception of such tax on imports. The provisions of the respective conventions in force between a European Union Member State and Israel for the avoidance of double taxation on income and on capital remain unaffected by this Agreement.\nArticle 10\nUser Charges for Airports and Aviation Facilities and Services\n1.   Each Contracting Party shall ensure that user charges that may be imposed by its competent charging authorities or bodies on the air carriers of the other Contracting Party for the use of air navigation and air traffic control services shall be cost-related and non-discriminatory. In any event, any such user charges shall be assessed on the air carriers of the other Contracting Party on terms not less favourable than the most favourable terms available to any other air carrier.\n2.   Each Contracting Party shall ensure that user charges that may be imposed by its competent charging authorities or bodies on the air carriers of the other Contracting Party for the use of airport, aviation security and related facilities and services shall be not unjustly discriminatory, and equitably apportioned among categories of users. These charges may reflect, but shall not exceed, the full cost to the competent charging authorities or bodies of providing the appropriate airport and aviation security facilities and services at that airport or within that airport’s system. These charges may include a reasonable return on assets, after depreciation. Facilities and services for which user charges are made shall be provided on an efficient and economic basis. In any event, these charges shall be assessed on the air carriers of the other Party on terms not less favourable than the most favourable terms available to any other air carrier at the time the charges are assessed.\n3.   Each Contracting Party shall encourage consultations between the competent charging authorities or bodies in its territory and the air carriers or their representative bodies using the services and facilities, and shall encourage the competent charging authorities or bodies to provide each airport user, or the representatives or associations of airport users, with information on the components serving as a basis for determining the system or the level of all charges levied at each airport by the airport managing bodies as such information may be necessary to permit an accurate review of the reasonableness of the charges in accordance with the principles of paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Article. Each Contracting Party shall encourage the competent charging authorities to provide users with reasonable notice of any proposal for changes in user charges to enable those authorities to consider the views expressed by the users before changes are made.\n4.   Neither Contracting Party shall be held, in dispute resolution procedures pursuant to Article 23, to be in breach of a provision of this Article, unless (a) it fails to undertake a review of the charge or practice that is the subject of complaint by the other Contracting Party within a reasonable amount of time; or (b) following such a review it fails to take all steps within its power to remedy any charge or practice that is inconsistent with this Article.\nArticle 11\nPricing\n1.   The Contracting Parties shall permit prices to be freely established by the air carriers on the basis of free and fair competition.\n2.   The Contracting Parties shall not require prices to be filed.\n3.   Discussions between the competent authorities may be held to discuss matters such as, but not limited to, prices which may be unjust, unreasonable or discriminatory.\nArticle 12\nStatistics\n1.   Each Contracting Party shall provide the other Contracting Party with statistics that are required by domestic laws and regulations, and, upon request, other available statistical information as may be reasonably required for the purpose of reviewing the operation of air services under this Agreement.\n2.   The Contracting Parties shall cooperate in the framework of the Joint Committee under Article 22 to facilitate the exchange of statistical information between them for the purpose of monitoring the development of air services under this Agreement.\nTITLE II\nREGULATORY COOPERATION\nArticle 13\nAviation Safety\n1.   Without prejudice to the discretion of the legislative authorities of the Contracting Parties, the Contracting Parties shall closely cooperate in the area of aviation safety with the objective of establishing, to the practical extent possible, harmonised rules or mutual recognition of each other's safety standards. The Joint Committee, with the assistance of the European Aviation Safety Agency, shall oversee this process of cooperation.\n2.   The Contracting Parties shall ensure that their relevant legislation, rules or procedures deliver, at minimum, the level of regulatory requirements and standards relating to air transport specified in Part A of Annex IV, as detailed in Annex VI.\n3.   The competent authorities of the Contracting Parties shall recognise as valid, for the purposes of operating the air transport provided for in this Agreement, certificates of airworthiness, certificates of competency, and licenses issued or validated by each other and still in force, provided that the requirements for such certificates or licenses at least equal the minimum standards that may be established pursuant to the Convention. The competent authorities may, however, refuse to recognise as valid for purposes of flight above their own territory, certificates of competency and licenses granted to or validated for their own nationals by such other authorities.\n4.   Each Contracting Party may request consultations at any time concerning the safety standards maintained by the other Contracting Party in areas relating to aeronautical facilities, flight crew, aircraft and the operation of aircraft. Such consultations shall take place within thirty (30) days of that request.\n5.   If, following such consultations, one Contracting Party finds that the other Contracting Party does not effectively maintain and administer safety standards in the areas referred to in paragraph 4 that meet the standards established at that time pursuant to the Convention, the other Contracting Party shall be informed of such findings and of the steps considered necessary to conform with the ICAO standards. The other Contracting Party shall then take appropriate corrective action within an agreed time period.\n6.   The Contracting Parties shall ensure that aircraft registered in one Contracting Party suspected of non-compliance with international aviation safety standards established pursuant to the Convention landing at airports open to international air traffic in the territory of the other Contracting Party shall be subject to ramp inspections by the competent authorities of that other Contracting Party, on board and around the aircraft to check both the validity of the aircraft documents and those of its crew and the apparent condition of the aircraft and its equipment.\n7.   The competent authorities of either Contracting Party may take all appropriate and immediate measures whenever they ascertain that an aircraft, any component of an aircraft or an operation may:\n(a)\nfail to satisfy the minimum standards established pursuant to the Convention, or\n(b)\ngive rise to serious concerns – established through an inspection referred to in paragraph 6, pursuant to Article 16 of the Convention – that an aircraft or the operation of an aircraft does not comply with the minimum standards established pursuant to the Convention, or\n(c)\ngive rise to serious concerns that there is a lack of effective maintenance and administration of minimum standards established pursuant to the Convention.\n8.   Where the competent authorities of one Contracting Party take action under paragraph 7, they shall promptly inform the competent authorities of the other Contracting Party of taking such action, providing reasons for its action.\n9.   When urgent action is essential to ensure the safety of an air carrier operation, each Contracting Party reserves the right to immediately suspend or vary the operating authorisation of an air carrier or air carriers of the other Contracting Party.\n10.   Where measures taken in application of paragraphs 7 or 9 are not discontinued even though the basis for taking them has ceased to exist, either Contracting Party may refer the matter to the Joint Committee.\nArticle 14\nAviation Security\n1.   The Contracting Parties reaffirm their obligations to each other to provide for the security of civil aviation against acts of unlawful interference, and in particular their obligations under the Convention, the Convention on Offences and Certain Other Acts Committed on Board Aircraft, signed at Tokyo on 14 September 1963, the Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Seizure of Aircraft, signed at The Hague on 16 December 1970, the Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts against the Safety of Civil Aviation, signed at Montreal on 23 September 1971, the Protocol for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts of Violence at Airports Serving International Civil Aviation, signed at Montreal on 24 February 1988, insofar as the Contracting Parties are parties to these conventions, as well as all other conventions and protocols relating to civil aviation security of which Contracting Parties are parties.\n2.   The Contracting Parties shall provide upon request all necessary assistance to each other to prevent acts of unlawful seizure of civil aircraft and other unlawful acts against the safety of such aircraft, their passengers and crew, airports and air navigation facilities, and any other threat to the security of civil aviation.\n3.   The Contracting Parties shall, in their mutual relations, act in conformity with the aviation security Standards and, so far as they are applied by them, the Recommended Practices established by the ICAO and designated as Annexes to the Convention, to the extent that such security provisions are applicable to the Contracting Parties. The Contracting Parties shall require that operators of aircraft of their registry, operators who have their principal place of business or permanent residence in their territory, and the operators of airports in their territory, act, at least, in conformity with such aviation security provisions.\n4.   Each Contracting Party shall ensure that effective measures are taken within its territory to protect aircraft, to screen passengers and their carry-on items, and to carry out appropriate checks on crew, cargo (including hold baggage) and aircraft stores prior to and during boarding or loading and that those measures are adjusted to meet increases in the threat. Each Contracting Party agrees that their air carriers may be required to respect the aviation security provisions referred to in paragraph 3 required by the other Contracting Party, for entrance into, departure from, or while within, the territory of that other Contracting Party. When a Contracting Party is informed of a specific threat for a specific flight or specific series of flights to or from the territory of the other Contracting Party, it shall inform the other Contracting Party, and special security measures may be decided by the first Contracting Party to take into account the specific threat, in accordance with paragraph 6.\n5.   The Contracting Parties agree to work towards achieving mutual recognition of each other's security standards. To this end, they shall establish administrative arrangements allowing for consultations on existing or planned aviation security measures and for cooperation and sharing of information on quality control measures implemented by the Contracting Parties. A Contracting Party may also request the cooperation of the other Contracting Party to assess whether particular security measures of that other Contracting Party meet the requirements of the requesting Contracting Party. Taking into account the results of the assessments, the requesting Contracting Party may decide that security measures of an equivalent standard are applied in the territory of the other Contracting Party in order that transfer passengers, transfer baggage, and/or transfer cargo may be exempted from re-screening in the territory of the requesting Contracting Party. Such a decision shall be communicated to the other Contracting Party.\n6.   Each Contracting Party shall also act favourably upon any request from the other Contracting Party for reasonable special security measures to meet a particular threat. Except in case of emergency, each Contracting Party will inform the other Contracting Party in advance of any special security measures it intends to introduce which could have a significant financial or operational impact on the air transport services provided under this Agreement. Either Contracting Party may request a meeting of the Joint Committee to discuss such security measures, as provided for in Article 22 of this Agreement.\n7.   When an incident or threat of an incident of unlawful seizure of civil aircraft or other unlawful acts against the safety of such aircraft, their passengers and crew, airports or air navigation facilities occurs, the Contracting Parties shall assist each other by facilitating communications and other appropriate measures intended to terminate rapidly and safely such incident or threat thereof.\n8.   Each Contracting Party shall take all measures it finds practicable to ensure that an aircraft subjected to an act of unlawful seizure or other acts of unlawful interference which is on the ground in its territory is detained on the ground unless its departure is necessitated by the overriding duty to protect human life. Wherever practicable, such measures shall be taken on the basis of mutual consultations.\n9.   When a Contracting Party has reasonable grounds to believe that the other Contracting Party has departed from the aviation security provisions of this Article, that Contracting Party may request immediate consultations with the other Contracting Party.\n10.   Without prejudice to Article 4, failure to reach a satisfactory agreement within fifteen (15) days from the date of such request shall constitute grounds to withhold, revoke, limit or impose conditions on the operating authorisation of one or more air carriers of such other Contracting Party.\n11.   When required by an immediate and extraordinary threat, a Contracting Party may take interim action prior to the expiry of fifteen (15) days.\n12.   Without prejudice to the need to take immediate action in order to protect transport security, the Contracting Parties affirm that when considering security measures, each Contracting Party shall evaluate possible adverse economic and operational effects on the operation of air services under this Agreement and, unless constrained by law, shall take such factors into account when it determines what measures are necessary and appropriate to address those security concerns.\n13.   Any action taken in accordance with the paragraphs 10 or 11 shall be discontinued upon compliance by the other Contracting Party with the provisions of this Article.\n14.   Notwithstanding this Article, The Contracting Parties agree that no party will be obliged to reveal information, which may harm the national security of each of the Contracting Parties.\nArticle 15\nAir Traffic Management\n1.   The Contracting Parties agree to cooperate closely in the field of air traffic management with a view to extending the Single European Sky to Israel in order to enhance safety and overall efficiency for general air traffic, to optimise capacities and to minimise delays. To this purpose, Israel shall be involved in the Single European Sky Committee as observer. The Joint Committee shall monitor this process of cooperation.\n2.   With a view to facilitating the application of the Single European Sky legislation in their territories:\n(a)\nIsrael shall take the necessary measures to adjust its air traffic management institutional structures to the Single European Sky, in particular by establishing a pertinent national supervisory body at least functionally independent of the air navigation service provider(s); and\n(b)\nThe European Union shall associate Israel with relevant operational initiatives in the fields of air navigation services, airspace and interoperability that stem from the Single European Sky, in particular through appropriate coordination on SESAR.\n3.\n(a)\nThe Contracting Parties shall ensure that their relevant legislation, rules or procedures deliver, at minimum, the regulatory requirements and standards relating to air transport specified in Section A of Part B of Annex IV as detailed in Annex VI.\n(b)\nThe Contracting Parties shall endeavour to act in accordance with European Union regulatory requirements and standards relating to air transport specified in Section B of Part B of Annex IV as detailed in Annex VI.\nArticle 16\nEnvironment\n1.   The Contracting Parties recognise the importance of protecting the environment when developing and implementing international aviation policy.\n2.   The Contracting Parties acknowledge that effective global, regional, national and/or local action is needed to minimise the impact of civil aviation on the environment.\n3.   The Contracting Parties recognise the importance of working together, and within the framework of multilateral discussions, to consider and minimise the effects of aviation on the environment and the economy, and to ensure that any mitigating measures are fully consistent with the objectives of this Agreement.\n4.   Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to limit the authority of the competent authorities of a Contracting Party to take all appropriate measures to prevent or otherwise address the environmental impacts of air transport provided that such measures are applied without distinction as to nationality.\n5.   The Contracting Parties shall ensure that their relevant legislation, rules or procedures deliver, at minimum, the regulatory requirements and standards relating to air transport specified in Part C of Annex IV as detailed in Annex VI.\nArticle 17\nAir Carrier Liability\n1.   The Contracting Parties reaffirm their obligations under the Convention for the Unification of Certain Rules for International Carriage by Air, done at Montreal on 28 May 1999 (the Montreal Convention).\n2.   The Contracting Parties shall ensure that their relevant legislation, rules or procedures deliver, at minimum, the regulatory requirements and standards relating to air transport specified in Part D of Annex IV as detailed in Annex VI.\nArticle 18\nConsumer Rights and Protection of Personal Data\nThe Contracting Parties shall ensure that their relevant legislation, rules or procedures deliver, at minimum, the regulatory requirements and standards relating to air transport specified in Part E of Annex IV as detailed in Annex VI.\nArticle 19\nComputer Reservation Systems\nThe Contracting Parties shall apply their laws and regulations, including competition rules, to operations of computer reservation systems on a fair and non-discriminatory basis. The computer reservation systems, air carriers and travel agencies of one Contracting Party shall enjoy treatment equivalent to that given to the computer reservation systems, air carriers and travel agencies operating in the territory of the other Contracting Party.\nArticle 20\nSocial aspects\nThe Contracting Parties shall ensure that their relevant legislation, rules or procedures deliver, at minimum, the regulatory requirements and standards relating to air transport specified in Part F of Annex IV as detailed in Annex VI.\nTITLE III\nINSTITUTIONAL PROVISIONS\nArticle 21\nInterpretation and Enforcement\n1.   The Contracting Parties shall take all appropriate measures, whether general or particular, to ensure fulfilment of the obligations arising out of this Agreement and shall refrain from any measures which would jeopardise attainment of the objectives of this Agreement.\n2.   Each Contracting Party shall be responsible, in its own territory, for the proper enforcement of this Agreement and, in particular, the regulatory requirements and standards relating to air transport specified in Annex IV as detailed in Annex VI.\n3.   Each Contracting Party shall give the other Contracting Party all necessary information and assistance subject to the applicable law of the respective Contracting Party, in the case of investigations on possible infringements which that other Contracting Party carries out under its respective competences as provided in this Agreement.\n4.   Whenever the Contracting Parties act under the powers granted to them by this Agreement on matters which are of interest to the other Contracting Party and which concern the authorities or undertakings of the other Contracting Party, the competent authorities of the other Contracting Party shall be fully informed and given the opportunity to comment before a final decision is taken.\nArticle 22\nThe Joint Committee\n1.   A committee composed of representatives of the Contracting Parties (hereinafter referred to as the Joint Committee) is hereby established, which shall be responsible for the administration of this Agreement and shall ensure its proper implementation. For this purpose it shall make recommendations and take decisions in the cases provided for in this Agreement.\n2.   The decisions of the Joint Committee shall be adopted by consensus and shall be binding upon the Contracting Parties. They will be put into effect by the Contracting Parties in accordance with their own rules.\n3.   The Joint Committee shall adopt its Rules of Procedure.\n4.   The Joint Committee shall meet as and when necessary, and at least once a year. Either Contracting Party may request the convening of a meeting.\n5.   A Contracting Party may also request a meeting of the Joint Committee to seek to resolve any question relating to the interpretation or application of this Agreement. Such a meeting shall begin at the earliest possible date, but not later than two months from the date of receipt of the request, unless otherwise agreed by the Contracting Parties.\n6.   For the purpose of the proper implementation of this Agreement, the Contracting Parties shall exchange information and, at the request of either Contracting Party, shall hold consultations within the Joint Committee.\n7.   If, in the view of one of the Contracting Parties, a decision of the Joint Committee is not properly implemented by the other Contracting Party, the former may request that the issue be discussed by the Joint Committee. If the Joint Committee cannot solve the issue within two months of its referral, the requesting Contracting Party may take appropriate safeguard measures under Article 24.\n8.   The decisions of the Joint Committee shall state the date of its implementation in the Contracting Parties and any other information likely to concern economic operators.\n9.   Without prejudice to paragraph 2, if the Joint Committee does not take a decision on an issue which has been referred to it within six months of the date of referral, the Contracting Parties may take appropriate temporary safeguard measures under Article 24.\n10.   The Joint Committee shall examine questions relating to bilateral investments of majority participation, or changes in the effective control of air carriers of the Contracting Parties.\n11.   The Joint Committee shall also develop cooperation by:\n(a)\ncarrying out its specific tasks in relation to the process of regulatory cooperation, as set out in Title II of this Agreement;\n(b)\nfostering expert-level exchanges on new legislative or regulatory initiatives and developments, including in the fields of security, safety, the environment, aviation infrastructure (including slots), competitive environment and consumer protection;\n(c)\nregularly examining the social effects of the Agreement as it is implemented, notably in the area of employment, and developing appropriate responses to concerns found to be legitimate;\n(d)\nagreeing, on the basis of consensus, on proposals, approaches or documents of a procedural nature directly related to the functioning of this Agreement;\n(e)\nconsidering potential areas for the further development of this Agreement, including the recommendation of amendments to this Agreement; and\n(f)\naddressing the application of section A.1 of Annex IV (list of air carriers subject to an operating ban).\n12.   The Parties share the goal of maximising the benefits for consumers, air carriers, labour, and communities on both sides by extending this Agreement to include third countries. To this end, the Joint Committee shall work to develop a proposal regarding the conditions and procedures, including any necessary amendments to this Agreement, which would be required for third countries to accede to this Agreement.\nArticle 23\nDispute Resolution and Arbitration\n1.   Either Contracting Party may refer through diplomatic channels, to the Association Council established under the Association Agreement, any dispute relating to the application or interpretation of this Agreement, having not been resolved in accordance with Article 22. For the purposes of this Article, the Association Council established under the Association Agreement shall act as Joint Committee.\n2.   The Association Council may settle the dispute by means of a decision.\n3.   The Contracting Parties shall take the necessary measures to implement the decision referred to in paragraph 2.\n4.   Should the Contracting Parties be unable to settle the dispute in accordance with paragraph 2, the dispute shall, at the request of either Contracting Party, be submitted to an arbitration tribunal of three arbitrators in accordance with the procedure laid down hereafter:\n(a)\neach Contracting Party shall appoint an arbitrator within sixty (60) days from the date of reception of the notification for the request for arbitration by the arbitration tribunal addressed by the other Contracting Party through diplomatic channels; the third arbitrator should be appointed by the Contracting Parties within sixty (60) additional days. If one of the Contracting Parties has not appointed an arbitrator within the agreed period, or if the third arbitrator is not appointed within the agreed period, each Contracting Party may request the President of the Council of the ICAO to appoint an arbitrator or arbitrators, whichever is applicable;\n(b)\nthe third arbitrator appointed under the terms of paragraph a) above should be a national of a third State having diplomatic relations with each of the Contracting Parties at the time of appointment, and shall act as a President of the arbitration tribunal;\n(c)\nthe arbitration tribunal shall agree on its rules of procedure; and\n(d)\nsubject to the final decision of the arbitration tribunal, the expenses of the arbitration shall be shared equally by the Contracting Parties.\n5.   At the request of a Contracting Party the arbitration tribunal may order the other Contracting Party to implement interim relief measures pending the arbitration tribunal's final decision.\n6.   The arbitration tribunal shall seek to adopt any provisional decision or final decision by consensus. Where consensus is not possible, the arbitration tribunal shall adopt its decisions by majority voting.\n7.   If one of the Contracting Parties does not act in conformity with a decision of the arbitration tribunal taken under the terms of this Article within thirty (30) days from the notification of the aforementioned decision, the other Contracting Party may, for as long as this failure endures, limit, suspend or revoke the rights or privileges which it had granted under the terms of this Agreement to the Contracting Party at fault.\nArticle 24\nSafeguard Measures\n1.   The Contracting Parties shall take any general or specific measures required to fulfil their obligations under this Agreement. They shall see to it that the objectives set out in this Agreement are attained.\n2.   If either Contracting Party considers that the other Contracting Party has failed to fulfil an obligation under this Agreement, it may take appropriate measures. Safeguard measures shall be restricted with regard to their scope and duration to what is strictly necessary in order to remedy the situation or maintain the balance of this Agreement. Priority shall be given to such measures which will least disturb the functioning of this Agreement.\n3.   A Contracting Party which is considering taking safeguard measures shall notify the other Contracting Party through the Joint Committee and shall provide all relevant information.\n4.   The Contracting Parties shall immediately enter into consultations in the Joint Committee with a view to finding a commonly acceptable solution.\n5.   Without prejudice to Articles 3(1)(d) (Authorisation) and 4(1)(d) (Refusal, Revocation, Suspension or Limitation of Authorisation) and Articles 13 (Aviation Safety) and 14 (Aviation Security), the Contracting Party concerned may not take safeguard measures until one month has elapsed after the date of notification under paragraph 3, unless the consultation procedure under paragraph 4 has been concluded before the expiration of the stated time limit.\n6.   The Contracting Party concerned shall, without delay, notify the measures taken to the Joint Committee and shall provide all relevant information.\n7.   Any action taken under the terms of this Article shall be suspended, as soon as the Contracting Party at fault satisfies the provisions of this Agreement.\nArticle 25\nGeographic Extension of the Agreement\nThe Contracting Parties commit to conduct a continuous dialogue to ensure the coherence of this Agreement with the Barcelona process, and they aim, as their ultimate goal, at a Common Euro-Mediterranean Aviation Area. Therefore, the possibility of mutually agreeing upon amendments to take into account similar Euro-Mediterranean aviation agreements shall be discussed within the Joint Committee in accordance with Article 22(11).\nArticle 26\nRelationship to Other Agreements\n1.   The provisions of this Agreement supersede the relevant provisions of existing bilateral agreements and arrangements between Israel and the Member States. However, notwithstanding any term of this Agreement, existing traffic rights, security arrangements which originate from these bilateral agreements or other arrangements which are not covered under this Agreement, or which are more favourable, can continue to be exercised. As far as air carriers are concerned, such rights and arrangements can continue to be exercised by:\n(a)\nAir carriers of the European Union, provided that there is no discrimination in the execution of these existing rights or other arrangements between air carriers of the European Union on the basis of nationality.\n(b)\nAir carriers of the State of Israel.\n2.   If the Contracting Parties become parties to a multilateral agreement, or endorse a decision adopted by the ICAO or another international organisation, that addresses matters covered by this Agreement, they shall consult in the Joint Committee to determine whether this Agreement should be revised to take into account such developments.\n3.   This Agreement shall be without prejudice to any decision by the two Contracting Parties to implement future recommendations that may be made by the ICAO. The Contracting Parties shall not cite this Agreement, or any part of it, as the basis for opposing consideration in the ICAO of alternative policies on any matter covered by this Agreement.\n4.   The Contracting Parties agree that there will be no restriction or prevention to conclude, in the future, security arrangements between the Government of the State of Israel and each Government of the Member States of the European Union in security areas that fall outside the scope of the exclusive competence of the EU. However, the Contracting Parties agree (i) to privilege, when possible and in accordance with paragraph 5 of Article 14, the conclusion of Security arrangement at the EU level, and (ii) to provide the Joint Committee with the relevant information concerning those bilateral security arrangements, subject to Article 14, paragraph 14.\nArticle 27\nAmendments\n1.   If one of the Contracting Parties wishes to revise the provisions of this Agreement, it shall notify the Joint Committee accordingly. The amendment to this Agreement shall enter into force in accordance with Article 30.\n2.   The Joint Committee may, upon the proposal of one Contracting Party and in accordance with this Article, decide to modify the Annexes of this Agreement.\n3.   This Agreement shall be without prejudice to the right of each Contracting Party, subject to compliance with the principle of non-discrimination and the provisions of this Agreement to unilaterally adopt new legislation or amend its existing legislation in the field of air transport mentioned in Annex IV, with respect to the principle of non-discrimination and in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement.\n4.   When new legislation or amendment to its existing legislation in the field of air transport mentioned in Annex IV is being considered by one of the Contracting Parties, it shall inform the other Contracting Party as appropriate and possible. Providing such information and, at the request of one of the Contracting Parties, a preliminary exchange of views may take place in the Joint Committee.\n5.   Each Contracting Party shall regularly and as soon as appropriate inform the other Contracting Party of newly adopted legislation or amendment to its existing legislation in the field of air transport mentioned in Annex IV. Providing such information may take place in the Joint Committee. Upon the request of any Contracting Party, the Joint Committee shall within sixty days hold an exchange of views on the implications of such new legislation or amendment for the proper functioning of this Agreement.\n6.   In order to safeguard the proper functioning of this Agreement, the Joint Committee shall:\n(a)\nadopt a decision revising Annexes IV and/or VI of this Agreement so as to integrate therein, if necessary on a basis of reciprocity, the new legislation or amendment in question; or\n(b)\nadopt a decision to the effect that the new legislation or amendment in question shall be regarded as in accordance with this Agreement; or\n(c)\ndecide any other measures, to be adopted within a reasonable period of time, regarding the new legislation or amendment in question.\nArticle 28\nTermination\n1.   This Agreement is concluded for an unlimited period.\n2.   Either Party may, at any time, give notice in writing through diplomatic channels to the other Party of its decision to terminate this Agreement. Such notice shall be sent simultaneously to the ICAO. This Agreement shall terminate at midnight GMT at the end of the IATA traffic season in effect one year following the date of written notification of termination, unless the notice is withdrawn by agreement of the Contracting Parties before the expiry of this period.\nArticle 29\nRegistration with the International Civil Aviation Organisation and the United Nations Secretariat\nThis Agreement and all amendments thereto shall be registered with the ICAO and with the UN Secretariat.\nArticle 30\nApplication and Entry into force\n1.   This Agreement shall be applied provisionally, in accordance with the national laws of the Contracting Parties, as of the date of its signature by the Contracting Parties.\n2.   This Agreement shall enter into force one month after the date of the last note in an exchange of diplomatic notes between the Contracting Parties confirming that all necessary procedures for entry into force of this Agreement have been completed.
