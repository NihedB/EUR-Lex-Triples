{"celex_id": "32016R0794", "reference": "24.5.2016\nEN\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\nL 135/53\nREGULATION (EU) 2016/794 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL\nof 11 May 2016\non the European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Cooperation (Europol) and replacing and repealing Council Decisions 2009/371/JHA, 2009/934/JHA, 2009/935/JHA, 2009/936/JHA and 2009/968/JHA\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 88 thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,\nActing in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure (1),\nWhereas:\n(1)\nEuropol was set up by Council Decision 2009/371/JHA (2) as an entity of the Union funded from the general budget of the Union to support and strengthen action by competent authorities of the Member States and their mutual cooperation in preventing and combating organised crime, terrorism and other forms of serious crime affecting two or more Member States. Decision 2009/371/JHA replaced the Convention based on Article K.3 of the Treaty on European Union, on the establishment of a European Police Office (Europol Convention) (3).\n(2)\nArticle 88 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) provides for Europol to be governed by a regulation to be adopted in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure. It also requires the establishment of procedures for the scrutiny of Europol's activities by the European Parliament, together with national parliaments, subject to point (c) of Article 12 of the Treaty on European Union (TEU) and Article 9 of Protocol No 1 on the role of National Parliaments in the European Union, annexed to the TEU and to the TFEU (‘Protocol No 1’), in order to enhance the democratic legitimacy and accountability of Europol to the Union's citizens. Therefore, Decision 2009/371/JHA should be replaced by a regulation laying down, inter alia, rules on parliamentary scrutiny.\n(3)\nThe ‘Stockholm programme — An open and secure Europe serving and protecting citizens’ (4) calls for Europol to evolve and become a hub for information exchange between the law enforcement authorities of the Member States, a service provider and a platform for law enforcement services. On the basis of an assessment of Europol's functioning, further enhancement of its operational effectiveness is needed to meet that objective.\n(4)\nLarge-scale criminal and terrorist networks pose a significant threat to the internal security of the Union and to the safety and livelihood of its citizens. Available threat assessments show that criminal groups are becoming increasingly poly-criminal and cross-border in their activities. National law enforcement authorities therefore need to cooperate more closely with their counterparts in other Member States. In this context, it is necessary to equip Europol to better support Member States in Union-wide crime prevention, analyses and investigations. This was also confirmed in the evaluation of Decision 2009/371/JHA.\n(5)\nThis Regulation aims to amend and expand the provisions of Decision 2009/371/JHA and of Council Decisions 2009/934/JHA (5), 2009/935/JHA (6), 2009/936/JHA (7) and 2009/968/JHA (8) implementing Decision 2009/371/JHA. Since the amendments to be made are of a substantial number and nature, those Decisions should, in the interests of clarity, be replaced in their entirety in relation to the Member States bound by this Regulation. Europol as established by this Regulation should replace and assume the functions of Europol as established by Decision 2009/371/JHA, which, as a consequence, should be repealed.\n(6)\nAs serious crime often occurs across internal borders, Europol should support and strengthen Member States' actions and their cooperation in preventing and combating serious crime affecting two or more Member States. Given that terrorism is one of the most significant threats to the security of the Union, Europol should assist Member States in facing common challenges in this regard. As the Union law enforcement agency, Europol should also support and strengthen actions and cooperation in tackling forms of crime that affect the interests of the Union. Among the forms of crime with which Europol is competent to deal, organised crime will continue to fall within the scope of Europol's main objectives, as, given its scale, significance and consequences, it also calls for a common approach by the Member States. Europol should also offer support in preventing and combating related criminal offences which are committed in order to procure the means of perpetrating acts in respect of which Europol is competent or to facilitate or perpetrate such acts or to ensure the impunity of committing them.\n(7)\nEuropol should provide strategic analyses and threat assessments to assist the Council and the Commission in laying down strategic and operational priorities of the Union for fighting crime and in the operational implementation of those priorities. Where the Commission so requests in accordance with Article 8 of Council Regulation (EU) No 1053/2013 (9), Europol should also carry out risk analyses, including in respect of organised crime, insofar as the risks concerned may undermine the application of the Schengen acquis by the Member States. Moreover, at the request of the Council or the Commission where appropriate, Europol should provide strategic analyses and threat assessments to contribute to the evaluation of states that are candidates for accession to the Union.\n(8)\nAttacks against information systems affecting Union bodies or two or more Member States are a growing menace in the Union, in particular in view of their speed and impact and the difficulty in identifying their sources. When considering requests by Europol to initiate an investigation into a serious attack of suspected criminal origin against information systems affecting Union bodies or two or more Member States, Member States should respond to Europol without delay, taking into account the fact that the rapidity of the response is a key factor in successfully tackling computer crime.\n(9)\nGiven the importance of the inter-agency cooperation, Europol and Eurojust should ensure that necessary arrangements are established to optimise their operational cooperation, taking due account of their respective missions and mandates and of the interests of Member States. In particular, Europol and Eurojust should keep each other informed of any activity involving the financing of joint investigation teams.\n(10)\nWhen a joint investigation team is set up, the relevant agreement should determine the conditions relating to the participation of the Europol staff in the team. Europol should keep a record of its participation in such joint investigation teams targeting criminal activities falling within the scope of its objectives.\n(11)\nEuropol should be able to request Member States to initiate, conduct or coordinate criminal investigations in specific cases where cross-border cooperation would add value. Europol should inform Eurojust of such requests.\n(12)\nEuropol should be a hub for information exchange in the Union. Information collected, stored, processed, analysed and exchanged by Europol includes criminal intelligence which relates to information about crime or criminal activities falling within the scope of Europol's objectives, obtained with a view to establishing whether concrete criminal acts have been committed or may be committed in the future.\n(13)\nIn order to ensure Europol's effectiveness as a hub for information exchange, clear obligations should be laid down requiring Member States to provide Europol with the data necessary for it to fulfil its objectives. While implementing such obligations, Member States should pay particular attention to providing data relevant to the fight against crimes considered to be strategic and operational priorities within relevant policy instruments of the Union, in particular the priorities set by the Council in the framework of the EU Policy Cycle for organised and serious international crime. Member States should also endeavour to provide Europol with a copy of bilateral and multilateral exchanges of information with other Member States on crime falling within Europol's objectives. When supplying Europol with the necessary information, Member States should also include information about any alleged cyber attacks affecting Union bodies located in their territory. At the same time, Europol should increase the level of its support to Member States, so as to enhance mutual cooperation and the sharing of information. Europol should submit an annual report to the European Parliament, to the Council, to the Commission and to national parliaments on the information provided by the individual Member States.\n(14)\nTo ensure effective cooperation between Europol and Member States, a national unit should be set up in each Member State (the ‘national unit’). The national unit should be the liaison link between national competent authorities and Europol, thereby having a coordinating role in respect of Member States' cooperation with Europol, and thus helping to ensure that each Member State responds to Europol requests in a uniform way. To ensure a continuous and effective exchange of information between Europol and the national units, and to facilitate their cooperation, each national unit should designate at least one liaison officer to be attached to Europol.\n(15)\nTaking into account the decentralised structure of some Member States and the need to ensure rapid exchanges of information, Europol should be allowed to cooperate directly with competent authorities in Member States, subject to the conditions defined by Member States, while keeping the national units informed at the latter's request.\n(16)\nThe establishment of joint investigation teams should be encouraged and Europol staff should be able to participate in them. To ensure that such participation is possible in every Member State, Council Regulation (Euratom, ECSC, EEC) No 549/69 (10) provides that Europol staff do not benefit from immunities while they are participating in joint investigation teams.\n(17)\nIt is also necessary to improve the governance of Europol, by seeking efficiency gains and streamlining procedures.\n(18)\nThe Commission and the Member States should be represented on the Management Board of Europol (the ‘Management Board’) to effectively supervise its work. The members and the alternate members of the Management Board should be appointed taking into account their relevant managerial, administrative and budgetary skills and knowledge of law enforcement cooperation. Alternate members should act as members in the absence of the member.\n(19)\nAll parties represented on the Management Board should make efforts to limit the turnover of their representatives, with a view to ensuring the continuity of the Management Board's work. All parties should aim to achieve a balanced representation between men and women on the Management Board.\n(20)\nThe Management Board should be able to invite non-voting observers whose opinion may be relevant for the discussion, including a representative designated by the Joint Parliamentary Scrutiny Group (JPSG).\n(21)\nThe Management Board should be given the necessary powers, in particular to set the budget, verify its execution, and adopt the appropriate financial rules and planning documents, as well as adopt rules for the prevention and management of conflicts of interest in respect of its members, establish transparent working procedures for decision-making by the Executive Director of Europol, and adopt the annual activity report. It should exercise the powers of appointing authority vis-à-vis staff of the agency, including the Executive Director.\n(22)\nTo ensure the efficient day-to-day functioning of Europol, the Executive Director should be its legal representative and manager, acting independently in the performance of his or her duties and ensuring that Europol carries out the tasks provided for by this Regulation. In particular, the Executive Director should be responsible for preparing budgetary and planning documents submitted for the decision of the Management Board and for implementing the multiannual programming and annual work programmes of Europol and other planning documents.\n(23)\nFor the purposes of preventing and combating crime falling within the scope of its objectives, it is necessary for Europol to have the fullest and most up-to-date information possible. Therefore, Europol should be able to process data provided to it by Member States, Union bodies, third countries, international organisations and, under stringent conditions laid down by this Regulation, private parties, as well as data coming from publicly available sources, in order to develop an understanding of criminal phenomena and trends, to gather information about criminal networks, and to detect links between different criminal offences.\n(24)\nTo improve Europol's effectiveness in providing accurate crime analyses to the competent authorities of the Member States, it should use new technologies to process data. Europol should be able to swiftly detect links between investigations and common modi operandi across different criminal groups, to check cross-matches of data and to have a clear overview of trends, while guaranteeing a high level of protection of personal data for individuals. Therefore, Europol databases should be structured in such a way as to allow Europol to choose the most efficient IT structure. Europol should also be able to act as a service provider, in particular by providing a secure network for the exchange of data, such as the secure information exchange network application (SIENA), aimed at facilitating the exchange of information between Member States, Europol, other Union bodies, third countries and international organisations. In order to ensure a high level of data protection, the purpose of processing operations and access rights as well as specific additional safeguards should be laid down. In particular, the principles of necessity and proportionality should be observed with regard to the processing of personal data.\n(25)\nEuropol should ensure that all personal data processed for operational analyses are allocated a specific purpose. Nonetheless, in order for Europol to fulfil its mission, it should be allowed to process all personal data received to identify links between multiple crime areas and investigations, and should not be limited to identifying connections only within one crime area.\n(26)\nTo respect the ownership of data and the protection of personal data, Member States, Union bodies, third countries and international organisations should be able to determine the purpose or purposes for which Europol may process the data they provide and to restrict access rights. Purpose limitation is a fundamental principle of personal data processing; in particular, it contributes to transparency, legal certainty and predictability and is particularly of high importance in the area of law enforcement cooperation, where data subjects are usually unaware when their personal data are being collected and processed and where the use of personal data may have a very significant impact on the lives and freedoms of individuals.\n(27)\nTo ensure that data are accessed only by those needing access in order to perform their tasks, this Regulation should lay down detailed rules on different degrees of right of access to data processed by Europol. Such rules should be without prejudice to restrictions on access imposed by data providers, as the principle of ownership of data should be respected. In order to increase efficiency in the prevention and combating of crimes falling within the scope of Europol's objectives, Europol should notify Member States of information which concerns them.\n(28)\nTo enhance operational cooperation between the agencies, and particularly to establish links between data already in the possession of the different agencies, Europol should enable Eurojust and the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) to have access, on the basis of a hit/no hit system, to data available at Europol. Europol and Eurojust should be able to conclude a working arrangement ensuring, in a reciprocal manner within their respective mandates, access to, and the possibility of searching, all information that has been provided for the purpose of cross-checking in accordance with specific safeguards and data protection guarantees provided for in this Regulation. Any access to data available at Europol should, by technical means, be limited to information falling within the respective mandates of those Union bodies.\n(29)\nEuropol should maintain cooperative relations with other Union bodies, authorities of third countries, international organisations and private parties, to the extent required for the accomplishment of its tasks.\n(30)\nTo ensure operational effectiveness, Europol should be able to exchange all relevant information, with the exception of personal data, with other Union bodies, authorities of third countries and international organisations, to the extent necessary for the performance of its tasks. Since companies, firms, business associations, non-governmental organisations and other private parties hold expertise and information of direct relevance to the prevention and combating of serious crime and terrorism, Europol should also be able to exchange such information with private parties. To prevent and combat cybercrime, as related to network and information security incidents, Europol should, pursuant to the applicable legislative act of the Union laying down measures to ensure a high common level of network and information security across the Union, cooperate and exchange information, with the exception of personal data, with national authorities competent for the security of network and information systems.\n(31)\nEuropol should be able to exchange relevant personal data with other Union bodies to the extent necessary for the accomplishment of its or their tasks.\n(32)\nSerious crime and terrorism often have links beyond the territory of the Union. Europol should therefore be able to exchange personal data with authorities of third countries and with international organisations such as the International Criminal Police Organisation — Interpol to the extent necessary for the accomplishment of its tasks.\n(33)\nAll Member States are affiliated to Interpol. To fulfil its mission, Interpol receives, stores and circulates data to assist competent law enforcement authorities to prevent and combat international crime. Therefore, it is appropriate to strengthen cooperation between Europol and Interpol by promoting an efficient exchange of personal data whilst ensuring respect for fundamental rights and freedoms regarding the automatic processing of personal data. When personal data is transferred from Europol to Interpol, this Regulation, in particular the provisions on international transfers, should apply.\n(34)\nTo guarantee purpose limitation, it is important to ensure that personal data can be transferred by Europol to Union bodies, third countries and international organisations only if necessary for preventing and combating crime that falls within Europol's objectives. To this end, it is necessary to ensure that, when personal data are transferred, the recipient gives an undertaking that the data will be used by the recipient or transferred onward to a competent authority of a third country solely for the purpose for which they were originally transferred. Further onward transfer of the data should take place in compliance with this Regulation.\n(35)\nEuropol should be able to transfer personal data to an authority of a third country or an international organisation on the basis of a Commission decision finding that the country or international organisation in question ensures an adequate level of data protection (‘adequacy decision’), or, in the absence of an adequacy decision, an international agreement concluded by the Union pursuant to Article 218 TFEU, or a cooperation agreement allowing for the exchange of personal data concluded between Europol and the third country prior to the entry into force of this Regulation. In light of Article 9 of Protocol No 36 on transitional provisions, annexed to the TEU and to the TFEU, the legal effects of such agreements are to be preserved until those agreements are repealed, annulled or amended in the implementation of the Treaties. Where appropriate and in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council (11), the Commission should be able to consult the European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPS) before and during the negotiation of an international agreement. Where the Management Board identifies an operational need for cooperation with a third country or an international organisation, it should be able to suggest to the Council that the latter draw the attention of the Commission to the need for an adequacy decision or for a recommendation for the opening of negotiations on an international agreement as referred to above.\n(36)\nWhere a transfer of personal data cannot be based on an adequacy decision, an international agreement concluded by the Union or an existing cooperation agreement, the Management Board, in agreement with the EDPS, should be allowed to authorise a set of transfers, where specific conditions so require and provided that adequate safeguards are ensured. The Executive Director should be allowed to authorise the transfer of data in exceptional cases on a case-by-case basis, where such transfer is required, under specific strict conditions.\n(37)\nEuropol should be able to process personal data originating from private parties and private persons only if those data are transferred to Europol by one of the following: a national unit in accordance with its national law; a contact point in a third country or an international organisation with which there is established cooperation through a cooperation agreement allowing for the exchange of personal data concluded in accordance with Article 23 of Decision 2009/371/JHA prior to the entry into force of this Regulation; an authority of a third country or an international organisation which is subject to an adequacy decision or with which the Union has concluded an international agreement pursuant to Article 218 TFEU. However, in cases where Europol receives personal data directly from private parties and the national unit, contact point or authority concerned cannot be identified, Europol should be able to process those personal data solely for the purpose of identifying those entities, and such data should be deleted unless those entities resubmit those personal data within four months after the transfer takes place. Europol should ensure by technical means that, during that period, such data would not be accessible for processing for any other purpose.\n(38)\nTaking into account the exceptional and specific threat posed to the internal security of the Union by terrorism and other forms of serious crime, especially when facilitated, promoted or committed using the internet, the activities that Europol should undertake on the basis of this Regulation, stemming from its implementation of the Council Conclusions of 12 March 2015 and the call by the European Council of 23 April 2015 in relation especially to those priority areas, in particular the corresponding practice of direct exchanges of personal data with private parties, should be evaluated by the Commission by 1 May 2019.\n(39)\nAny information which has clearly been obtained in obvious violation of human rights should not be processed.\n(40)\nData protection rules at Europol should be strengthened and should draw on the principles underpinning Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 to ensure a high level of protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data. As Declaration No 21 on the protection of personal data in the fields of judicial cooperation in criminal matters and police cooperation, attached to the TEU and the TFEU, recognises the specificity of personal data processing in the law enforcement context, the data protection rules of Europol should be autonomous while at the same time consistent with other relevant data protection instruments applicable in the area of police cooperation in the Union. Those instruments include, in particular, Directive (EU) 2016/680 of the European Parliament and of the Council (12), as well as the Convention for the Protection of Individuals with regard to Automatic Processing of Personal Data of the Council of Europe and its Recommendation No R(87) 15 (13).\n(41)\nAny processing of personal data by Europol should be lawful and fair in relation to the data subjects concerned. The principle of fair processing requires transparency of processing allowing data subjects concerned to exercise their rights under this Regulation. It should be possible nevertheless to refuse or restrict access to their personal data if, with due regard to the interests of the data subjects concerned, such refusal or restriction constitutes a necessary measure to enable Europol to fulfil its tasks properly, to protect security and public order or to prevent crime, to guarantee that a national investigation will not be jeopardised or to protect the rights and freedoms of third parties. To enhance transparency, Europol should make publicly available a document setting out in an intelligible form the applicable provisions regarding the processing of personal data and the means available to data subjects to exercise their rights. Europol should also publish on its website a list of adequacy decisions, agreements and administrative arrangements relating to the transfer of personal data to third countries and international organisations. Moreover, in order to increase Europol's transparency vis-à-vis Union citizens and its accountability, Europol should publish on its website a list of its Management Board members and, where appropriate, the summaries of the outcome of the meetings of the Management Board, while respecting data protection requirements.\n(42)\nAs far as possible, personal data should be distinguished according to their degree of accuracy and reliability. Facts should be distinguished from personal assessments, in order to ensure both the protection of individuals and the quality and reliability of the information processed by Europol. In the case of information obtained from publicly available sources, particularly sources on the internet, Europol should as far as possible assess the accuracy of such information and the reliability of its source with particular diligence in order to address the risks associated with the internet as regards the protection of personal data and privacy.\n(43)\nPersonal data relating to different categories of data subjects are processed in the area of law enforcement cooperation. Europol should make distinctions between personal data in respect of different categories of data subjects as clear as possible. Personal data concerning persons such as victims, witnesses and persons possessing relevant information, as well as personal data concerning minors, should in particular be protected. Europol should only process sensitive data if those data supplement other personal data already processed by Europol.\n(44)\nIn the light of the fundamental right to the protection of personal data, Europol should not store personal data for longer than is necessary for the performance of its tasks. The need for continued storage of such data should be reviewed no later than three years after the start of its initial processing.\n(45)\nTo guarantee the security of personal data, Europol and Member States should implement necessary technical and organisational measures.\n(46)\nAny data subject should have a right of access to personal data concerning him or her, a right to rectification if those data are inaccurate, and a right to erasure or restriction if those data are no longer required. The costs related to exercising the right of access to personal data should not represent a barrier to effectively exercising that right. The rights of the data subject and the exercise thereof should not affect the obligations incumbent upon Europol and should be subject to the restrictions laid down in this Regulation.\n(47)\nThe protection of the rights and freedoms of data subjects requires a clear attribution of the responsibilities under this Regulation. In particular, Member States should be responsible for the accuracy of data, for keeping up to date the data they have transferred to Europol and for the legality of such data transfers. Europol should be responsible for the accuracy of data and for keeping up to date the data provided by other data suppliers or resulting from Europol's own analyses. Europol should ensure that data are processed fairly and lawfully, and are collected and processed for a specific purpose. Europol should also ensure that the data are adequate, relevant, not excessive in relation to the purpose for which they are processed, stored no longer than is necessary for that purpose, and processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security of personal data and confidentiality of data processing.\n(48)\nEuropol should keep records of collection, alteration, access, disclosure, combination or erasure of personal data for the purposes of verifying the lawfulness of the data processing, self-monitoring and ensuring proper data integrity and security. Europol should be obliged to co-operate with the EDPS and to make logs or documentation available upon request, so that they can be used for monitoring processing operations.\n(49)\nEuropol should designate a Data Protection Officer to assist it in monitoring compliance with this Regulation. The Data Protection Officer should be in a position to perform his or her duties and tasks independently and effectively, and should be provided with the necessary resources to do so.\n(50)\nIndependent, transparent, accountable and effective structures for supervision are essential for the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data as required by Article 8(3) of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. National authorities competent for the supervision of the processing of personal data should monitor the lawfulness of personal data provided by Member States to Europol. The EDPS should monitor the lawfulness of data processing carried out by Europol, exercising his or her functions with complete independence. In this regard, the prior consultation mechanism is an important safeguard for new types of processing operations. This should not apply to specific individual operational activities, such as operational analysis projects, but to the use of new IT systems for the processing of personal data and any substantial changes thereto.\n(51)\nIt is important to ensure strengthened and effective supervision of Europol and to guarantee that the EDPS can make use of appropriate law enforcement data protection expertise when he or she assumes responsibility for data protection supervision of Europol. The EDPS and national supervisory authorities should closely cooperate with each other on specific issues requiring national involvement and should ensure the consistent application of this Regulation throughout the Union.\n(52)\nIn order to facilitate the cooperation between the EDPS and the national supervisory authorities, but without prejudice to the independence of the EDPS and his or her responsibility for data protection supervision of Europol, they should regularly meet within the Cooperation Board, which, as an advisory body, should deliver opinions, guidelines, recommendations and best practices on various issues requiring national involvement.\n(53)\nAs Europol also processes non-operational personal data, unrelated to criminal investigations, such as personal data concerning staff of Europol, service providers or visitors, the processing of such data should be subject to Regulation (EC) No 45/2001.\n(54)\nThe EDPS should hear and investigate complaints lodged by data subjects. The investigation following a complaint should be carried out, subject to judicial review, to the extent that is appropriate in the specific case. The national supervisory authority should inform the data subject of the progress and the outcome of the complaint within a reasonable period.\n(55)\nAny individual should have the right to a judicial remedy against a decision of the EDPS concerning him or her.\n(56)\nEuropol should be subject to the general rules on contractual and non-contractual liability applicable to Union institutions, agencies and bodies, save as regards the rules on liability for unlawful data processing.\n(57)\nIt may be unclear for the individual concerned whether damage suffered as a result of unlawful data processing is a consequence of action by Europol or by a Member State. Europol and the Member State in which the event that gave rise to the damage occurred should therefore be jointly and severally liable.\n(58)\nWhile respecting the role of the European Parliament together with national parliaments in the scrutiny of Europol's activities, it is necessary that Europol be a fully accountable and transparent internal organisation. To that end, in light of Article 88 TFEU, procedures should be established for the scrutiny of Europol's activities by the European Parliament together with national parliaments. Such procedures should be subject to point (c) of Article 12 TEU and to Article 9 of Protocol No 1, providing that the European Parliament and national parliaments are together to determine the organisation and promotion of effective and regular interparliamentary cooperation within the Union. The procedures to be established for the scrutiny of Europol's activities should take due account of the need to ensure that the European Parliament and the national parliaments stand on an equal footing, as well as the need to safeguard the confidentiality of operational information. However, the way in which national parliaments scrutinise their governments in relation to the activities of the Union is a matter for the particular constitutional organisation and practice of each Member State.\n(59)\nThe Staff Regulations of Officials of the European Union (the ‘Staff Regulations’) and the Conditions of Employment of Other Servants of the European Union (the ‘Conditions of Employment of Other Servants’) laid down in Council Regulation (EEC, Euratom, ECSC) No 259/68 (14) should apply to Europol staff. Europol should be able to employ staff from the competent authorities of the Member States as temporary agents whose period of service should be limited in order to maintain the principle of rotation, as the subsequent reintegration of such staff members into the service of their competent authority facilitates close cooperation between Europol and the competent authorities of the Member States. Member States should take any measure necessary to ensure that staff engaged at Europol as temporary agents may, at the end of their term of service at Europol, return to the national civil service to which they belong.\n(60)\nGiven the nature of the duties of Europol and the role of the Executive Director, the competent committee of the European Parliament should be able to invite the Executive Director to appear before it prior to his or her appointment, as well as prior to any extension of his or her term of office. The Executive Director should also present the annual report to the European Parliament and to the Council. Furthermore, the European Parliament and the Council should be able to invite the Executive Director to report on the performance of his or her duties.\n(61)\nTo guarantee the full autonomy and independence of Europol, it should be granted an autonomous budget, with revenue coming essentially from a contribution from the general budget of the Union. The Union budgetary procedure should be applicable as far as the Union contribution and any other subsidies chargeable to the general budget of the Union are concerned. The auditing of accounts should be undertaken by the Court of Auditors.\n(62)\nCommission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 1271/2013 (15) should apply to Europol.\n(63)\nGiven their specific legal and administrative powers and their technical competences in conducting cross-border information-exchange activities, operations and investigations, including in joint investigation teams, and in providing facilities for training, the competent authorities of the Member States should be able to receive grants from Europol without a call for proposals in accordance with point (d) of Article 190(1) of Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 1268/2012 (16).\n(64)\nRegulation (EU, Euratom) No 883/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council (17) should apply to Europol.\n(65)\nEuropol processes data that require particular protection as they include sensitive non-classified and EU classified information. Europol should therefore draw up rules on the confidentiality and processing of such information. The rules on the protection of EU classified information should be consistent with Council Decision 2013/488/EU (18).\n(66)\nIt is appropriate to evaluate the application of this Regulation regularly.\n(67)\nThe necessary provisions regarding accommodation for Europol in The Hague, where it has its headquarters, and the specific rules applicable to all Europol's staff and members of their families should be laid down in a headquarters agreement. Furthermore, the host Member State should provide the necessary conditions for the smooth operation of Europol, including multilingual, European-oriented schooling and appropriate transport connections, so as to attract high-quality human resources from as wide a geographical area as possible.\n(68)\nEuropol as established by this Regulation replaces and succeeds Europol as established by Decision 2009/371/JHA. It should therefore be the legal successor of all its contracts, including employment contracts, liabilities and properties acquired. International agreements concluded by Europol as established by Decision 2009/371/JHA and agreements concluded by Europol as established by the Europol Convention before 1 January 2010 should remain in force.\n(69)\nTo enable Europol to continue to fulfil the tasks of Europol as established by Decision 2009/371/JHA to the best of its abilities, transitional measures should be laid down, in particular with regard to the Management Board, the Executive Director and staff employed under a contract of indefinite duration as a local staff member concluded by Europol as established by the Europol Convention, who should be offered the possibility of employment as a member of the temporary or contract staff under the Conditions of Employment of Other Servants.\n(70)\nThe Council Act of 3 December 1998 (19) on Europol staff regulations has been repealed by Article 63 of Decision 2009/371/JHA. However, it should continue to apply to staff employed by Europol before the entry into force of Decision 2009/371/JHA. Therefore, transitional provisions should provide that contracts concluded in accordance with those staff regulations are to remain governed by them.\n(71)\nSince the objective of this Regulation, namely the establishment of an entity responsible for law enforcement cooperation at Union level, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States but can rather, by reason of the scale and effects of the action, be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 TEU. In accordance with the principle of proportionality as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve that objective.\n(72)\nIn accordance with Article 3 and Article 4a(1) of Protocol No 21 on the position of the United Kingdom and Ireland in respect of the area of freedom, security and justice, annexed to the TEU and to the TFEU, Ireland has notified its wish to take part in the adoption and application of this Regulation.\n(73)\nIn accordance with Articles 1 and 2 and Article 4a(1) of Protocol No 21 on the position of the United Kingdom and Ireland in respect of the area of freedom, security and justice, annexed to the TEU and the TFEU, and without prejudice to Article 4 of that Protocol, the United Kingdom is not taking part in the adoption of this Regulation and is not bound by it or subject to its application.\n(74)\nIn accordance with Articles 1 and 2 of Protocol No 22 on the position of Denmark, annexed to the TEU and to the TFEU, Denmark is not taking part in the adoption of this Regulation and is not bound by it or subject to its application.\n(75)\nThe EDPS has been consulted and issued an opinion on 31 May 2013.\n(76)\nThis Regulation respects the fundamental rights and observes the principles recognised in particular by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, in particular the right to the protection of personal data and the right to privacy as protected by Articles 8 and 7 of the Charter, as well as by Article 16 TFEU,\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nCHAPTER I\nGENERAL PROVISIONS, OBJECTIVES AND TASKS OF EUROPOL\nArticle 1\nEstablishment of the European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Cooperation\n1.

The Management Board, after consulting the EDPS, shall, as appropriate, adopt guidelines further specifying procedures for the processing of information for the purposes listed in paragraph 2 in accordance with point (q) of Article 11(1).\nArticle 19\nDetermination of the purpose of, and restrictions on, the processing of information by Europol\n1.   A Member State, a Union body, a third country or an international organisation providing information to Europol shall determine the purpose or purposes for which it is to be processed, as referred to in Article 18. If it has not done so, Europol, in agreement with the provider of the information concerned, shall process the information in order to determine the relevance of such information as well as the purpose or purposes for which it is to be further processed. Europol may process information for a purpose different from that for which information has been provided only if authorised so to do by the provider of the information.\n2.   Member States, Union bodies, third countries and international organisations may indicate, at the moment of providing information to Europol, any restriction on access thereto or the use to be made thereof, in general or specific terms, including as regards its transfer, erasure or destruction. Where the need for such restrictions becomes apparent after the information has been provided, they shall inform Europol accordingly. Europol shall comply with such restrictions.\n3.   In duly justified cases Europol may assign restrictions to access or use by Member States, Union bodies, third countries and international organisations of information retrieved from publicly available sources.\nArticle 20\nAccess by Member States and Europol's staff to information stored by Europol\n1.   Member States shall, in accordance with their national law and Article 7(5), have access to, and be able to search, all information which has been provided for the purposes of points (a) and (b) of Article 18(2). This shall be without prejudice to the right of Member States, Union bodies, third countries and international organisations to indicate any restrictions in accordance with Article 19(2).\n2.   Member States shall, in accordance with their national law and Article 7(5), have indirect access on the basis of a hit/no hit system to information provided for the purposes of point (c) of Article 18(2). This shall be without prejudice to any restrictions indicated by the Member States, Union bodies and third countries or international organisations providing the information, in accordance with Article 19(2).\nIn the case of a hit, Europol shall initiate the procedure by which the information that generated the hit may be shared, in accordance with the decision of the provider of the information to Europol.\n3.   In accordance with national law, the information referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 shall be accessed and further processed by Member States only for the purpose of preventing and combating:\n(a)\nforms of crime in respect of which Europol is competent; and\n(b)\nother forms of serious crime, as set out in Council Framework Decision 2002/584/JHA (22).\n4.   Europol staff duly empowered by the Executive Director shall have access to information processed by Europol to the extent required for the performance of their duties and without prejudice to Article 67.\nArticle 21\nAccess by Eurojust and OLAF to information stored by Europol\n1.   Europol shall take all appropriate measures to enable Eurojust and OLAF, within their respective mandates, to have indirect access on the basis of a hit/no hit system to information provided for the purposes of points (a), (b) and (c) of Article 18(2), without prejudice to any restrictions indicated by the Member State, Union body, third country or international organisation providing the information in question, in accordance with Article 19(2).\nIn the case of a hit, Europol shall initiate the procedure by which the information that generated the hit may be shared, in accordance with the decision of the provider of the information to Europol, and only to the extent that the data generating the hit are necessary for the performance of Eurojust's or OLAF's tasks.\n2.   Europol and Eurojust may conclude a working arrangement ensuring, in a reciprocal manner and within their respective mandates, access to, and the possibility of searching, all information that has been provided for the purpose specified in point (a) of Article 18(2). This shall be without prejudice to the right of Member States, Union bodies, third countries and international organisations to indicate restrictions on access to, and the use of, such data, and shall be in accordance with the data protection guarantees provided for in this Regulation.\n3.   Searches of information in accordance with paragraphs 1 and 2 shall be carried out only for the purpose of identifying whether information available at Eurojust or OLAF matches with information processed at Europol.\n4.   Europol shall allow searches in accordance with paragraphs 1 and 2 only after obtaining from Eurojust information on which National Members, Deputies and Assistants, as well as Eurojust staff members, and from OLAF information on which OLAF staff members, have been designated as authorised to perform such searches.\n5.   If, during Europol's information-processing activities in respect of an individual investigation, Europol or a Member State identifies the need for coordination, cooperation or support in accordance with the mandate of Eurojust or OLAF, Europol shall notify them to that effect and shall initiate the procedure for sharing the information, in accordance with the decision of the Member State providing the information. In such a case, Eurojust or OLAF shall consult with Europol.\n6.   Eurojust, including the College, the National Members, Deputies and Assistants, as well as Eurojust staff members, and OLAF, shall respect any restriction on access or use, in general or specific terms, indicated by Member States, Union bodies, third countries and international organisations in accordance with Article 19(2).\n7.   Europol, Eurojust and OLAF shall inform each other if, after consulting each other's data in accordance with paragraph 2 or as a result of a hit in accordance with paragraph 1, there are indications that data may be incorrect or may conflict with other data.\nArticle 22\nDuty to notify Member States\n1.   Europol shall, in accordance with point (b) of Article 4(1), notify a Member State without delay of any information concerning it. If such information is subject to access restrictions pursuant to Article 19(2) that would prohibit its being shared, Europol shall consult with the provider of the information stipulating the access restriction and seek its authorisation for sharing.\nIn such a case, the information shall not be shared without an explicit authorisation by the provider.\n2.   Irrespective of any access restrictions, Europol shall notify a Member State of any information concerning it if this is absolutely necessary in the interest of preventing an imminent threat to life.\nIn such a case, Europol shall at the same time notify the provider of the information about the sharing of the information and justify its analysis of the situation.\nCHAPTER V\nRELATIONS WITH PARTNERS\nSECTION 1\nCommon provisions\nArticle 23\nCommon provisions\n1.   In so far as necessary for the performance of its tasks, Europol may establish and maintain cooperative relations with Union bodies in accordance with the objectives of those bodies, the authorities of third countries, international organisations and private parties.\n2.   Subject to any restriction pursuant to Article 19(2) and without prejudice to Article 67, Europol may directly exchange all information, with the exception of personal data, with entities referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article, in so far as such an exchange is relevant for the performance of Europol's tasks.\n3.   The Executive Director shall inform the Management Board about any regular cooperative relations which Europol intends to establish and maintain in accordance with paragraphs 1 and 2, and about the development of such relations once established.\n4.   For the purposes set out in paragraphs 1 and 2, Europol may conclude working arrangements with entities referred to in paragraph 1. Such working arrangements shall not allow the exchange of personal data and shall not bind the Union or its Member States.\n5.   Europol may receive and process personal data from entities referred to in paragraph 1 insofar as necessary and proportionate for the legitimate performance of its tasks and subject to the provisions of this Chapter.\n6.   Without prejudice to Article 30(5), personal data shall only be transferred by Europol to Union bodies, third countries and international organisations if necessary for preventing and combating crime falling within the scope of Europol's objectives and in accordance with this Regulation, and if the recipient gives an undertaking that the data will be processed only for the purpose for which they were transferred. If the data to be transferred have been provided by a Member State, Europol shall seek that Member State's consent, unless the Member State has granted its prior authorisation to such onward transfer, either in general terms or subject to specific conditions. Such consent may be withdrawn at any time.\n7.   Onward transfers of personal data held by Europol by Member States, Union bodies, third countries and international organisations shall be prohibited, unless Europol has given its prior explicit authorisation.\n8.   Europol shall ensure that detailed records of all transfers of personal data and of the grounds for such transfers are recorded in accordance with this Regulation.\n9.   Any information which has clearly been obtained in obvious violation of human rights shall not be processed.\nSECTION 2\nTransfer and exchange of personal data\nArticle 24\nTransfer of personal data to Union bodies\nSubject to any possible restrictions pursuant to Article 19(2) or (3) and without prejudice to Article 67, Europol may directly transfer personal data to a Union body, insofar as such transfer is necessary for the performance of its tasks or those of the recipient Union body.\nArticle 25\nTransfer of personal data to third countries and international organisations\n1.   Subject to any possible restrictions pursuant to Article 19(2) or (3) and without prejudice to Article 67, Europol may transfer personal data to an authority of a third country or to an international organisation, insofar as such transfer is necessary for the performance of Europol's tasks, on the basis of one of the following:\n(a)\na decision of the Commission adopted in accordance with Article 36 of Directive (EU) 2016/680, finding that the third country or a territory or a processing sector within that third country or the international organisation in question ensures an adequate level of protection (‘adequacy decision’);\n(b)\nan international agreement concluded between the Union and that third country or international organisation pursuant to Article 218 TFEU adducing adequate safeguards with respect to the protection of privacy and fundamental rights and freedoms of individuals;\n(c)\na cooperation agreement allowing for the exchange of personal data concluded, before 1 May 2017, between Europol and that third country or international organisation in accordance with Article 23 of Decision 2009/371/JHA.\nEuropol may conclude administrative arrangements to implement such agreements or adequacy decisions.\n2.   The Executive Director shall inform the Management Board about exchanges of personal data on the basis of adequacy decisions pursuant to point (a) of paragraph 1.\n3.   Europol shall publish on its website and keep up to date a list of adequacy decisions, agreements, administrative arrangements and other instruments relating to the transfer of personal data in accordance with paragraph 1.\n4.   By 14 June 2021, the Commission shall assess the provisions contained in the cooperation agreements referred to in point (c) of paragraph 1, in particular those concerning data protection. The Commission shall inform the European Parliament and the Council about the outcome of that assessment, and may, if appropriate, submit to the Council a recommendation for a decision authorising the opening of negotiations for the conclusion of international agreements referred to in point (b) of paragraph (1).\n5.   By way of derogation from paragraph 1, the Executive Director may authorise the transfer of personal data to third countries or international organisations on a case-by-case basis if the transfer is:\n(a)\nnecessary in order to protect the vital interests of the data subject or of another person;\n(b)\nnecessary to safeguard legitimate interests of the data subject where the law of the Member State transferring the personal data so provides;\n(c)\nessential for the prevention of an immediate and serious threat to the public security of a Member State or a third country;\n(d)\nnecessary in individual cases for the purposes of the prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of criminal offences or the execution of criminal sanctions; or\n(e)\nnecessary in individual cases for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims relating to the prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of a specific criminal offence or the execution of a specific criminal sanction.\nPersonal data shall not be transferred if the Executive Director determines that fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject concerned override the public interest in the transfer referred to in points (d) and (e).\nDerogations may not be applicable to systematic, massive or structural transfers.\n6.   By way of derogation from paragraph 1, the Management Board may, in agreement with the EDPS, authorise for a period not exceeding one year, which shall be renewable, a set of transfers in accordance with points (a) to (e) of paragraph 5, taking into account the existence of adequate safeguards with respect to the protection of privacy and fundamental rights and freedoms of individuals. Such authorisation shall be duly justified and documented.\n7.   The Executive Director shall as soon as possible inform the Management Board and the EDPS of the cases in which paragraph 5 has been applied.\n8.   Europol shall keep detailed records of all transfers made pursuant to this Article.\nArticle 26\nExchanges of personal data with private parties\n1.   Insofar as is necessary in order for Europol to perform its tasks, Europol may process personal data obtained from private parties on condition that they are received via:\n(a)\na national unit in accordance with national law;\n(b)\nthe contact point of a third country or an international organisation with which Europol has concluded, before 1 May 2017, a cooperation agreement allowing for the exchange of personal data in accordance with Article 23 of Decision 2009/371/JHA; or\n(c)\nan authority of a third country or an international organisation which is the subject of an adequacy decision as referred to in point (a) of Article 25(1) of this Regulation or with which the Union has concluded an international agreement pursuant to Article 218 TFEU.\n2.   In cases where Europol nonetheless receives personal data directly from private parties and where the national unit, contact point or authority concerned, as referred to in paragraph 1, cannot be identified, Europol may process those personal data solely for the purpose of such identification. Subsequently, the personal data shall be forwarded immediately to the national unit, contact point or authority concerned and shall be deleted unless the national unit, contact point or authority concerned resubmits those personal data in accordance with Article 19(1) within four months after the transfer takes place. Europol shall ensure by technical means that, during that period, the data in question are not accessible for processing for any other purpose.\n3.   Following the transfer of personal data in accordance with point (c) of paragraph 5 of this Article, Europol may in connection therewith receive personal data directly from a private party which that private party declares it is legally allowed to transmit in accordance with the applicable law, in order to process such data for the performance of the task set out in point (m) of Article 4(1).\n4.   If Europol receives personal data from a private party in a third country with which there is no agreement concluded either on the basis of Article 23 of Decision 2009/371/JHA or on the basis of Article 218 TFEU, or which is not the subject of an adequacy decision as referred to in point (a) of Article 25(1) of this Regulation, Europol may forward those data only to a Member State, or to a third country concerned with which such an agreement has been concluded.\n5.   Europol may not transfer personal data to private parties except where, on a case-by-case basis where strictly necessary and subject to any possible restrictions stipulated pursuant to Article 19(2) or (3) and without prejudice to Article 67:\n(a)\nthe transfer is undoubtedly in the interests of the data subject, and either the data subject's consent has been given or the circumstances allow a clear presumption of consent; or\n(b)\nthe transfer is absolutely necessary in the interests of preventing the imminent perpetration of a crime, including terrorism, for which Europol is competent; or\n(c)\nthe transfer of personal data which are publicly available is strictly necessary for the performance of the task set out in point (m) of Article 4(1) and the following conditions are met:\n(i)\nthe transfer concerns an individual and specific case; and\n(ii)\nno fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subjects concerned override the public interest necessitating the transfer in the case at hand.\n6.   With regard to points (a) and (b) of paragraph 5 of this Article, if the private party concerned is not established within the Union or in a country with which Europol has a cooperation agreement allowing for the exchange of personal data, with which the Union has concluded an international agreement pursuant to Article 218 TFEU or which is the subject of an adequacy decision as referred to in point (a) of Article 25(1) of this Regulation, the transfer shall only be authorised if the transfer is:\n(a)\nnecessary in order to protect the vital interests of the data subject or another person; or\n(b)\nnecessary in order to safeguard legitimate interests of the data subject; or\n(c)\nessential for the prevention of an immediate and serious threat to public security of a Member State or a third country; or\n(d)\nnecessary in individual cases for the purposes of the prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of criminal offences for which Europol is competent; or\n(e)\nnecessary in individual cases for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims relating to the prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of a specific criminal offence for which Europol is competent.\n7.   Europol shall ensure that detailed records of all transfers of personal data and the grounds for such transfers are recorded in accordance with this Regulation and communicated upon request to the EDPS pursuant to Article 40.\n8.   If the personal data received or to be transferred affect the interests of a Member State, Europol shall immediately inform the national unit of the Member State concerned.\n9.   Europol shall not contact private parties to retrieve personal data.\n10.   The Commission shall evaluate the practice of direct exchanges of personal data with private parties by 1 May 2019.\nArticle 27\nInformation from private persons\n1.   Insofar as is necessary in order for Europol to perform its tasks, Europol may receive and process information originating from private persons. Personal data originating from private persons may only be processed by Europol on condition that they are received via:\n(a)\na national unit in accordance with national law;\n(b)\nthe contact point of a third country or an international organisation with which Europol has concluded, before 1 May 2017, a cooperation agreement allowing for the exchange of personal data in accordance with Article 23 of Decision 2009/371/JHA; or\n(c)\nan authority of a third country or an international organisation which is the subject of an adequacy decision as referred to in point (a) of Article 25(1) or with which the Union has concluded an international agreement pursuant to Article 218 TFEU.\n2.   If Europol receives information, including personal data, from a private person residing in a third country with which there is no international agreement concluded either on the basis of Article 23 of Decision 2009/371/JHA or on the basis of Article 218 TFEU, or which is not the subject of an adequacy decision as referred to in point (a) of Article 25(1) of this Regulation, Europol may only forward that information to a Member State or to a third country concerned with which such an international agreement has been concluded.\n3.   If the personal data received affect the interests of a Member State, Europol shall immediately inform the national unit of the Member State concerned.\n4.   Europol shall not contact private persons to retrieve information.\n5.   Without prejudice to Articles 36 and 37, Europol may not transfer personal data to private persons.\nCHAPTER VI\nDATA PROTECTION SAFEGUARDS\nArticle 28\nGeneral data protection principles\n1.   Personal data shall be:\n(a)\nprocessed fairly and lawfully;\n(b)\ncollected for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes and not further processed in a manner incompatible with those purposes. Further processing of personal data for historical, statistical or scientific research purposes shall not be considered incompatible provided that Europol provides appropriate safeguards, in particular to ensure that data are not processed for any other purposes;\n(c)\nadequate, relevant, and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which they are processed;\n(d)\naccurate and kept up to date; every reasonable step must be taken to ensure that personal data that are inaccurate, having regard to the purposes for which they are processed, are erased or rectified without delay;\n(e)\nkept in a form which permits identification of data subjects for no longer than necessary for the purposes for which the personal data are processed; and\n(f)\nprocessed in a manner that ensures appropriate security of personal data.\n2.   Europol shall make publicly available a document setting out in an intelligible form the provisions regarding the processing of personal data and the means available for the exercise of the rights of data subjects.\nArticle 29\nAssessment of reliability of the source and accuracy of information\n1.   The reliability of the source of information originating from a Member State shall be assessed as far as possible by the providing Member State using the following source evaluation codes:\n(A): where there is no doubt as to the authenticity, trustworthiness and competence of the source, or if the information is provided by a source which has proved to be reliable in all instances;\n(B): where the information is provided by a source which has in most instances proved to be reliable;\n(C): where the information is provided by a source which has in most instances proved to be unreliable;\n(X): where the reliability of the source cannot be assessed.\n2.   The accuracy of information originating from a Member State shall be assessed as far as possible by the providing Member State using the following information evaluation codes:\n(1): information the accuracy of which is not in doubt;\n(2): information known personally to the source but not known personally to the official passing it on;\n(3): information not known personally to the source but corroborated by other information already recorded;\n(4): information not known personally to the source and which cannot be corroborated.\n3.   Where Europol, on the basis of information already in its possession, comes to the conclusion that the assessment provided for in paragraphs 1 or 2 needs to be corrected, it shall inform the Member State concerned and seek to agree on an amendment to the assessment. Europol shall not change the assessment without such agreement.\n4.   Where Europol receives information from a Member State without an assessment in accordance with paragraphs 1 or 2, it shall attempt to assess the reliability of the source or the accuracy of information on the basis of information already in its possession. The assessment of specific data and information shall take place in agreement with the providing Member State. A Member State may also agree with Europol in general terms on the assessment of specified types of data and specified sources. If no agreement is reached in a specific case, or no agreement in general terms exists, Europol shall assess the information or data and shall attribute to such information or data the evaluation codes (X) and (4) referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 respectively.\n5.   This Article shall apply mutatis mutandis where Europol receives data or information from a Union body, third country, international organisation or private party.\n6.   Information from publicly available sources shall be assessed by Europol using the evaluation codes set out in paragraphs 1 and 2.\n7.   Where information is the result of an analysis made by Europol in the performance of its tasks, Europol shall assess such information in accordance with this Article, and in agreement with the Member States participating in the analysis.\nArticle 30\nProcessing of special categories of personal data and of different categories of data subjects\n1.   Processing of personal data in respect of victims of a criminal offence, witnesses or other persons who can provide information concerning criminal offences, or in respect of persons under the age of 18, shall be allowed if it is strictly necessary and proportionate for preventing or combating crime that falls within Europol's objectives.\n2.   Processing of personal data, by automated or other means, revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs or trade union membership and processing of genetic data or data concerning a person's health or sex life shall be prohibited, unless it is strictly necessary and proportionate for preventing or combating crime that falls within Europol's objectives and if those data supplement other personal data processed by Europol. The selection of a particular group of persons solely on the basis of such personal data shall be prohibited.\n3.   Only Europol shall have direct access to personal data as referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2. The Executive Director shall duly authorise a limited number of Europol officials to have such access if it is necessary for the performance of their tasks.\n4.   No decision by a competent authority which produces adverse legal effects concerning a data subject shall be based solely on automated processing of data as referred to in paragraph 2, unless the decision is expressly authorised pursuant to national or Union legislation.\n5.   Personal data as referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 shall not be transmitted to Member States, Union bodies, third countries or international organisations unless such transmission is strictly necessary and proportionate in individual cases concerning crime that falls within Europol's objectives and in accordance with Chapter V.\n6.   Every year Europol shall provide to the EDPS a statistical overview of all personal data as referred to in paragraph 2 which it has processed.\nArticle 31\nTime-limits for the storage and erasure of personal data\n1.   Personal data processed by Europol shall be stored by Europol only for as long as is necessary and proportionate for the purposes for which the data are processed.\n2.   Europol shall in any event review the need for continued storage no later than three years after the start of initial processing of personal data. Europol may decide on the continued storage of personal data until the following review, which shall take place after another period of three years, if continued storage is still necessary for the performance of Europol's tasks. The reasons for the continued storage shall be justified and recorded. If no decision is taken on the continued storage of personal data, that data shall be erased automatically after three years.\n3.   If personal data as referred to in Article 30(1) and (2) are stored for a period exceeding five years, the EDPS shall be informed accordingly.\n4.   Where a Member State, a Union body, a third country or an international organisation has indicated any restriction as regards the earlier erasure or destruction of the personal data at the moment of transfer in accordance with Article 19(2), Europol shall erase the personal data in accordance with those restrictions. If continued storage of the data is deemed necessary, on the basis of information that is more extensive than that possessed by the data provider, in order for Europol to perform its tasks, Europol shall request the authorisation of the data provider to continue storing the data and shall present a justification for such request.\n5.   Where a Member State, a Union body, a third country or an international organisation erases from its own data files personal data provided to Europol, it shall inform Europol accordingly. Europol shall erase the data unless the continued storage of the data is deemed necessary, on the basis of information that is more extensive than that possessed by the data provider, in order for Europol to perform its tasks. Europol shall inform the data provider of the continued storage of such data and present a justification of such continued storage.\n6.   Personal data shall not be erased if:\n(a)\nthis would damage the interests of a data subject who requires protection. In such cases, the data shall be used only with the express and written consent of the data subject;\n(b)\ntheir accuracy is contested by the data subject, for a period enabling Member States or Europol, where appropriate, to verify the accuracy of the data;\n(c)\nthey have to be maintained for purposes of proof or for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims; or\n(d)\nthe data subject opposes their erasure and requests the restriction of their use instead.\nArticle 32\nSecurity of processing\n1.   Europol shall implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to protect personal data against accidental or unlawful destruction, accidental loss or unauthorised disclosure, alteration and access or any other unauthorised form of processing.\n2.   In respect of automated data processing, Europol and each Member State shall implement measures designed to:\n(a)\ndeny unauthorised persons access to data-processing equipment used for processing personal data (equipment access control);\n(b)\nprevent the unauthorised reading, copying, modification or removal of data media (data media control);\n(c)\nprevent the unauthorised input of data and the unauthorised inspection, modification or deletion of stored personal data (storage control);\n(d)\nprevent the use of automated data-processing systems by unauthorised persons using data-communication equipment (user control);\n(e)\nensure that persons authorised to use an automated data-processing system have access only to data covered by their access authorisation (data access control);\n(f)\nensure that it is possible to verify and establish to which bodies personal data may be or have been transmitted using data-communication equipment (communication control);\n(g)\nensure that it is possible to verify and establish which personal data have been input into automated data-processing systems and when and by whom the data were input (input control);\n(h)\nensure that it is possible to verify and establish what data have been accessed by which member of personnel and at what time (access log);\n(i)\nprevent the unauthorised reading, copying, modification or deletion of personal data during transfers of personal data or during the transportation of data media (transport control);\n(j)\nensure that it is possible, in the event of interruption, to restore installed systems immediately (recovery); and\n(k)\nensure that the functions of the system perform faultlessly, that the occurrence of faults in the functions is immediately reported (reliability) and that stored data cannot be corrupted by system malfunctions (integrity).\n3.   Europol and Member States shall establish mechanisms to ensure that security needs are taken on board across information system boundaries.\nArticle 33\nData protection by design\nEuropol shall implement appropriate technical and organisational measures and procedures in such a way that the data processing will comply with this Regulation and protect the rights of the data subjects concerned.\nArticle 34\nNotification of a personal data breach to the authorities concerned\n1.   In the event of a personal data breach, Europol shall without undue delay notify the EDPS, as well as the competent authorities of the Member States concerned, of that breach, in accordance with the conditions laid down in Article 7(5),as well as the provider of the data concerned.\n2.   The notification referred to in paragraph 1 shall, as a minimum:\n(a)\ndescribe the nature of the personal data breach including, where possible and appropriate, the categories and number of data subjects concerned and the categories and number of data records concerned;\n(b)\ndescribe the likely consequences of the personal data breach;\n(c)\ndescribe the measures proposed or taken by Europol to address the personal data breach; and\n(d)\nwhere appropriate, recommend measures to mitigate the possible adverse effects of the personal data breach.\n3.   Europol shall document any personal data breaches, including the facts surrounding the breach, its effects and the remedial action taken, thereby enabling the EDPS to verify compliance with this Article.\nArticle 35\nCommunication of a personal data breach to the data subject\n1.   Subject to paragraph 4 of this Article, where a personal data breach as referred to in Article 34 is likely to severely and adversely affect the rights and freedoms of the data subject, Europol shall communicate the personal data breach to the data subject without undue delay.\n2.   The communication to the data subject referred to in paragraph 1 shall describe, where possible, the nature of the personal data breach, recommend measures to mitigate the possible adverse effects of the personal data breach, and contain the identity and contact details of the Data Protection Officer.\n3.   If Europol does not have the contact details of the data subject concerned, it shall request the provider of the data to communicate the personal data breach to the data subject concerned and to inform Europol about the decision taken. Member States providing the data shall communicate the breach to the data subject concerned in accordance with the procedures of their national law.\n4.   The communication of a personal data breach to the data subject shall not be required if:\n(a)\nEuropol has applied to the personal data concerned by that breach appropriate technological protection measures that render the data unintelligible to any person who is not authorised to access it;\n(b)\nEuropol has taken subsequent measures which ensure that the data subject's rights and freedoms are no longer likely to be severely affected; or\n(c)\nsuch communication would involve disproportionate effort, in particular owing to the number of cases involved. In such a case, there shall instead be a public communication or similar measure informing the data subjects concerned in an equally effective manner.\n5.   The communication to the data subject may be delayed, restricted or omitted where this constitutes a necessary measure with due regard for the legitimate interests of the person concerned:\n(a)\nto avoid obstructing official or legal inquiries, investigations or procedures;\n(b)\nto avoid prejudicing the prevention, detection, investigation and prosecution of criminal offences or for the execution of criminal penalties;\n(c)\nto protect public and national security;\n(d)\nto protect the rights and freedoms of third parties.\nArticle 36\nRight of access for the data subject\n1.

European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Cooperation (Europol)\nWHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?\nIt sets up the rules for Europol, including a system by which the European Parliament, together with national parliaments, can politically monitor Europol’s activities. In addition, it adapts Europol’s external relations to the rules of the Lisbon Treaty.\nThe regulation aligns the current Council decision on Europol with the rules of the Lisbon Treaty.\nKEY POINTS\nObjectives\nEuropol’s objectives are to support and strengthen:\naction by authorities in the European Union (EU) countries;\nmutual cooperation amongst EU countries in preventing and combating terrorism, serious crime affecting two or more EU countries and forms of crime which affect a common interest covered by EU policy.\nTasks\nThe regulation sets out a number of specific tasks in order to meet those objectives including:\ncollecting, storing, processing, analysing and exchanging information including criminal intelligence;\nnotifying EU countries, via Europol national units, without delay, of any information and connection between criminal offences concerning them;\ncoordinating, organising and implementing investigative and operational actions to support and strengthen actions by EU countries’ authorities;\npreparing threat assessments, strategic and operational analyses and general situation reports;\nparticipating in joint investigation teams;\ndeveloping EU centres of specialised expertise for combating certain types of crime, for example the European Cybercrime Centre;\nsupporting EU countries in combating crime enabled, promoted or committed using the internet.\nScrutiny\nEuropol’s powers are accompanied by data protection safeguards and parliamentary scrutiny:\nThe European Data Protection Supervisor monitors Europol’s processing of personal data and there will be a clear procedure for citizens to address requests under EU law.\nEuropol’s work is overseen by a Joint Parliamentary Scrutiny Group, with members from both national parliaments and the European Parliament.\nFROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?\n              \nIt applies from 1 May 2017 except for Articles 71 (legal agreements and contracts
