whereas under Article 5 of Protocol (No 11) on certain provisions relating to the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland to the Treaty, Article 104c(1) does not apply to the United Kingdom unless it moves to the third stage; whereas the obligation under Article 109e(4) to endeavour to avoid excessive deficits will continue to apply to the United Kingdom;\n(4)\nWhereas adherence to the medium-term objective of budgetary positions close to balance or in surplus will allow Member States to deal with normal cyclical fluctuations while keeping the government deficit within the 3 % of GDP reference value;\n(5)\nWhereas it is appropriate to complement the multilateral surveillance procedure of Article 103 (3) and (4) with an early warning system, under which the Council will alert a Member State at an early stage to the need to take the necessary budgetary corrective action in order to prevent a government deficit becoming excessive;\n(6)\nWhereas the multilateral surveillance procedure of Article 103 (3) and (4) should furthermore continue to monitor the full range of economic developments in each of the Member States and in the Community as well as the consistency of economic policies with the broad economic guidelines referred to in Article 103 (2); whereas for the monitoring of these developments, the presentation of information in the form of stability and convergence programmes is appropriate;\n(7)\nWhereas there is a need to build upon the useful experience gained during the first two stages of economic and monetary union with convergence programmes;\n(8)\nWhereas the Member States adopting the single currency, hereafter referred to as ‘participating Member States’, will, in accordance with Article 109j, have achieved a high degree of sustainable convergence and in particular a sustainable government financial position; whereas the maintenance of sound budgetary positions in these Member States will be necessary to support price stability and to strengthen the conditions for the sustained growth of output and employment; whereas it is necessary that participating Member States submit medium-term programmes, hereafter referred to as ‘stability programmes’; whereas it is necessary to define the principal contents of such programmes;\n(9)\nWhereas the Member States not adopting the single currency, hereafter referred to as ‘non-participating Member States’, will need to pursue policies aimed at a high degree of sustainable convergence; whereas it is necessary that these Member States submit medium-term programmes, hereafter referred to as ‘convergence programmes’; whereas it is necessary to define the principal contents of such convergence programmes;\n(10)\nWhereas in its Resolution of 16 June 1997 on the establishment of an exchange-rate mechanism in the third stage of Economic and Monetary Union, the European Council issued firm political guidelines in accordance with which an exchange-rate mechanism is established in the third stage of EMU, hereafter referred to as ‘ERM2’; whereas the currencies of non-participating Member States joining ERM2 will have a central rate vis-à-vis the euro, thereby providing a reference point for judging the adequacy of their policies; whereas the ERM2 will also help to protect them and the Member States adopting the euro from unwarranted pressures in the foreign-exchange markets; whereas, so as to enable appropriate surveillance in the Council, non-participating Member States not joining ERM2 will nevertheless present policies in their convergence programmes oriented to stability thus avoiding real exchange rate misalignments and excessive nominal exchange rate fluctuations;\n(11)\nWhereas lasting convergence of economic fundamentals is a prerequisite for sustainable exchange rate stability;\n(12)\nWhereas it is necessary to lay down a timetable for the submission of stability programmes and convergence programmes and their updates;\n(13)\nWhereas in the interest of transparency and informed public debate it is necessary that Member States make public their stability programmes and their convergence programmes;\n(14)\nWhereas the Council, when examining and monitoring the stability programmes and the convergence programmes and in particular their medium-term budgetary objective or the targeted adjustment path towards this objective, should take into account the relevant cyclical and structural characteristics of the economy of each Member State;\n(15)\nWhereas in this context particular attention should be given to significant divergences of budgetary positions from the budgetary objectives of being close to balance or in surplus; whereas it is appropriate for the Council to give an early warning in order to prevent a government deficit in a Member State becoming excessive; whereas in the event of persistent budgetary slippage it will be appropriate for the Council to reinforce its recommendation and make it public; whereas for non-participating Member States the Council may make recommendations on action to be taken to give effect to their convergence programmes;\n(16)\nWhereas both convergence and stability programmes lead to the fulfilment of the conditions of economic convergence referred to in Article 104c,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nSECTION 1\nPURPOSE AND DEFINITIONS\nArticle 1\nThis Regulation sets out the rules covering the content, the submission, the examination and the monitoring of stability programmes and convergence programmes as part of multilateral surveillance by the Council so as to prevent, at an early stage, the occurrence of excessive general government deficits and to promote the surveillance and coordination of economic policies.\nArticle 2\nFor the purpose of this Regulation ‘participating Member States’ shall mean those Member States which adopt the single currency in accordance with the Treaty and ‘non-participating Member States’ shall mean those which have not adopted the single currency.\nSECTION 2\nSTABILITY PROGRAMMES\nArticle 3\n1.

The Council shall carry out the examination of the convergence programme referred to in paragraph 1 within at most two months of the submission of the programme. The Council, on a recommendation from the Commission and after consulting the Committee set up by Article 109c, shall deliver an opinion on the programme. Where the Council, in accordance with Article 103, considers that the objectives and contents of a programme should be strengthened, the Council shall, in its opinion, invite the Member State concerned to adjust its programme.\n3.   Updated convergence programmes shall be examined by the Committee set up by Article 109c on the basis of assessments by the Commission; if necessary, updated programmes may also be examined by the Council in accordance with the procedure set out in paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Article.\nArticle 10\n1.   As part of multilateral surveillance in accordance with Article 103 (3), the Council shall monitor the implementation of convergence programmes on the basis of information provided by non-participating Member States in accordance with Article 7 (2) (a) of this Regulation and of assessments by the Commission and the Committee set up by Article 109c of the Treaty, in particular with a view to identifying actual or expected significant divergence of the budgetary position from the medium-term budgetary objective, or the adjustment path towards it, as set in the programme for the government surplus/deficit.\nIn addition, the Council shall monitor the economic policies of non-participating Member States in the light of convergence programme objectives with a view to ensure that their policies are geared to stability and thus to avoid real exchange rate misalignments and excessive nominal exchange rate fluctuations.\n2.

These are preventive measures designed to ensure the budgetary discipline necessary for the smooth operation of the European Union (EU).\nIt concerns not only those EU countries that have adopted the single currency but also those not yet participating.\nKEY POINTS\nThis regulation aims to monitor and coordinate EU countries’ budgetary policies, as a preventive measure to ensure budgetary discipline within the EU.\nTo do this, it provides for a European Semester at the start of each year to assist EU countries in putting in place healthy budgetary policies. EU countries submit to the European Commission  stability programmes (for countries in the euro area) and convergence programmes(for countries outside the euro area) in which they adopt medium-term budgetary objectives. These programmes are assessed by the Commission and are the subject of specific Council recommendations for each country.\nEuropean Semester for economic policy coordination\nThe European Semester is a 6-month period during which EU countries’ budgetary policies are examined.\nAt the start of the Semester, the Council identifies the key economic challenges for the EU and provides EU countries with strategic policy guidelines to be followed.\nSubsequently, and on the basis of these guidelines, EU countries must draw up:\ntheir stability or convergence programmes under this regulation;\ntheir national reform programmes, in line with broad guidelines for economic policy and guidelines for employment policies.\nAt the end of the European Semester and following an assessment of the programmes, the Council sends recommendations to each EU country. Based on the Commission’s assessment, the Council gives its opinion before EU countries draw up their final budgets for the following year.\nMedium-term budgetary objectives\nEach EU country has a medium-term deficit objective for its budgetary position, defined in structural terms. The objectives differ between EU countries: they are stricter where the level of debt and estimated costs of an ageing population are higher.\nFor the EU countries that have adopted the euro and for those participating in the exchange rate mechanism (ERM II), the objective is set between -1 % of GDP and a balance or surplus.\nThe objectives may be revised when a major structural reform is undertaken or every 3 years, when forecasts are published enabling the estimated costs of ageing populations to be updated.\nMultilateral surveillance: stability and convergence programmes\nThe stability and convergence programmes serve as a basis for multilateral surveillance by the Council of the EU. This surveillance, provided for in Article 121 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU should prevent, at an early stage, excessive public deficits and promote the coordination of economic policies.\nEach EU country must present the Council of the EU and the Commission with a stability programme (for countries in the euro area) or a convergence programme (for countries outside the euro area).\nStability or convergence programmes must include the following information:\nthe medium-term budgetary objective and the planned adjustments to achieve the objective;\ngovernment balance as a percentage of GDP, the likely trend for the government debt ratio, the planned growth for government spending and the growth of government revenue, given unchanged policy, as well as quantified discretionary revenue measures;\ninformation on estimated costs of ageing populations, and other possible costs (such as public guarantees) with a potentially large impact on government accounts;\ninformation on the consistency of the programmes with the broad economic policy guidelines and the national reform programmes;\nthe main assumptions underlying the economic outlook, which are likely to influence the realisation of the stability and convergence programmes (growth, employment, inflation and other important variables);\nan assessment and a detailed analysis of the budgetary measures and other economic policy measures — taken or planned — relevant to achieving the programme’s aims;\nan analysis of how changes in the main economic assumptions would affect the budgetary and debt positions;\nwhere applicable, the reasons for any deviation from the planned adjustments needed to achieve the medium-term budgetary objective.\nIn addition, convergence programmes have to state the relationship between these objectives and price and exchange rate stability, as well as the medium-term objectives of monetary policy.\nExamination of the stability and convergence programmes\nOn the basis of assessments by the Commission and the Economic and Financial Committee, the Council examines the medium-term budgetary objectives presented by countries in their programmes. It checks in particular:\nwhether the objective is based on realistic economic assumptions;\nwhether the measures taken or planned are sufficient to achieve the objective;\nwhether an assessment of the planned adjustments shows that the country concerned is seeking to improve its (cyclically adjusted) budgetary balance year-on-year;\nwhether annual growth in government spending by the country concerned is not too high, i.e. does not exceed a benchmark rate in the medium term.\nWhen making its assessments, the Council must take account of the implementation of major structural reforms, especially pension reforms.\nThe Council is to examine the programme within 3 months of its submission. On a recommendation from the Commission and after consulting the Economic and Financial Committee, the Council delivers an opinion on the programme. Where it considers that the objectives and content of a programme should be strengthened, the Council can ask the country concerned to adjust it.\nAvoiding an excessive deficit: the early warning mechanism\nAs part of multilateral surveillance, the Council monitors the implementation of stability and convergence programmes on the basis of information provided by the EU countries and assessments carried out by the Commission and the Economic and Financial Committee.\nSo, if the Commission identifies a significant divergencefrom the medium-term budgetary objective or from the planned adjustments that should lead to achieving that objective, it will give recommendationsto the country concerned to prevent an excessive deficit (early warning mechanism, Article 121(4) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU).\nFurthermore, recommendations adopted in the Council may be made public.\nEuropean Commission guidance\nIn 2015, a Commission communication clarified how it intends to apply the stability and growth pact rules to strengthen the link between structural reforms, investment and fiscal responsibility so as to stimulate job creation and growth in the EU.\nThis guidance had 3 main objectives:\nto encourage effective implementation of structural reforms;\nto promote investment, particularly in the context of the new European Fund for Strategic Investments, which is a central element of the investment plan for Europe proposed by the Commission;\nto better reflect the economic situation of each of the EU countries.\nFROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?\n              \nIt has applied since 1 July 1998.\nBACKGROUND\nUnder the rules of the stability and growth pact, EU countries must apply healthy budgetary policies in order to avoid excessive government deficits which might endanger the economic and financial stability of the EU.\nIn 2011, the stability and growth pact was the subject of extensive reforms. The new measures adopted are an important step in guaranteeing budgetary discipline, promoting the stability of the EU economy and preventing another crisis.\nThe stability and growth pact now includes six legislative acts (known as ‘the 6-Pack’) which entered into force on 13 December 2011 and two further acts (‘the 2-Pack’) which entered into force on 30 May 2013:\nRegulation (EU) No 1173/2011 on the effective enforcement of budgetary surveillance in the euro area;\nRegulation (EU) No 1174/2011 on enforcement measures to correct excessive macroeconomic imbalances in the euro area;\nRegulation (EU) No 1175/2011 amending this regulation on surveillance procedures for budgetary positions;\nRegulation (EU) No 1176/2011 on the prevention and correction of macroeconomic imbalances;\nRegulation (EU) No 1177/2011 amending the procedure on excessive deficits;\nDirective 2011/85/EU on requirements for budgetary frameworks of the Member States;\nRegulation (EU) No 472/2013 on surveillance of the economies and budgets of euro area countries with, or threatened with, serious difficulties with respect to their financial stability;\nRegulation (EU) No 473/2013 on common rules for monitoring and assessing draft budgetary plans and ensuring the correction of excessive deficit of countries in the euro area\nFor further information, see:\n‘Stability and Growth Pact’ (European Commission).\nMAIN DOCUMENT\n            \nCouncil Regulation (EC) No 1466/97 of 7 July 1997 on the strengthening of the surveillance of budgetary positions and the surveillance and coordination of economic policies (OJ L 209, 2.8.1997, pp. 1–5)\nSuccessive amendments to Regulation (EC) No 1466/97 have been incorporated in to the original document.
