Community and the Swiss Confederation on the simplification of inspections and formalities in respect of the carriage of goods and on customs security measuresTHE EUROPEAN COMMUNITY,of the one part, andTHE SWISS CONFEDERATION,of the other part,hereinafter referred to as \"the Community\" and \"Switzerland\" respectively and, jointly, as \"the Contracting Parties\",Having regard to the Agreement between the European Economic Community and the Swiss Confederation on the simplification of inspections and formalities in respect of the carriage of goods, of 21 November 1990, hereinafter referred to as \"the 1990 Agreement\",Whereas the scope of the 1990 Agreement should be extended to customs security by adding a new chapter on this subject,Whereas, in the interests of clarity and greater legal security the 1990 Agreement, is incorporated in this Agreement, which will replace the 1990 Agreement,Considering the Free Trade Agreement of 22 July 1972 between the European Economic Community and the Swiss Confederation,Considering the Joint Declaration adopted in Luxembourg on 9 April 1984 by Ministers of the EFTA countries and the Member States of the Community and the Commission of the European Communities, and the statement adopted in Brussels on 2 February 1988 by Ministers of the EFTA countries and Ministers of the Member States of the Community with the aim of creating a dynamic European economic area of benefit to their countries,Considering that the Contracting Parties have ratified the International Convention on the Harmonization of Frontier Controls of Goods,Bearing in mind the need to maintain the existing level of simplification of inspections and formalities on the passage of goods at frontiers between the Community and Switzerland and so ensure the smooth flow of trade between the two parties,Considering that such simplification should be progressively developed,Considering that veterinary and phyto-sanitary controls are now governed by the Agreement of 21 June 1999 between the European Community and the Swiss Confederation on Trade in Agricultural Products,Acknowledging that the conditions under which inspections and formalities are carried out may be extensively harmonised without impairing their purpose, their proper implementation or their effectiveness,Considering that no provision of this Agreement may be interpreted as exempting the Contracting Parties from their obligations under other international agreements,Considering that the Contracting Parties undertake to guarantee on their respective territories an equivalent level of security through measures based on legislation in force in the Community,Considering that it is desirable that Switzerland be consulted on the development of Community rules concerning customs security measures, that it take part in the relevant work of the Customs Code Committee, established by Article 247a of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 of 12 October 1992 establishing the Community Customs Code, and that it be notified of the implementation of such rules,Considering that the Contracting Parties are determined to improve security in the trade in goods entering or exiting their territories without hampering trade flows,Considering that, in the interests of the Contracting Parties, equivalent customs security measures should be introduced in respect of the transport of goods from or to third countries,Considering that these customs security measures concern the declaration of security data relating to goods prior to their entry and exit, the management of security risks and related customs inspections and the allocation of authorised economic operator status for mutually recognised security purposes,Considering that Switzerland has an adequate level of personal data protection,Considering that in the case of customs security measures it is useful to foresee provisions for appropriate rebalancing measures, including suspension of the relevant provisions where the equivalence of customs security measures is no longer assured,HAVE DECIDED TO CONCLUDE THIS AGREEMENT:CHAPTER IGENERAL PROVISIONSArticle 1DefinitionsFor the purposes of this Agreement:(a) \"inspections\" means any operation whereby the customs authorities or any other inspection authority carries out the physical examination or visual inspection of the means of transport or of the goods themselves in order to ascertain that their nature, origin, condition, quantity and value are in conformity with the particulars contained in the documents produced;(b) \"formalities\" means any formality to which the authorities subject a trader and which consists in the production or examination of documents, certificates accompanying the goods, or other particulars, irrespective of the method or medium employed, relating to the goods or the means of transport;(c) \"risk\" means the likelihood of an event occurring in connection with the entry, exit, transit, transfer and end-use of goods moving between the customs territory of one of the Contracting Parties and third countries and the presence of goods not in free circulation in the territory of one of the Contracting Parties, which jeopardises the safety and security of the Community, its Member States or Switzerland, public health, the environment or consumers;(d) \"risk management\" means the systematic identification of risk and implementation of all measures necessary for limiting exposure to risk. This includes activities such as collecting data and information, analysing and assessing risk, prescribing and taking action and regular monitoring and review of the process and its outcomes, based on sources and strategies defined by the Community, its Member States and Switzerland, or at the international level.Article 2Scope1. Without prejudice to special provisions in force under agreements concluded between the Community and Switzerland, this Agreement shall apply to inspections and formalities concerning the carriage of goods which have to cross a frontier between Switzerland and the Community and to customs security measures applicable to the carriage of goods to or from third countries.2. This Agreement shall not apply to inspections or formalities concerning ships and aircraft as means of transport; however, it shall apply to vehicles and goods carried by the said means of transport.Article 3Territories covered1. This Agreement shall apply, on the one hand, to the Community customs territory and, on the other, to the Swiss customs territory and its customs enclaves.2. This Agreement shall apply in the Principality of Liechtenstein for as long as that Principality is bound to Switzerland by a customs union treaty.CHAPTER IIPROCEDURESArticle 4Random checks and formalities other than the customs security inspections referred to in Chapter III1. Save as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, the Contracting Parties shall take the necessary measures to ensure that:- the various inspections and formalities provided for in Article 2(1) are carried out with the minimum delay necessary and, as far as possible, in one place,- inspections are carried out by means of random checks except in duly justified circumstances.2. For the purposes of implementing the second indent of paragraph 1, the basis for carrying out random checks shall be the total number of consignments passing through a frontier post and presented to a customs office or other inspection authority during a given period, and not the total number of goods making up each consignment.3. The Contracting Parties shall facilitate, at the places of departure and destination of goods, the use of simplified procedures and data-processing and data-transmission techniques for the purposes of the export, transit and import of goods.4. The Contracting Parties shall endeavour to deploy customs offices, including those in the interior of their territory, in such a way as best to take account of the requirements of commercial operators.Article 5Delegation of powersThe Contracting Parties shall see to it that, by express delegation by the competent authorities and on their behalf, one of the other services represented, and preferably the customs service, may carry out inspections for which those authorities are responsible and, insofar as such inspections relate to the requirement to produce the necessary documents, checks on the validity and authenticity thereof and on the identity of the goods declared in such documents. In that event, the authorities concerned shall ensure that the means required for carrying out such checks are made available.Article 6Recognition of inspections and documentsFor the purposes of implementing this Agreement and without prejudice to the possibility of carrying out random checks, the Contracting Parties shall, in the event of goods being imported or entering in transit, recognise the inspections carried out and the documents drawn up by the competent authorities of the other Contracting Party which certify that the goods comply with the legal requirements of the country of import or equivalent requirements in the country of export.Article 7Opening hours of frontier posts1. Where the volume of traffic so warrants, the Contracting Parties shall see to it that:(a) frontier posts are open, except when traffic is prohibited, so that:- frontiers can be crossed 24 hours a day with the corresponding inspections and formalities in respect of goods placed under a customs transit procedure, their means of transport and vehicles travelling unladen, save where frontier inspection is necessary in order to prevent the spread of disease or to protect animals,- inspections and formalities relating to the movement of means of transport and goods which are not moving under a customs transit procedure may be performed from Monday to Friday during an uninterrupted period of at least 10 hours and on Saturday during an uninterrupted period of at least six hours, unless those days are public holidays;(b) as regards vehicles and goods transported by air, the periods referred to in the second indent of point (a) shall be adapted in such a way as to meet actual needs and for that purpose shall be split or extended if necessary.2. Where several frontier posts are situated in the immediate vicinity of one and the same frontier zone, the Contracting Parties may jointly agree, for certain of such posts, to derogate from paragraph 1 provided that the other posts in that zone are able to clear goods and vehicles in accordance with that paragraph.3. As regards the frontier posts and customs offices and services referred to in paragraph 1, and under the conditions laid down by the Contracting Parties, the competent authorities shall, if specifically requested during business hours and for sound reasons, provide for inspections and formalities to be carried out, as an exception, outside business hours, on condition that, where relevant, payment is made for services so rendered.Article 8Express lanesThe Contracting Parties shall endeavour to establish at frontier posts, where technically possible and justified by the volume of traffic, express lanes reserved for goods placed under a customs transit procedure, their means of transport, vehicles travelling unladen and all goods subject to such inspections and formalities as do not exceed those required in respect of goods placed under a transit procedure.CHAPTER IIICUSTOMS SECURITY MEASURESArticle 9General provisions concerning security1.

If the equivalence of the Contracting Parties' customs security measures is no longer assured because the amendments provided for in Article 22(4) have not been decided, a Contracting Party may suspend the application of Chapter III from the date of implementation of the relevant Community act, unless the Joint Committee, having considered how to continue its application, decides otherwise.3. The scope and duration of such measures shall be limited to what is necessary in order to remedy the situation and to secure a fair balance of rights and obligations under this Agreement.

However, a customs export declaration used as an exit summary declaration shall be lodged with the competent authority of the Contracting Party in whose customs territory the formalities for export to third countries are carried out. In either case the competent authority shall carry out a risk analysis based on the information contained in the declaration and the customs controls deemed necessary for security.3. When goods destined for a third country leave the customs territory of a Contracting Party through the customs territory of the other Contracting Party, the information referred to in Article 1(2) shall be transmitted by the competent authority of the former Contracting Party to the competent authority of the latter.However, the Joint Committee may determine cases in which transmission of this information is not necessary as long as the level of security assured by this Agreement is not affected.The Contracting Parties shall seek to establish an interconnection and use a common system for transmitting data that contains the information necessary for the exit summary declaration of the goods in question.If the Contracting Parties are unable to establish the transmission referred to in the first subparagraph on the date of application of this Agreement, the exit summary declaration for goods destined for a third country that leave a Contracting Party through the customs territory of the other Contracting Party shall, except for direct air traffic, be lodged exclusively with the competent authority of the latter Contracting Party.Article 4Time limits for lodging entry and exit summary declarations1. The deadlines for lodging entry and exit summary declarations are those laid down in Articles 184a and 592b of Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93.2. Notwithstanding paragraph 1, each Contracting Party may decide on different time limits:- in cases of the traffic referred to in Article 3(3) so that reliable risk analysis may be carried out and shipments intercepted in order to carry out any security-related customs checks,- in the case of an international agreement between that Contracting Party and a third country, subject to the procedure laid down in Article 9(3) of this Agreement.[1] OJ L 253, 11.10.1993, p. 1.--------------------------------------------------ANNEX IIAuthorised economic operatorTITLE IGRANTING OF THE STATUS OF AUTHORISED ECONOMIC OPERATORArticle 1General provisions1.

However, in the case referred to in paragraph 1(b), the customs authority may decide not to suspend the status of authorised economic operator if it considers an infringement to be of negligible importance in relation to the number or size of the customs-related operations and it does not raise doubts concerning the good faith of the authorised economic operator.3. Where the nature or the level of the threat to citizens′ security and safety, to public health or to the environment so requires, suspension shall take place immediately.4. The suspension shall not affect any customs procedure already started before the date of suspension and not yet completed.5. Each Contracting Party shall set the length of the suspension period with a view to enabling the economic operator to regularise the situation.6. When the economic operator concerned has, to the satisfaction of the customs authorities, taken the necessary measures to comply with the conditions and criteria that have to be met by any authorised economic operator, the issuing customs authority shall lift the suspension.Article 8Revocation of the status1.

It covers: goods crossing frontiers between Switzerland and the European Union (EU);customs security measures on goods to and from non-EU countries.\nDecision No 1/2013 amends the agreement to bring it into line with subsequent EU customs security measures to ensure the EU and Switzerland provide the same level of security.\nDecision No 1/2021 amends the customs security measures (Chapter III) of the 2009 agreement and Annexes I and II to take account, in particular, of new customs security measures introduced by an implementing act of the European Commission, Decision (EU) 2019/2151.\nKEY POINTS\n              \nThe agreement applies to the customs territory of the EU and Switzerland, including its customs enclaves, and to the customs territory of Liechtenstein, as long as it is linked to Switzerland by a customs union.\nThe EU and Switzerland agree to do as follows.\nCarry out: inspections and formalities with the minimum possible delay and, as far as possible, in one place;random inspections, based on the number of consignments passing through a frontier post and not the total number of goods in each consignment, except when circumstances justify otherwise.\nDeploy customs offices on their territory to take account of commercial operators’ requirements.\nDelegate to the relevant services the authority to inspect the validity and authenticity of documents and goods.\nRecognise each other’s inspections and the validity of documents they issue.\nEnsure frontier posts are open, where traffic volume warrants, so: frontiers can be crossed 24 hours a day and any inspections and formalities can be carried out on goods being transported under a customs transit procedure;inspections and formalities for goods not under a customs transit procedure may be carried out, except on public holidays, for continuous periods (10 hours from Monday to Friday, 6 hours on Saturdays).\nEstablish express lanes at frontier posts, where technically possible and traffic

application of the agreement.\nConsultation groups to deal with practical, technical or organisational issues.\nProvisions on the development of law require:\nthe EU, when drafting legislation covering areas in Chapter III, to seek informal opinions from Swiss experts, just as it routinely does from EU national experts;\nthe Commission to send a copy of the draft legislation to Switzerland;\na preliminary exchange of views if either party so requests;\namendments to Chapter III due to developments in EU legislation to be decided as soon as possible so both may be implemented at the same time.\nThe EU allows Swiss experts to participate as observers in the Customs Code Committee when items covered by Chapter III are discussed.\nThe EU and Switzerland confirm that any agreement either signs with a non-EU country on issues covered by Chapter III will not create obligations for the other, unless the joint committee so decides.\nThe agreement does not:\nprevent bans or restrictions on the import, export or transit of goods on grounds such as public morality, policy, security or health, protection of national treasures or industrial and commercial property;\napply to inspections of or formalities on ships or planes, but does apply to the vehicles and goods they carry.\nAnnex III sets out the details of an arbitration procedure.\nDecision No 1/2013 made initial amendments to Annexes I and II to the agreement.\nDecision No 1/2021 of the EU–Switzerland joint committee replaces Articles 9 to 14 of Chapter III (customs security measures) and Annexes I and II to the agreement.\nThe EU and Switzerland:\nensure the same level of security and safety at their external borders by applying identical customs security measures to goods to and from non-EU countries;\ndo not apply those customs security measures to goods transported between themselves;\nconsult with each other before concluding arrangements with a non-EU country to guarantee consistency in implementing the 2009 agreement.\nEntry and exit summaries:\nare required for goods transported to and from non-EU countries, except for those transiting by sea or air;\nmust be provided before the goods enter or leave either party’s customs area;\nare lodged by the carrier, importer or person presenting the goods (entry summaries) and by people identified by the EU and Switzerland (exit summaries).\nAnnex I gives details of the entry and exit summary declarations. It covers the:\nelectronic import control system 2 (ICS2) used;\nform and particulars of the declarations;\nexceptions where summaries are not required;\nlocation and time limits for lodging declarations;\ntechnical arrangements for the electronic systems;\nfinancing arrangements of the import control system.\nEach party designates authorised economic operators (AEOs) within their jurisdiction. In the case of Switzerland, this includes its customs enclaves of Samnaun and Sampuoir. The operators:\nenjoy facilitations during security-related customs controls;\nare recognised by the other party, particularly when agreements with non-EU countries are implemented.\nAnnex II lays down the:\ncriteria for granting AEO status and the conditions for applying it;\ntype of facilitations given (i.e. AEOs have fewer physical and document-based security controls than others);\nrules on suspending, annulling and revoking the status;\narrangements for exchanging information between the EU and Switzerland on their AEO.\nSecurity- and safety-related customs controls are:\nbased primarily on risk analysis using electronic data processing techniques to identify and evaluate risks and develop countermeasures;\ncarried out within a common risk management framework that is also used to exchange risk-related information, subject to professional secrecy and personal data protection rules.\nIn March 2021, Decision No 130/2021 of the Joint Committee of the European Economic Area was adopted. It:\namends Protocol 10 to the European Economic Area Agreement on the simplification of inspections and formalities to enable Norway to join the EU’s ICS2 customs control system on basically the same terms as Switzerland;\ntakes account of the Commission’s Implementing Decision (EU) 2019/2151 establishing a work programme for developing and deploying electronic customs systems;\ndoes not apply to Iceland and Liechtenstein, but could in the future.\nDATE OF ENTRY INTO FORCE\nThe agreement entered into force on 1 July 2009.\nDecision No 1/2013 took effect on 7 June 2013.\nDecision No 1/2021 took effect on 15 March 2021.\nBACKGROUND\n              \nICS2 helps manage customs border controls and supports the EU’s customs pre-arrival security and safety programme. It enables customs officers to better assess risk on the basis of common information, protecting the EU and its citizens from hazardous, dangerous or illegal imports.\nThe EU–Switzerland Joint Committee decision of 12 March 2021 and the European Economic Area Joint Committee decision of 15 March 2021 ensure Switzerland and Norway apply the same security and safety measures as the EU. As a result, trade between the two countries and the EU does not require entry or exit summary declarations.\nFor more information, see:\nNew customs agreements with Switzerland and Norway (European Commission)\nImport control system 2 (ICS2) (European Commission).\nMAIN DOCUMENTS\n            \nAgreement between the European Community and the Swiss Confederation on the simplification of inspections and formalities in respect of the carriage of goods and on customs security measures (OJ L 199, 31.7.2009, pp. 24–42).\nSuccessive amendments to the agreement have been incorporated in the original text.
