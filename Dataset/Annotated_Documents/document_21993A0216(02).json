Flammable liquids are liquids, or mixtures of liquids, or liquids containing solids in solution or suspension (for example, paints, varnishes, lacquers, etc., but not including substances or wastes otherwise classified on account of their dangerous characteristics) which give off a flammable vapour at temperatures of not more than 60,5 oC, closed-cup test, or not more than 65,6 oC, open-cup test. (Since the results of open-cup tests and of closed-cup tests are not strictly comparable and even individual results by the same test are often variable, regulations varying from the above figures to make allowance for such differences would be within the spirit of this definition.)\n4.1\nH4.1\nFlammable solids\nSolids, or waste solids, other than those classed as explosives, which under conditions encountered in transport are readily combustible, or may cause or contribute to fire through friction.\n4.2\nH4.2\nSubstances or wastes liable to spontaneous combustion\nSubstances or wastes which are liable to spontaneous heating under normal conditions encountered in transport, or to heating up on contact with air, and being then liable to catch fire.\n4.3\nH4.3\nSubstances or wastes which, in contact with water emit flammable gases\nSubstances or wastes which, by interaction with water, are liable to become spontaneously flammable or to give off flammable gases in dangerous quantities.\n5.1\nH5.1\nOxidizing\nSubstances or wastes which, while in themselves not necessarily combustible, may, generally by yielding oxygen cause, or contribute to, the combustion of other materials.\n5.2\nH5.2\nOrganic peroxides\nOrganic substances or wastes which contain the bivalent -O-O-structure are thermally unstable substances which may undergo exothermic self-accelerating decomposition.\n6.1\nH6.1\nPoisonous (acute)\nSubstances or wastes liable either to cause death or serious injury or to harm human health if swallowed or inhaled or by skin contact.\n6.2\nH6.2\nInfectious substances\nSubstances or wastes containing viable micro-organisms or their toxins which are known or suspected to cause disease in animals or humans.\n8\nH8\nCorrosives\nSubstances or wastes which, by chemical action, will cause severe damage when in contact with living tissue, or, in the case of leakage, will materially damage, or even destroy, other goods or the means of transport; they may also cause other hazards.\n9\nH10\nLiberation of toxic gases in contact with air or water\nSubstances or wastes which, by interaction with air or water, are liable to give off toxic gases in dangerous quantities.\n9\nH11\nToxic (delayed or chronic)\nSubstances or wastes which, if they are inhaled or ingested or if they penetrate the skin, may involve delayed or chronic effects, including carcinogenicity.\n9\nH12\nEcotoxic\nSubstances or wastes which if released present or may present immediate or delayed adverse impacts to the environment by means of bioaccumulation and /or toxic effects upon biotic systems.\n9\nH13\nCapable, by any means, after disposal, of yielding another material, e.g., leachate, which possesses any of the characteristics listed above.\nTests\nThe potential hazards posed by certain types of wastes are not yet fully documented; tests to define quantitatively these hazards do not exist. Further research is necessary in order to develop means to characterize potential hazards posed to man and /or the environment by these wastes. Standardized tests have been derived with respect to pure substances and materials. Many countries have developed national tests which can be applied to materials listed in Annex I, in order to decide if these materials exhibit any of the characteristics listed in this Annex.\n(1)  Corresponds to the hazard classification system included in the United Nations recommendations on the transport of dangerous goods (ST/SG/AC, 10/1/Rev. 5, United Nations, New York, 1988).\nANNEX IV\nDISPOSAL OPERATIONS\nA.

It aims to protect human health and the environment from the adverse effects resulting from the generation, the transboundary (crossing borders) movement and the management of hazardous wastes and other wastes.\nThe convention regulates the transboundary movements of hazardous wastes and other wastes and requires its parties to ensure that they manage and dispose of such wastes in an environmentally sound manner.\nThe parties also undertake to:\nminimise the quantities that are transported;\ntreat and dispose of the wastes as close as possible to their place of generation;\nprevent or minimise the generation of wastes at source.\nKEY POINTS\nScope\nThe convention has 8 annexes:\nAnnex I: Categories of wastes to be controlled — ranging from clinical wastes to wastes from the production, formulation and use of organic solvents;\nAnnex II: Categories of wastes requiring special consideration — wastes collected from households and residues arising from the incineration of household wastes;\nAnnex III: List of hazardous characteristics — such as whether they are explosive, flammable liquids or solids, liable to spontaneous combustion, corrosive or ecotoxic (harmful to the environment);\nAnnex IV: List of disposal* operations;\nAnnex V A: Information to be provided on notification;\nAnnex V B: Information to be provided on the movement document;\nAnnex VI: Arbitration;\nAnnex VII: (not in force);\nAnnex VIII: List of wastes.\nGeneral obligations of the convention\nParties agree the following:\nnot to export (or import) hazardous wastes or other wastes to (or from) a non-signatory state;\nnot to export waste unless the state of import has given its prior consent in writing to the specific import;\nto communicate information about proposed international movements to the states concerned by means of a notification form; this will allow them to evaluate the effects of hazardous waste or other wastes on human health and the environment;\nto permit international movements of wastes only where there is no danger with regard to their movement and disposal;\nto package, label and transport the wastes that are moved in line with international rules, and to ensure they are accompanied by a movement document from the point at which movement starts to the point of disposal.\nAny party may impose additional requirements that are consistent with the convention.\nNotification procedures\nThe convention introduces notification procedures with regard to:\ninternational movements between parties;\ninternational movements from a party through the territory of non-signatory states.\nIllegal shipments\nWhere wastes are illegally exported, parties to the convention must re-import them.\nEnvironmentally sound management\nParties agree to work together on environmentally sound practices for the management of hazardous and other wastes.\nDispute settlement\nParties should settle any disputes through negotiation or any other peaceful means of their choice. If a solution is not found, the dispute is submitted to the International Court of Justice or to an arbitration tribunal consisting of 3 parties.\nSecretariat\nA secretariat facilitates cooperation and the sharing of information among parties.\nCapacity-building\nRegional or sub-regional centres around the globe provide training and capacity-building.\nImplementing legislation\nThe convention has been incorporated into EU law by means of Regulation (EC) No 1013/2006 and its subsequent amendments.\nFROM WHEN DO THE DECISION AND THE CONVENTION APPLY?\n              \nThe decision has applied since 1 February 1993.
