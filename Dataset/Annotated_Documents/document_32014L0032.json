{"celex_id": "32014L0032", "reference": "29.3.2014\nEN\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\nL 96/149\nDIRECTIVE 2014/32/EU OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL\nof 26 February 2014\non the harmonisation of the laws of the Member States relating to the making available on the market of measuring instruments (recast)\n(Text with EEA relevance)\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 114 thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee (1),\nActing in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure (2),\nWhereas:\n(1)\nDirective 2004/22/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 31 March 2004 on measuring instruments (3) has been substantially amended (4). Since further amendments are to be made, that Directive should be recast in the interests of clarity.\n(2)\nRegulation (EC) No 765/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 9 July 2008 setting out the requirements for accreditation and market surveillance relating to the marketing of products (5) lays down rules on the accreditation of conformity assessment bodies, provides a framework for the market surveillance of products and for controls on products from third countries, and lays down the general principles of the CE marking.\n(3)\nDecision No 768/2008/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 9 July 2008 on a common framework for the marketing of products (6) lays down common principles and reference provisions intended to apply across sectoral legislation in order to provide a coherent basis for revision or recasts of that legislation. Directive 2004/22/EC should be adapted to that Decision.\n(4)\nThis Directive covers measuring instruments which are new to the Union market when they are placed on the market; that is to say they are either new measuring instruments made by a manufacturer established in the Union or measuring instruments, whether new or second-hand, imported from a third country.\n(5)\nCorrect and traceable measuring instruments can be used for a variety of measurement tasks. Those responding to reasons of public interest, public health, safety and order, protection of the environment and the consumer, of levying taxes and duties and of fair trading, which directly and indirectly affect the daily life of citizens in many ways, may require the use of legally controlled measuring instruments.\n(6)\nThis Directive should apply to all forms of supply, including distance selling.\n(7)\nLegal metrological control should not lead to barriers to the free movement of measuring instruments. The applicable provisions should be the same in all Member States and proof of conformity should be accepted throughout the Union.\n(8)\nLegal metrological control requires conformity with specified performance requirements. The performance requirements that the measuring instruments must meet should provide a high level of protection. The conformity assessment should provide a high level of confidence.\n(9)\nMember States should as a general rule prescribe legal metrological control. Where legal metrological control is prescribed, only measuring instruments complying with common performance requirements should be used.\n(10)\nThe principle of optionality introduced by Directive 2004/22/EC allows Member States to exercise their right to decide whether or not to prescribe the use of the measuring instruments covered by this Directive.\n(11)\nNational specifications concerning the appropriate national requirements for use should not interfere with the provisions of this Directive on ‘putting into use’.\n(12)\nThe performance of certain measuring instruments is particularly sensitive to the environment, in particular the electromagnetic environment. Immunity of measuring instruments to electromagnetic interference should form an integral part of this Directive and the immunity requirements of Directive 2004/108/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 December 2004 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to electromagnetic compatibility (7) should therefore not apply.\n(13)\nIn order to ensure the free circulation of measuring instruments in the Union, Member States should not impede the placing on the market and/or putting into use of measuring instruments that carry the CE marking and supplementary metrology marking in accordance with the provisions of this Directive.\n(14)\nMember States should take appropriate action to prevent non-complying measuring instruments from being placed on the market and/or put into use. Adequate cooperation between the competent authorities of the Member States is therefore necessary to ensure a Union-wide effect of this objective.\n(15)\nEconomic operators should be responsible for the compliance of measuring instruments with this Directive, in relation to their respective roles in the supply chain, so as to ensure a high level of protection of the aspects of public interest covered by this Directive, and also to guarantee fair competition on the Union market.\n(16)\nAll economic operators intervening in the supply and distribution chain should take appropriate measures to ensure that they make available on the market only measuring instruments which are in conformity with this Directive. It is necessary to provide for a clear and proportionate distribution of obligations which correspond to the role of each economic operator in the supply and distribution chain.\n(17)\nIn order to facilitate communication between economic operators, market surveillance authorities and consumers, Member States should encourage economic operators to include a website address in addition to the postal address.\n(18)\nThe manufacturer, having detailed knowledge of the design and production process, is best placed to carry out the conformity assessment procedure. Conformity assessment should therefore remain solely the obligation of the manufacturer.\n(19)\nIt is necessary to ensure that measuring instruments from third countries entering the Union market comply with this Directive, and in particular that the appropriate conformity assessment procedures have been carried out by manufacturers with regard to those measuring instruments. Provision should therefore be made for importers to make sure that the measuring instruments they place on the market comply with the requirements of this Directive and that they do not place on the market measuring instruments which do not comply with such requirements or present a risk. Provision should also be made for importers to make sure that conformity assessment procedures have been carried out and that marking of measuring instruments and documentation drawn up by manufacturers are available for inspection by the competent national authorities.\n(20)\nWhen placing a measuring instrument on the market, every importer should indicate on the measuring instrument his name, registered trade name or registered trade mark and the postal address at which he can be contacted. Exceptions should be provided for in cases where the size or nature of the measuring instrument does not allow it. This includes cases where the importer would have to open the packaging to put his name and address on the measuring instrument.\n(21)\nThe distributor makes a measuring instrument available on the market after it has been placed on the market by the manufacturer or the importer. The distributor should act with due care to ensure that its handling of the measuring instrument does not adversely affect the compliance of that instrument with this Directive.\n(22)\nAny economic operator that either places a measuring instrument on the market under his own name or trade mark or modifies a measuring instrument in such a way that compliance with of this Directive may be affected should be considered to be the manufacturer and should assume the obligations of the manufacturer.\n(23)\nDistributors and importers, being close to the market place, should be involved in market surveillance tasks carried out by competent national authorities, and should be prepared to participate actively, providing those authorities with all necessary information relating to the measuring instrument concerned.\n(24)\nEnsuring traceability of a measuring instrument throughout the whole supply chain helps to make market surveillance simpler and more efficient. An efficient traceability system facilitates market surveillance authorities’ task of tracing economic operators who made non-compliant measuring instruments available on the market. When keeping the information required under this Directive for the identification of other economic operators, economic operators should not be required to update such information in respect of other economic operators who have either supplied them with a measuring instrument or to whom they have supplied a measuring instrument.\n(25)\nThis Directive should be limited to the expression of essential requirements that do not impede technical progress, preferably performance requirements. In order to facilitate conformity assessment with those requirements it is necessary to provide for a presumption of conformity for measuring instruments which are in conformity with harmonised standards that are adopted in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 1025/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 October 2012 on European Standardisation (8) for the purpose of expressing detailed technical specifications of those requirements.\n(26)\nRegulation (EU) No 1025/2012 provides for a procedure for objections to harmonised standards where those standards do not entirely satisfy the requirements of this Directive.\n(27)\nThe technical and performance specifications of internationally agreed normative documents may also comply, in part or in full, with the essential requirements laid down by this Directive. In those cases the use of these internationally agreed normative documents should be allowed as an alternative to the use of harmonised standards and, under specific conditions, give rise to a presumption of conformity.\n(28)\nConformity with the essential requirements laid down by this Directive can also be provided by specifications that are not supplied by a harmonised standard or an internationally agreed normative document. The use of harmonised standards or internationally agreed normative documents should therefore be optional.\n(29)\nIn order to enable economic operators to demonstrate and the competent authorities to ensure that measuring instruments made available on the market comply with the essential requirements, it is necessary to provide for conformity assessment procedures. Decision No 768/2008/EC establishes modules for conformity assessment procedures, from the least to the most stringent, in proportion to the level of risk involved and the level of safety required. In order to ensure inter-sectoral coherence and to avoid ad-hoc variants, conformity assessment procedures should be chosen from among those modules. However, it is necessary to adapt those modules in order to reflect specific aspects of metrological control.\n(30)\nThe conformity assessment of sub-assemblies should be carried out in accordance with this Directive. If sub-assemblies are made available on the market separately and independently of an instrument, their conformity assessment should be undertaken independently of the instrument concerned.\n(31)\nThe state of the art in measurement technology is subject to constant evolution which may lead to changes in the needs for conformity assessments. Therefore, for each category of measuring instrument and, where appropriate, sub-assemblies, there should be an appropriate procedure or a choice between different procedures of equivalent stringency.\n(32)\nManufacturers should draw up an EU declaration of conformity to provide information required under this Directive on the conformity of a measuring instrument with this Directive and with other relevant Union harmonisation legislation.\n(33)\nTo ensure effective access to information for market surveillance purposes, the information required to identify all applicable Union acts should be available in a single EU declaration of conformity. In order to reduce the administrative burden on economic operators, that single EU declaration of conformity may be a dossier made up of relevant individual declarations of conformity.\n(34)\nThe CE marking and the supplementary metrology marking, indicating the conformity of a measuring instrument, are the visible consequence of a whole process comprising conformity assessment in a broad sense. General principles governing the CE marking and its relationship to other markings are set out in Regulation (EC) No 765/2008. Rules governing the affixing of the CE marking and the supplementary metrology marking should be laid down in this Directive.\n(35)\nIn order to take account of differences in climatic conditions or of different levels of consumer protection that may apply at national level, it is necessary to establish environmental or accuracy classes as essential requirements.\n(36)\nCertain conformity assessment procedures set out in this Directive require the intervention of conformity assessment bodies, which are notified by the Member States to the Commission.\n(37)\nExperience has shown that the criteria set out in Directive 2004/22/EC that conformity assessment bodies have to fulfil to be notified to the Commission are not sufficient to ensure a uniformly high level of performance of notified bodies throughout the Union. It is, however, essential that all notified bodies perform their functions to the same level and under conditions of fair competition. That requires the setting of obligatory requirements for conformity assessment bodies wishing to be notified in order to provide conformity assessment services.\n(38)\nIf a conformity assessment body demonstrates conformity with the criteria laid down in harmonised standards it should be presumed to comply with the corresponding requirements set out in this Directive.\n(39)\nIn order to ensure a consistent level of quality in the performance of conformity assessment of measuring instruments, it is also necessary to set requirements for notifying authorities and other bodies involved in the assessment, notification and monitoring of notified bodies.\n(40)\nThe system set out in this Directive should be complemented by the accreditation system provided for in Regulation (EC) No 765/2008. Since accreditation is an essential means of verifying the competence of conformity assessment bodies, it should also be used for the purposes of notification.\n(41)\nTransparent accreditation as provided for in Regulation (EC) No 765/2008, ensuring the necessary level of confidence in certificates of conformity, should be considered by the national public authorities throughout the Union as the preferred means of demonstrating the technical competence of conformity assessment bodies. However, national authorities may consider that they possess the appropriate means of carrying out that evaluation themselves. In such cases, in order to ensure the appropriate level of credibility of evaluations carried out by other national authorities, they should provide the Commission and the other Member States with the necessary documentary evidence demonstrating the compliance of the conformity assessment bodies evaluated with the relevant regulatory requirements.\n(42)\nConformity assessment bodies frequently subcontract parts of their activities linked to the assessment of conformity or have recourse to a subsidiary. In order to safeguard the level of protection required for the measuring instruments to be placed on the market, it is essential that conformity assessment subcontractors and subsidiaries fulfil the same requirements as notified bodies in relation to the performance of conformity assessment tasks. Therefore, it is important that the assessment of the competence and the performance of bodies to be notified and the monitoring of bodies already notified cover also activities carried out by subcontractors and subsidiaries.\n(43)\nIt is necessary to increase the efficiency and transparency of the notification procedure and, in particular, to adapt it to new technologies so as to enable online notification.\n(44)\nSince notified bodies may offer their services throughout the Union, it is appropriate to give the other Member States and the Commission the opportunity to raise objections concerning a notified body. It is therefore important to provide for a period during which any doubts or concerns as to the competence of conformity assessment bodies can be clarified before they start operating as notified bodies.\n(45)\nIn the interests of competitiveness, it is crucial that notified bodies apply the conformity assessment procedures without creating unnecessary burdens for economic operators. For the same reason, and to ensure equal treatment of economic operators, consistency in the technical application of the conformity assessment procedures needs to be ensured. That can best be achieved through appropriate coordination and cooperation between notified bodies.\n(46)\nIn order to ensure legal certainty, it is necessary to clarify that rules on Union market surveillance and control of products entering the Union market provided for in Regulation (EC) No 765/2008 apply to measuring instruments covered by this Directive. This Directive should not prevent Member States from choosing the competent authorities to carry out those tasks.\n(47)\nMember States should take all appropriate measures to ensure that measuring instruments may be placed on the market only if, when properly stored and used for their intended purpose, or under conditions of use which can be reasonably foreseen, they do not endanger the health and safety of persons. Measuring instruments should be considered as non-compliant with the essential requirements laid down in this Directive only under conditions of use which can be reasonably foreseen, that is when such use could result from lawful and readily predictable human behaviour.\n(48)\nDirective 2004/22/EC already provides for a safeguard procedure allowing the Commission to examine the justification for a measure taken by a Member State against measuring instruments it considers to be non-compliant. In order to increase transparency and to reduce processing time, it is necessary to improve the existing safeguard procedure, with the view to making it more efficient and drawing on the expertise available in Member States.\n(49)\nThe existing system should be supplemented by a procedure under which interested parties are informed of measures intended to be taken with regard to measuring instruments presenting a risk to aspects of public interest protection covered by this Directive. It should also allow market surveillance authorities, in cooperation with the relevant economic operators, to act at an early stage in respect of such measuring instruments.\n(50)\nWhere the Member States and the Commission agree as to the justification of a measure taken by a Member State, no further involvement of the Commission should be required, except where non-compliance can be attributed to shortcomings of a harmonised standard or a normative document.\n(51)\nIn order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of this Directive, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission. Those powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 February 2011 laying down the rules and general principles concerning mechanisms for control by Member States of the Commission’s exercise of implementing powers (9).\n(52)\nThe advisory procedure should be used for the adoption of implementing acts requesting the notifying Member State to take the necessary corrective measures in respect of notified bodies that do not meet or no longer meet the requirements for their notification.\n(53)\nThe advisory procedure should also be used for the adoption of implementing acts with respect to the objections to the internationally agreed normative documents whose references have not yet been published in the Official Journal of the European Union, given that the relevant document has not yet led to the presumption of conformity with the applicable essential requirements.\n(54)\nThe examination procedure should be used for the adoption of implementing acts with respect to the objections to the internationally agreed normative documents whose references were already published in the Official Journal of the European Union and which a Member State or the Commission considers justified, given that such acts could have consequences on the presumption of conformity with the applicable essential requirements.\n(55)\nThe examination procedure should also be used for the adoption of implementing acts with respect to compliant measuring instruments which present a risk to the health or safety of persons or to other aspects of public interest protection.\n(56)\nIn line with established practice, the committee set up by this Directive can play a useful role in examining matters concerning the application of this Directive raised either by its chair or by a representative of a Member State in accordance with its rules of procedure.\n(57)\nWhen matters relating to this Directive, other than its implementation or infringements, are being examined, i.e. in a Commission expert group, the European Parliament should in line with existing practice receive full information and documentation and, where appropriate, an invitation to attend such meetings.\n(58)\nThe Commission should, by means of implementing acts and, given their special nature, acting without the application of Regulation (EU) No 182/2011, determine whether measures taken by Member States in respect of non-compliant measuring instruments are justified or not.\n(59)\nIn order to take into account the developments in the measurement technology, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union should be delegated to the Commission in respect of amendments to the instrument-specific Annexes. It is of particular importance that the Commission carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level. The Commission, when preparing and drawing up delegated acts, should ensure a simultaneous, timely and appropriate transmission of relevant documents to the European Parliament and to the Council.\n(60)\nMember States should lay down rules on penalties applicable to infringements of the provisions of national law adopted pursuant to this Directive and ensure that those rules are enforced. The penalties provided for should be effective, proportionate and dissuasive.\n(61)\nIt is necessary to provide for reasonable transitional arrangements that allow the making available on the market and putting into use, without the need to comply with further product requirements, of measuring instruments that have already been placed on the market in accordance with Directive 2004/22/EC before the date of application of national measures transposing this Directive. Distributors should therefore be able to supply measuring instruments that have been placed on the market, namely stock that is already in the distribution chain, before the date of application of national measures transposing this Directive.\n(62)\nSince the objective of this Directive, namely to ensure that measuring instruments on the market fulfil the requirements providing for a high level of protection of the public interests covered by this Directive while guaranteeing the functioning of the internal market cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States but can rather, by reason of its scale and effects, be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Directive does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve that objective.\n(63)\nThe obligation to transpose this Directive into national law should be confined to those provisions which represent a substantive amendment as compared to the earlier Directive. The obligation to transpose the provisions which are unchanged arises under the earlier Directive.\n(64)\nThis Directive should be without prejudice to the obligations of the Member States relating to the time-limits for transposition into national law and the dates of application of the Directives set out in Annex XIV, Part B,\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:\nCHAPTER 1\nGENERAL PROVISIONS\nArticle 1\nSubject matter\nThis Directive establishes the requirements that measuring instruments have to satisfy with a view to their being made available on the market and/or put into use for the measuring tasks referred to in Article 3(1).\nArticle 2\nScope\n1.

Member States shall not impede for reasons covered by this Directive the making available on the market and/or putting into use of any measuring instrument that satisfies the requirements of this Directive.\n2.   Member States shall take all appropriate measures to ensure that measuring instruments are made available on the market and/or put into use only if they satisfy the requirements of this Directive.\n3.   A Member State may require a measuring instrument to satisfy provisions governing its putting into use that are justified by local climatic conditions. In such a case, the Member State shall choose appropriate upper and lower temperature limits from Table 1 of Annex I and may specify humidity conditions (condensing or non-condensing) and whether the intended location of use is open or closed.\n4.   When different accuracy classes are defined for a measuring instrument:\n(a)\nthe instrument-specific Annexes under the heading ‘Putting into use’ may indicate the accuracy classes to be used for specific applications;\n(b)\nin all other cases a Member State may determine the accuracy classes to be used for specific applications within the classes defined, subject to allowing the use of all accuracy classes on its territory.\nFor the purposes of point (a) or point (b), measuring instruments of a better accuracy class may be used if the owner so chooses.\n5.   At trade fairs, exhibitions, demonstrations or similar events, Member States shall not prevent the showing of measuring instruments not in conformity with this Directive, provided that a visible sign clearly indicates their non-conformity and their non-availability for making available on the market and/or putting into use until they are brought into conformity.\nCHAPTER 2\nOBLIGATIONS OF ECONOMIC OPERATORS\nArticle 8\nObligations of manufacturers\n1.   When placing their measuring instruments on the market and/or putting them into use, manufacturers shall ensure that they have been designed and manufactured in accordance with the essential requirements set out in Annex I and in the relevant instrument-specific Annexes.\n2.   Manufacturers shall draw up the technical documentation referred to in Article 18 and carry out the relevant conformity assessment procedure referred to in Article 17 or have it carried out.\nWhere compliance of a measuring instrument with the applicable requirements of this Directive has been demonstrated by that conformity assessment procedure, manufacturers shall draw up an EU declaration of conformity and affix the CE marking and the supplementary metrology marking.\n3.   Manufacturers shall keep the technical documentation and the EU declaration of conformity for 10 years after the measuring instrument has been placed on the market.\n4.   Manufacturers shall ensure that procedures are in place for series production to remain in conformity with this Directive. Changes in measuring instrument design or characteristics and changes in the harmonised standards, normative documents or in other technical specifications by reference to which conformity of a measuring instrument is declared shall be adequately taken into account.\nWhen deemed appropriate with regard to the performance of a measuring instrument, manufacturers shall carry out sample testing of measuring instruments made available on the market, investigate and, if necessary, keep a register of complaints, of non-conforming measuring instruments and measuring instrument recalls, and shall keep distributors informed of any such monitoring.\n5.   Manufacturers shall ensure that measuring instruments which they have placed on the market bear a type, batch or serial number or other element allowing their identification, or, where the size or nature of the measuring instrument does not allow it, that the required information is provided in a document accompanying the measuring instrument and on the packaging, if any, in accordance with point 9.2 of Annex I.\n6.   Manufacturers shall indicate on the measuring instrument their name, registered trade name or registered trade mark and the postal address at which they can be contacted or, where that is not possible, in a document accompanying the measuring instrument and on the packaging, if any, in accordance with point 9.2 of Annex I. The address shall indicate a single point at which the manufacturer can be contacted. The contact details shall be in a language easily understood by end-users and market surveillance authorities.\n7.   Manufacturers shall ensure that the measuring instrument which they have placed on the market is accompanied by a copy of the EU Declaration of conformity and by instructions and information in accordance with point 9.3 of Annex I, in a language which can be easily understood by end-users, as determined by the Member State concerned. Such instructions and information, as well as any labelling, shall be clear, understandable and intelligible.\n8.   Manufacturers who consider or have reason to believe that a measuring instrument which they have placed on the market is not in conformity with this Directive shall immediately take the corrective measures necessary to bring that measuring instrument into conformity, to withdraw it or recall it, if appropriate. Furthermore, where the measuring instrument presents a risk, manufacturers shall immediately inform the competent national authorities of the Member States in which they made the measuring instrument available on the market to that effect, giving details, in particular, of the non-compliance and of any corrective measures taken.\n9.   Manufacturers shall, further to a reasoned request from a competent national authority, provide it with all the information and documentation in paper or electronic form necessary to demonstrate the conformity of the measuring instrument with this Directive, in a language which can be easily understood by that authority. They shall cooperate with that authority, at its request, on any action taken to eliminate the risks posed by measuring instruments which they have placed on the market.\nArticle 9\nAuthorised representatives\n1.   A manufacturer may, by a written mandate, appoint an authorised representative.\nThe obligations laid down in Article 8(1) and the obligation to draw up technical documentation referred to in Article 8(2) shall not form part of the authorised representative’s mandate.\n2.   An authorised representative shall perform the tasks specified in the mandate received from the manufacturer. The mandate shall allow the authorised representative to do at least the following:\n(a)\nkeep the EU declaration of conformity and the technical documentation at the disposal of national market surveillance authorities for 10 years after the measuring instrument has been placed on the market;\n(b)\nfurther to a reasoned request from a competent national authority, provide that authority with all the information and documentation necessary to demonstrate the conformity of a measuring instrument;\n(c)\ncooperate with the competent national authorities, at their request, on any action taken to eliminate the risks posed by measuring instruments covered by their mandate.\nArticle 10\nObligations of importers\n1.   Importers shall place only compliant measuring instruments on the market.\n2.   Before placing a measuring instrument on the market and/or putting a measuring instrument into use importers shall ensure that the appropriate conformity assessment procedure referred to in Article 17 has been carried out by the manufacturer. They shall ensure that the manufacturer has drawn up the technical documentation, that the measuring instrument bears the CE marking and the supplementary metrology marking and is accompanied by a copy of the EU declaration of conformity and the required documents, and that the manufacturer has complied with the requirements set out in Article 8(5) and (6).\nWhere an importer considers or has reason to believe that a measuring instrument is not in conformity with the essential requirements set out in Annex I and in the relevant instrument-specific Annexes, he shall not place the measuring instrument on the market or put it into use until it has been brought into conformity. Furthermore, where the measuring instrument presents a risk, the importer shall inform the manufacturer and the market surveillance authorities to that effect.\n3.   Importers shall indicate on the measuring instrument their name, registered trade name or registered trade mark and the postal address at which they can be contacted or, where that is not possible, in a document accompanying the measuring instrument and on its packaging, if any, in accordance with point 9.2 of Annex I. The contact details shall be in a language easily understood by end-users and market surveillance authorities.\n4.   Importers shall ensure that the measuring instrument is accompanied by instructions and information in accordance with point 9.3 of Annex I, in a language which can be easily understood by end-users, as determined by the Member State concerned.\n5.   Importers shall ensure that, while a measuring instrument is under their responsibility, its storage or transport conditions do not jeopardise its compliance with the essential requirements set out in Annex I and in the relevant instrument-specific Annexes.\n6.   When deemed appropriate with regard to the performance of a measuring instrument, importers shall carry out sample testing of measuring instruments made available on the market, investigate, and, if necessary, keep a register of complaints, of non-conforming measuring instruments and measuring instrument recalls, and shall keep distributors informed of any such monitoring.\n7.   Importers who consider or have reason to believe that a measuring instrument which they have placed on the market is not in conformity with this Directive shall immediately take the corrective measures necessary to bring that measuring instrument into conformity, to withdraw it or recall it, if appropriate.

The relevant economic operators shall cooperate as necessary with the market surveillance authorities for that purpose.\nWhere, in the course of the evaluation referred to in the first subparagraph, the market surveillance authorities find that the measuring instrument does not comply with the requirements laid down in this Directive, they shall without delay require the relevant economic operator to take all appropriate corrective actions to bring the measuring instrument into compliance with those requirements, to withdraw the measuring instrument from the market, or to recall it within a reasonable period, commensurate with the nature of the risk, as they may prescribe.\nThe market surveillance authorities shall inform the relevant notified body accordingly.\nArticle 21 of Regulation (EC) No 765/2008 shall apply to the measures referred to in the second subparagraph of this paragraph.\n2.   Where the market surveillance authorities consider that non-compliance is not restricted to their national territory, they shall inform the Commission and the other Member States of the results of the evaluation and of the actions which they have required the economic operator to take.\n3.   The economic operator shall ensure that all appropriate corrective action is taken in respect of all the measuring instruments concerned that it has made available on the market throughout the Union.\n4.   Where the relevant economic operator does not take adequate corrective action within the period referred to in the second subparagraph of paragraph 1, the market surveillance authorities shall take all appropriate provisional measures to prohibit or restrict the measuring instrument being made available on their national market, to withdraw the measuring instrument from that market or to recall it.\nThe market surveillance authorities shall inform the Commission and the other Member States, without delay, of those measures.\n5.   The information referred to in the second subparagraph of paragraph 4 shall include all available details, in particular the data necessary for the identification of the non-compliant measuring instrument, the origin of the measuring instrument, the nature of the non-compliance alleged and the risk involved, the nature and duration of the national measures taken and the arguments put forward by the relevant economic operator. In particular, the market surveillance authorities shall indicate whether the non-compliance is due to either of the following:\n(a)\nfailure of the measuring instrument to meet requirements relating to aspects of public interest protection laid down in this Directive; or\n(b)\nshortcomings in the harmonised standards or normative documents referred to in Article 14 conferring a presumption of conformity.\n6.   Member States other than the Member State initiating the procedure under this Article shall without delay inform the Commission and the other Member States of any measures adopted and of any additional information at their disposal relating to the non-compliance of the measuring instrument concerned, and, in the event of disagreement with the adopted national measure, of their objections.\n7.   Where, within three months of receipt of the information referred to in the second subparagraph of paragraph 4, no objection has been raised by either a Member State or the Commission in respect of a provisional measure taken by a Member State, that measure shall be deemed justified.\n8.   Member States shall ensure that appropriate restrictive measures, such as withdrawal of the measuring instrument from the market, are taken in respect of the measuring instrument concerned, without delay.\nArticle 43\nUnion safeguard procedure\n1.   Where, on completion of the procedure set out in Article 42(3) and (4), objections are raised against a measure taken by a Member State, or where the Commission considers a national measure to be contrary to Union legislation, the Commission shall without delay enter into consultation with the Member States and the relevant economic operator or operators and shall evaluate the national measure. On the basis of the results of that evaluation, the Commission shall adopt an implementing act determining whether the national measure is justified or not.\nThe Commission shall address its decision to all Member States and shall immediately communicate it to them and the relevant economic operator or operators.\n2.   If the national measure is considered justified, all Member States shall take the necessary measures to ensure that the non-compliant measuring instrument is withdrawn from their market, and shall inform the Commission accordingly. If the national measure is considered unjustified, the Member State concerned shall withdraw that measure.\n3.   Where the national measure is considered justified and the non-compliance of the measuring instrument is attributed to shortcomings in the harmonised standards referred to in point (b) of Article 42(5) of this Directive, the Commission shall apply the procedure provided for in Article 11 of Regulation (EU) No 1025/2012.\n4.   Where the national measure is considered justified and the non-compliance of the measuring instrument is attributed to shortcomings in the normative documents referred to in point (b) of Article 42(5), the Commission shall apply the procedure provided for in Article 16.\nArticle 44\nCompliant measuring instruments which present a risk\n1.   Where, having carried out an evaluation under Article 42(1), a Member State finds that although a measuring instrument is in compliance with this Directive, it presents a risk to aspects of public interest protection, it shall require the relevant economic operator to take all appropriate measures to ensure that the measuring instrument concerned, when placed on the market, no longer presents that risk, to withdraw the measuring instrument from the market or to recall it within a reasonable period, commensurate with the nature of the risk, as it may prescribe.\n2.   The economic operator shall ensure that corrective action is taken in respect of all the measuring instruments concerned that he has made available on the market throughout the Union.\n3.   The Member State shall immediately inform the Commission and the other Member States. That information shall include all available details, in particular the data necessary for the identification of the measuring instrument concerned, the origin and the supply chain of the measuring instrument, the nature of the risk involved and the nature and duration of the national measures taken.\n4.   The Commission shall without delay enter into consultation with the Member States and the relevant economic operator or operators and shall evaluate the national measures taken. On the basis of the results of that evaluation, the Commission shall decide by means of implementing acts whether the national measure is justified or not, and where necessary, propose appropriate measures.\nThe implementing acts referred to in the first subparagraph of this paragraph shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 46(3).\n5.   The Commission shall address its decision to all Member States and shall immediately communicate it to them and the relevant economic operator or operators.\nArticle 45\nFormal non-compliance\n1.   Without prejudice to Article 42, where a Member State makes one of the following findings, it shall require the relevant economic operator to put an end to the non-compliance concerned:\n(a)\nthe CE marking or the supplementary metrology marking has been affixed in violation of Article 30 of Regulation (EC) No 765/2008 or of Article 22 of this Directive;\n(b)\nthe CE marking or the supplementary metrology marking has not been affixed;\n(c)\nthe identification number of the notified body, where that body is involved in the production control phase, has been affixed in violation of Article 22 or has not been affixed;\n(d)\nthe EU declaration of conformity does not accompany the measuring instrument;\n(e)\nthe EU declaration of conformity has not been drawn up correctly;\n(f)\ntechnical documentation is either not available or not complete.\n(g)\nthe information referred to in Article 8(6) or Article 10(3) is absent, false or incomplete;\n(h)\nany other administrative requirement provided for in Article 8 or Article 10 is not fulfilled.\n2.   Where the non-compliance referred to in paragraph 1 persists, the Member State concerned shall take all appropriate measures to restrict or prohibit the measuring instrument being made available on the market or ensure that it is recalled or withdrawn from the market.\nCHAPTER 6\nCOMMITTEE AND DELEGATED ACTS\nArticle 46\nCommittee procedure\n1.

Meetings of committees thus fall within the scope of point 15 of the Framework Agreement when and insofar as other issues are discussed.", "summary": "EU rules ensuring that measuring instruments are accurate\nEU rules ensuring that measuring instruments are accurate\nSUMMARY OF:\nDirective 2014/32/EU relating to measuring instruments\nWHAT IS THE AIM OF THE DIRECTIVE?\n              \nIt lays down uniform, EU-wide rules on the sale and putting into use of measuring instruments (MIs). MIs are important for trade, consumers and industry as they ensure the accuracy of measurements and help the transparency and fairness of commercial transactions.\nIt aims to:\nestablish the essential requirements that instruments or systems with a measurement function have to satisfy;\nintroduce simpler, clearer and more-consistent rules and ensure traceability;\nreduce administrative burdens for manufacturers, importers and distributors;\nensure that instruments compliant with the essential requirements can circulate freely within the EU.\nBenefits should include:\ncompliant and more-accurate measuring instruments on the EU market and increased levels of public trust in them;\nfewer non-compliant instruments and distortions of competition on the market arising from different enforcement practices;\nprotection of the public from wrong measurements;\nincreased room for technological innovation, by adopting a modern regulatory approach.\nThe directive recasts and repeals Directive 2004/22/EC.\nKEY POINTS\n              \nThe directive brings the MI legislation into line with the EU’s ‘new legislative framework’. This framework comprises 2 complementary texts:\nRegulation (EC) No 765/2008 on accreditation and market surveillance; and\nDecision No 768/2008/EC on uniform conditions for the marketing of safe products in the EU (conformity marking).\nScope\nLegally controlled measuring instruments are used for a variety of measurement tasks in the areas of public health and safety and of fair trading. The directive applies to:\nutility meters (water meters, gas meters and volume-conversion devices*, active electrical energy meters and thermal energy meters);\nmeasuring systems for the continuous and dynamic measurement of quantities of liquids other than water (e.g. petrol pumps);\nautomatic weighing instruments (e.g. rail weighbridges or automatic packaging lines);\ntaximeters;\nmaterial measures and dimensional measuring instruments (e.g. for metalworking or woodworking); and\nexhaust gas analysers (e.g. to check engine performance).\nThe directive applies to all MIs that are new to the EU market when they are placed on that market or put into use, that is that they are:\nnew MIs made by a manufacturer established in the EU; or\nMIs imported from a non-EU country, whether they are new or second hand.\nIt applies to all forms of supply of MIs, including distance selling.\nResponsibilities of manufacturers, importers and distributors\nManufacturers must ensure that:\nall MIs on sale in the EU bear the conformity marking consisting of the European conformity (CE) marking plus the supplementary metrology (M) marking, with the last two digits of the year of its affixing and the notified body* number(s), indicating that they meet all the essential requirements of EU legislation (set out in Annex I of the directive and in the relevant instrument-specific annexes);\nthey conduct a risk and conformity assessment and draw up technical documentation for the MI before affixing the CE + M markings (see Annex II of the directive);\nthey (and if they appoint an authorised representative*) keep the technical documentation and the EU declaration of conformity (as set out in Annex II of the directive) for 10 years after the MI has been placed on the market;\nthey indicate on the MI their name, registered trade name or registered trade mark and the postal address where they can be contacted to ensure traceability;\nin the event they believe that MIs they have placed on the market do not conform, take corrective measures to bring them into conformity, withdraw or recall them;\ninstructions and information accompanying the MI are written in a language easily understood by its end users and that they, as well as any labelling, are clear and understandable.\nImporters must ensure that:\nMIs they place on the market comply with the essential requirements;\nmanufacturers have carried out conformity assessments correctly and inform the market surveillance authority if they consider that the MIs do not comply;\nthey indicate on the MI their name, registered trade name or registered trade mark and the postal address where they can be contacted;\nmarking of MIs and documentation drawn up by manufacturers are available for inspection by the competent authorities.\nDistributors must ensure that:\nMIs under their responsibility, or MIs’ storage or transport conditions do not place at risk their compliance with the essential requirements;\nMIs bear the necessary markings;\nin the event they believe that MIs they have made available on the market do not conform, take corrective measures to bring them into conformity, withdraw or recall them.\nIn addition, the directive:\nintroduces requirements for notifying authorities and the procedures for notification of conformity assessment bodies;\nspecifies how national market surveillance authorities must identify and prevent the sale of MIs which present a risk to aspects of public interest protection, including their import from non-EU countries;\nincludes rules on penalties for infringements by manufacturers, importers and distributors which may include criminal penalties in serious cases.\nFROM WHEN DOES THE DIRECTIVE APPLY?\n              \nDirective 2014/32/EU revised and replaced Directive 2004/22/EC and had to be applied in the EU countries as of 20 April 2016.\nBACKGROUND\n              \nFor more information, see:\nLegal metrology (European Commission).\nKEY TERMS\n              \nVolume-conversion device: a device used to convert the measurement flow, temperature, pressure and gas composition under operating conditions into base conditions.\nNotified body: an independent organisation designated by an EU country to assess the conformity of certain products before they are placed on the market. It carries out tasks related to conformity assessment procedures set out in the relevant legislation, when the intervention of an external authority is required.\nAuthorised representative: any individual or organisation established in the EU with a written mandate from a manufacturer to act on their behalf.\nMAIN DOCUMENT\n            \nDirective 2014/32/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 February 2014 on the harmonisation of the laws of the Member States relating to the making available on the market of measuring instruments (recast) (OJ L 96, 29.3.2014, pp. 149-250)\nSuccessive amendments to Directive 2014/32/EU have been incorporated into the original document.
