{"celex_id": "32019R0033", "reference": "11.1.2019\nEN\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\nL 9/2\nCOMMISSION DELEGATED REGULATION (EU) 2019/33\nof 17 October 2018\nsupplementing Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards applications for protection of designations of origin, geographical indications and traditional terms in the wine sector, the objection procedure, restrictions of use, amendments to product specifications, cancellation of protection, and labelling and presentation\nTHE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,\nHaving regard to Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 December 2013 establishing a common organisation of the markets in agricultural products and repealing Council Regulations (EEC) No 922/72, (EEC) No 234/79, (EC) No 1037/2001 and (EC) No 1234/2007 (1), and in particular Article 109, Article 114 and Article 122 thereof,\nWhereas:\n(1)\nRegulation (EU) No 1308/2013 repealed and replaced Council Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 (2). Sections 2 and 3 of Chapter I of Title II of Part II of Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 lay down rules on designations of origin, geographical indications, traditional terms, labelling and presentation in the wine sector and empower the Commission to adopt delegated and implementing acts in that respect. In order to ensure the smooth functioning of the wine market in the new legal framework, certain rules have to be adopted by means of such acts. Those acts should replace the provisions of Commission Regulation (EC) No 607/2009 (3) which should therefore be repealed.\n(2)\nExperience gained from the application of Regulation (EC) No 607/2009 has demonstrated that the current procedures for the registration, amendment and cancellation of Union or third country designations of origin or geographical indications can be intricate, burdensome and time consuming. Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 has created legal vacuums, in particular as regards the procedure to be followed in applications to amend product specifications. Rules of procedure concerning designations of origin and geographical indications in the wine sector are inconsistent with the rules applicable to quality schemes in the foodstuffs, spirit drinks and aromatised wines sectors of Union law. This gives rise to inconsistencies in how this category of intellectual property rights is implemented. These discrepancies should be addressed in light of the right to protection of intellectual property established in Article 17(2) of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. This Regulation should therefore simplify, clarify, complete and harmonise the relevant procedures. Procedures should be modelled as far as possible on the efficient and well tested procedures for protecting intellectual property rights relating to agricultural products and foodstuffs laid down in Regulation (EU) No 1151/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council (4), Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 664/2014 (5) and Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 668/2014 (6), and adapted to take account of the specificities of the wine sector.\n(3)\nDesignations of origin and geographical indications are intrinsically linked to the territory of Member States. National and local authorities have the best expertise and knowledge of the relevant facts. This should be reflected in the relevant procedural rules, having regard to the principle of subsidiarity set out in Article 5(3) of the Treaty on European Union.\n(4)\nThe name to be protected as a designation of origin or a geographical indication should only be registered in a language that has at least a historical link with the geographical area in which the product is produced. Specific rules concerning the use of linguistic characters for a PDO and a PGI should be laid down in order to ensure that operators and consumers in all Member States are better able to read and understand such names.\n(5)\nThe conditions in which a single producer may qualify as an eligible applicant should be defined. Single producers should not be penalised if prevailing circumstances prevent the creation of a producer group. However, it should be clarified that the protected name may be used by other producers established in the demarcated geographical area provided the conditions laid down in the product specification are met, even where the protected name consists of or contains the name of the holding of the single applicant producer.\n(6)\nWhere a wine sector product bearing a designation of origin or geographical indication must only be packaged within a demarcated geographical area according to the product specification, this constitutes a restriction on the free movement of goods and freedom to provide services. In light of the case-law of the Court of Justice such restrictions may be imposed only if they are necessary and proportionate to safeguard quality, to certify the origin of the product or to ensure control. It is therefore necessary to provide that any restrictions on packaging should be duly justified from the point of view of the free movement of goods and the freedom to provide services.\n(7)\nRegulation (EC) No 607/2009 laid down a number of derogations concerning production in the demarcated geographical area. These derogations should be maintained to preserve traditional production practices. They should be clearly set out for the sake of legal certainty and clarity.\n(8)\nApplications for protection are examined by the national authorities of the Member State concerned through a preliminary national procedure. In the case of protected designations of origin, Member States should pay particular attention to the description of the link between the quality and characteristics of the product and the particular geographical environment. In the case of protected geographical indications, Member States should pay particular attention to the description of the link between a specific quality, reputation or other characteristic and the geographical origin of the product, taking into account the demarcated area and the characteristics of the product. The definition of the demarcated area should be detailed, precise and unambiguous so that producers, the competent authorities and the control bodies can ascertain whether operations are being carried out within the demarcated geographical area.\n(9)\nThe assessment carried out by the competent authorities of Member States is an essential step in the procedure. Member States have knowledge, expertise and access to data and facts that make them the best placed to assess whether an application concerning a designation of origin or a geographical indication fulfils the requirements for protection. Therefore, Member States should guarantee that the result of this assessment, which should be faithfully recorded in a single document summarising the relevant elements of the product specification, is reliable and accurate. Having regard to the principle of subsidiarity, the Commission should subsequently scrutinise applications to ensure that there are no manifest errors and that Union law and the interests of stakeholders outside the Member State of application have been taken into account.\n(10)\nIn order to facilitate joint applications for protection of designations of origin and geographical indications, the specific steps in the procedures for those applications should be defined.\n(11)\nWhere Member States consider that the name subject to the application for protection is eligible for registration as a protected designation of origin or geographical indication in compliance with Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013, Member States should be able to grant transitional protection at national level while the Commission is conducting the assessment on the application for protection.\n(12)\nThe information to be submitted by an applicant in order for applications for protection, amendment, objection or cancellation requests to be deemed admissible should be set out in order to facilitate the management of such applications and in order to speed up the examination of the files.\n(13)\nThe objection procedure should be shortened and improved. For the sake of legal certainty, deadlines should be fixed for the various steps in the procedure and grounds of objection should be specified. An amicable step should be introduced to allow the parties to communicate with a view to potentially reaching agreement.\n(14)\nProvision should be made for specific derogations that permit grapevine products that do not comply with the product specification to use a protected name for a transitional period. In order to overcome temporary difficulties and in order to ensure that all producers comply with the specifications in the long term, Member States should be allowed to grant derogations for a period of up to 10 years in certain cases.\n(15)\nProducers of grapevine products bearing a name protected as a designation of origin or geographical indication have to face a changing and challenging market. They require procedures allowing them to swiftly adapt to market demands, however, they are in fact penalised by the length and complexity of the current amendment procedure, the effect of which impedes their ability to react quickly to the market. Producers of grapevine products bearing a name protected as a designation of origin or geographical indication should also be allowed to take account of developments in scientific and technical knowledge and of environmental changes. In order to reduce the steps of such procedures and to give effect in this area to the principle of subsidiarity, decisions on amendments which do not concern essential elements of the product specification should be approved at Member State's level. Producers should be enabled to apply those amendments immediately on the conclusion of the national procedure. There should be no requirement to re-examine the application for approval at Union level.\n(16)\nHowever, in order to protect the interests of third parties established in Member States other than the one in which the grapevine products is produced, the Commission should remain responsible for approving amendments for which an objection procedure is required at Union level. Therefore, a new classification of amendments should be introduced: standard amendments, which apply immediately following the approval by the Member State since they do not require an objection procedure at Union level, and Union amendments, which apply only following approval by the Commission subsequent upon the completion of an objection procedure at Union level.\n(17)\nTemporary amendments should be introduced to allow grapevine products bearing a protected designation of origin or geographical indication to continue to be marketed under the protected names in cases of natural disaster or adverse weather conditions or adoption of sanitary or phytosanitary measures which temporarily prevent operators from complying with the product specification. Due to their emergency nature, temporary amendments should apply immediately following the approval by the Member State. The list of emergency grounds for temporary amendments is exhaustive due to the exceptional character of temporary amendments.\n(18)\nUnion amendments should follow the procedure governing applications for protection in order to have the same efficiency and guarantees. It should be applied mutatis mutandis with the exclusion of certain steps which should be omitted with a view to reducing the administrative burden. The procedure for standard amendments and temporary amendments should be established to allow Member States to carry out an appropriate assessment of the applications and to guarantee a consistent approach across Member States. The accuracy and exhaustiveness of Member States' assessment should be equivalent to the accuracy and exhaustiveness required for the assessment process within the procedure governing applications for the protection.\n(19)\nStandard and temporary amendments related to the protected designations of origin and geographical indications of third countries should follow the approach provided for Member States, and the approval decision should be taken in accordance with the system in force in the third country in question.\n(20)\nThe cancellation procedure should be more transparent and clear. In particular, it should be possible to oppose the cancellation request. To that end, the cancellation procedure should follow the standard procedure governing applications for protection, mutatis mutandis, with the exclusion of certain steps which should be omitted to reduce the administrative burden. It should be possible to cancel protected names if a name is no longer in use in the market place.\n(21)\nRules on temporary labelling and the presentation of grapevine products whose name has been the subject of an application for protection as a designation of origin or geographical indication should be adopted in order to ensure the protection of the legitimate interests of the operators while taking into account the principle of fair competition and the obligation to ensure that appropriate information is communicated to consumers.\n(22)\nCertain protected designations of origin benefit from derogations from the obligation to use the term ‘protected designation of origin’ on labels. In order to maintain this historical concession it is appropriate to confirm the existence of this derogation for such names.\n(23)\nThe use of traditional terms to describe grapevine products is a long-established practice in the Union. Such terms designate a production or ageing method, the quality, colour, type of place or a particular event linked to the history of a grapevine product bearing a protected designation of origin or geographical indication or indicate that it is a grapevine product having a protected designation of origin or geographical indication. Articles 112 and 113 of Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 lay down the general rules regarding the use and protection of traditional terms. So as to ensure fair competition and avoid misleading consumers, a common framework should be laid down regarding the protection and registration of such traditional terms. Furthermore, the procedures concerning the grant of protection to traditional terms should be simplified and harmonised, where possible, with the procedures applicable to the grant of protection to designations of origin and geographical indications.\n(24)\nA traditional term may evoke the particular characteristics of the grapevine product bearing that traditional term. Therefore, in order to convey clear information, that term should be indicated only in the language customarily used, with its original spelling and script.\n(25)\nIn order to ensure that consumers are not misled, the use of traditional terms for grapevine products manufactured in third countries should be allowed provided they fulfil the same or equivalent conditions to those required from Member States. Therefore, both Member States and third countries should have the possibility to apply for the protection of a traditional term at Union level. Having regard to the fact that some third countries do not have the same centralised system of protection of traditional terms as the Union, the definition of ‘representative professional organisations’ operating in third countries should be laid down to ensure the same guarantees as those provided for in the Union rules.\n(26)\nMember States, third countries or representative professional organisations operating in third countries should ensure that the application for protection submitted to the Commission is complete and contains all relevant information that allows the Commission to establish that the traditional term complies with the conditions laid down in Article 112 of Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 and proves that the traditional term is already protected in the Member State.\n(27)\nProtection should only be granted to traditional terms that are widely known and have a significant economic impact on the grapevine products for which they are reserved. Therefore, the Commission should approve applications for the protection of a traditional term only where the application provides exhaustive evidence that the term is traditionally used to describe grapevine products produced in a large part of the territory of the Union or is a reputed name traditionally used in the entire territory of a Member State or third country, that fair competition is guaranteed for producers that used that term prior to the grant of protection and that the traditional term is not a generic term. To this end, the meaning of ‘traditional use’ and ‘generic’ should be defined in this Regulation.\n(28)\nThe Commission should scrutinise the application for protection of a traditional term in order to ensure that the application is duly completed and complies with the conditions laid down by this Regulation. If the application requirements are not met, the Commission should request the applicant to make the necessary modifications or to withdraw the application. In the absence of action on the part of the applicant, the application should be rejected.\n(29)\nTo ensure the absence of any obstacle to the protection of a traditional term, any Member State or third country, or any natural or legal person having a legitimate interest, should have the option of objecting to the protection of that traditional term. In order for the objection to be deemed admissible, the objection should be substantiated and should demonstrate that the application is not in compliance with Union rules on traditional terms. Furthermore, in case the objection is considered admissible, the Commission should provide the applicant with a copy of the objection received in order to facilitate the parties to reach an agreement. If no agreement between the parties is reached, the Commission should rule on the objection and grant the protection or reject the application for protection of the traditional term.\n(30)\nIn order to ensure clarity for consumers as regards the nature and origin of the product and in order to ensure fair competition among producers, it is necessary to establish the conditions of use for trade marks that contain or consist of a traditional term and for the use of homonymous traditional terms.\n(31)\nIn order to take account of the evolution in consumption patterns and to address grapevine products production and marketing developments, it should be possible for Member States and third countries to apply to modify or cancel a traditional term. To be deemed admissible, applications to modify or cancel a traditional term should be duly substantiated.\n(32)\nThe system in place in third countries for the protection and use of traditional terms may differ from the one in place within the Union. For consistency purposes, the use of traditional terms to describe grapevine products produced in third countries should be allowed provided that they do not conflict with Union law.\n(33)\nThe acquired right of protection of traditional terms protected under Regulation (EC) No 607/2009 should be taken into account. Those terms should therefore continue to be automatically protected under this Regulation.\n(34)\nArticles 117 to 121 of Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 lay down the general rules for the labelling and presentation of grapevine products. That Regulation also harmonises the use of terms other than those expressly specified by Union legislation, provided that they are not misleading. For the smooth functioning of the internal market, Union rules on the use of compulsory labelling particulars for grapevine products should be laid down. Moreover, in order not to mislead consumers, provisions on the use of optional labelling particulars should also be set out.\n(35)\nIn order to assist consumers, mandatory information should be grouped in a single visual field on the container. However, in accordance with the requirements of Regulation (EU) No 1169/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council (7), certain compulsory particulars, such as the indication of the importer and listing of ingredients that may cause allergies or intolerances should be exempt from this obligation.\n(36)\nUnder the terms of Regulation (EU) No 1169/2011 the substances or products that may cause allergies or intolerances and the terms to be used to indicate them on the label of foodstuffs are those listed in Annex II therein. In the case of grapevine products, other terms are also used to refer to egg products, milk products and sulphites. Those terms should therefore be used for the labelling of grapevine products.\n(37)\nGrapevine products produced within the Union are exported to third countries. In order to ensure that consumers of those countries understand the information related to the product they purchase, it should be possible to have the label translated into the languages of the importing country. Moreover, in order to facilitate trade, provision should be made permitting the labels to display any particulars required by the legislation of the importing country, whether or not compliant with Union law. Moreover, for security reasons, it should also be possible to derogate from Union presentation requirements for grapevine products to be consumed on board of airplanes, such as the obligation to use glass-bottles for sparkling wines.\n(38)\nThe use of lead-based capsules to cover the closing devices of containers holding products covered by Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 should continue to be banned in order to avoid any risk of contamination by contact with such capsules and environmental pollution from waste.\n(39)\nDue regard should be given to the particular nature of grapevine products and the degree of variability of their alcohol content. Therefore, positive and negative tolerances should be allowed as regards the indication of the actual alcoholic strength by volume on the label.\n(40)\nIn order to ensure traceability, rules on the ‘indication of provenance’ should be introduced. Moreover, those rules should take into account the expectation of consumers as regards the origin of the grapevine products and that of the grape and must used to produce the final product.\n(41)\nFor the smooth operation of the internal market and to ensure that the consumer is not misled, there should be a compulsory indication of the name and address of the bottler, producer, vendor or importer.\n(42)\nConsumers often make purchasing decisions based on the information provided concerning the sugar content of sparkling wine, aerated sparkling wine, quality sparkling wine and quality aromatic sparkling wine. The indication of sugar content should therefore be compulsory for those categories of grapevine products while it should remain optional for other categories of grapevine products.\n(43)\nConsumers are not always aware of the characteristics and production methods of aerated sparkling wine and aerated semi-sparkling wine, especially as regards the use of carbon dioxide. It is therefore necessary to indicate on the label of that wine that it has been produced by adding carbon dioxide.\n(44)\nThe indication of the vintage year and the indication of one or more wine grape varieties require specific rules to ensure that the information conveyed to consumers is not misleading. In particular, restrictions should be established for the use of grape variety names consisting of or containing a protected designation of origin or geographical indication.\n(45)\nConsumers also often make purchasing decisions based on the wine grape variety used. In order to prevent misleading labelling practices, rules on the conditions of use of the names used to indicate wine grape varieties should be laid down. Furthermore, considering the economic importance of varietal wines for producers, it should be possible for producers of grapevine products not bearing a protected designation of origin or geographical indication to indicate the information ‘varietal wine’, together with the name of the country where the grapevine product was produced, on the label.\n(46)\nThe sugar content of grapevine products other than sparkling wine, aerated sparkling wine, quality sparkling wine and quality aromatic sparkling wine is not an essential element of information for the consumer. It should therefore be optional for producers to indicate the sugar content of those grapevine products on the label. However, in order not to mislead the consumers, the voluntary use of terms related to the sugar content for those products should be regulated.\n(47)\nIn order to ensure the veracity and accuracy of the information conveyed to the consumer, specific conditions should be set out for indicating production methods on the label, especially as regards production methods for sparkling wines and ageing practices for all grapevine products. These terms evoke higher standard grapevine products in the consumer's mind, and should therefore be reserved for grapevine products bearing a protected designation of origin or geographical indication.\n(48)\nThe indication of the holding which exploits the vineyards from which the grapevine products come and where all the winemaking processes are carried out, may constitute an added value for producers and a higher quality indication for consumers. It should therefore be permissible for producers to indicate the name of a holding on the labels of grapevine products bearing a protected designation of origin or protected geographical indication.\n(49)\nThe indication on the label of the name of a geographical area which is smaller or larger than the area of a protected designation of origin or geographical indication should be permitted for grapevine products bearing a protected designation of origin or geographical indication, in order to better inform the consumer about the place where the grapevine product was produced, in particular where such places are well known by consumers.\n(50)\nThe use of bottles having a particular shape for certain grapevine products bearing a protected designation of origin or geographical indication is a long-established practice within the Union and such use can evoke certain characteristics or the provenance of those grapevine products in the mind of consumers. Such bottle shapes should therefore be reserved for the wines in question.\n(51)\nThe traditional type of glass bottle and closure of sparkling wines reflect traditional production and bottling practices. They should therefore be reserved to sparkling wine. However, Member States should be able to authorise the use of such type of bottle and closure for other beverages, provided that they do not mislead the consumer as to the real nature of the product.\n(52)\nMember States should be enabled, for the implementation of their quality policy, to lay down additional rules for the labelling of grapevine products produced on their territories, provided that they are compatible with Union law.\n(53)\nAny documents or information sent to the Commission concerning an application for protection, amendment or cancellation of a protected designation of origin, geographical indication or traditional term should be in one of the official languages of the Union or accompanied by the translation in one of those languages, in order to allow the Commission to carry out the correct analysis of the submitted documentation and information.\n(54)\nTo ensure a smooth transition from the rules of Regulation (EC) No 607/2009 to the new rules set out in this Regulation and Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2019/34 (8), transitional periods should be provided for in order to enable economic operators established in the Union and in third countries to comply with the labelling requirements. Provisions should be enacted to ensure that grapevine products labelled in accordance with the existing rules may continue to be marketed until stocks are exhausted,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nCHAPTER I\nINTRODUCTORY PROVISION\nArticle 1\nSubject matter\nThis Regulation lays down rules supplementing Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 concerning protected designations of origin, protected geographical indications and traditional terms, in addition to labelling and presentation in the wine sector as regards:\n(a)\napplications for protection;\n(b)\nthe objection procedure;\n(c)\nrestrictions of use of protected designation of origin and protected geographical indications\n(d)\namendments to product specifications and modifications of traditional terms;\n(e)\ncancellation of protection;\n(f)\nlabelling and presentation.\nCHAPTER II\nPROTECTED DESIGNATIONS OF ORIGIN AND GEOGRAPHICAL INDICATIONS\nSECTION 1\nApplication for protection\nArticle 2\nName to be protected\n1.   The name to be protected as a designation of origin or geographical indication shall be registered only in the languages which are or were historically used to describe the specific product in the demarcated geographical area.\n2.   The name of a designation of origin or a geographical indication shall be registered in its original script. Where the original script is not in Latin characters, a transcription in Latin characters shall be registered together with the name in its original script.\nArticle 3\nApplicant\nA single producer may be deemed an applicant within the meaning of Article 95(1) of Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 if it is shown that:\n(a)\nthe person concerned is the only producer willing to submit an application; and\n(b)\nthe demarcated geographical area possesses characteristics which differ appreciably from those of neighbouring areas or the characteristics of the product are different from those produced in neighbouring areas.\nThe circumstance by which a protected designation of origin or geographical indication consists of or contains the name of the holding of the single applicant producer shall not prevent other producers from using that name provided that they comply with the product specification.\nArticle 4\nAdditional requirements for product specifications\n1.   The description of the grapevine products shall indicate the relevant category or categories of grapevine products from amongst the categories set out in Part II of Annex VII to Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013.\n2.   Where the product specification indicates that packaging, including bottling, shall take place within the demarcated geographical area or within an area in the immediate proximity of the demarcated area in question, it shall also include a justification showing why, in the specific case, the packaging must take place in the particular geographical area to safeguard quality, to ensure the origin or to ensure control, taking into account Union law, in particular that on the free movement of goods and the free provision of services.\nArticle 5\nDerogations concerning production in the demarcated geographical area\n1.   By way of derogation from points (a)(iii) and (b)(iii) of Article 93(1) of Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013, and on condition that the product specification so provides, a product which has a protected designation of origin or geographical indication may be made into wine in any of the following locations:\n(a)\nin an area in the immediate proximity of the demarcated area in question;\n(b)\nin an area located within the same administrative unit or within a neighbouring administrative unit, in conformity with national rules;\n(c)\nin the case of a trans-border designation of origin or geographical indication, or where an agreement on control measures exists between two or more Member States or between one or more Member States and one or more third countries, in an area situated in the immediate proximity of the demarcated area in question.\n2.   By way of derogation from point (a)(iii) of Article 93(1) of Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013, and on condition that the product specification so provides, a product may be made into sparkling wine or semi-sparkling wine bearing a protected designation of origin beyond the immediate proximity of the demarcated area in question if this practice was in use prior to 1 March 1986.\n3.   By way of derogation from point (a)(iii) of Article 93(1) of Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013, with regard to liqueur wines with the protected designation of origin ‘Málaga’ and ‘Jerez-Xérès-Sherry’, the must of raisined grapes to which neutral alcohol of vine origin has been added to prevent fermentation, obtained from Pedro Ximénez vine variety, may come from the ‘Montilla-Moriles’ region.\nArticle 6\nNational procedure\nWhen forwarding an application for protection to the Commission in accordance with Article 96(5) of Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013, a Member State shall include a declaration that it considers that the application lodged by the applicant meets the conditions for protection under Subsection 2 of Section 2 of Chapter I of Title II of Part II of Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 and the provisions adopted pursuant thereto and that it certifies that the single document referred to in Article 94(1)(d) of Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 is a faithful summary of the product specification.\nMember States shall inform the Commission of admissible objections received in the national procedure. Member States shall keep the Commission informed of any national judicial proceedings possibly affecting the application for protection.\nArticle 7\nJoint applications\nWhere joint applications for the protection of a name as designation of origin or geographical indication, as referred to in Article 95(3) of Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013, are submitted, the related preliminary national procedures, including the objection stage, shall be carried out in all the Member States concerned.\nArticle 8\nTransitional national protection\n1.   A Member State may, on a transitional basis only, grant protection to a name at national level, with effect from the date upon which an application for protection has been forwarded to the Commission.\nSuch transitional national protection shall cease on the date upon which either a decision on protection under Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 is taken or the application is withdrawn.\n2.   Where a name is not protected under this Regulation, the consequences of such national protection shall be the sole responsibility of the Member State concerned. The measures taken by Member States under paragraph 1 shall have no effect on intra-Union or international trade.\nArticle 9\nAdmissibility of the application\n1.   Applications for protection are considered admissible if they are submitted in accordance with Articles 94, 95 and 96 of Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 and Article 3 and Article 5(3) of Implementing Regulation (EU) 2019/34 and if they are duly completed.\nAn application for protection shall be considered to be duly completed when it complies with Article 94(1) and (3) of Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 and Article 2 of Implementing Regulation (EU) 2019/34 and if the single document is duly completed.\nThe single document summarising the product specification, referred to in Article 94(1)(d) of Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 shall be considered to be duly completed when it complies with the requirements listed in Article 5(1) and (2) of Implementing Regulation (EU) 2019/34. The product specification shall be considered duly completed when it complies with the requirements set out in Article 94(2) of Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013.\n2.   If the Commission considers that an application is inadmissible, it shall inform the competent authorities of the Member State or those of the third country or the applicant established in a third country of the reasons grounding the finding of inadmissibility.\n3.   At least once a month the Commission shall make public the list of names for which it has received applications for protection as designations of origin or geographical indications, the name of the applicant Member State or third country and the date of submission of the application.\nArticle 10\nScrutiny of the application\nAn examination of the application by the Commission, as referred to in Article 97(2) of Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013, shall consist of a check that there are no manifest errors in the application. When examining the application the Commission shall examine the single document in particular. The examination should be completed within a period of 6 months. Where this period is exceeded, the Commission shall inform the applicant in writing of the reasons for the delay.\nSECTION 2\nObjection procedure\nArticle 11\nAdmissibility and grounds of objection\n1.   For the purposes of Article 98 of Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 a substantiated statement of objection shall be admissible where:\n(a)\nit is received by the Commission within the deadline set out in Article 98 of Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013;\n(b)\nit complies with the requirements set out in Article 8(1) of Implementing Regulation (EU) 2019/34;\nand:\n(c)\nit shows that the application for protection or amendment to the product specification or for cancellation of the protection is incompatible with the rules on designations of origin and geographical indications because:\n(i)\nit would conflict with Articles 92 to 95, 105 or 106 of Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 and with the provisions adopted pursuant thereto;\n(ii)\nthe registration of the proposed name would conflict with Article 100 or 101 of Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013;\n(iii)\nthe registration of the proposed name would jeopardise the rights of a trade mark holder or of a user of a fully homonymous name or of a compound name, one term of which is identical to the name to be registered, or the existence of partially homonymous names or of other names similar to the name to be registered which refer to grapevine products which have been legally on the market for at least five years preceding the date of the publication provided for in Article 97(3) of Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013.\nThe grounds of objection shall be assessed in relation to the territory of the Union.\nWhere an objection is filed by a natural or legal person, the duly substantiated statement of objection shall be admissible only if it shows the legitimate interest of the objector.\n2.   Where the Commission considers that the objection is inadmissible, it shall inform the authority or natural or legal person that objected of the reasons grounding the finding of inadmissibility.\nArticle 12\nObjection procedure\n1.   If the Commission considers that the objection is admissible it shall invite the authority or natural or legal person that lodged the objection and the authority or natural or legal person that lodged the application for protection to engage in appropriate consultations for a period of three months. The invitation shall be issued within a period of four months from the date on which the application for protection, to which the substantiated statement of objection relates, is published in the Official Journal of the European Union and it shall be accompanied by a copy of the substantiated statement of objection. At any time during these three months, the Commission may, at the request of the authority or natural or legal person that lodged the application, extend the deadline for the consultations by a maximum of three months.\n2.   The authority or person that lodged the objection and the authority or person that lodged the application for protection shall start such consultations without undue delay. They shall provide each other with the relevant information to assess whether the application for protection complies with the conditions of this Regulation and of Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013.\n3.   If the parties reach an agreement, either the applicant established in the third country or the authorities of the Member State or of the third country from which the application for protection was lodged shall notify the Commission of the results of the consultations carried out and of all the factors which enabled that agreement to be reached, including the opinions of the parties. If the details published in accordance with Article 97(3) of Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 have been substantially amended, the Commission shall repeat the scrutiny referred to in Article 97(2) of that Regulation after a national procedure ensuring adequate publication of those amended details has been carried out. Where, following the agreement, there are no amendments to the product specification or where the amendments are not substantial, the Commission shall adopt a decision in accordance with Article 99 of Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 conferring protection on the designation of origin or geographical indication.\n4.   If no agreement is reached, either the applicant established in the third country or the authorities of the Member State or of the third country, from which the application for protection was lodged shall notify the Commission of the results of the consultations carried out and of all the related information and documents. The Commission shall adopt a decision in accordance with Article 99 of Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 either conferring protection or rejecting the application.\nArticle 13\nRestrictions on the use of protected designations of origin and protected geographical indications\n1.   Without prejudice to Article 102 of Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013, the Commission may adopt implementing acts granting a transitional period of up to five years to enable products originating in a Member State or a third country, the designation of which consists of or contains a name that contravenes Article 103(2) of Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013, to continue to use the designation under which they were marketed.\nThe granting of such transitional period is conditional upon the submission of an admissible statement of objection under Article 96(3) or Article 98 of Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 showing that the decision conferring protection over the name would jeopardise the existence:\n(a)\nof an entirely identical name or of a compound name, one term of which is identical to the name to be registered; or\n(b)\nof partially homonymous names or of other names similar to the name to be registered which refer to grapevine products which have been legally on the market for at least five years preceding the date of the publication provided for in Article 97(3) of Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013.\n2.   The Commission may adopt implementing acts extending the transitional period referred to in paragraph 1 up to 15 years in duly justified cases where it is shown that:\n(a)\nthe designation referred to in paragraph 1 has been in legal use consistently and fairly for at least 25 years before the application for protection was submitted to the Commission;\n(b)\nthe purpose of using the designation referred to in paragraph 1 has not, at any time, been to profit from the reputation of the registered name and it is shown that the consumer has not been nor could have been misled as to the true origin of the product.\n3.   When using a designation referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2, the indication of the country of origin shall clearly and visibly appear on the labelling.\n4.   To overcome temporary difficulties, with the long-term objective of ensuring that all producers in the area concerned comply with the product specification, a Member State may grant protection for a transitional period, starting from the date on which the application is forwarded to the Commission, on condition that the operators concerned have legally marketed the grapevine products in question using the names concerned continuously for at least the five years prior to the lodging of the application to the authorities of the Member State and that these temporary difficulties had been raised in the national objection procedure referred to in Article 96(3) of Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013. The transitional period shall be as short as possible and shall not exceed 10 years.\nThe first subparagraph shall apply mutatis mutandis to a protected geographical indication or protected designation of origin referring to a geographical area situated in a third country, with the exception of the objection procedure.\nSuch transitional periods shall be indicated in the application file referred to in Article 94(1) of Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013.\nSECTION 3\nAmendments to product specifications\nArticle 14\nTypes of amendments\n1.   For the purposes of Article 105 of Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 amendments to a product specification are classified into two categories as regards their importance: amendments requiring an objection procedure at Union level (‘Union amendments’), and amendments to be dealt with at Member State or third country level (‘standard amendments’).\nAn amendment is considered to be a Union amendment where:\n(a)\nit includes a change in the name of the protected designation of origin or protected geographical indication;\n(b)\nit consists of a change, a deletion or an addition of a category of grapevine product, as referred to in Part II of Annex VII to Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013;\n(c)\nit could potentially void the link referred to in point (a)(i) or in point (b)(i) of Article 93(1) of Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013;\n(d)\nit entails further restrictions on the marketing of the product.\nApplications for Union amendments submitted by third countries or by third country producers shall contain proof that the requested amendment complies with the laws on the protection of designations of origin or geographical indications in force in that third country.\nAll other amendments are considered standard amendments.\n2.   For the purposes of Article 105 of Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013, a temporary amendment is a standard amendment concerning a temporary change in the product specification resulting from the imposition of obligatory sanitary and phytosanitary measures by the public authorities or linked to natural disasters or adverse weather conditions formally recognised by the competent authorities.\nArticle 15\nProcedure for Union amendments to product specifications\n1.   An application for approval of a Union amendment to a product specification, as defined in Article 14 of this Regulation, shall follow the procedure laid down in Article 94 and Articles 96 to 99 of Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013, in Sections 1, 2 and 3 of Chapter II of this Regulation and in Sections 1, 2 and 3 of Chapter II of Implementing Regulation (EU) 2019/34 mutatis mutandis.\n2.   Where, based on the examination carried out pursuant to Article 97(2) of Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013, the Commission considers that the conditions required under Article 97(3) of that Regulation are met, it shall publish the application for a Union amendment referred to in Article 9(1) of Implementing Regulation (EU) 2019/34 in the Official Journal of the European Union, C series. The final decision on the approval of the amendment shall be adopted without applying the examination procedure referred to in Article 229(2) of Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 unless an admissible objection has been lodged or the application for amendment is rejected, in which case the second paragraph of Article 99 of that Regulation shall apply.\n3.   An application for approval of Union amendments shall contain Union amendments exclusively. If an application for Union amendments also contains standard or temporary amendments the procedure for Union amendments shall apply only to the Union amendments. The standard or temporary amendments shall be deemed as not submitted.\n4.   In examining the applications for amendment, the Commission shall focus on the proposed amendments.\nArticle 16\nAdmissibility of applications for Union amendment\n1.   Applications for approval of a Union amendment to a product specification are considered admissible if they are submitted in accordance with Article 105 of Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 and with Article 3 and Article 9(2) of Implementing Regulation (EU) 2019/34 mutatis mutandis, and if they are duly completed.\nAn application for approval of a Union amendment to a product specification shall be considered to be duly completed where it is comprehensive and exhaustive and where it complies with the requirements set out in Article 2 and Article 9(1) of Implementing Regulation (EU) 2019/34.\nThe approval by the Commission of an application for approval of a Union amendment to a product specification shall only cover the amendments submitted in the application itself.\n2.   If the application is considered inadmissible, the competent authorities of the Member State or those of the third country or the applicant established in a third country shall be informed of the reasons for the inadmissibility.\nArticle 17\nStandard amendments\n1.   Standard amendments shall be approved and made public by Member States to which the geographical area of the designation of origin or geographical indication relates.\nApplications for approval of a standard amendment to a product specification shall be submitted to the authorities of the Member State to whom the geographical area of the designation or indication relates. Applicants shall satisfy the conditions laid down in Article 95 of Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013. If the application for approval of a standard amendment to a product specification does not come from the applicant which had submitted the application for protection of the name or names to which the product specification refers, the Member State shall give that applicant the opportunity to comment on the application, if that applicant still exists.\nThe application for a standard amendment shall provide a description of the standard amendments, provide a summary of the reasons for which the amendments are required and demonstrate that the proposed amendments qualify as standard in accordance with Article 14 of this Regulation.\n2.   Where the Member State considers that the requirements of Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 and the provisions adopted pursuant thereto are met, it may approve and make public the standard amendment. The approval decision shall include the modified consolidated single document, where relevant, and the modified consolidated product specification.\nThe standard amendment shall be applicable in the Member State once it has been made public. The Member State shall communicate standard amendments to the Commission not later than one month following the date on which the national decision of approval was made public.\n3.   Decisions approving standard amendments concerning grapevine products originating in third countries shall be taken in accordance with the system in force in the third country concerned and shall be communicated to the Commission by a single producer within the meaning of Article 3 or a group of producers having a legitimate interest, either directly to the Commission or via the authorities of that third country, not later than one month following the date they are made public.\n4.   The communication of standard amendments shall be considered to be duly completed when it complies with Article 10 of Implementing Regulation (EU) 2019/34.\n5.   In the event that the standard amendment implies a modification of the single document, the Commission shall publish the description of the standard amendment referred to in Article 10 of Implementing Regulation (EU) 2019/34 and the modified single document in the Official Journal of the European Union, C series, within three months from the date on which the communication is received from the Member State, third country or third country single producer or group of producers.\n6.   In the event that the standard amendment does not imply a modification of the single document, the Commission shall make public, via the information systems referred to in Article 32 of Implementing Regulation (EU) 2019/34, the description of the standard amendment within three months from the date on which the communication is received from the Member State, third country or applicant established in the third country.\n7.   Standard amendments shall be applicable in the territory of the Union once they have been published in the Official Journal of the European Union, C series or made public by the Commission in the information systems referred to in Article 32 of Implementing Regulation (EU) 2019/34.\n8.   If the geographical area covers more than one Member State, the Member States concerned shall apply the procedure for standard amendments separately for the part of the area which falls within their territory. The standard amendment shall be applicable only after the last national decision of approval becomes applicable. The Member State last approving the standard amendment shall send the Commission the communication referred to in paragraph 4 not later than one month following the date on which its decision approving the standard amendment is made public.\nIf one or more of the Member States concerned do not adopt the national decision of approval referred to in the first subparagraph, any of Member States concerned may submit an application under the Union amendment procedure. Such a rule shall also apply mutatis mutandis when one or more of the concerned countries is a third country.\nArticle 18\nTemporary amendments\n1.   Temporary amendments shall be approved and made public by Member States to which the geographical area of the designation of origin or geographical indication relates. They shall be communicated to the Commission together with the reasons supporting the temporary amendments not later than one month following the date on which the national decision of approval was made public. A temporary amendment is applicable in the Member State once it has been made public.\n2.   Where the geographical area covers more than one Member State, the procedure for temporary amendment applies separately in the Member States concerned for the part of the area which falls within their territory. Temporary amendments shall be applicable only when the last national decision of approval becomes applicable. The Member State last approving the temporary amendment shall communicate it to the Commission not later than one month following the date upon which its decision of approval is made public. This rule applies, mutatis mutandis, also when one or more of the countries concerned is a third country.\n3.   Temporary amendments concerning grapevine products originating in third countries shall be communicated to the Commission, together with the reasons supporting the temporary amendments, by a single producer within the meaning of Article 3 or a group of producers having a legitimate interest, either directly or via the authorities of that third country, not later than one month following their approval.\n4.   The communication of temporary amendments shall be considered to be duly completed when it contains all the elements referred to in Article 11 of Implementing Regulation (EU) 2019/34.\n5.   The Commission shall make public such amendments within three months from the date on which the communication is received from the Member State, third country or third country single producer or group of producers. A temporary amendment is applicable in the territory of the Union once it has been made public by the Commission.\nSECTION 4\nCancelling a protected designation of origin or geographical indication\nArticle 19\nCancellation procedure\nRequests to cancel a protected designation of origin or geographical indication, as referred to in Article 106 of Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013, shall follow the procedure laid down in Article 94 and Articles 96 to 99 of that Regulation together with provisions of Sections 1, 2 and 4 of Chapter II of this Regulation and of Sections 1, 2, 4 and 5 of Chapter II of Implementing Regulation (EU) 2019/34 mutatis mutandis.\nThe Commission shall publish the cancellation request referred to in Article 13 of Implementing Regulation (EU) 2019/34 in the Official Journal of the European Union, C series.\nArticle 20\nGrounds for cancellation\nFor the purposes of Article 106 of Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 compliance with the product specification shall also be deemed not to be ensured where no product bearing the protected name has been placed on the market for at least seven consecutive years.\nArticle 21\nAdmissibility of cancellation requests\n1.   For the purpose of Articles 106 of Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 a substantiated cancellation request shall be admissible where:\n(a)\nthe cancellation request complies with the requirements set out in Article 13(1) of Implementing Regulation (EU) 2019/34; and\n(b)\nthe cancellation request is based on the grounds referred to in Article 106 of Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013.\n2.   Where the Commission considers that the cancellation request is not admissible it shall inform the Member State or third country authority or the natural or legal person that submitted the request of the reasons supporting the finding of inadmissibility.\n3.   Substantiated statements of objection to cancellation shall be admissible only where they show commercial reliance by an interested person on the registered name.\nSECTION 5\nUse of symbols, indications and abbreviations\nArticle 22\nTemporary labelling and presentation\nAfter an application for protection of a designation of origin or a geographical indication has been forwarded to the Commission, producers may indicate it in labelling and presentation, and use national logos and indications, in compliance with Union law and in particular Regulation (EU) No 1169/2011.\nUnion symbols indicating the protected designation of origin or the protected geographical indication, the Union indications ‘protected designation of origin’ or ‘protected geographical indication’ and the Union abbreviations ‘PDO’ or ‘PGI’ may appear on the labelling only after the publication of the decision conferring protection on that designation of origin or geographical indication.\nWhere the application is rejected, any grapevine products labelled in accordance with the first subparagraph may be marketed until the stocks are exhausted.\nArticle 23\nDerogations from the obligation to use the term ‘protected designation of origin’ on labels\nIn accordance with Article 119(3) of Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013, references to the terms ‘protected designation of origin’ may be omitted for wines bearing the following protected designations of origin:\n(a)\nGreece:\nΣάμος (Samos);\n(b)\nSpain:\nCava, Jerez, Xérès or Sherry, Manzanilla;\n(c)\nFrance:\nChampagne;\n(d)\nItaly:\nAsti, Marsala, Franciacorta;\n(e)\nCyprus:\nΚουμανδαρία (Commandaria);\n(f)\nPortugal:\nMadeira or Madère, Port or Porto.\nCHAPTER III\nTRADITIONAL TERMS\nSECTION 1\nApplications for protection and examination procedure\nArticle 24\nLanguage and spelling of the traditional term\n1.   A traditional term shall be registered:\n(a)\nin the official language or regional language of the Member State or third country from which the term originates; or\n(b)\nin the language used in trade for this term.\n2.   A traditional term shall be registered with its original spelling and in its original script. Where the original script is not in Latin characters, a transcription in Latin characters shall be registered together with the name in its original script.\nArticle 25\nApplicants\n1.   Competent authorities of the Member States or third countries or representative professional organisations established in third countries may apply for the protection of a traditional term.\n2.   ‘Representative professional organisation’ shall mean any producer organisation or association of producer organisations having adopted the same rules, operating in the area of one or more wine designations of origin or geographical indications where it includes in its membership at least two thirds of the producers established in the area in which it operates and accounts for at least two thirds of the production of that area. A representative professional organisation may lodge an application for protection only for grapevine products which it produces.\nArticle 26\nAdmissibility of the application\n1.   Applications for protection are considered admissible where they are submitted in compliance with Article 25 of this Regulation and Article 21 and Article 30(3) of Implementing Regulation (EU) 2019/34 and are duly completed.\nAn application shall be considered to be duly completed where it contains the following information:\n(a)\nthe name to be protected as a traditional term;\n(b)\nthe type of traditional term, whether it falls under Article 112(a) or (b) of Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013;\n(c)\nthe language in which the name to be protected as a traditional term is expressed;\n(d)\nthe grapevine product category or categories concerned;\n(e)\na summary of the definition and conditions of use;\n(f)\nthe protected designations of origin or protected geographical indications concerned.\n2.   The application shall be accompanied by a copy of the legislation of the Member State concerned or rules applicable to wine producers in the third country or countries concerned, governing the use of the term in question, and a reference to the publication of that legislation or those rules.\n3.   If the application is not duly completed or if the documents referred to in paragraph 2 have not been provided with the application, the application shall be inadmissible.\n4.   Where the application is inadmissible, the authorities of the Member State or those of the third country or the applicant established in the third country in question shall be informed of the reasons for its inadmissibility and that they are entitled to submit another application duly completed.\nArticle 27\nConditions of validity\n1.   An application for the protection of a traditional term shall be deemed valid if the name for which the protection is sought:\n(a)\nfulfils the requirements of a traditional term as defined in Article 112 of Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 as well as the requirements laid down in Article 24 of this Regulation;\n(b)\nconsists exclusively of either:\n(i)\na name traditionally used in trade in a large part of the territory of the Union or of the third country in question, to distinguish specific categories of grapevine products referred to in Article 92(1) of Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013; or\n(ii)\na reputed name traditionally used in trade in at least the territory of the Member State or third country in question, to distinguish specific categories of grapevine products referred to in Article 92(1) of Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013;\n(c)\nhas not become generic, and\n(d)\nis defined and regulated in the Member State's legislation or subject to conditions of use as provided for by rules applicable to wine producers in the third country in question, including those emanating from representative professional organisations.\nPoint (b) shall not apply to traditional terms referred to in Article 112(a) of Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013.\n2.   For the purposes of paragraph (1) (b), traditional use means:\n(a)\nuse amounting to a period of at least five years in case of terms filed in the official language or regional language of the Member State or third country where the term originates;\n(b)\nuse amounting to a period of at least 15 years in case of terms filed in the language used for trade.\n3.   For the purposes of paragraph (1)(c), a name that has become ‘generic’ means the name which, although it relates to a specific production method or ageing method, or the quality, colour, type of place, or a particular event linked to the history of a grapevine product, has become the common name of that product in the Union.\nArticle 28\nScrutiny by the Commission\n1.   The date of submission of an application for protection of a traditional term shall be the date on which the application is received by the Commission.\n2.   The Commission shall examine whether the application for protection meets the conditions laid down in this Chapter.\n3.   Where the Commission considers that the conditions laid down in Articles 26 and 27 are met, it shall adopt an implementing act concerning the publication, in the Official Journal of the European Union, of the application for protection.\n4.   If an application for the protection of a traditional term does not meet the conditions laid down in this Chapter, the Commission shall inform the applicant of the grounds for refusal, setting a deadline for the withdrawal or modification of the application or for the submission of comments.\n5.   If the obstacles are not remedied by the applicant within the deadline referred to in paragraph 4, the Commission shall adopt an implementing act rejecting the application in accordance with Article 115(2) of Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013.\nSECTION 2\nObjection procedure\nArticle 29\nSubmission of an objection\nThe date of submission of an objection shall be the date on which the objection is received by the Commission.\nArticle 30\nAdmissibility and grounds of objection\n1.   A substantiated objection shall be admissible where:\n(a)\nit is submitted by any Member State or third country, or any natural or legal person having a legitimate interest;\n(b)\nit is received by the Commission within the deadline provided for in Article 22(1) of Implementing Regulation (EU) 2019/34;\n(c)\nit demonstrates that the application for protection is incompatible with the rules on traditional terms because it does not comply with Article 27 of this Regulation or because the registration of the name proposed would conflict with Article 32 or 33 of this Regulation.\n2.   An objection that is deemed admissible shall be notified to the Member State or the third country authorities or the representative professional organisation in the third country in question.\nArticle 31\nScrutiny of an objection\n1.   Where the Commission does not reject the objection in accordance with Article 23(3) of Implementing Regulation (EU) 2019/34, it shall communicate the objection to the applicant that submitted the application and shall invite the applicant to file observations within the time period referred to in Article 24(1) of Implementing Regulation (EU) 2019/34. Any observations received within this period shall be communicated to the objector.\nIn the course of its scrutiny of an objection, the Commission shall request the parties to provide comments, if appropriate, within the time period referred to in Article 24(2) of Implementing Regulation (EU) 2019/34, on the communications received from the other parties.\n2.   Where the applicant or the objector do not file any observations in response, or where the time periods for filing observations and for submitting comments referred to in Article 24 of Implementing Regulation (EU) 2019/34 are not respected, the Commission shall proceed to rule on the objection.\n3.   A decision to reject or recognise the traditional term in question shall be taken by the Commission on the basis of the evidence available to it. The Commission shall consider whether the conditions referred to or laid down in Articles 27, 32 or 33 of this Regulation are fulfilled. A decision to reject the traditional term shall be notified to the objector and to the applicant.\n4.   Where multiple objections are lodged, a preliminary examination of one or more such objections may prevent an application for protection from proceeding. In these circumstances, the Commission may suspend the other objection procedures. The Commission shall inform the other objectors of any decision affecting them which was taken in the course of the procedure.\nWhere an application is rejected, objection procedures which have been suspended shall be deemed to be closed and the objectors concerned shall be duly informed.\nSECTION 3\nProtection\nArticle 32\nRelationship with trade marks\n1.   The registration of a trade mark that contains or consists of a traditional term which does not respect the definition and conditions of use of that traditional term as referred to in Article 112 of Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013, and that relates to a product falling under one of the categories listed in Part II of Annex VII thereto shall be:\n(a)\nrefused if the application for registration of the trade mark is submitted after the date of submission of the application for protection of the traditional term to the Commission and the traditional term is subsequently protected; or\n(b)\ninvalidated.\n2.   A name shall not be protected as a traditional term where, in the light of a trade mark's reputation and renown, such protection is liable to mislead the consumer as to the true identity, nature, characteristic or quality of the grapevine product.\n3.   Without prejudice to paragraph 2, a trade mark referred to in paragraph 1 which has been applied for, registered or established by use in good faith, where national legislation so provides, in the territory of the Union, prior to the date of protection of the traditional term in the country of origin, may continue to be used and renewed notwithstanding the protection of a traditional term, provided that no grounds for the trade mark's invalidity or revocation exist under Directive 2008/95/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (9), Directive (EU) 2015/2436 of the European Parliament and of the Council (10) or under Regulation (EU) 2017/1001 of the European Parliament and of the Council (11).\nIn such cases, the use of the traditional term shall be permitted alongside the relevant trade marks.\nArticle 33\nHomonyms\n1.   A term for which an application for protection is submitted and which is wholly or partially homonymous with a traditional term already protected under Article 113 of Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 shall be registered with due regard to local and traditional usage and the risk of confusion.\nA homonymous term which misleads consumers as to the nature, quality or the true origin of the grapevine products shall not be registered even if the term is accurate.\nA registered homonymous term may be used only if there is a sufficient distinction in practice between the homonym registered subsequently and the term already in the register, having regard to the need to treat the producers concerned in an equitable manner and the need to avoid misleading the consumer.\n2.   Paragraph 1 shall apply mutatis mutandis for traditional terms protected before 1 August 2009 which are wholly or partially homonymous with a protected designation of origin or geographical indication or a wine grape variety name or its synonym listed in Annex IV.\nSECTION 4\nModification and cancellation\nArticle 34\nModification of a traditional term\nAn applicant satisfying the conditions of Article 25 may apply for approval of a modification of a registered traditional term concerning the elements referred to in points (b), (c) and (d) of Article 26(1).\nArticles 26 to 31 shall apply mutatis mutandis to applications for modification.\nArticle 35\nCancellation of a traditional term\nIn accordance with Article 115(2) of Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013, the Commission may, on a duly substantiated request by a Member State, a third country or a natural or legal person having a legitimate interest, adopt implementing acts cancelling the protection of a traditional term.\nArticles 26 to 31 shall apply mutatis mutandis to applications for cancellation.\nArticle 36\nGrounds for cancellation\nThe protection of a traditional term shall be cancelled where:\n(a)\nthe traditional term no longer meets the requirements laid down in Articles 27, 32 or 33;\n(b)\ncompliance with the corresponding definition and conditions of use is no longer ensured.\nArticle 37\nAdmissibility of a cancellation request\n1.   A substantiated cancellation request shall be admissible where:\n(a)\nit was submitted to the Commission by a Member State, a third country or a natural or legal person having a legitimate interest; and\n(b)\nit is based on one of the grounds referred to in Article 36.\nThe duly substantiated cancellation request shall be admissible only if it demonstrates the legitimate interest of the applicant.\n2.   Where the Commission considers that the cancellation request is not admissible it shall inform the authority or person that sent the request of the reasons for inadmissibility.\n3.   The Commission shall make the cancellation request available to the authorities and persons affected in accordance with Article 30(4) of Implementing Regulation (EU) 2019/34.\n4.   Substantiated statements of objection to cancellation requests shall be admissible only if they show continued commercial reliance on the registered name by an interested person.\nArticle 38\nRules concerning traditional terms used in third countries\n1.   The definition of traditional terms provided for in Article 112 of Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 shall apply mutatis mutandis to terms traditionally used in third countries for grapevine products covered by geographical indications or designations of origin under the legislation of those third countries.\n2.   Grapevine products originating in third countries whose labels bear traditional indications other than the traditional terms listed in the electronic database ‘E-Bacchus’, referred to in Article 25(1) of Implementing Regulation (EU) 2019/34, may use these traditional indications on wine labels in accordance with the rules applicable in the third countries concerned, including those emanating from representative professional organisations.\nSECTION 5\nArticle 39\nExisting protected traditional terms\nA traditional term which is protected under Regulation (EC) No 607/2009 shall automatically be protected under this Regulation.\nCHAPTER IV\nLABELLING AND PRESENTATION\nSECTION 1\nCompulsory particulars\nArticle 40\nPresentation of compulsory particulars\n1.   Compulsory particulars referred to in Article 119 of Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 shall appear in the same field of vision on the container, in such a way as to be simultaneously legible without having to turn the container, in indelible characters and shall be clearly distinguishable from surrounding text or graphics.\n2.   By way of derogation from paragraph 1, the compulsory particulars referred to in Article 41(1) and the lot number may appear outside the field of vision referred to in that paragraph.\n3.   The size of the characters of the particulars referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article and in Article 41(1) must be equal to or greater than 1,2 mm, regardless of the character format used.\nArticle 41\nApplication of certain horizontal rules\n1.   For the purposes of indicating certain substances or products causing allergies or intolerances, as referred to in Article 21 of Regulation (EU) No 1169/2011, the terms concerning sulphites/sulfites, eggs and egg-based products and milk and milk-based products that shall be used are those listed in Part A of Annex I.\n2.   The terms referred to in paragraph 1 may be accompanied by the relevant pictogram shown in Part B of Annex I.\nArticle 42\nMarketing and export\n1.   Grapevine products whose label or presentation does not conform to the corresponding conditions laid down in this Regulation shall not be marketed within the Union or exported.\n2.

geographical indications, traditional terms, labelling and presentation\nWines and wine sector products — protected designations of origin, protected geographical indications, traditional terms, labelling and presentation\nSUMMARY OF:\nDelegated Regulation (EU) 2019/33  — applications for protection of designations of origin, geographical indications and traditional terms in the wine sector, the objection procedure, restrictions of use, amendments to product specifications, cancellation of protection, and labelling and presentation\nWHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?\nIt sets out rules on protected designations of origin, protected geographical indications and traditional terms, in addition to labelling and presentation in the wine sector.\nIt supplements the rules set out in Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013\nKEY POINTS\nProtection of designations of origin and geographical indications\nProtected designation of origin (PDO) identifies the name of a region, a specific place or, in exceptional cases, a country, used to describe a product whose quality and characteristics are essentially due to a particular geographical environment and which must be produced within a determined geographical area using recognised and recorded know-how. All wine products with PDO status must be produced exclusively with grapes from the area in question.\nProtected geographical indication (PGI) means an indication referring to a region, a specific place or, in exceptional cases, a country, used to describe a product which possesses a specific quality, reputation or other characteristics that can be attributed to that geographical origin. All products with PGI status must be produced with at least 85% of the grapes coming from the area in question.\nRules for PDOs and PGIs\nThe regulation sets out rules covering:\napplying for protection;\nthe objection procedure — rules on the restrictions on the use of PDOs and PGIs where an objection has been made;\namending a product specification;\ncancelling protection;\nuse of symbols, indications and abbreviations — including the use of national logos and indications as well as derogations.\nTraditional terms\nTraditional terms are used to:\nindicate that the product has PDO or PGI status by virtue of EU law and the legislation of an EU country;\ndesignate a production or ageing method or a quality, colour or type of place or a particular event linked to the history of the product with PDO or PGI status.\nRules for traditional terms\nThe regulation sets out rules covering:\napplying for protection and the examination procedure — including the language and spelling of the terms, conditions of validity and scrutiny by the European Commission;\nthe objection procedure;\nprotection — including the relationship with trade marks, and homonyms*;\nmodification and cancellation.\nLabelling and presentation\nThe regulation also covers rules for labelling and presentation covering:\n‘compulsory particulars’ — in order to help consumers to better understand the specific character of wine sector products and to guarantee producers’ recognition of the quality of their products, labels of wine sector products must contain a number of items of information including: the category of the wine product, as set out in Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013;the term PDO or PGI for wines with those designations and the respective name;actual alcoholic strength;indication of provenance;indication of the bottler, for sparkling wines the producer or the vendor, for imported wines the importer;sugar content of sparkling wines.\n‘optional particulars’ — this can include: vintage;grape variety(ies);sugar content (for wines other than sparkling wine);traditional terms for wines with a PDO or PGI;EU symbol indicating a PDO or PGI;terms referring to certain production methods;terms referring to a holding.\nspecific bottle shapes and closures.\nFROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?\n              \nIt has applied since 14 January 2019.\nBACKGROUND\n              \nThis delegated regulation was adopted in parallel with Implementing Regulation (EU) 2019/34 which sets out rules to implement Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013.
