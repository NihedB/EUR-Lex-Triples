The European Parliament and the Council have endorsed that strategy.\n(2)\nRegulation (EU) No 1291/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council (3) established Horizon 2020 — The Framework Programme for Research and Innovation (2014-2020) (‘Horizon 2020’). Horizon 2020 aims at achieving a greater impact on research and innovation by contributing to the strengthening of public-public partnerships, including through Union participation in programmes undertaken by several Member States in accordance with Article 185 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.\n(3)\nPublic-public partnerships should aim to develop closer synergies, increase coordination and avoid unnecessary duplication with Union, international, national and regional research programmes, and should fully respect the Horizon 2020 general principles, in particular those relating to openness and transparency. Moreover, open access to scientific publications should be ensured.\n(4)\nBy Decision No 1209/2003/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (4), the Community decided to make a financial contribution to the European and Developing Countries Clinical Trials Partnership (‘EDCTP1’) matching that of the Participating States but not exceeding EUR 200 000 000, for the duration of the Sixth Framework Programme of the European Community for research, technological development and demonstration activities, contributing to the creation of the European Research Area and to innovation (2002 to 2006) established by Decision No 1513/2002/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (5). EDCTP1 was also supported under the Seventh Framework Programme of the European Community for research, technological development and demonstration activities (2007 – 2013) established by Decision No 1982/2006/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (6).\n(5)\nIn 2009, independent experts adopted the report of the interim evaluation of EDCTP1. The opinion of the expert panel was that EDCTP1 provided a unique platform for a genuine dialogue with African scientists, and that it has started to bridge the gap between North and South in building research capacities and in providing learning and working opportunities for young African researchers. Following that report, there are fundamental issues to be taken into consideration for a second European and Developing Countries Clinical Trials Partnership Programme (‘EDCTP2 Programme’): the current scope of EDCTP1 needs to be amended and extended; the capabilities in developing countries for the sound conduct and management of clinical trials should, where necessary, be further developed and strengthened, in particular the role and development of ethical review committees and the corresponding regulatory environment, the coordination, collaboration and, where appropriate, integration of European national programmes should be further improved; collaboration with other major public and private partners, including the pharmaceutical industry, and public-private partnerships such as the Product Development Partnerships (‘PDPs’), civil society, non-governmental organisations and foundations, need to be strengthened and extended; there should be clear and transparent rules of governance; synergies with European external policy actions should be developed specifically with Union development assistance; co-funding rules should be clarified and simplified; and monitoring tools need to be strengthened.\n(6)\nPursuant to Council Decision 2013/743/EU (7), further support may be provided to the EDCTP2 Programme.\n(7)\nThe Union is a major funder of research into poverty-related diseases and neglected infectious diseases. The Commission and Member States contribute nearly one quarter (22 %) of the relevant global investment made by governments. The Union is also a major player in global health. For example, the Commission and the Member States provide approximately half the financing of the Global Fund To Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria.\n(8)\nEDCTP1 produced major achievements, and developed eight improved medical treatments, in particular for newborns, children and pregnant or breastfeeding women suffering from HIV/AIDS or malaria. It has resulted in the launch of the first four African Regional Networks of Excellence promoting South-South cooperation on clinical research, and more than 400 African researchers have been trained. It has also contributed to establishing the Pan-African Clinical Trials Registry and the African Vaccine Regulators Forum.\n(9)\nDespite the considerable results and achievements of EDCTP1, poverty-related diseases still represent a major obstacle to the sustainable development of developing countries due to their social and economic burden, especially in sub-Saharan Africa. Effective, safe, suitable and affordable medical treatments tailored to the specific circumstances of developing countries still do not exist for most poverty-related diseases, and investment in clinical research remains inadequate as conducting clinical trials is costly and the return on investment is limited due to market failure. It should be underlined that only 10 % of global research funding is allocated to the diseases which account for 90 % of the world’s pathologies. Moreover, European research activities and programmes are still often fragmented and are therefore either subcritical in scale or overlapping, whereas research capacity and investment in developing countries are inadequate.\n(10)\nSupporting the fight against poverty-related diseases would also help to safeguard Europe’s citizens from those diseases as increasing global mobility (including tourism), migratory movements and shifts in the geographic distribution of those diseases mean that Europe may be facing new or returning challenges in connection with those diseases.\n(11)\nOn 15 June 2010, the European Parliament adopted a resolution on progress towards achieving the Millennium Development Goals (‘MDG’) in advance of the UN high-level meeting in September 2010, in which it asked the Commission, the Member States and developing countries to address MDG 5 (on improving maternal health), MDG 4 (on child mortality) and MDG 6 (on HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis) in a coherent and holistic way.\n(12)\nThe Union is committed to the 2012 Rio+20 conference conclusions on developing and achieving internationally-agreed Sustainable Development Goals (‘SDG’), following and including the MDG.\n(13)\nIn 2000, the Union launched a high-level policy dialogue with Africa leading to the establishment of an Africa-EU Strategic Partnership, following which a Joint Africa-EU Strategy was adopted in 2007 and a high-level policy dialogue on Science, Technology and Innovation was established in 2011.\n(14)\nOn 31 March 2010, the Commission presented a communication on the Union’s role in global health, which called for a more coordinated approach among Member States and across relevant policies to identify and jointly address shared global priorities for health research. In that communication, the Commission also restated the need to promote equitable and universal coverage of quality health services, plus effective and fair financing of research that benefits the health of all people.\n(15)\nIn the Council Conclusions of 10 May 2010 on the EU role in global health, the Council called on the Union to promote effective and fair financing of research that benefits the health of all and ensures that innovations and interventions lead to affordable and accessible solutions. In particular, models that dissociate the costs of Research and Development (‘R&D’) from the prices of medicines should be explored, including the opportunities for technology transfer to developing countries.\n(16)\nIn its Communication of 21 September 2011 on partnering in research and innovation, the Commission put partnerships across institutional, national and continental borders at the centre of the Union’s research policy.\n(17)\nIn its Communication of 27 February 2013 entitled ‘A decent life for all: ending poverty and giving the world a sustainable future’, the Commission reaffirmed its commitment to doing its utmost to help achieve the MDG by 2015, and pointed out that EU-funded research under EDCTP1 had contributed to achieving the MDG.\n(18)\nIn line with the objectives of Horizon 2020, any Member State and any country associated to Horizon 2020 should be entitled to participate in the EDCTP2 Programme.\n(19)\nContribution to the exploration of open innovation models for needs-driven research, and available and affordable outcomes in alignment with other Union commitments in health R & D should be considered.\n(20)\nThe Participating States intend to contribute to implementing the EDCTP2 Programme during the period covered by it, namely 2014 – 2024. In order to take into account the duration of Horizon 2020, calls for proposals under the EDCTP2 Programme should be launched at the latest by 31 December 2020. In duly justified cases, calls for proposals may be launched by 31 December 2021.\n(21)\nA ceiling should be established for the Union’s financial participation in EDCTP2 Programme for the duration of Horizon 2020. Within the limits of that ceiling, the Union contribution should be equal to the contribution of the states referred to in this Decision in order to achieve a high leverage effect and ensure a stronger integration of those states’ programmes.\n(22)\nThe Union’s financial contribution should be subject to formal commitments from the Participating States to contribute to implementing the EDCTP2 Programme and to the fulfilment of those commitments.\n(23)\nThe joint implementation of the EDCTP2 Programme requires an implementation structure. The Participating States have agreed on the implementation structure for EDCTP2 Programme and have set up the EDCTP2-Implementation Structure (‘EDCTP2-IS’). The EDCTP2-IS should be the recipient of the Union’s financial contribution and should ensure the efficient implementation of the EDCTP2 Programme.\n(24)\nEDCTP2 activities should be in line with the objectives and research and innovation priorities of Horizon 2020 and with the general principles and conditions laid down in Article 26 of Regulation (EU) No 1291/2013.\n(25)\nCalls for proposals by EDCTP2-IS should also be published on the single portal for participants, as well as through other Horizon 2020 electronic means of dissemination managed by the Commission.\n(26)\nThe Union’s financial contribution should be managed in compliance with the principle of sound financial management and in accordance with the relevant rules on indirect management laid down in Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 966/2012 of the European Parliament and the Council (8) and Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 1268/2012 (9).\n(27)\nIn order to protect the Union’s financial interests, the Commission should have the right to reduce, suspend or terminate the Union’s financial contribution if the EDCTP2 Programme is implemented inadequately, partially or late, or if the Participating States do not contribute, or contribute partially or late, to the financing of the EDCTP2 Programme. Those rights should be provided for in the delegation agreement to be concluded between the Union and the EDCTP2-IS.\n(28)\nIn order to implement the EDCTP2 Programme efficiently, financial support should be provided by the EDCTP2-IS mainly in the form of grants to participants in actions selected at the level of the EDCTP2-IS. The selection of those actions should be made following open and competitive calls for proposals under the responsibility of the EDCTP2-IS.\n(29)\nParticipation in indirect actions under the EDCTP2 Programme is subject to Regulation (EU) No 1290/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council (10). However, due to the specific operating needs of the EDCTP2 Programme, it is necessary to provide for derogations from that Regulation in accordance with Article 1(3) of that Regulation.\n(30)\nDerogations from point (b) of Article 9(1), point (c) of Article 10(1) and Article 12 of Regulation (EU) No 1290/2013 are necessary in order to require participation and allow funding of African entities, and allow cooperation through joint calls between the EDCTP2 Programme and any other legal entity.\n(31)\nFor the purpose of simplification, administrative burdens should be reduced for all parties. Double audits and disproportionate documentation and reporting should be avoided. When audits are conducted, the specificities of the national programmes should be taken into account, as appropriate.\n(32)\nAudits of recipients of Union funds provided in accordance with this Decision should ensure a reduction of the administrative burden, in compliance with Horizon 2020.\n(33)\nThe Union’s financial interests should be protected by means of proportionate measures throughout the expenditure life-cycle, including the prevention, detection and investigation of irregularities, the recovery of funds lost, wrongly paid or incorrectly used and, where appropriate, administrative and financial penalties in accordance with Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 966/2012.\n(34)\nThe Commission should conduct interim evaluations, assessing in particular the quality and efficiency of the EDCTP2 Programme, the progress made towards the objectives set and a final evaluation, and should prepare reports on those evaluations.\n(35)\nUpon request from the Commission, the EDCTP2-IS and the Participating States should submit any information the Commission needs to include in the reports on the evaluation of the EDCTP2 Programme.\n(36)\nIt is essential that the research activities carried out under the EDCTP2 Programme are in full compliance with the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, the European Convention on Human Rights and its Supplementary Protocols, ethical principles included in the World Medical Association’s Declaration of Helsinki of 2008, the standards of good clinical practice adopted by the International Conference on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use, relevant Union legislation and local ethics requirements of the countries where the research activities are to be conducted.\n(37)\nIt is essential that informed consent for clinical trials conducted in developing countries should always be obtained in a way that is truly informed and voluntary.\n(38)\nIt is also important that the activities conducted under the EDCTP2 Programme should be coherent with the Union’s development policy actions. In this context, synergies between EDCTP2 and the European Development Fund should be sought.\n(39)\nWithin the objective of cooperation with international development assistance initiatives, EDCTP2 funded activities should take into account the recommendations proposed by the relevant World Health Organisation (WHO) initiatives where appropriate, including the consultative Expert Working Group on Research and Development (‘CEWG’).\n(40)\nThe Scientific Panel for Health was set up by Horizon 2020 as a science-led stakeholder platform, in order to elaborate scientific input, to provide a coherent scientific focused analysis of research and innovation bottlenecks and opportunities related to the Horizon 2020 societal challenge on health, demographic change and well-being, to contribute to the definition of its research and innovation priorities and to encourage Union-wide scientific participation. Through active cooperation with stakeholders, it helps to build capabilities and to foster knowledge-sharing and stronger collaboration across the Union in that field. EDCTP2 should, therefore, collaborate and exchange information with the Scientific Panel for Health, where appropriate.\n(41)\nSince the objectives of this Decision, namely to contribute to the reduction of the social and economic burden of poverty-related diseases in developing countries, and in particular in sub-Saharan Africa, by accelerating the clinical development of effective, safe, accessible, suitable and affordable medical interventions for poverty-related diseases, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States due to the lack of necessary critical mass to be achieved, both in human and financial terms, and can therefore, by reason of the scale of the action, be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Decision does not go beyond what is necessary for those objectives,\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\nArticle 1\nParticipation in the second European and Developing Countries Clinical Trials Partnership Programme\n1.   The Union shall participate in the second European and Developing Countries Clinical Trials Partnership Programme (the ‘EDCTP2 Programme’), jointly undertaken by Austria, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom (the ‘Participating States’) in accordance with the conditions laid down in this Decision.\n2.   Any Member State other than those listed in paragraph 1 and any other country associated to Horizon 2020 may participate in the EDCTP2 Programme, provided it fulfils the condition set out in point (e) of Article 3(1) of this Decision.
