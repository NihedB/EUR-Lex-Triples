This is done either by the Council adopting legislative acts (in this case, decisions and regulations), or by means of Council implementing acts.\nFollowing the Russian Federation’s decision on 23 February 2022 to recognise the non-government controlled areas of the Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts of Ukraine as independent entities, the EU adopted the first package of sanctions. These came into effect on 24 February.\nA second package of sanctions was adopted on 25 February 2022 following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. These cover the financial sector, the energy and transport sectors, dual-use goods, export control and export financing, visa policy, additional sanctions against Russian individuals and new listing criteria. These measures have applied since 26 February 2022.\nOn 2 March 2022, the Council adopted Decision (CFSP) 2022/354 and Implementing Regulation (EU) 2022/353 imposing sanctions on Belarus in view of its participation in Russia’s actions in Ukraine.\nOn 9 March 2022, the Council adopted Decision (CFSP) 2022/399 amending Decision 2012/642/CFSP concerning restrictive measures in view of the situation in Belarus and the involvement of Belarus in the Russian aggression against Ukraine, and Regulation (EU) 2022/398 amending Regulation (EC) No 765/2006 concerning restrictive measures in view of the situation in Belarus and the involvement of Belarus in the Russian aggression against Ukraine.\nOn 15 March 2022, the EU adopted Decision (CFSP) 2022/430 and Regulation 2022/428 imposing a fourth package of sanctions introducing further restrictive measures in view of Russia’s actions destabilising the situation in Ukraine ) targeting a number of sectors: prohibiting all transactions with certain state-owned companies;prohibiting the provision of any credit-rating services;tightening the export restrictions regarding certain goods and technology;expanding the list of persons connected to Russia’s defence and industrial base;prohibiting new investments in the Russian energy sector;introducing a comprehensive export restriction on equipment, technology and services for the energy industry in Russia (with some exceptions);introducing further trade restrictions concerning iron, steel, and luxury goods.\nOn the same day the Council adopted Decision (CFSP) 2022/429 and Implementing Regulation (EU) 2022/427 adding 15 individuals and 9 entities to the list of persons, entities and bodies subject to restrictive measures set out in the Annex to Decision 2014/145/CFSP concerning restrictive measures in respect of actions undermining or threatening the territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence of Ukraine.\nKEY POINTS\n              \nThe documents address five different aspects of the situation in Ukraine. They put in place restrictive measures covering the following.\n1.\nRussia’s actions destabilising the situation in Ukraine\nDecision 2014/512/CFSP.\nImposes economic sanctions, including a ban on the sale, supply, transfer or export of weapons, dual-use goods (see summary) and technology, certain oil exploration and production technology, and on assistance with goods and technology included on the common military list.\nFurther to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the decision was amended several times by: Decision (CFSP) 2022/430 (tighter export restrictions regarding dual-use goods and technology as well as goods and technology which might contribute to the technological enhancement of Russia’s defence and security sector), Decisions (CFSP) 2022/264 (restrictions on access to the capital market, in particular by prohibiting the financing of Russia, its Government and its Central Bank), 2022/327 (expanding existing financial and export restrictions, introducing restrictions related to the oil refining sector and export ban in the field of aviation and space), 2022/335 (banning aircraft operated by Russian air carriers, Russian-registered aircraft, or any non-Russian-registered aircraft which is owned or chartered, or otherwise controlled by any Russian person/entity, to land in, take off from, or overfly EU territory), 2022/346 (disconnecting major Russian banks from SWIFT financial messaging systems and other currency-related measures), 2022/351 (suspending the broadcasting activities of Russia Today and Sputnik in the EU) and 2022/395 (restrictions on maritime navigation goods and technologies and related services).\nRegulation (EU) No 833/2014.\nSupplements these measures by establishing a basis for sharing information between EU Member States and by authorising Member States to introduce rules on penalties for infringing the bans and restrictions.\nFurther to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the Council adopted Regulations (EU) 2022/428, 2022/262, 2022/328, 2022/334, 2022/345, 2022/350 and 2022/394.\n2.\nImports originating in Crimea or Sevastopol, in response to the illegal annexation of Crimea and Sevastopol\nDecision 2014/386/CFSP.Bans the import of goods originating in Crimea or Sevastopol into the EU, along with the related financial assistance.Exempts goods checked by the Ukraine authorities and granted a certificate of origin.Bans the acquisition or extension of business dealings in the areas including the acquisition of real estate or shares in companies based there.\nRegulation (EU) No 692/2014.Provides broader details on restrictive economic measures.Includes a list of the banned goods for sale, supply, transfer or export.\n3.\nActions undermining or threatening the territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence of Ukraine\nDecision 2014/145/CFSP.\nEstablishes travel bans and asset freezes.\nLists the persons concerned.\nFollowing Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the EU adopted several decisions amending Decision 2014/145/CFSP: Decisions (CFSP) 2022/429, 2022/241, 2022/265, 2022/267, 2022/329, 2022/331, 2022/337, 2022/354 and 2022/397.\nRegulation (EU) No 269/2014.\nProvides broader details on travel bans, asset freezes and derogations (exceptions).\nSets up a basis for sharing information between Member States.\nAuthorises Member States to set up rules on penalties for infringing the bans and restrictions.\nIn late February and early March 2022, the regulation was amended several times by Implementing Regulations (EU) 2022/427, 2022/236, 2022/260, 2022/261, 2022/332, 2022/336, 2022/353, 2022/396, and by Regulations (EU) 2022/259 and 2022/330.\n4.\nCertain persons, entities and bodies in view of the situation in Ukraine\nDecision 2014/119/CFSP.\nFreezes assets, with derogations, of those responsible for misappropriating Ukrainian state funds or responsible for human rights violations in Ukraine.\nLists the individuals concerned.\nOn 3 March 2022, Decision (CFSP) 2022/376 extended the application of Decision 2014/119/CFSP until 6 March 2023.\nRegulation (EU) No 208/2014.\nProvides broader details on asset freezes and derogations.\nSets up a basis for sharing information between EU Member States.\nAuthorises Member States to set rules on penalties for infringing the bans and restrictions.\n5.\nRussian recognition of the non-government controlled areas of the Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts of Ukraine and the ordering of Russian armed forces into those areas\nDecision (CFSP) 2022/266.
