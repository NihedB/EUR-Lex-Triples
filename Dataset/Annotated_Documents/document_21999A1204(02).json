This schedule shall provide for a phasing out of these duties at equal annual rates starting at the latest one year after their introduction. The Cooperation Council may decide on a different schedule.Article 26Safeguard procedures1. In the event of the Community or South Africa initiating a surveillance mechanism in respect of difficulties referred to in Article 24 which has as its purpose the rapid provision of information on the trend of trade flows, it shall inform the other Party thereof and, if requested, enter into consultations with it.2. In the cases specified in Article 24, before taking the measure provided for therein or, in cases to which subparagraph 5(b) of this Article apply, the Community or South Africa, as the case may be, shall as soon as possible supply the Cooperation Council with all relevant information, with the view to seeking a solution acceptable to both Parties.3. In the selection of measures, priority must be given to those which least disturb the functioning of this Agreement and they shall be limited to the extent necessary to prevent or remedy serious injury and to facilitate adjustment.4. The safeguard measures shall be notified immediately to the Cooperation Council and shall be the subject of periodic consultations within that body, particularly with a view to establishing a timetable for their abolition as soon as circumstances permit.5. For the implementation of the previous paragraphs the following provisions shall apply.(a) As regards Article 24, difficulties arising from the situation referred to in that Article shall be referred for examination to the Cooperation Council, which may take any decision needed to put an end to such difficulties. If the Cooperation Council or the exporting Party has not taken a decision putting an end to the difficulties or no other satisfactory solution has been reached within 30 days of the matter being so referred, the importing Party may adopt appropriate measures to remedy the problem. Such measures should be taken for a period not exceeding three years and shall contain elements which would degressively lead to their elimination at the end of the set period, at the latest.(b) Where exceptional circumstances requiring immediate action make prior information or examination, as the case may be, impossible, the Community or South Africa, whichever is concerned, may, in the situations specified in Article 24, apply forthwith the precautionary measures necessary to deal with the situation and shall inform the other Party immediately thereof.Article 27ExceptionsThe Agreement shall not preclude prohibitions or restrictions on imports, exports, goods in transit or trade in used goods justified on grounds of public morality, public policy or public security; the protection of health and life of humans, animals or plants; the protection of national treasures possessing artistic, historic or archaeological value; or the protection of intellectual, industrial and commercial property or rules relating to gold and silver. Such prohibitions or restrictions shall not, however, constitute a means of arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination where the same conditions prevail or a disguised restriction on trade between the Parties.Article 28Rules of originThe rules of origin for the application of tariff preferences provided for in this Agreement are laid down in Protocol 1.SECTION BRIGHT OF ESTABLISHMENT AND SUPPLY OF SERVICESArticle 29Reconfirmation of GATS obligations1. In recognition of the growing importance of services for the development of their economies, the Parties underline the importance of strict observance of the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS), in particular its principle on most-favoured-nation treatment, and including its applicable protocols with annexed commitments.2. In accordance with the GATS, this treatment shall not apply to:(a) advantages accorded by either Party under the provisions of an agreement as defined in Article V of the GATS or under measures adopted on the basis of such an agreement;(b) other advantages accorded pursuant to the list of most-favoured-nation exemptions annexed by either Party to the GATS.3.

The objective set out in paragraph 1 shall be subject to a first examination by the Cooperation Council at the latest five years after the entry into force of this Agreement.Article 31Maritime transport1. The Parties shall endeavour to apply effectively the principle of unrestricted access to the international maritime market and traffic based on fair competition on a commercial basis.2. The Parties agree to extend to each other's nationals and the vessels registered in the territory of either of the Parties treatment no less favourable than that granted to the most favoured nation in respect of the maritime transport of goods, passengers or both, access to ports, the use of infrastructure and auxiliary maritime services of those ports and related fees and charges, customs facilities and the assignment of berths and facilities for loading and unloading, based on fair competition and on commercial terms.3. The Parties agree to consider maritime transport, including intermodal operations, in the context of Article 30, without prejudice to nationality restrictions or agreements entered into by either Party, which exist at that time and which would be consistent with the Parties' rights and obligations under the GATS Agreement.SECTION CCURRENT PAYMENTS AND MOVEMENT OF CAPITALArticle 32Current payments1. Subject to the provisions of Article 34, the Parties undertake to allow all payments for current transactions between residents of the Community and of South Africa to be made in freely convertible currency.2.

With regard to transactions on the capital account of balance of payments, the Community and South Africa shall ensure, from the entry into force of this Agreement, that capital relating to direct investments in South Africa in companies formed in accordance with current laws can move freely, and that such investment and any profit stemming therefrom can be liquidated and repatriated.2. The Parties shall consult each other with a view to facilitating and eventually achieving full liberalisation of the movement of capital between the Community and South Africa.Article 34Balance of payment difficultiesWhere one or more Member States of the Community, or South Africa, is in serious balance of payments difficulties, or under threat thereof, the Community or South Africa, as the case may be, may, in accordance with the conditions established under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and Articles VIII and XIV of the Articles of Agreement of the International Monetary Fund, adopt restrictions on current transactions which shall be of limited duration and may not go beyond what is necessary to remedy the balance of payments situation. The Community or South Africa, as the case may be, shall inform the other Party forthwith and shall submit to it as soon as possible a timetable for the elimination of the measures concerned.SECTION DCOMPETITION POLICYArticle 35DefinitionThe following are incompatible with the proper functioning of this Agreement, in so far as they may affect trade between the Community and South Africa:(a) agreements and concerted practices between firms in horizontal relationships, decisions by associations of firms, and agreements between firms in vertical relationships, which have the effect of substantially preventing or lessening competition in the territory of the Community or of South Africa, unless the firms can demonstrate that the anti-competitive effects are outweighed by pro-competitive ones;(b) abuse by one or more firms of market power in the territory of the Community or of South Africa as a whole or in a substantial part thereof.Article 36ImplementationIf, at the entry into force of this Agreement, either Party has not yet adopted the necessary laws and regulations for the implementation of Article 35, in their jurisdictions it shall do so within a period of three years.Article 37Appropriate measuresIf the Community or South Africa considers that a particular practice in its domestic market is incompatible with the terms of Article 35, and:(a) is not adequately dealt with under the implementing rules referred to in Article 36, or(b) in the absence of such rules, and if such practice causes or threatens to cause serious prejudice to the interests of the other Party or material injury to its domestic industry, including its services industry,the Party concerned may take appropriate measures consistent with its own laws, after consultation within the Cooperation Council, or after 30 working days following referral for such consultation. The appropriate measures to be taken shall respect the powers of the Competition Authority concerned.Article 38Comity1. The Parties agree that, whenever the Commission or the South African Competition Authority has reason to believe that anti-competitive practices, defined under Article 35, are taking place within the territory of the other authority and are substantially affecting important interests of the Parties, it may request the other Party's competition authority to take appropriate remedial action in terms of that authority's rules governing competition.2. Such a request shall not prejudice any action under the requesting authority's competition laws that may be deemed necessary and shall not in any way encumber the addressed authority's decision-making powers or its independence.3. Without prejudice to its respective functions, rights, obligations or independence, the competition authority so addressed shall consider and give careful attention to the views expressed and documentation provided by the requesting authority and, in particular, pay heed to the nature of the anti-competitive activities in question, the firm or firms involved, and the alleged harmful effect on the important interests of the aggrieved Party.4. When the Commission or the Competition Authority of South Africa decides to conduct an investigation or intends to take any action that may have important implications for the interests of the other Party, the Parties must consult, at the request of either Party and both shall endeavour to find a mutually acceptable solution in the light of their respective important interests, giving due regard to each other's laws, sovereignty, the independence of the respective competition authorities and to considerations of comity.Article 39Technical assistanceThe Community shall provide South Africa with technical assistance in the restructuring of its competition law and policy, which may include among others:(a) the exchange of experts;(b) organisation of seminars;(c) training activities.Article 40InformationThe Parties shall exchange information taking into account the limitations imposed by the requirements of professional and business secrecy.SECTION EPUBLIC AIDArticle 41Public aid1. In so far as it may affect trade between the Community and South Africa, public aid favouring certain firms or the production of certain goods, which distorts or threatens to distort competition, and which does not support a specific public policy objective or objectives of either Party, is incompatible with the proper functioning of this Agreement.2. The Parties agree that it is in their interests to ensure that public aid is granted in a fair, equitable and transparent manner.Article 42Remedial measures1. If the Community or South Africa considers that a particular practice is incompatible with the terms of Article 41, and that such practice causes or threatens to cause serious prejudice to the interests of the other Party or material injury to its domestic industry, the Parties agree, where it is not adequately dealt with under existing rules and procedures, to enter into consultations with a view to finding a mutually satisfactory solution. Such consultations will be without prejudice to the Parties' rights and obligations in terms of their respective laws and international commitments.2. Either Party may invite the Cooperation Council to examine, in the context of such consultation, the Parties' public policy objectives justifying the grant of public aid referred to in Article 41.Article 43TransparencyEach Party shall ensure transparency in the area of public aid. In particular, where a Party so requests, the other Party shall provide information on aid schemes, on particular individual cases of public aid, or on the total amount and the distribution of aid given.

For the purpose of implementing this Agreement, the following products shall be considered as originating in the Community:(a) products wholly obtained in the Community within the meaning of Article 4 of this Protocol;(b) products obtained in the Community incorporating materials which have not been wholly obtained there, provided that such materials have undergone sufficient working or processing in the Community within the meaning of Article 5 of this Protocol.2. For the purpose of implementing this Agreement, the following products shall be considered as originating in South Africa:(a) products wholly obtained in South Africa within the meaning of Article 4 of this Protocol;(b) products obtained in South Africa incorporating materials which have not been wholly obtained there, provided that such materials have undergone sufficient working or processing in South Africa within the meaning of Article 5 of this Protocol.Article 3Cumulation of originBilateral cumulation1. Materials originating in the Community shall be considered as materials originating in South Africa when incorporated into a product obtained there. It shall not be necessary that such materials have undergone sufficient working or processing, provided they have undergone working or processing going beyond that referred to in Article 6 of this Protocol.2. Materials originating in South Africa shall be considered as materials originating in the Community when incorporated into a product obtained there. It shall not be necessary that such materials have undergone sufficient working or processing, provided they have undergone working or processing going beyond that referred to in Article 6 of this Protocol.Cumulation with ACP States3. Subject to the provisions of paragraphs 5 and 6, materials originating in an ACP State shall be considered as originating in the Community or South Africa when incorporated into a product obtained there. It shall not be necessary that such materials have undergone sufficient working or processing.4. Any working or processing carried out within SACU shall be considered as having been carried out in South Africa, when further worked or processed there.5. Products which have acquired originating status by virtue of paragraph 3 shall only continue to be considered as products originating in the Community or South Africa when the value added there exceeds the value of the materials used originating in any one of the ACP States. If this is not so, the products concerned shall be considered as originating in the ACP State which accounts for the highest value of originating materials used. In the allocation of origin, no account shall be taken of materials originating in the ACP States which have undergone sufficient working or processing in the Community or South Africa.6. The cumulation provided for in paragraph 3 may only be applied where the ACP materials used have acquired the status of originating products by an application of the rules of origin contained in the Fourth ACP-EC Convention. The Community and South Africa shall provide each other, through the European Commission with details of agreements and their corresponding rules of origin which have been concluded with the ACP States.7. Once the requirements laid down in paragraph 6 have been fulfilled, and a date for the entry into force of these provisions has been agreed, each party shall fulfil its own notification and information obligations.Article 4Wholly obtained products1. The following shall be considered as wholly obtained in the Community or South Africa:(a) mineral products extracted from their soil or from their seabed;(b) vegetable products harvested there;(c) live animals born and raised there;(d) products from live animals raised there;(e) products obtained by hunting or fishing conducted there;(f) products of sea fishing and other products taken from the sea outside the territorial waters of the Community or South Africa by their vessels;(g) products made aboard their factory ships exclusively from products referred to in subparagraph f;(h) used articles collected there fit only for the recovery of raw materials, including used tyres fit only for retreading or for use as waste;(i) waste and scrap resulting from manufacturing operations conducted there;(j) products extracted from marine soil or subsoil outside their territorial waters provided that they have sole rights to work that soil or subsoil;(k) goods produced there exclusively from the products specified in subparagraphs a to j.2. The terms \"their vessels\" and \"their factory ships\" in paragraph 1(f) and (g) shall apply only to vessels and factory ships:(a) which are registered or recorded in an EC Member State or in South Africa;(b) which sail under the flag of an EC Member State or of South Africa;(c) which are owned to an extent of at least 50 % by nationals of EC Member States or of South Africa, or by a company with its head office in one of these States, of which the manager or managers, Chairman of the Board of Directors or the Supervisory Board, and the majority of the members of such boards are nationals of EC Member States or of South Africa and of which, in addition, in the case of partnerships or limited companies, at least half the capital belongs to those States or to public bodies or nationals of the said States;(d) of which the master and officers are nationals of EC Member States or of South Africa; and(e) of which at least 75 % of the crew are nationals of EC Member States or of South Africa.At the entry into force of tariff concessions for fishery products, paragraphs 2(d) and 2(e), will be replaced by: \"(d) of which at least 50 % of the crew, masters and officers included, are nationals of EC Member States or of South Africa\".Article 5Sufficiently worked or processed products1. For the purposes of Article 2, products which are not wholly obtained are considered to be sufficiently worked or processed when the conditions set out in the list in Annex II are fulfilled.The conditions referred to above indicate, for all products covered by this Agreement, the working or processing which must be carried out on non-originating materials used in manufacturing and apply only in relation to such materials. Accordingly, it follows that if a product, which has acquired originating status by fulfilling the conditions set out in the list is used in the manufacture of another product, the conditions applicable to the product in which it is incorporated do not apply to it, and no account shall be taken of the non-originating materials which may have been used in its manufacture.2. Notwithstanding paragraph 1, non-originating materials which, according to the conditions set out in the list, should not be used in the manufacture of a product may nevertheless be used, provided that:(a) their total value does not exceed 15 % of the ex-works price of the product, except for products falling within Chapters 3 and 24 and HS Headings 1604, 1605, 2207 and 2208 where the total value of the non-originating materials does not exceed 10 % of the ex-works price of the product;(b) any of the percentages given in the list for the maximum value of non-originating materials are not exceeded through the application of this paragraph.This paragraph shall not apply to products falling within Chapters 50 to 63 of the Harmonised System.3. Paragraphs 1 and 2 shall apply except as provided in Article 6.Article 6Insufficient working or processing operations1. Without prejudice to paragraph 2, the following operations shall be considered as insufficient working or processing to confer the status of originating products, whether or not the requirements of Article 5 are satisfied:(a) operations to ensure the preservation of products in good condition during transport and storage (ventilation, spreading out, drying, chilling, placing in salt, sulphur dioxide or other aqueous solutions, removal of damaged parts, and like operations);(b) simple operations consisting of removal of dust, sifting or screening, sorting, classifying, matching (including the making-up of sets of articles), washing, painting, cutting up;(c) (i) changes of packaging and breaking up and assembly of packages;(ii) simple placing in bottles, flasks, bags, cases, boxes, fixing on cards or boards, etc., and all other simple packaging operations;(d) affixing marks, labels and other like distinguishing signs on products or their packaging;(e) simple mixing of products, whether or not of different kinds, where one or more components of the mixtures do not meet the conditions laid down in this Protocol to enable them to be considered as originating in the Community or South Africa;(f) simple assembly of parts to constitute a complete product;(g) a combination of two or more operations specified in subparagraphs a to f;(h) slaughter of animals.2. All the operations carried out in either the Community or South Africa on a given product shall be considered together when determining whether the working or processing undergone by that product is to be regarded as insufficient within the meaning of paragraph 1.Article 7Unit of qualification1. The unit of qualification for the application of the provisions of this Protocol shall be the particular product which is considered as the basic unit when determining classification using the nomenclature of the Harmonised System.Accordingly, it follows that:(a) when a product composed of a group or assembly of articles is classified under the terms of the Harmonised System in a single heading, the whole constitutes the unit of qualification;(b) when a consignment consists of a number of identical products classified under the same heading of the Harmonised System, each product must be taken individually when applying the provisions of this Protocol.2. Where, under General Rule 5 of the Harmonised System, packaging is included with the product for classification purposes, it shall be included for the purposes of determining origin.Article 8Accessories, spare parts and toolsAccessories, spare parts and tools dispatched with a piece of equipment, machine, apparatus or vehicle, which are part of the normal equipment and included in the price thereof or which are not separately invoiced, shall be regarded as one with the piece of equipment, machine, apparatus or vehicle in question.Article 9SetsSets, as defined in General Rule 3 of the Harmonised System, shall be regarded as originating when all component products are originating. Nevertheless, when a set is composed of originating and non-originating products, the set as a whole shall be regarded as originating, provided that the value of the non-originating products does not exceed 15 % of the ex-works price of the set.Article 10Neutral elementsIn order to determine whether a product originates, it shall not be necessary to determine the origin of the following which might be used in its manufacture:(a) energy and fuel;(b) plant and equipment;(c) machines and tools;(d) goods which do not enter and which are not intended to enter into the final composition of the product.TITLE IIITERRITORIAL REQUIREMENTSArticle 11Principle of territoriality1. The conditions set out in Title II relative to the acquisition of originating status must be fulfilled without interruption in the Community or South Africa, except as provided for in Article 3.2.

However, products constituting one single consignment may be transported through other territories with, should the occasion arise, transhipment or temporary warehousing in such territories, provided that they remain under the surveillance of the customs authorities in the country of transit or warehousing and do not undergo operations other than unloading, reloading or any operation designed to preserve them in good condition.Originating products may be transported by pipeline across territory other than that of the Community or South Africa.2. Evidence that the conditions set out in paragraph 1 have been fulfilled shall be supplied to the customs authorities of the importing country by the production of:(a) a single transport document covering the passage from the exporting country through the country of transit; or(b) a certificate issued by the customs authorities of the country of transit:(i) giving an exact description of the products,(ii) stating the dates of unloading and reloading of the products and, where applicable, the names of the ships, or the other means of transport used, and(iii) certifying the conditions under which the products remained in the transit country, or(c) failing these, any substantiating documents.Article 13Exhibitions1. Originating products, sent for exhibition in a country other than those referred to in Article 3 and sold after the exhibition for importation in the Community or South Africa shall benefit on importation from the provisions of the Agreement provided it is shown to the satisfaction of the customs authorities that:(a) an exporter has consigned these products from the Community or South Africa to the country in which the exhibition is held and has exhibited them there;(b) the products have been sold or otherwise disposed of by that exporter to a person in the Community or South Africa;(c) the products have been consigned during the exhibition or immediately thereafter in the state in which they were sent for exhibition, and(d) the products have not, since they were consigned for exhibition, been used for any purpose other than demonstration at the exhibition.2.

The supplier's declaration referred to in paragraph 1 shall serve as the evidence of the working or processing undergone in SACU by the goods concerned for the purpose of determining whether the products in the manufacture of which these goods are used, can be considered as originating in South Africa and fulfil the other requirements of this Protocol.3. A separate supplier's declaration shall be made out by the supplier for each consignment of goods in the form prescribed in Annex V on a sheet of paper annexed to the invoice, the delivery note or any other commercial document describing the goods concerned in sufficient detail to enable them to be identified.

Obvious formal errors such as typing errors on a proof of origin should not cause this document to be rejected if these errors are not such as to create doubts concerning the correctness of the statements made in this document.Article 29Amounts expressed in euro1. Amounts in the national currency of the exporting country equivalent to the amounts expressed in euro shall be fixed by the exporting country and communicated to the importing countries through the European Commission.2. When the amounts exceed the corresponding amounts fixed by the importing country, the latter shall accept them if the products are invoiced in the currency of the exporting country. When the products are invoiced in the currency of another EC Member State, the importing country shall recognise the amount notified by the country concerned.3. The amounts to be used in any given national currency shall be the equivalent in that national currency of the amounts expressed in euro as at the first working day in October 1999.4. The amounts expressed in euro and their equivalents in the national currencies of the EC Member States and South Africa shall be reviewed by the Cooperation Council at the request of the Community or South Africa. When carrying out this review, the Cooperation Council shall ensure that there will be no decrease in the amounts to be used in any national currency and shall furthermore consider the desirability of preserving the effects of the limits concerned in real terms. For this purpose, it may decide to modify the amounts expressed in euro.TITLE VARRANGEMENTS FOR ADMINISTRATIVE COOPERATIONArticle 30Mutual assistance1. The customs authorities of the EC Member States and of South Africa shall provide each other, through the European Commission, with specimen impressions of stamps used in their customs offices for the issue of EUR.1 movement certificates and with the addresses of the customs authorities responsible for verifying those certificates and invoice declarations.2.

Any documents and information obtained suggesting that the information given on the proof or origin is incorrect shall be forwarded in support of the request for verification.3. The verification shall be carried out by the customs authorities of the exporting country. For this purpose, they shall have the right to call for any evidence and to carry out any inspection of the exporter's accounts or any other check considered appropriate.4.

Where disputes arise in relation to the verification procedures of Article 31 which cannot be settled between the customs authorities requesting a verification and the customs authorities responsible for carrying out this verification or where they raise a question as to the interpretation of this Protocol, they shall be submitted to the Cooperation Council.2. In all cases the settlement of disputes between the importer and the customs authorities of the importing country shall be under the legislation of the said country.Article 33PenaltiesPenalties shall be imposed on any person who draws up, or causes to be drawn up, a document which contains incorrect information for the purpose of obtaining a preferential treatment for products.Article 34Free zones1. The Community and South Africa shall take all necessary steps to ensure that products traded under cover of a proof of origin which in the course of transport use a free zone situated in their territory, are not substituted by other goods and do not undergo handling other than normal operations designed to prevent their deterioration.2. By means of an exemption to the provisions contained in paragraph 1, when products originating in the Community or South Africa are imported into a free zone under cover of a proof of origin and undergo treatment or processing, the authorities concerned shall issue a new EUR.1 certificate at the exporter's request, if the treatment or processing undergone is in conformity with the provisions of this Protocol.TITLE VICEUTA AND MELILLAArticle 35Application of the Protocol1. The term \"Community\" used in Article 2 does not cover Ceuta and Melilla.2. Products originating in South Africa, when imported into Ceuta or Melilla, shall enjoy in all respects the same customs regime as that which is applied to products originating in the customs territory of the Community under Protocol 2 of the Act of Accession of the Kingdom of Spain and the Portuguese Republic to the European Communities. South Africa shall grant to imports of products covered by the Agreement and originating in Ceuta and Melilla the same customs regime as that which is granted to products imported from and originating in the Community.3. For the purpose of the application of paragraph 2 concerning products originating in Ceuta and Melilla, this Protocol shall apply, mutatis mutandis, subject to the special conditions set out in Article 36.Article 36Special conditions1. Providing they have been transported directly in accordance with the provisions of Article 12, the following shall be considered as:1. products originating in Ceuta and Melilla:(a) products wholly obtained in Ceuta and Melilla;(b) products obtained in Ceuta and Melilla in the manufacture of which product other than those referred to in (a) are used, provided that:(i) the said products have undergone sufficient working or processing within the meaning of Article 5 of this Protocol; or that(ii) those products originate in South Africa or the Community within the meaning of this Protocol, provided that they have been submitted to working or processing which goes beyond the insufficient working or processing referred to in Article 6(1);2. products originating in South Africa:(a) products wholly obtained in South Africa;(b) products obtained in South Africa, in the manufacture of which products other than those referred to in (a) are used, provided that:(i) the said products have undergone sufficient working or processing within the meaning of Article 5 of this Protocol; or that(ii) those products originate in Ceuta and Melilla or the Community within the meaning of this Protocol, provided that they have been submitted to working or processing which goes beyond the insufficient working or processing referred to in Article 6(1).2. Ceuta and Melilla shall be considered as a single territory.3. The exporter or his authorised representative shall enter \"South Africa\" and \"Ceuta and Melilla\" in Box 2 of EUR.1 movement certificates or on invoice declarations. In addition, in the case of products originating in Ceuta and Melilla, this shall be indicated in Box 4 of EUR.1 movement certificates or on invoice declarations.4. The Spanish customs authorities shall be responsible for the application of this Protocol in Ceuta and Melilla.TITLE VIIFINAL PROVISIONSArticle 37Amendments to the ProtocolThe Cooperation Council may decide to amend the provisions of this Protocol.Article 38Implementation of the ProtocolThe Community and South Africa shall each take the steps necessary to implement this Protocol.Article 39Goods in transit or storageThe provisions of the Agreement may be applied to goods which comply with the provisions of this Protocol and which on the date of entry into force of the Agreement are either in transit or are in the Community or in South Africa or, in temporary storage in bonded warehouses or in free zones, subject to the submission to the customs authorities of the importing state, within four months of that date, of an EUR.1 certificate endorsed retrospectively by the competent authorities of the exporting state together with the documents showing that the goods have been transported directly.ANNEX IINTRODUCTORY NOTES TO THE LIST IN ANNEX IINote 1:The list sets out the conditions required for all products to be considered as sufficiently worked or processed within the meaning of Article 5 of the Protocol.Note 2:2.1. The first two columns in the list describe the product obtained. The first column gives the heading number or chapter number used in the Harmonised System and the second column gives the description of goods used in that system for that heading or chapter. For each entry in the first two columns a rule is specified in columns 3 or 4. Where, in some cases, the entry in the first column is preceded by an \"ex\", this signifies that the rules in columns 3 or 4 apply only to the part of that heading as described in column 2.2.2. Where several heading numbers are grouped together in column 1 or a chapter number is given and the description of products in column 2 is therefore given in general terms, the adjacent rules in columns 3 or 4 apply to all products which, under the Harmonised System, are classified in headings of the chapter or in any of the headings grouped together in column 1.2.3. Where there are different rules in the list applying to different products within a heading, each indent contains the description of that part of the heading covered by the adjacent rules in columns 3 or 4.2.4. Where, for an entry in the first two columns, a rule is specified in both columns 3 and 4, the exporter may opt, as an alternative, to apply either the rule set out in column 3 or that set out in column 4. If no origin rule is given in column 4, the rule set out in column 3 has to be applied.Note 3:3.1. The provisions of Article 5 of the Protocol concerning products having acquired originating status which are used in the manufacture of other products apply regardless of whether this status has been acquired inside the factory where these products are used or in another factory in the Community or in South Africa.Example:An engine of heading No 8407, for which the rule states that the value of the non-originating materials which may be incorporated may not exceed 40 % of the ex-works price, is made from \"other alloy steel roughly shaped by forging\" of heading No ex 7224.If this forging has been forged in the Community from a non-originating ingot, it has already acquired originating status by virtue of the rule for heading No ex 7224 in the list. The forging can then count as originating in the value calculation for the engine regardless of whether it was produced in the same factory or in another factory in the Community. The value of the non-originating ingot is thus not taken into account when adding up the value of the non-originating materials used.3.2. The rule in the list represents the minimum amount of working or processing required and the carrying out of more working or processing also confers originating status; conversely, the carrying out of less working or processing cannot confer originating status. Thus if a rule provides that non-originating material at a certain level of manufacture may be used, the use of such material at an earlier stage of manufacture is allowed and the use of such material at a later stage is not.3.3. Without prejudice to Note 3.2 where a rule states that \"materials of any heading\" may be used, materials of the same heading as the product may also be used, subject, however, to any specific limitations which may also be contained in the rule. However, the expression \"manufacture from materials of any heading, including other materials of heading No ...\" means that only materials classified in the same heading as the product of a different description than that of the product as given in column 2 of the list may be used.3.4. When a rule in the list specifies that a product may be manufactured from more than one material, this means that any one or more materials may be used. It does not require that all be used.Example:The rule for fabrics of heading Nos 5208 to 5212 provides that natural fibres may be used and that chemical materials, among other materials, may also be used. This does not mean that both have to be used; it is possible to use one or the other or both.3.5. Where a rule in the list specifies that a product must be manufactured from a particular material, the condition obviously does not prevent the use of other materials which, because of their inherent nature, cannot satisfy the rule. (See also Note 6.2 below in relation to textiles).Example:The rule for prepared foods of heading No 1904 which specifically excludes the use of cereals and their derivatives does not prevent the use of mineral salts, chemicals and other additives which are not products from cereals.However, this does not apply to products which, although they cannot be manufactured from the particular materials specified in the list, can be produced from a material of the same nature at an earlier stage of manufacture.Example:In the case of an article of apparel of ex Chapter 62 made from non-woven materials, if the use of only non-originating yarn is allowed for this class of article, it is not possible to start from non-woven cloth, even if non-woven cloths cannot normally be made from yarn. In such cases, the starting material would normally be at the stage before yarn, that is the fibre stage.3.6. Where, in a rule in the list, two percentages are given for the maximum value of non-originating materials that can be used, then these percentages may not be added together. In other words, the maximum value of all the non-originating materials used may never exceed the highest of the percentages given. Furthermore, the individual percentages must not be exceeded in relation to the particular materials they apply to.Note 4:4.1. The term \"natural fibres\" is used in the list to refer to fibres other than artificial or synthetic fibres. It is restricted to the stages before spinning takes place, including waste, and, unless otherwise specified, includes fibres that have been carded, combed or otherwise processed but not spun.4.2. The term \"natural fibres\" includes horsehair of heading No 0503, silk of heading Nos 5002 and 5003 as well as the wool fibres, fine or coarse animal hair of heading Nos 5101 to 5105, the cotton fibres of heading Nos 5201 to 5203 and the other vegetable fibres of heading Nos 5301 to 5305.4.3. The terms \"textile pulp\", \"chemical materials\" and \"paper-making materials\" are used in the list to describe the materials not classified in Chapters 50 to 63, which can be used to manufacture artificial, synthetic or paper fibres or yarns.4.4. The term \"man-made staple fibres\" is used in the list to refer to synthetic or artificial filament tow, staple fibres or waste, of heading Nos 5501 to 5507.Note 5:5.1. Where for a given product in the list a reference is made to this note, the conditions set out in column 3 shall not be applied to any basic textile materials, used in the manufacture of this product, which, taken together, represent 10 % or less of the total weight of all the basic textile materials used. (See also Notes 5.3 and 5.4.)5.2. However, the tolerance mentioned in Note 5.1 may only be applied to mixed products which have been made from two or more basic textile materials.The following are the basic textile materials:- silk,- wool,- coarse animal hair,- fine animal hair,- horsehair,- cotton,- paper-making materials and paper,- flax,- true hemp,- jute and other textile bast fibres,- sisal and other textile fibres of the genus Agave,- coconut, abaca, ramie and other vegetable textile fibres,- synthetic man-made filaments,- artificial man-made filaments,- synthetic man-made staple fibres of polypropylene,- synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyester,- synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyamide,- synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyacrylonitrile,- synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyimide,- synthetic man-made staple fibres of polytetrafluoroethylene,- synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyphenylene sulphide,- synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyvinyl chloride,- other synthetic man-made staple fibres,- artificial man-made staple fibres of viscose,- other artificial man-made staple fibres,- yarn made of polyurethane segmented with flexible segments of polyether whether or not gimped,- yarn made of polyurethane segmented with flexible segments of polyester whether or not gimped,- products of heading No 5605 (metallised yarn) incorporating strip consisting of a core of aluminium foil or of a core of plastic film whether or not coated with aluminium powder, of a width not exceeding 5 mm, sandwiched by means of a transparent or coloured adhesive between two layers of plastic film,- other products of heading No 5605.Example:A yarn of heading No 5205 made from cotton fibres of heading No 5203 and synthetic staple fibres of heading No 5506 is a mixed yarn. Therefore, non-originating synthetic staple fibres that do not satisfy the origin rules (which require manufacture from chemical materials or textile pulp) may be used up to a weight of 10 % of the yarn.Example:A woollen fabric of heading No 5112 made from woollen yarn of heading No 5107 and synthetic yarn of staple fibres of heading No 5509 is a mixed fabric. Therefore synthetic yarn which does not satisfy the origin rules (which require manufacture from chemical materials or textile pulp) or woollen yarn that does not satisfy the origin rules (which require manufacture from natural fibres, not carded or combed or otherwise prepared for spinning) or a combination of the two may be used provided their total weight does not exceed 10 % of the weight of the fabric.Example:Tufted textile fabric of heading No 5802 made from cotton yarn of heading No 5205 and cotton fabric of heading No 5210 is only a mixed product if the cotton fabric is itself a mixed fabric being made from yarns classified in two separate headings or if the cotton yarns used are themselves mixtures.Example:If the tufted textile fabric concerned had been made from cotton yarn of heading No 5205 and synthetic fabric of heading No 5407, then, obviously, the yarns used are two separate basic textile materials and the tufted textile fabric is accordingly a mixed product.Example:A carpet with tufts made from both artificial yarns and cotton yarns and with a jute backing is a mixed product because three basic textile materials are used. Thus, any non-originating materials that are at a later stage of manufacture than the rule allows may be used, provided their total weight does not exceed 10 % of the weight of the textile materials of the carpet. Thus, both the jute backing and/or the artificial yarns could be imported at that stage of manufacture, provided the weight conditions are met.5.3. In the case of products incorporating \"yarn made of polyurethane segmented with flexible segments of polyether whether or not gimped\" this tolerance is 20 % in respect of this yarn.5.4. In the case of products incorporating \"strip consisting of a core of aluminium foil or of a core of plastic film whether or not coated with aluminium powder, of a width not exceeding 5 mm, sandwiched by means of an adhesive between two layers of plastic film\", this tolerance is 30 % in respect of this strip.Note 6:6.1. In the case of those textile products which are marked in the list by a footnote referring to this note, textile materials, with the exception of linings and interlinings, which do not satisfy the rule set out in the list in column 3 for the made-up product concerned may be used provided that they are classified in a heading other than that of the product and that their value does not exceed 8 % of the ex-works price of the product.6.2. Without prejudice to Note 6.3, materials which are not classified within Chapters 50 to 63 may be used freely in the manufacture of textile products, whether or not they contain textiles.Example:If a rule in the list provides that for a particular textile item, such as trousers, yarn must be used, this does not prevent the use of metal items, such as buttons, because buttons are not classified within Chapters 50 to 63. For the same reason, it does not prevent the use of slide-fasteners even though slide-fasteners normally contain textiles.6.3. Where a percentage rules applies, the value of materials which are not classified within Chapters 50 to 63 must be taken into account when calculating the value of the non-originating materials incorporated.Note 7:7.1. For the purposes of heading Nos ex 2707, 2713 to 2715, ex 2901, ex 2902 and ex 3403, the \"specific processes\" are the following:(a) vacuum distillation;(b) redistillation by a very thorough fractionation process(1);(c) cracking;(d) reforming;(e) extraction by means of selective solvents;(f) the process comprising all the following operations: processing with concentrated sulphuric acid, oleum or sulphuric anhydride; neutralisation with alkaline agents; decolorisation and purification with naturally active earth, activated earth, activated charcoal or bauxite;(g) polymerisation;(h) alkylation;(i) isomerisation.7.2. For the purposes of heading Nos 2710, 2711 and 2712, the \"specific processes\" are the following:(a) vacuum distillation;(b) redistillation by a very thorough fractionation process(2);(c) cracking;(d) reforming;(e) extraction by means of selective solvents;(f) the process comprising all the following operations: processing with concentrated sulphuric acid, oleum or sulphuric anhydride; neutralisation with alkaline agents; decolorisation and purification with naturally active earth, activated earth, activated charcoal or bauxite;(g) polymerisation;(h) alkylation;(ij) isomerisation;(k) in respect of heavy oils falling within heading No ex 2710 only, desulphurisation with hydrogen resulting in a reduction of at least 85 % of the sulphur content of the products processed (ASTM D 1266-59 T method);(l) in respect of products falling within heading No 2710 only, deparaffining by a process other than filtering;(m) in respect of heavy oils falling within heading No ex 2710 only, treatment with hydrogen at a pressure of more than 20 bar and a temperature of more than 250 °C with the use of a catalyst, other than to effect desulphurisation, when the hydrogen constitutes an active element in a chemical reaction. The further treatment with hydrogen of lubricating oils of heading No ex 2710 (e.g. hydrofinishing or decolorisation) in order, more especially, to improve colour or stability shall not, however, be deemed to be a specific process;(n) in respect of fuel oils falling within heading No ex 2710 only, atmospheric distillation, on condition that less than 30 % of these products distils, by volume, including losses, at 300 °C by the ASTM D 86 method;(o) in respect of heavy oils other than gas oils and fuel oils falling within heading No ex 2710 only, treatment by means of a high-frequency electrical brush-discharge.7.3. For the purposes of heading Nos ex 2707, 2713 to 2715, ex 2901, ex 2902 and ex 3403, simple operations such as cleaning, decanting, desalting, water separation, filtering, colouring, marking, obtaining a sulphur content as a result of mixing products with different sulphur contents, any combination of these operations or like operations do not confer origin.(1) See additional explanatory note 4(b) to chapter 27 of the Combined Nomenclature.(2) See additional explanatory note 4(b) to chapter 27 of the Combined Nomenclature.ANNEX IILIST OF WORKING OR PROCESSING REQUIRED TO BE CARRIED OUT ON NON-ORIGINATING MATERIALS IN ORDER THAT THE PRODUCT MANUFACTURED CAN OBTAIN ORIGINATING STATUSThe products mentioned in the list may not all be covered by the Agreement.

agreement referred to at Article 3(3) of this Agreement shall only consist of a grave violation of democratic principles or fundamental human rights or the serious interruption of the rule of law, creating an environment not conducive for consultations or where a delay would be detrimental to the objectives or interests of the Parties to this Agreement.The Parties also agree that the appropriate measures referred to at Article 3(1), (3) and (5) of this Agreement must be proportional to the violation. In the selection and implementation of these measures, the Parties will pay particular attention to the circumstances of the most vulnerable groups of the population and will ensure that they are not unduly penalised.Joint Declaration in relation to export refunds1. In drawing up the trade components of the Agreement, the Parties have examined on a case-by-case basis, the potential impact of export refund mechanisms on the process of trade liberalisation.2. The Community states for its part that further examination of the future export refunds in connection with trade with South Africa will take place when the present discussions on agricultural reform have been completed.Joint Declaration in relation to accelerated tariff elimination by South AfricaThe Parties agree to anticipate the application of the procedures provided in Article 17 of this Agreement during the interim period before the entry into force of the Agreement in order to allow the possible application of an accelerated timetable for tariff elimination and elimination of export refunds on the date of entry into force of the Agreement.Joint Declaration on agricultural quotas1. The annual growth factors set out in Annex IV, list 6 and Annex VI, lists 3 and 4 of this Agreement will be periodically examined and reconfirmed starting no later than five years after entry into force of the Agreement.2. Concerning in particular prepared fruits (peaches, pears and apricots), South Africa agrees to manage its exports to the Community in a balanced way.Joint Declaration in relation to public aidThe Parties agree that the South African economy and its interaction with the economies in the Southern African Development Community are undergoing a substantial restructuring that will be facilitated by the Government of South Africa.Joint Declaration in relation to fisheriesThe Parties will make their best endeavours to negotiate and conclude the Fisheries Agreement referred to in Article 62 of this Agreement no later than the end of the year 2000.Joint Declaration in relation to bilateral agreementsNotwithstanding any implication to the contrary in this Agreement, any such rights of one or more Member States of the European Union contained in such existing agreements shall not be construed to have been extended to the other Member States.Joint Declaration in relation to illegal immigrationThe Parties, recognising the importance of cooperating together for the prevention and control of illegal immigration, declare their readiness to pursue these issues in exchanges within the framework of the Cooperation Council with a view to seeking solutions to problems which might arise in this sector.Community declaration in relation to the essential elementIn the context of a political and institutional environment respectful of human rights, democratic principles and the rule of law, the Community considers good governance as meaning the transparent and accountable management of all a country's human, natural, and internal and external economic and financial resources for the purposes of equitable and sustainable development.Community declaration in relation to financial aspects of cooperationIn the past a special financial facility was established as the European programme for reconstruction and development (EPRD), under Council Regulation (EC) No 2259/96. The Community earmarked about ECU 500 million for this facility over the period 1996 to 1999 in support of the policies of the Government of South Africa and agreements were signed on this basis. This amount covers four annual appropriations, which are subject to approval by the Community budget authority. The Community declares its willingness to maintain its financial cooperation with South Africa at a substantial level, and will take the necessary decisions in this respect on the basis of a proposal by the Commission.Other appropriate financial instruments (e.g. in the framework of the EC/ACP Cooperation Agreement) could be made available after this Agreement has entered into force. In this context, the Community would be willing to consider the possibility of channelling part of its future assistance, in a targeted manner (e.g. emerging entrepreneurs), in the form of risk capital or of interest rates subsidies on European Investment Bank (EIB) own-resources lending.Declaration by the European Investment Bank (EIB) in relation to financial aspects of cooperationAs set out in the Framework Agreement signed between South Africa and the EIB on 12 September 1995, the EIB was authorised by its Board of Governors on 19 June 1995 to make loans up to a total of ECU 300 million on the Bank's own resources in South Africa over the two-year period from 19 June 1995 to 19 June 1997. Under a second authorisation by the Bank's Board of Governors on 12 June 1997 and a supplementary Framework Agreement signed between South Africa and the EIB on 6 March 1998, a further ECU 375 million has been authorised for the period June 1997 to December 1999.The Article refers to the possible extension of these activities of the Bank at the end of this period.Within its mandate, the EIB would be willing to consider loans to South African borrowers for projects in South Africa, and, on a case by case basis, for projects in the SADC region.Declaration by South Africa in relation to the essential elementGood governance is understood on the South African side as compliance with the South African Constitution (Act 108 of 1996), in particular the provisions related to the transparent, equitable and accountable management of her human, natural, economic and financial resources for the purpose of economic growth and sustainable development.Declaration by South Africa in relation to sanitary and phytosanitary measuresThe South African Government wishes to stress that the smooth and efficient functioning of the mechanism for the implementation of sanitary and phytosanitary measures is vital for the successful and effective implementation of this Agreement. In this regard, South Africa urges the Community to treat South Africa, as preferred trade partner, as a priority country in its sanitary and phytosanitary dealings.Declaration by South Africa in relation to financial aspects of cooperationThe South African Government anticipates that the present level of financial cooperation with respect to funding beyond 1999 shall be at least maintained at the same levels.AGREED MINUTESThe Contracting Parties agreed that:Ad Article 4a regular political dialogue between the Parties shall commence at the moment that the provisional application of this Agreement enters into effect.", "summary": "Trade, Development and Cooperation Agreement (TDCA) with South Africa\nTrade, Development and Cooperation Agreement (TDCA) with South Africa\nSUMMARY OF:\nAgreement on Trade, Development and Cooperation between the EU and South Africa\nDecision on the conclusion of the Trade, Development and Cooperation Agreement between the EU and the Republic of South Africa\nWHAT IS THE AIM OF THE AGREEMENT AND THE DECISION?\n              \nThe agreement seeks to strengthen relations between the EU and South Africa in a variety of fields in the areas of trade, development and cooperation.\nThe decision adopts the agreement on behalf of the EU.\nKEY POINTS\n              \nThe agreement has several objectives:\nstrengthening dialogue between the parties,\nsupporting South Africa in its economic and social transition process,\npromoting regional cooperation and the country’s economic integration in southern Africa and in the world economy, and\nexpanding and liberalising trade in goods, services and capital between the parties.\nBased on respect for democratic principles, human rights and the rule of law, the agreement establishes a regular political dialogue on subjects of common interest, both at bilateral and regional level (within the context of the EU’s dialogue with the countries of southern Africa and with the group of the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries).\nThe duration of the agreement is unspecified, but it can be revised within 5 years of the date of its entry into force in order to consider possible amendments.\nThe agreement covers a number of areas and includes a future developments clause making it possible to widen the field of cooperation.\nTrade\nThe TDCA establishes preferential trade arrangements between the EU and South Africa, with the progressive introduction of a Free Trade Area (FTA). The EU is South Africa’s main trading and investment partner. The FTA aims to ensure better access to the EU market for South Africa and access to the South African market for the EU. As a result, it plays an important role in South Africa’s integration into the world economy. The agreement covers around 90 % of current bilateral trade between the two parties.\nThe agreement provides for the liberalisation of 95% of the EU’s imports from South Africa within 10 years, and 86 % of South Africa’s imports from the EU in 12 years. In order to protect the vulnerable sectors of both parties, certain products are excluded from the FTA and others have been only partially liberalised. For the EU, these are mainly agricultural products, while for South Africa, they are industrial products, in particular certain motor vehicle products and certain textile and clothing products. However, since December 2006, there has been provision for a strengthening of trade liberalisation in the motor vehicle sector.\nThe agreement sets out detailed rules of origin in order to ensure that products benefiting from the preferential arrangements come only from South Africa or the EU. To take account of modern international production processes, special provisions make the rules of origin more flexible.\nSouth Africa and the EU may implement safeguard measures when an imported product threatens to cause serious injury to the national industry. The agreement also allows South Africa to adopt transitional safeguard measures (for example, an increase or reintroduction of customs duties). In addition, similar measures make it possible to protect the economies of members of the Central African Customs Union and the outermost regions of the EU (such as Reunion).\nThe agreement includes provisions aimed at avoiding abuse by firms with a dominant position on the market and thus ensuring free competition among the companies from the EU and South Africa. Cooperation takes place within the framework of consultations between the competent authorities. In addition, the EU provides technical assistance to help South Africa restructure its competition laws. The agreement also recognises the need to provide adequate protection for intellectual property and provides for urgent consultations, where necessary, and technical assistance for South Africa.\nLastly, the TDCA provides for close cooperation in a wide range of fields linked to trade, including customs services, the free movement of services and capital, and technical obstacles such as certification and standardisation.\nDevelopment cooperation\nEU development aid for South Africa is mainly implemented from the EU budget through the financing instrument for development cooperation.\nThe focus of the multiannual indicative programme for cooperation with South Africa for 2014-2020 is on 3 areas:\njob creation\neducation, training and innovation\nbuilding a capable and developmental state.\nAs with other development cooperation agreements, decentralised cooperation is a key element of assistance, thus requiring a high degree of civil society involvement in the development process.\nEconomic cooperation\nBoth parties are stepping up their economic cooperation in many fields such as industry (in order to facilitate the restructuring of South African industry), the information society, the creation and development of small and medium-sized enterprises, transport and energy. Cooperation in this field should also support sustainable development in their economies and protect the environment.\nOther aspects\nThe provisions of the agreement cover cooperation in fields as diverse as:\nsocial cooperation, based on dialogue covering a number of aspects, such as freedom of association, workers’ rights, children’s rights, gender equality and violence against women;\ncooperation to protect the environment, particularly as regards climate change;\ncultural cooperation;\ncooperation in the fight against drugs and money laundering;\ncooperation in the field of health and, in particular, the fight against AIDS.\nLastly, the TDCA contains some institutional provisions. It creates a Cooperation Council to ensure the smooth operation of the agreement. And it provides for regular contact between the parties; for example, between their parliaments and between the EU’s Economic and Social Committee and its South-African counterpart, the National Economic Development and Labour Council.\nFROM WHEN DO THE AGREEMENT AND DECISION APPLY?\n              \nSigned on 11 October 1999 in Pretoria, the TDCA entered fully into force on 1 May 2004. However, some provisions which fall within EU competence have been applied since 1 January 2000.\nIn June 2016, South Africa signed EU - SADC EPA (Economic Partnership Agreement with the Southern African Development Community) together with 5 other southern African countries (Botswana, Lesotho, Mozambique, Namibia, and Swaziland). Once ratified, the EPA will replace the trade rules of the TDCA.\nBACKGROUND\n              \nThe agreement is supplemented by 3 additional agreements: the Science and Technology Agreement, and the Wine and Spirits Agreements. The Fisheries Agreement envisaged under the TDCA has not been concluded. South Africa also has qualified membership of the Cotonou Agreement, which governs the relations between the EU and ACP countries.\nFor more information, see:\nSouth Africa and the EU (EEAS).\nMAIN DOCUMENTS\n            \nAgreement on Trade, Development and Cooperation between the European Community and its Member States, of the one part, and the Republic of South Africa, of the other part - Protocol 1 concerning the definition of the concept of ‘originating products’ and methods of administrative cooperation - Protocol 2 on mutual administrative assistance in customs matters - Final Act - Declarations (OJ L 311, 4.12.1999, pp. 3-415)\nSuccessive amendments to the agreement have been incorporated into the original text.
