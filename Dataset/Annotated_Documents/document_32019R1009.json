{"celex_id": "32019R1009", "reference": "25.6.2019\nEN\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\nL 170/1\nREGULATION (EU) 2019/1009 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL\nof 5 June 2019\nlaying down rules on the making available on the market of EU fertilising products and amending Regulations (EC) No 1069/2009 and (EC) No 1107/2009 and repealing Regulation (EC) No 2003/2003\n(Text with EEA relevance)\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 114 thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee (1),\nActing in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure (2),\nWhereas:\n(1)\nThe conditions for making fertilisers available on the internal market have been partially harmonised through Regulation (EC) No 2003/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council (3), which almost exclusively covers fertilisers from mined or chemically produced, inorganic materials. There is also a need to make use of recycled or organic materials for fertilising purposes. Harmonised conditions for making fertilisers made from such recycled or organic materials available on the entire internal market should be established in order to provide an important incentive for their further use. Promoting increased use of recycled nutrients would further aid the development of the circular economy and allow a more resource-efficient general use of nutrients, while reducing Union dependency on nutrients from third countries. The scope of the harmonisation should therefore be extended in order to include recycled and organic materials.\n(2)\nCertain products are being used in combination with fertilisers for the purpose of improving nutrition efficiency, with the beneficial effect of reducing the amount of fertilisers used and hence their environmental impact. In order to facilitate their free movement on the internal market, not only fertilisers, i.e. products intended to provide plants with nutrient, but also products intended to improve plants’ nutrition efficiency, should be covered by the harmonisation.\n(3)\nRegulation (EC) No 765/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council (4) lays down rules on the accreditation of conformity assessment bodies, provides a framework for the market surveillance of products and for controls on products from third countries, and lays down the general principles of the CE marking. That Regulation should be applicable to products covered by this Regulation in order to ensure that products benefiting from the free movement of goods within the Union fulfil requirements providing a high level of protection of public interests such as human, animal and plant health, safety and the environment.\n(4)\nDecision No 768/2008/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (5) lays down common principles and reference provisions intended to apply across sectoral legislation in order to provide a coherent basis for revision or recasts of that legislation. Regulation (EC) No 2003/2003 should therefore be replaced by this Regulation, drafted to the extent possible in accordance with those common principles and reference provisions.\n(5)\nContrary to most other product harmonisation measures in Union law, Regulation (EC) No 2003/2003 does not prevent non-harmonised fertilisers from being made available on the internal market in accordance with national law and the general free movement rules of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). In view of the very local nature of certain product markets, this possibility should remain. Compliance with harmonised rules should therefore remain optional, and should be required only for products, intended to provide plants with nutrient or improve plants’ nutrition efficiency, which are CE marked when made available on the market. This Regulation should therefore not apply to products which are not CE marked when made available on the market.\n(6)\nDifferent product functions warrant different product safety and quality requirements adapted to their different intended uses. EU fertilising products should therefore be divided into different product function categories, which should each be subject to specific safety and quality requirements.\n(7)\nAn EU fertilising product might have more than one of the functions described in the product function categories set out in this Regulation. Where only one of those functions is claimed, it should be sufficient for the EU fertilising product to comply with the requirements of the product function category describing that claimed function. By contrast, where more than one of those functions are claimed, the EU fertilising product should be regarded as a blend of two or more component EU fertilising products, and compliance should be required for each of the component EU fertilising products with respect to its function. A specific product function category should therefore cover such blends.\n(8)\nA manufacturer using one or more EU fertilising products that have already been subject to a conformity assessment, by that manufacturer or another manufacturer, might wish to rely on that conformity assessment. For the purpose of reducing the administrative burden to a minimum, the resulting EU fertilising product should also be regarded as a blend of two or more component EU fertilising products, and the additional conformity requirements for the blend should be limited to the aspects that are warranted by the blending.\n(9)\nDifferent component materials warrant different process requirements and control mechanisms adapted to their different potential hazardousness and variability. Component materials for EU fertilising products should therefore be divided into different categories, which should each be subject to specific process requirements and control mechanisms. It should be possible to make available on the market an EU fertilising product composed of several component materials from various component material categories, where each material complies with the requirements of the category to which the material belongs.\n(10)\nContaminants in EU fertilising products, such as cadmium, could pose a risk to human, animal or plant health, to safety or to the environment as they accumulate in the environment and enter the food chain. Their content should therefore be limited in such products. Furthermore, impurities in EU fertilising products derived from bio-waste, in particular polymers but also metal and glass, should be either prevented or limited to the extent technically feasible by detection of such impurities in separately collected bio-waste before processing.\n(11)\nSeveral Member States have in place national provisions limiting cadmium content in phosphate fertilisers on grounds relating to the protection of human health and of the environment. Should a Member State deem it necessary to maintain such national provisions after the adoption of harmonised limit values under this Regulation, and until those harmonised limit values are equal to or lower than the national limit values already in place, it should notify them to the Commission in accordance with Article 114(4) TFEU. Furthermore, in accordance with Article 114(5) TFEU, if a Member State deems it necessary to introduce new national provisions, such as provisions limiting cadmium content in phosphate fertilisers, based on new scientific evidence relating to the protection of the environment or the working environment on grounds of a problem specific to that Member State arising after the adoption of this Regulation, it should notify the Commission of the envisaged provisions as well as the grounds for introducing them. In either case, the Commission should verify in accordance with Article 114(6) TFEU whether or not the notified national provisions are a means of arbitrary discrimination, a disguised restriction on trade or an obstacle to the functioning of the internal market.\n(12)\nIn view of the fact that certain Member States have been granted derogations from Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 2003/2003 in accordance with TFEU relating to cadmium content in fertilisers on the grounds, inter alia, of the protection of human health and the environment in the context of particular soil and climactic conditions prevailing in those Member States, and since the factual circumstances that led to the granting of those derogations by the Commission remain valid, those Member States should be able to continue to apply their national limit values for cadmium content until such time as harmonised limit values for cadmium content in phosphate fertilisers which are equal to or lower than those limit values are applicable at Union level.\n(13)\nIn order to facilitate the compliance of phosphate fertilisers with the requirements of this Regulation and to boost innovation, sufficient incentives should be provided for the development of relevant technologies, particularly decadmiation technology, and for the management of cadmium-rich hazardous waste in the form of relevant financial resources such as those available under Horizon Europe, the Circular Economy Finance Support Platform or through the European Investment Bank. Those incentives should target cadmium removal solutions that will be economically viable on an industrial scale and allow appropriate treatment of the waste generated.\n(14)\nAn EU fertilising product complying with the requirements of this Regulation should be allowed to move freely on the internal market. Where one or more of the component materials is a derived product within the meaning of Regulation (EC) No 1069/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council (6), but has reached a point in the manufacturing chain beyond which it no longer poses any significant risk to human, animal or plant health, to safety or to the environment (the ‘end point in the manufacturing chain’), to continue subjecting the product to the provisions of that Regulation would represent an unnecessary administrative burden. Such fertilising products should therefore be excluded from the requirements of that Regulation. Regulation (EC) No 1069/2009 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(15)\nFor each component material category which includes derived products within the meaning of Regulation (EC) No 1069/2009, the end point in the manufacturing chain should be determined in accordance with the procedures laid down in that Regulation. Where such an end point is reached before the EU fertilising product is placed on the market but after the manufacturing process regulated under this Regulation has started, the process requirements of both Regulation (EC) No 1069/2009 and this Regulation should apply cumulatively to EU fertilising products, which means application of the stricter requirement in case both Regulations regulate the same parameter.\n(16)\nDerived products within the meaning of Regulation (EC) No 1069/2009 which are already placed on the market and used in the Union as organic fertilisers and soil improvers in accordance with that Regulation constitute promising raw materials for the production of innovative fertilising products in a circular economy. As soon as an end point in the manufacturing chain has been determined for the respective derived product, the EU fertilising products containing such derived products in accordance with this Regulation should be granted free movement on the internal market without being subject to the requirements of Regulation (EC) No 1069/2009. For this purpose, the Commission should, without undue delay, carry out a first assessment to check whether an end point in the manufacturing chain can be determined.\n(17)\nIn the event of risks to public or animal health from fertilising products derived from animal by-products, recourse to safeguard measures in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council (7) should be possible, as is the case for other categories of products derived from animal by-products.\n(18)\nThe making available on the market of an animal by-product or a derived product within the meaning of Regulation (EC) No 1069/2009 for which no end point in the manufacturing chain has been determined, or for which the determined end point has not been reached at the time of making available on the market, is subject to the requirements of that Regulation. Therefore, it would be misleading to provide for the product’s CE marking under this Regulation. Any product containing or consisting of such an animal by-product or derived product should therefore be excluded from the scope of this Regulation. Untreated animal by-products should not be subject to this Regulation.\n(19)\nFor certain recovered wastes, such as struvite, biochar and ash-based products, within the meaning of Directive 2008/98/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (8), a market demand for their use as fertilising products has been identified. Furthermore, certain requirements are necessary for the waste used as input in the recovery operation and for the treatment processes and techniques, as well as for fertilising products resulting from the recovery operation, in order to ensure that the use of those fertilising products does not lead to overall adverse environmental or human health impacts. For EU fertilising products, those requirements should be laid down in this Regulation. Therefore, as of the moment of compliance with all the requirements of this Regulation, such products should cease to be regarded as waste within the meaning of Directive 2008/98/EC, and it should, therefore, be possible for fertilising products containing or consisting of such recovered waste materials to access the internal market. To ensure legal certainty, take advantage of technical developments, and further stimulate the incentive among producers to make more use of valuable waste streams, the scientific analyses and the setting of recovery requirements at Union level for such products should start immediately after the entry into force of this Regulation. Accordingly, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 TFEU should be delegated to the Commission in respect of defining, without unnecessary delay, larger or additional categories of component materials eligible for use in the production of EU fertilising products.\n(20)\nCertain by-products within the meaning of Directive 2008/98/EC are currently used by manufacturers as components of fertilising products or can be expected to be used in future emerging markets. For such components, specific requirements should be laid down in a separate component material category in Annex II to this Regulation.\n(21)\nCertain substances and mixtures, commonly referred to as inhibitors, improve the nutrient release pattern of a nutrient in a fertiliser by delaying or stopping the activity of specific groups of micro-organisms or enzymes. For inhibitors made available on the market with the intention of them being added to fertilising products, the manufacturer should be responsible for ensuring that those inhibitors fulfil certain efficacy criteria. Therefore, those inhibitors should be considered as EU fertilising products under this Regulation. Furthermore, EU fertilising products containing such inhibitors should be subject to certain efficacy, safety and environmental criteria. Such inhibitors should therefore also be regulated as component materials for EU fertilising products.\n(22)\nCertain substances, mixtures and micro-organisms, referred to as plant biostimulants, are not as such inputs of nutrients, but nevertheless stimulate plants’ natural nutrition processes. Where such products aim solely at improving the plants’ nutrient use efficiency, tolerance to abiotic stress, quality traits or increasing the availability of confined nutrients in the soil or rhizosphere, they are by nature more similar to fertilising products than to most categories of plant protection products. They act in addition to fertilisers, with the aim of optimising the efficiency of those fertilisers and reducing the nutrient application rates. Such products should therefore be eligible for CE marking under this Regulation and excluded from the scope of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council (9). Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(23)\nProducts with one or more functions, one of which is covered by the scope of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009, are plant protection products falling within the scope of that Regulation. Those products should remain under the control developed for such products and provided for by that Regulation. Where such products also have the function of a fertilising product, it would be misleading to provide for their CE marking under this Regulation, since the making available on the market of a plant protection product is contingent on a product authorisation valid in the Member State concerned. Therefore, such products should be excluded from the scope of this Regulation.\n(24)\nThis Regulation should not prevent the application of existing Union legislation relating to aspects of protection of human, animal and plant health, of safety and of the environment not covered by this Regulation. This Regulation should therefore apply without prejudice to Council Directive 86/278/EEC (10), Council Directive 89/391/EEC (11), Council Directive 91/676/EEC (12), Directive 2000/60/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (13), Directive 2001/18/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (14), Regulation (EC) No 852/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council (15), Regulation (EC) No 882/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council (16), Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council (17), Commission Regulation (EC) No 1881/2006 (18), Council Regulation (EC) No 834/2007 (19), Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council (20), Regulation (EU) No 98/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council (21), Regulation (EU) No 1143/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council (22), Regulation (EU) 2016/2031 of the European Parliament and of the Council (23), Directive (EU) 2016/2284 of the European Parliament and of the Council (24) and Regulation (EU) 2017/625 of the European Parliament and of the Council (25).\n(25)\nIn line with common practice, nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium should be referred to as ‘primary macronutrients’, and calcium, magnesium, sodium and sulphur should be referred to as ‘secondary macronutrients’. Also in line with common practice, fertilisers should be referred to as ‘straight’ when they contain either only one macronutrient – regardless whether it is primary or secondary – or only one primary macronutrient in combination with one or more secondary macronutrients. In line with the same practice, fertilisers should be referred to as ‘compound’ when they contain either more than one primary macronutrient – regardless whether they also contain one or more secondary macronutrients – or contain no primary macronutrient but more than one secondary macronutrient.\n(26)\nWhere an EU fertilising product contains a substance or mixture within the meaning of Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006, the safety of its constituent substances for the intended use should be established through registration pursuant to that Regulation. The information requirements should ensure that the safety of the intended use of the EU fertilising product is demonstrated in a manner comparable to that achieved through other regulatory regimes for products intended for use on arable soil or crops, notably Member States’ national fertiliser legislation and Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009. Therefore, where the actual quantities placed on the market are lower than 10 tonnes per company per year, the information requirements determined by Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 for the registration of substances in quantities of 10 to 100 tonnes should exceptionally apply as a condition for use in EU fertilising products. Those information requirements should apply to the actual substances contained in the EU fertilising product, as opposed to the precursors used for the manufacturing of those substances. The precursors themselves, such as sulphuric acid used as a precursor for the production of single superphosphate, should not be regulated as component materials for the purpose of this Regulation, since chemical safety will be better ensured by regulating as component materials the substances formed from the precursors and actually contained in the EU fertilising product. The obligation to comply with all the requirements of a component material category should therefore apply to those substances.\n(27)\nWhere the actual quantities of substances in EU fertilising products regulated by this Regulation are higher than 100 tonnes, the additional information requirements laid down in Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 should apply directly by virtue of that Regulation. The application of the other provisions of Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 should also remain unaffected by this Regulation.\n(28)\nEconomic operators should be responsible for the compliance of EU fertilising products with this Regulation, in relation to their respective roles in the supply chain, so as to ensure a high level of protection of the aspects of public interest covered by this Regulation, and also to guarantee fair competition on the internal market. Whenever appropriate, manufacturers and importers should carry out sample testing of the EU fertilising products that they have made available on the market, in order to protect the health and safety of consumers and the environment.\n(29)\nIt is necessary to provide for a clear and proportionate distribution of obligations which correspond to the role of each economic operator in the supply and distribution chain.\n(30)\nThe manufacturer, having detailed knowledge of the design and production process, is best placed to carry out the conformity assessment procedure. Conformity assessment of EU fertilising products should therefore remain solely the obligation of the manufacturer.\n(31)\nIt is necessary to ensure that EU fertilising products from third countries that enter the internal market comply with this Regulation, and in particular that the appropriate conformity assessment procedures have been carried out by manufacturers with regard to those EU fertilising products. Provision should therefore be made for importers to make sure that EU fertilising products which they place on the market comply with the requirements of this Regulation and that they do not place on the market EU fertilising products which do not comply with such requirements or present a risk to human, animal or plant health, to safety or to the environment. Provision should also be made for such importers to make sure that conformity assessment procedures have been carried out and that marking of EU fertilising products and documentation drawn up by manufacturers are available for inspection by the competent national authorities.\n(32)\nWhen placing an EU fertilising product on the market, importers should indicate on the packaging of the EU fertilising product their name, registered trade name or registered trade mark and the postal address at which they can be contacted, in order to enable market surveillance.\n(33)\nSince distributors make an EU fertilising product available on the market after it has been placed on the market by the manufacturer or the importer, they should act with due care to ensure that their handling of the EU fertilising product does not adversely affect the compliance of that EU fertilising product with this Regulation.\n(34)\nEconomic operators who either place an EU fertilising product on the market under their own name or trade mark or modify an EU fertilising product in such a way that compliance with this Regulation may be affected should be considered to be manufacturers and should assume the obligations of manufacturers. In other cases, economic operators who only package or repackage EU fertilising products already placed on the market by other economic operators should be able to prove that compliance with the requirements of this Regulation has not been affected, by indicating their identity on the package and by keeping a copy of the original labelling information.\n(35)\nSince distributors and importers are close to the market place, they should be involved in market surveillance tasks carried out by competent national authorities, and should be required to participate actively and provide those authorities with all necessary information relating to the EU fertilising product.\n(36)\nEnsuring traceability of an EU fertilising product throughout the whole supply chain helps to make market surveillance simpler and more efficient. An efficient traceability system facilitates market surveillance authorities’ task of tracing economic operators who made non-compliant EU fertilising products available on the market. When keeping the information required for the identification of other economic operators, economic operators should not be required to update such information in respect of other economic operators who have either supplied them with an EU fertilising product or to whom they have supplied an EU fertilising product, since such updated information is normally not available to them.\n(37)\nIn order to facilitate the assessment of conformity with the requirements of this Regulation it is necessary to provide for a presumption of conformity for EU fertilising products which are in conformity with harmonised standards that are adopted in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 1025/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council (26) or with common specifications adopted in accordance with this Regulation.\n(38)\nIn order to enable economic operators to demonstrate and the competent authorities to verify that EU fertilising products made available on the market comply with the requirements of this Regulation, it is necessary to provide for conformity assessment procedures. Decision No 768/2008/EC establishes modules for conformity assessment procedures, from the least stringent to the most stringent, in proportion to the level of risk involved and the level of safety required. In order to ensure inter-sectoral coherence and to avoid ad-hoc variants, conformity assessment procedures should be chosen from among those modules. It should be possible for manufacturers to choose a more stringent conformity assessment procedure for the assessment of an EU fertilising product eligible for a less stringent procedure, since this might enable the manufacturers to streamline their administration without jeopardising the conformity of the EU fertilising product. Furthermore, it is necessary to adapt the modules established by Decision No 768/2008/EC in order to reflect specific aspects of fertilising products. In particular, it is necessary to reinforce the quality systems and the involvement of notified bodies for the conformity assessment of certain EU fertilising products derived from recovered waste.\n(39)\nIn order to ensure that ammonium nitrate fertilisers of high nitrogen content do not endanger safety, and that such fertilisers are not used for purposes other than those for which they are intended, for example as explosives, such fertilisers should be subject to specific requirements relating to detonation resistance testing and to traceability.\n(40)\nTo ensure effective access to information for market surveillance purposes, information regarding conformity with all Union acts applicable to EU fertilising products should be given in the form of a single EU declaration of conformity. In order to reduce the administrative burden on economic operators, it should be possible for that single EU declaration of conformity to be a dossier made up of relevant individual declarations of conformity.\n(41)\nThe CE marking, indicating the conformity of an EU fertilising product with this Regulation, is the visible consequence of a whole process comprising conformity assessment in a broad sense. General principles governing the CE marking and its relationship to other markings are set out in Regulation (EC) No 765/2008. Specific rules governing the affixing of the CE marking in the case of EU fertilising products should be laid down.\n(42)\nCertain conformity assessment procedures set out in this Regulation require the intervention of conformity assessment bodies, which are notified by the Member States to the Commission.\n(43)\nIt is essential that all notified bodies perform their functions to the same level and under conditions of fair competition. That requires the setting of obligatory requirements for conformity assessment bodies wishing to be notified in order to provide conformity assessment services.\n(44)\nIf a conformity assessment body demonstrates conformity with the criteria laid down in harmonised standards it should be presumed to comply with the corresponding requirements set out in this Regulation.\n(45)\nIn order to ensure a consistent level of quality in the performance of conformity assessment of EU fertilising products, it is also necessary to set requirements for notifying authorities and other bodies involved in the assessment, notification and monitoring of notified bodies.\n(46)\nThe system set out in this Regulation should be complemented by the accreditation system provided for in Regulation (EC) No 765/2008. Since accreditation is an essential means of verifying the competence of conformity assessment bodies, it should also be used for the purposes of notification.\n(47)\nDue to the variable nature of certain component materials of EU fertilising products, and the potentially irreversible nature of some of the damage to which soil and crop exposure to impurities could lead, transparent accreditation as provided for in Regulation (EC) No 765/2008, ensuring the necessary level of confidence in certificates of conformity of EU fertilising products, should be the only means of demonstrating the technical competence of conformity assessment bodies.\n(48)\nConformity assessment bodies frequently subcontract parts of their activities linked to the assessment of conformity or have recourse to a subsidiary. In order to safeguard the level of protection required for EU fertilising products to be placed on the market, it is essential that conformity assessment subcontractors and subsidiaries fulfil the same requirements as notified bodies in relation to the performance of conformity assessment tasks. Therefore, it is important that the assessment of the competence and the performance of bodies to be notified and the monitoring of bodies already notified cover also activities carried out by subcontractors and subsidiaries.\n(49)\nIt is necessary to provide for an efficient and transparent notification procedure and, in particular, to adapt it to new technologies so as to enable online notification.\n(50)\nSince the services offered by notified bodies in a Member State might relate to EU fertilising products made available on the market throughout the Union, it is appropriate to give the other Member States and the Commission the opportunity to raise objections concerning a notified body. It is therefore important to provide for a period during which any doubts or concerns as to the competence of conformity assessment bodies can be clarified before they start operating as notified bodies.\n(51)\nIn the interests of easing market access, it is crucial that notified bodies apply the conformity assessment procedures without creating unnecessary burdens for economic operators. For the same reason, and to ensure equal treatment of economic operators, consistency in the technical application of the conformity assessment procedures needs to be ensured. That can best be achieved through appropriate coordination and cooperation between notified bodies.\n(52)\nIn order to ensure legal certainty, it is necessary to clarify that rules on internal market surveillance and control of products entering the internal market provided for in Regulation (EC) No 765/2008 apply to EU fertilising products covered by this Regulation. This Regulation should not prevent Member States from choosing the competent authorities to carry out those tasks.\n(53)\nEU fertilising products should be placed on the market only if they are sufficiently effective and do not present a risk to human, animal or plant health, to safety or to the environment when properly stored and used for their intended purpose, or under conditions of use which can be reasonably foreseen, that is when such use could result from lawful and readily predictable human behaviour.\n(54)\nRegulation (EC) No 2003/2003 provides for a safeguard procedure allowing the Commission to examine the justification for a measure taken by a Member State against EC fertilisers considered to constitute a risk. In order to increase transparency and to reduce processing time, it is necessary to improve the existing safeguard procedure, with the view to making it more efficient and drawing on the expertise available in Member States.\n(55)\nThe existing system should be supplemented by a procedure under which interested parties are informed of measures intended to be taken with regard to EU fertilising products presenting a risk to human, animal or plant health, to safety or to the environment. It should also allow market surveillance authorities, in cooperation with the relevant economic operators, to act at an early stage in respect of such EU fertilising products.\n(56)\nThe obligations of market surveillance authorities under this Regulation to require economic operators to take corrective actions should only apply to fertilising products bearing the CE marking when they are made available on the market. Those obligations should therefore be without prejudice to any possibility existing under national law to allow the economic operator to remove the CE marking and to legally place the product on the market as a product not falling within the scope of this Regulation.\n(57)\nIn order to achieve the objectives of this Regulation, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 TFEU should be delegated to the Commission in respect of adaptation to technical progress, in particular in the field of production of fertilising products derived from animal by-products and in the field of waste recovery, as well as in the agricultural sector and the agro-food industry.\n(58)\nPromising technical progress is being made in the field of recycling of waste, such as phosphorus recycling from sewage sludge, and fertilising product production from animal by-products, such as biochar. It should be possible for products containing or consisting of such materials to access the internal market without unnecessary delay when the manufacturing processes have been scientifically analysed and process requirements have been established at Union level. For that purpose, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 TFEU should be delegated to the Commission in respect of defining and introducing additional component materials eligible for use in the production of EU fertilising products and corresponding contaminant limit values in such products. That empowerment should only apply to the extent justified by technical progress established after the adoption of this Regulation, and not for the purpose of amending any elements of this Regulation in the absence of new evidence of such progress. In order to base the introduction of new contaminant limit values in EU fertilising products on full consideration of the direct and indirect impact on food and feed safety and on the environment, scientific opinions of the European Food Safety Authority, the European Chemicals Agency or the Commission’s Joint Research Centre, as relevant, should be taken into account prior to the adoption of new contaminant limit values. For derived products within the meaning of the Regulation (EC) No 1069/2009, component material categories should be expanded or added only to the extent that an end point in the manufacturing chain has been determined in accordance with the procedures laid down in that Regulation, since derived products for which no such end point has been determined are in any event excluded from the scope of this Regulation.\n(59)\nSince micro-organisms are not subject to registration under Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 or any other horizontal Union legislation requiring manufacturers to demonstrate that the intended use is safe, they should be eligible as component materials for EU fertilising products only to the extent that they have been clearly identified and supported by data demonstrating that their use is safe, and indicated in an exhaustive list adopted on that basis. The power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 TFEU should be delegated to the Commission in respect of adding new micro-organisms to that exhaustive list on the same basis.\n(60)\nAn EU fertilising product can contain polymers other than nutrient polymers. However, this should be limited to cases where the purpose of the polymer is that of controlling the release of nutrients or increasing the water retention capacity or wettability of the EU fertilising product. It should be possible for innovative products containing such polymers to access the internal market. In order to minimise risks to human health, to safety or to the environment that may be posed by polymers other than nutrient polymers, the criteria for their biodegradability, so that they are capable of undergoing physical and biological decomposition, should be established. For that purpose, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 TFEU should be delegated to the Commission in respect of defining the criteria for the conversion of polymeric carbon into carbon dioxide and a related testing method. Polymers which do not comply with those criteria should be prohibited after a transitional period.\n(61)\nFurthermore, it should be possible to react immediately to new scientific evidence and to new risk assessments regarding human, animal or plant health, safety or the environment. For that purpose, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 TFEU should be delegated to the Commission to amend the requirements applicable to various categories of EU fertilising products.\n(62)\nWhen adopting delegated acts under this Regulation, it is of particular importance that the Commission carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level, and that those consultations be conducted in accordance with the principles laid down in the Interinstitutional Agreement of 13 April 2016 on Better Law-Making (27). In particular, to ensure equal participation in the preparation of delegated acts, the European Parliament and the Council receive all documents at the same time as Member States’ experts, and their experts systematically have access to meetings of Commission expert groups dealing with the preparation of delegated acts.\n(63)\nIn order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of this Regulation, implementing powers to adopt acts should be conferred on the Commission in order to determine whether measures taken by Member States in respect of non-compliant EU fertilising products are justified or not. Since those acts will relate to the question of whether national measures are justified, such acts should not be subject to control by the Member States.\n(64)\nIn order to further ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of this Regulation, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission. Those powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council (28).\n(65)\nThe advisory procedure should be used for the adoption of implementing acts requiring the notifying Member State to take the necessary corrective measures in respect of notified bodies that do not meet or no longer meet the requirements for their notification.\n(66)\nThe examination procedure should be used for the adoption of implementing acts laying down in common specifications uniform conditions for implementing the requirements of this Regulation and tests for verifying the conformity of EU fertilising products where harmonised standards have not been adopted, or do not satisfy the requirements of this Regulation, or where there are undue delays in the process of adopting or updating these standards; amending or repealing common specifications where non-compliance of EU fertilising products can be attributed to shortcomings in those common specifications; determining whether a national measure taken in respect of a compliant EU fertilising product that presents a risk to human, animal or plant health, to safety or to the environment is justified or not.\n(67)\nThe Commission should adopt immediately applicable implementing acts determining whether a national measure taken in respect of a compliant EU fertilising product that presents a risk is justified or not where, in duly justified cases relating to the protection of human, animal or plant health, safety or the environment, imperative grounds of urgency so require.\n(68)\nMember States should lay down rules on penalties applicable to infringements of this Regulation and ensure that those rules are enforced. The penalties provided for should be effective, proportionate and dissuasive.\n(69)\nIn view of the need to ensure a high level of environmental protection and the need to take into account new developments based on scientific facts, the Commission should submit to the European Parliament and to the Council a report which includes a review of the limit values for cadmium content.\n(70)\nIt is necessary to provide for transitional arrangements that allow the making available on the market of EC fertilisers that have been placed on the market in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 2003/2003 before the date of application of this Regulation without those products having to comply with further product requirements. Distributors should therefore be able to supply EC fertilisers that have been placed on the market, namely stock that is already in the distribution chain, before the date of application of this Regulation.\n(71)\nIt is necessary to provide for sufficient time for economic operators to comply with their obligations under this Regulation, and for Member States to set up the administrative infrastructure necessary for its application. The application should therefore be deferred to a date where those preparations can reasonably be finalised.\n(72)\nSince the objective of this Regulation, namely to guarantee the functioning of the internal market while ensuring that EU fertilising products on the market fulfil the requirements providing for a high level of protection of human, animal, and plant health, of safety and of the environment, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States but can rather, by reason of its scale and effects, be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve that objective,\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nCHAPTER I\nGENERAL PROVISIONS\nArticle 1\nScope\n1.

Where the market surveillance authorities of one Member State have sufficient reason to believe that an EU fertilising product presents a risk to human, animal or plant health, to safety or to the environment, they shall carry out an evaluation in relation to the EU fertilising product concerned covering all relevant requirements laid down in this Regulation. The relevant economic operators shall cooperate as necessary with the market surveillance authorities for that purpose.\nWhere, in the course of the evaluation referred to in the first subparagraph, the market surveillance authorities find that the EU fertilising product does not comply with the requirements laid down in this Regulation, they shall without delay require the relevant economic operator to take all appropriate corrective action, within a reasonable period prescribed by the market surveillance authorities and commensurate with the nature of the risk, to bring the EU fertilising product into compliance with those requirements, to withdraw the EU fertilising product from the market or to recall it.\nThe market surveillance authorities shall inform the relevant notified body accordingly.\nArticle 21 of Regulation (EC) No 765/2008 shall apply to the measures referred to in the second subparagraph of this paragraph.\n2.   Where the market surveillance authorities consider that non-compliance is not restricted to their national territory, they shall inform the Commission and the other Member States of the results of the evaluation and of the actions which they have required the economic operator to take.\n3.   The economic operator shall ensure that all appropriate corrective action is taken in respect of all the EU fertilising products concerned that the economic operator has made available on the market throughout the Union.\n4.   Where the relevant economic operator does not take adequate corrective action within the period referred to in the second subparagraph of paragraph 1, the market surveillance authorities shall take all appropriate provisional measures to prohibit or restrict the EU fertilising product being made available on their national market, to withdraw the EU fertilising product from that market or to recall it.\nThe market surveillance authorities shall inform the Commission and the other Member States, without delay, of those measures.\n5.   The information referred to in the second subparagraph of paragraph 4 shall include all available details, in particular the data necessary for the identification of the non-compliant EU fertilising product, the origin of that EU fertilising product, the nature of the non-compliance alleged and the risk involved, the nature and duration of the national measures taken and the arguments put forward by the relevant economic operator. In particular, the market surveillance authorities shall indicate whether the non-compliance is due to any of the following:\n(a)\nfailure of the EU fertilising product to meet the requirements set out in Annex I, II or III;\n(b)\nshortcomings in the harmonised standards referred to in Article 13;\n(c)\nshortcomings in the common specifications referred to in Article 14.\n6.   Member States other than the Member State initiating the procedure under this Article shall without delay inform the Commission and the other Member States of any measures adopted and of any additional information at their disposal relating to the non-compliance of the EU fertilising product concerned, and, in the event of disagreement with the adopted national measure, of their objections.\n7.   Where, within three months of receipt of the information referred to in the second subparagraph of paragraph 4, no objection has been raised by either a Member State or the Commission in respect of a provisional measure taken by a Member State, that measure shall be deemed justified.\n8.   Member States shall ensure that appropriate restrictive measures, such as withdrawal of the EU fertilising product from the market, are taken without delay in respect of the EU fertilising product concerned.\n9.   Obligations of the market surveillance authorities under this Article shall be without prejudice to the possibility for Member States to regulate fertilising products which are not EU fertilising products.\nArticle 39\nUnion safeguard procedure\n1.   Where, on completion of the procedure set out in Article 38(3) and (4), objections are raised against a measure taken by a Member State, or where the Commission considers a national measure to be contrary to Union law, the Commission shall without delay enter into consultation with the Member States and the relevant economic operator or operators and shall evaluate the national measure. On the basis of the results of that evaluation, the Commission shall adopt an implementing act in the form of a decision determining whether the national measure is justified or not.\nIf the national measure is considered justified, the decision shall order all Member States to take the necessary measures to ensure that the non-compliant EU fertilising product is withdrawn from their market, and to inform the Commission accordingly.\nIf the national measure is considered unjustified, the decision shall order the Member State concerned to withdraw that measure.\nThe Commission shall address its decision to all Member States and shall immediately communicate it to them and the relevant economic operator or operators.\n2.   Where the national measure is considered justified and the non-compliance of the EU fertilising product is attributed to shortcomings in the harmonised standards referred to in point (b) of Article 38(5) of this Regulation, the Commission shall apply the procedure provided for in Article 11 of Regulation (EU) No 1025/2012.\n3.   Where the national measure is considered justified and the non-compliance of the EU fertilising product is attributed to shortcomings in the common specifications referred to in point (c) of Article 38(5), the Commission shall, without delay, adopt implementing acts amending or repealing the common specifications concerned.\nThose implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 45(3).\nArticle 40\nCompliant EU fertilising products which present a risk\n1.   Where, having carried out an evaluation under Article 38(1), a Member State finds that although an EU fertilising product is in compliance with this Regulation it presents a risk to human, animal or plant health, to safety or to the environment, it shall without delay require the relevant economic operator to take all appropriate measures, within a reasonable period prescribed by the market surveillance authority and commensurate with the nature of the risk, to ensure that the EU fertilising product concerned, when made available on the market, no longer presents that risk, to withdraw the EU fertilising product from the market or to recall it.\n2.   The economic operator shall ensure that corrective action is taken in respect of all the EU fertilising products concerned that the economic operator has made available on the market throughout the Union.\n3.   The Member State shall immediately inform the Commission and the other Member States. That information shall include all available details, in particular the data necessary for the identification of the EU fertilising product concerned, the origin and the supply chain of that EU fertilising product, the nature of the risk involved and the nature and duration of the national measures taken.\n4.   The Commission shall without delay enter into consultation with the Member States and the relevant economic operator or operators and shall evaluate the national measures taken. On the basis of the results of that evaluation, the Commission shall adopt an implementing act in the form of a decision determining whether the national measure is justified or not, and where necessary, ordering appropriate measures.\nThose implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 45(3).\nOn duly justified imperative grounds of urgency relating to the protection of human, animal or plant health, safety or the environment, the Commission shall adopt immediately applicable implementing acts in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 45(4).\n5.   The Commission shall address its decision to all Member States and shall immediately communicate it to them and the relevant economic operator or operators.\nArticle 41\nFormal non-compliance\n1.   Without prejudice to Article 38, where a Member State makes one of the following findings with regard to an EU fertilising product, it shall require the relevant economic operator to put an end to the non-compliance concerned:\n(a)\nthe CE marking has been affixed in violation of Article 30 of Regulation (EC) No 765/2008 or of Article 18 of this Regulation;\n(b)\nthe identification number of the notified body has been affixed in violation of Article 18 or has not been affixed, where required by Article 18;\n(c)\nthe EU declaration of conformity has not been drawn up or has not been drawn up correctly;\n(d)\nthe technical documentation is either not available or not complete;\n(e)\nthe information referred to in Article 6(6) or Article 8(3) is absent, false or incomplete;\n(f)\nany other administrative requirement provided for in Article 6 or Article 8 is not fulfilled.\n2.

Thermal cycles prior to a test for compliance with the oil retention requirement referred to in point 4 under PFC 1(C)(I)(a)(i-ii)(A) in Annex I\n4.1.1.   Principle and definition\nIn a closed suitable laboratory flask, heat the sample from ambient temperature to 50 °C and maintain at this temperature for a period of two hours (phase at 50 °C). Thereupon cool the sample until a temperature of 25 °C is achieved and maintain at that temperature for two hours (phase at 25 °C). The combination of the successive phases at 50 °C and 25 °C forms one thermal cycle. After being subjected to two thermal cycles, the test sample is held at a temperature of 20 (± 3) °C for the determination of the oil retention value.\n4.1.2.   Apparatus\nNormal laboratory apparatus, in particular:\n(a)\nwater baths or ovens thermostated at 25 ± 1 °C and 50 ± 1 °C respectively,\n(b)\nsuitable laboratory flasks with an individual capacity of 150 ml.\n4.1.3.   Procedure\n4.1.3.1.\nPut each test sample of 70 ± 5 g into a suitable laboratory flask which is then closed.\n4.1.3.2.\nAfter attaining the temperature of 50 °C and maintain that temperature for two hours, change the temperature of the flask to the 25 °C bath or oven and proceed as described in 4.1.1.\n4.1.3.3.\nIf using a water bath maintain the water of each bath at constant temperature and keep in motion by rapid stirring. Ensure the water level comes above the level of the sample. Protect the stopper from condensation by a foam rubber cap.\n4.2.   Oil retention test referred to in point 4 under PFC 1(C)(I)(a)(i-ii)(A) in Annex I\n4.2.1.   Description\nThe oil retention of an EU fertilising product shall be the quantity of oil retained by the EU fertilising product determined under the operating conditions specified and expressed as a % by mass.\nThe test shall be carried out on a representative sample of the EU fertilising product. Before being tested, the whole mass of the sample shall be thermally cycled two times in accordance with point 4.1.\nThe method is applicable to both prilled and granular fertilisers which do not contain oil soluble materials.\n4.2.2.   Principle\nTotal immersion of the test sample in gas oil for a specified period, followed by the draining away of surplus oil under specified conditions. Measurement of the increase in mass of the test portion.\n4.2.3.   Reagents\nGas oil with the following characteristics:\n(a)\nviscosity max.: 5 mPas at 40 °C;\n(b)\ndensity: 0,8 g/ml to 0,85 g/ml at 20 °C;\n(c)\nsulphur content: ≤ 1,0 % (m/m);\n(d)\nash: ≤ 0,1 % (m/m).\n4.2.4.   Apparatus\nOrdinary laboratory apparatus, and:\n(a)\nbalance, capable of weighing to the nearest 0,01 g;\n(b)\nbeakers, of capacity 500 ml;\n(c)\nfunnel, of plastic materials, preferably with a cylindrical wall at the upper end, diameter approximately 200 mm;\n(d)\ntest sieve, aperture 0,5 mm, fitting into the funnel;\nNote: The size of the funnel and sieve is such as to ensure that only a few granules lie one above another and the oil is able to drain easily.\n(e)\nfilter paper, rapid filtering grade, creped, soft, mass 150 g/m2;\n(f)\nabsorbent tissue (laboratory grade).\n4.2.5.   Procedure\n4.2.5.1.\nTwo individual determinations are carried out in quick succession on separate portions of the same test sample.\n4.2.5.2.\nRemove particles smaller than 0,5 mm using the test sieve. Weigh to the nearest 0,01 g approximately 50 g of the sample into the beaker. Add sufficient gas oil to cover the prills or granules completely and stir carefully to ensure that the surfaces of all the prills or granules are fully wetted. Cover the beaker with a watch glass and leave to stand for one hour at 25 (± 2) °C.\n4.2.5.3.\nFilter the entire contents of the beaker through the funnel containing the test sieve. Allow the portion retained by the sieve to remain there for one hour so that most of the excess oil can drain away.\n4.2.5.4.\nLay two sheets of filter paper (about 500 mm x 500 mm) on top of each other on a smooth surface; fold the four edges of both filter papers upwards to a width of about 40 mm to prevent the prills or granules from rolling away. Place two layers of absorbent tissue in the centre of the filter papers. Pour the entire contents of the sieve over the absorbent tissues and spread the prills or granules evenly with a soft, flat brush. After two minutes lift one side of the tissues to transfer the prills or granules to the filter papers beneath and spread them evenly over these with the brush. Lay another sheet of filter paper, similarly with its edges turned upward, on the sample and roll the prills or granules between the filter papers with circular movements while exerting a little pressure. Pause after every eight circular movements to lift the opposite corners of the filter papers and return to the centre the prills or granules that have rolled to the periphery. Keep to the following procedure: make four complete circular movements, first clockwise and then anticlockwise. Then roll the prills or granules back to the centre as described above. This procedure is to be carried out three times (24 circular movements, corners lifted twice). Carefully insert a new sheet of filter paper between the bottom sheet and the one above it and allow the prills or granules to roll onto the new sheet by lifting the edges of the upper sheet. Cover the prills or granules with a new sheet of filter paper and repeat the same procedure as described above. Immediately after rolling, pour the prills or granules into a tared dish and reweigh to the nearest 0,01 g to determine the mass of the quantity of gas oil retained.\n4.2.5.5.\nRepeating the rolling procedure and reweighing\nIf the quantity of gas oil retained in the portion is found to be greater than 2,00 g, place the portion on a fresh set of filter papers and repeat the rolling procedure, lifting the corners in accordance with point 4.2.5.4 (two times eight circular movements, lifting once). Then reweigh the portion.\n4.2.5.6.\nTwo oil retention tests per sample are to be carried out.\n4.2.6.   Test report\n4.2.6.1.   Expression of the results\n4.2.6.1.1.   Method of calculation and formula\nThe oil retention, from each determination (point 4.2.5.1) expressed as a % by mass of the sieved test portion, is given by the equation:\nwhere:\nm1 is the mass, in grams, of the sieved test portion (point 4.2.5.2),\nm2 is the mass, in grams, of the test portion according to points 4.2.5.4 and 4.2.5.5 respectively as the result of the last weighing.\n4.2.6.1.2.   Take as the result the arithmetic mean of the two individual determinations.\n4.2.6.2.   The test report shall form part of the technical documentation.\n4.3.   Thermal cycles prior to the detonation resistance test referred to in point 5 under PFC 1(C)(I)(a)(i-ii)(A) in Annex I\n4.3.1.   Principle and definition\nIn a tight box heat the sample from ambient temperature to 50 °C and maintain at this temperature for a period of one hour (phase at 50 °C). Thereupon cool the sample until a temperature of 25 °C is achieved and maintain at that temperature for one hour (phase at 25 °C). The combination of the successive phases at 50 °C and 25 °C forms one thermal cycle. After being subjected to the required number of thermal cycles, the test sample is held at a temperature of 20 ± 3 °C pending the execution of the detonation resistance test.\n4.3.2.   Apparatus\nMethod 1\n(a)\nA water bath, thermostated in a temperature range of 20 to 51 °C with a minimum heating and cooling rate of 10 °C/h, or two water baths, one thermostated at a temperature of 20 °C, the other at 51 °C. The water in the bath(s) is continuously stirred; the volume of the bath shall be large enough to guarantee ample circulation of the water.\n(b)\nA stainless steel box, watertight all around and provided with a temperature recording device in the centre. The outside width of the box is 45 ± 2 mm and the wall thickness is 1,5 mm (see Figure 1 as an example). The height and length of the box can be chosen to suit the dimensions of the water bath, e.g. length 600 mm, height 400 mm.\nMethod 2\n(a)\nSuitable oven, thermostated in a temperature range of 20 °C to 51 °C with a minimum heating and cooling rate of 10 °C/h.\n(b)\nSuitable airtight plastics boxes or bags provided with a suitable temperature recording device in the centre of the sample or a stainless steel box as described in point (b) of method 1 of point 4.3.2. Once filled, the outside thickness of the box or bag shall be maximum 45 mm.\n4.3.3.   Procedure\nPlace a quantity of fertilisers sufficient for the detonation resistance test into the boxes or bags and close them. Place the stainless steel boxes in the water bath (method 1) or the boxes or bags in the oven (method 2). Heat the water or oven to 51 °C and measure the temperature in the centre of the fertiliser. One hour after the temperature at the centre has reached 50 °C start cooling. One hour after the temperature at the centre has reached 25 °C start heating for the second cycle. In the case of two water baths or ovens, transfer the boxes or bags to the other bath or oven after each heating/cooling period.\nFigure 1\nA\n:\nO-ring\nB\n:\nCover\nC\n:\nBolt\nD\n:\nBox\n4.4.   Detonation resistance test referred to in point 5 under PFC 1(C)(I)(a)(i-ii)(A) in Annex I\n4.4.1.   Description\n4.4.1.1.\nThe test shall be carried out on a representative sample of the EU fertilising product. Before being tested for resistance to detonation, the whole mass of the sample is to be thermally cycled five times in accordance with point 4.3.\n4.4.1.2.\nThe EU fertilising product shall be subjected to the detonation resistance test in a horizontal steel tube under the following conditions (the details of the materials are in point 4.4.3):\n(a)\nseamless steel tube:\n(i)\nTube length: 1 000 mm at least,\n(ii)\nNominal external diameter: 114 mm at least,\n(iii)\nNominal wall thickness: 5 mm at least,\n(b)\nbooster: the type and mass of the booster chosen shall be such as to maximise the detonation pressure applied to the sample in order to determine its susceptibility to the transmission of detonation,\n(c)\ntemperature of the sample: 15 °C to 25 °C,\n(d)\nwitness lead cylinders for detecting detonation: 50 mm diameter and 100 mm height,\n(e)\nplaced at 150 mm intervals and supporting the tube horizontally.\nNOTE: The test is to be carried out twice. The test is deemed conclusive if in both tests one or more of the supporting lead cylinders is crushed by less than 5 %.\n4.4.2.   Principle\nThe test sample is confined in a steel tube and subjected to detonation shock from an explosive booster charge. Propagation of the detonation is determined from the degree of crushing of lead cylinders on which the tube rests horizontally during the test.\n4.4.3.   Materials\n(a)\nPlastic explosive containing 83 % to 86 % penthrite\n—\ndensity: 1 500 kg/m3 to 1 600 kg/m3\n—\ndetonation velocity: 7 300 m/s to 7 700 m/s\n—\nmass: (500 ± 1) g;\nor any other plastic explosive with similar detonation characteristics.\n(b)\nSeven lengths of flexible detonating cord with non-metallic sleeve\n—\nfilling mass: 11 g/m to 13 g/m\n—\nlength of each cord: (400 ± 2) mm.\n(c)\nCompressed pellet of secondary explosive, recessed to receive detonator\n—\nexplosive: hexogen/wax 95/5 or similar secondary explosive, with or without added graphite\n—\ndensity: 1 500 kg/m3 to 1 600 kg/m3\n—\ndiameter: 19 mm to 21 mm\n—\nheight: 19 mm to 23 mm\n—\nmass of the compressed pellet: maximum 10 g\n—\ncentral recess to receive detonator: maximal diameter 7,0 to 7,3 mm, depth about 12 mm. In case of detonators with large diameters, the diameter of the recess shall be slightly larger (e.g. 0,5 mm) than the diameter of the detonator.\n(d)\nSeamless steel tube as specified in ISO 65 – 1981 – Heavy Series, with nominal dimensions DN 100 (4'')\n—\noutside diameter: 113,1 mm to 115,0 mm\n—\nwall thickness: 5,0 mm to 6,5 mm\n—\nlength: 1 005 ± 2 mm.\n(e)\nBottom plate\n—\nmaterial: steel of good weldable quality\n—\ndimensions: 160 mm × 160 mm\n—\nthickness: 5 mm to 6 mm.\n(f)\nSix lead cylinders\n—\ndiameter: 50 ± 1 mm\n—\nheight: 100 mm to 101 mm\n—\nmaterials: soft lead, at least 99,5 % purity.\n(g)\nSteel block\n—\nlength: at least 1 000 mm\n—\nwidth: at least 150 mm\n—\nheight: at least 150 mm (alternatively a stack of several beams can be used to achieve this height)\n—\nMass: at least 300 kg if there is no firm base for the steel block.\n(h)\nPlastic or cardboard cylinder for booster charge\n—\nwall thickness: 1,5 mm to 2,5 mm\n—\ndiameter: 92 mm to 96 mm\n—\nheight: 64 mm to 67 mm.\n(i)\nDetonator (electric or non-electric) with initiation force 8 to 10\n(j)\nWooden or plastic disc\n—\ndiameter: 92 mm to 96 mm.

Procedure\n4.4.4.1.   Preparation of booster charge for insertion into steel tube\nDepending on the availability of equipment, the explosive can be initiated in the booster charge either\n—\nby seven-point simultaneous initiation as referred to in point 4.4.4.1.1, or\n—\nby central initiation by a compressed pellet as referred to in point 4.4.4.1.2.\n4.4.4.1.1.   Seven-point simultaneous initiation\nThe booster charge prepared for use is shown in Figure 2.\n4.4.4.1.1.1.   Drill holes in the wooden or plastic disc (point (j) under point 4.4.3) parallel to the axis of the disc through the centre and through six points symmetrically distributed around a concentric circle 55 mm in diameter. The diameter of the holes shall be 6 mm to 7 mm (see Section A-B in Figure 2), depending on the diameter of the detonating cord used (point (b) under point 4.4.3).\n4.4.4.1.1.2.   Cut seven lengths of flexible detonating cord (point (b) under point 4.4.3) each 400 mm long, avoiding any loss of explosive at each end by making a clean cut and immediately sealing the end with adhesive. Push each of the seven lengths through each of the seven holes in the wooden or plastic disc (point (j) under point 4.4.3) until their ends project a few centimetres on the other side of the disc. Then insert a small split pin (point (l) under point 4.4.3) transversally into the textile sleeve of each length of cord 5 mm to 6 mm from the end and apply adhesive around the outside of the lengths of cord in a band 2 cm wide adjacent to the pin. Finally, pull the long piece of each cord to bring the pin into contact with the wooden or plastic disc.\n4.4.4.1.1.3.   Shape the plastic explosive (point (a) under point 4.4.3) to form a cylinder 92 mm to 96 mm in diameter, depending on the diameter of the cylinder (point (h) under point 4.4.3). Stand this cylinder upright on a level surface and insert the shaped explosive. Then insert the wooden or plastic disc (1) carrying the seven lengths of detonating cord into the top of the cylinder and press it down onto the explosive. Adjust the height of the cylinder (64 mm to 67 mm) so that its top edge does not extend beyond the level of the wood or plastic. Finally, fix the cylinder to the wooden or plastic disc for instance with staples or small nails, around its entire circumference.\n4.4.4.1.1.4.   Group the free ends of the seven lengths of detonating cord around the circumference of the wooden or plastic rod (point (k) under point 4.4.3) so that their ends are all level in a plane perpendicular to the rod. Secure them in a bundle around the rod by means of adhesive tape (2).\n4.4.4.1.2.   Central initiation by a compressed pellet\nThe booster charge prepared for use is shown in Figure 3.\n4.4.4.1.2.1.   Preparing a compressed pellet\nTaking the necessary safety precautions, place maximum 10 g of a secondary explosive (point (c) under point 4.4.3) in a mould with an inside diameter of 19 mm to 21 mm and compress to the correct shape and density (the ratio of diameter: height should be roughly 1:1). In the centre of the bottom of the mould there is a peg, 12 mm in height and 7,0 mm to 7,3 mm in diameter (depending on the diameter of the detonator used), which forms a cylindrical recess in the compressed cartridge for subsequent insertion of the detonator.\n4.4.4.1.2.2.   Preparing the booster charge\nPlace the explosive (point (a) under point 4.4.3) into the cylinder (point (h) under point 4.4.3) standing upright on a level surface, then press it down with a wooden or plastic die to give the explosive a cylindrical shape with a central recess. Insert the compressed pellet into this recess. Cover the cylindrically shaped explosive containing the compressed pellet with a wooden or plastic disc (point (j) under point 4.4.3) having a central hole 7,0 mm to 7,3 mm in diameter for insertion of a detonator. Fix the wooden or plastic disc and the cylinder together with a cross of adhesive tape. Ensure that the hole drilled in the disc and the recess in the compressed pellet are coaxial by inserting the wooden or plastic rod (point (k) under point 4.4.3).\n4.4.4.2.   Preparing steel tubes for the detonation tests\nAt one end of the steel tube (point (d) under point 4.4.3), drill two diametrically opposed holes 4 mm in diameter perpendicularly through the side wall at a distance of 4 mm from the edge. Butt weld the bottom plate (point (e) under point 4.4.3) to the opposite end of the tube, completely filling the right angle between the bottom plate and the wall of the tube with weld metal around the entire circumference of the tube.\n4.4.4.3.   Filling and charging the steel tube\nSee Figures 2 and 3.\n4.4.4.3.1.\nThe test sample, the steel tube and the booster charge shall be conditioned to temperatures of (20 ± 5) °C. About 20 kg of the test sample should be available for two detonation resistance tests.\n4.4.4.3.2.1\nPlace the tube upright with its square bottom plate resting on a firm, flat surface, preferably concrete. Fill the tube to about one-third of its height with the test sample and drop it 10 cm vertically onto the flat surface five times to compact the prills or granules as densely as possible in the tube. To accelerate compaction, vibrate the tube by striking the side wall with a 750 g to 1 000 g hammer between drops for a total of 10 times.\n4.4.4.3.2.2.\nRepeat this charging method with another portion of the test sample. Finally, a further addition shall be made such that, after compaction by raising and dropping the tube 10 times and a total of 20 intermittent hammer blows, the charge fills the tube to a distance of 70 mm from its orifice.\n4.4.4.3.2.3\nThe filling height of the sample shall be adjusted in the steel tube so that the booster charge (referred to in point 4.4.4.1.1 or 4.4.4.1.2) to be inserted later will be in close contact with the sample over its entire surface.\n4.4.4.3.3.\nInsert the booster charge into the tube so that it is in contact with the sample; the top surface of the wooden or plastic disc shall be 6 mm below the end of the tube. Ensure essential close contact between explosive and test sample by taking out the booster charge and adding or removing small quantities of sample. As shown in Figures 2 and 3, split pins should be inserted through the holes near the open end of the tube and their legs opened flat against the tube.\n4.4.4.4.   Positioning of the steel tube and lead cylinders (see Figure 4)\n4.4.4.4.1.\nNumber the bases of the lead cylinders (point (f) under point 4.4.3) 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6. Make six marks 150 mm apart along a line on a steel block (point 4.4.3(g)) lying on a horizontal base, with each mark at least 75 mm from any edge of the block. Place a lead cylinder upright on each of these marks, with the base of each cylinder centred on its mark (see Figure 4).\n4.4.4.4.2.\nLay the steel tube prepared according to point 4.4.4.3 horizontally on the lead cylinders so that the axis of the tube is parallel to the centre line of the lead cylinders and the welded end of the tube extends 50 mm beyond lead cylinder No 6. To prevent the tube from rolling, insert small wooden or plastic wedges between the tops of the lead cylinders and the tube wall (one on each side) or place a cross of wood between the tube and the steel block or stack of beams. (see Figure 4).\nNote: Make sure that the tube is in contact with all six lead cylinders; a slight curvature of the tube surface can be compensated for by rotating the tube about its longitudinal axis; if any of the lead cylinders is too tall, tap the cylinder in question carefully with a hammer until it is the required height.\n4.4.4.5.   Preparation for detonation\n4.4.4.5.1.\nSet up the apparatus as described in point 4.4.4.4 in a bunker or suitably prepared underground site or suitable location. Ensure that the temperature of the steel tube is kept at (20 ± 5) °C before detonation.\nNote: Detonation can cause steel fragments to be projected with high kinetic energy, therefore, firing shall be carried out at a suitable distance from dwellings or thoroughfares.\n4.4.4.5.2.\nIf the booster charge with seven-point initiation is used, ensure that the detonation cords are stretched out as described in the footnote to point 4.4.4.1.1.4 and arranged as horizontally as possible.\n4.4.4.5.3.\nFinally, remove the wooden or plastic rod and replace with the detonator. Do not carry out firing until the danger zone has been evacuated and the test personnel have taken cover.\n4.4.4.5.4.\nDetonate the explosive.\n4.4.4.6.1.\nAllow sufficient time for the fumes (gaseous and sometimes toxic decomposition products such as nitrous gases) to disperse, then collect the lead cylinders and measure their heights with a Vernier caliper.\n4.4.4.6.2.\nRecord for each of the marked lead cylinders, the degree of crushing expressed as a percentage of the original height of 100 mm.

This will guarantee a high level of soil protection and reduce health and environmental risks while allowing producers to adapt their manufacturing process to comply with the new limits.\nIt maintains optional harmonisation, as it does not prevent non-harmonised fertilising products from being made available on the internal market in accordance with national law and the general free-movement rules.\nKEY POINTS\nScope\nThe regulation covers 7 categories of fertilising products, namely:\nfertilisers: inorganic fertilisers,organo-mineral fertilisers,organic fertilisers,\nsoil improvers,\nliming materials,\ngrowing media,\ninhibitors,\nplant biostimulants, and\nfertilising product blends.\nIt will replace Regulation (EC) No 2003/2003 which does not include fertilisers produced from recovered or organic materials.\nIt does not apply to:\nanimal by-products or derived products which are subject to the requirements of Regulation (EC) No 1069/2009 when made available on the market;\nplant protection products covered by the scope of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 (see summary).\nThe rules apply to the design, manufacture and placing on the market of EU fertilising products. The regulation does not apply to the use or the mode of application of the EU fertilising products.\nRequirements\nThe regulation sets out rules for EU fertilising products carrying the CE marking including requirements for: maximum levels of contaminants and pathogens (disease-causing microorganisms);minimum content of nutrients and other relevant characteristics depending on the category of the product;labelling.\nTesting the conformity of EU fertilising products must be performed in a reliable and reproducible manner.\nFree movement\nEU countries cannot restrict the free movement of EU fertilising products for reasons relating to composition, labelling or other aspects covered by this regulation if those products comply with this Regulation’s rules.\nEU countries can maintain or adopt rules relating to human health and the environment (which comply with the EU treaties) which concern the use of EU fertilising products, as long as they do not require EU compliant products to be modified or influence the conditions for making them available on the market.\nRepeal\nRegulation (EU) 2019/1009 repeals Regulation (EC) No 2003/2003 as of 16 July 2022.\nFROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?\n              \nIt applies as of 16 July 2022.\nBACKGROUND\nChemicals legislation (European Commission).\nKEY TERMS\n              \nOrganic: fertilisers derived from plant residues or livestock manure.\nOrgano-mineral: a fertiliser obtained by the mixing of one or more organic fertilisers with one or more inorganic fertilisers (e.g. nitrogen or phosphorus).\nSoil improver: a material to be added to the soil to maintain or improve its properties.\nInhibitors: a substance added to a fertiliser which extends the time a component, such as nitrogen,is released into the soil.\nPlant biostimulants: substances and micro-organisms which can stimulate natural processes to improve nutrient uptake, nutrient efficiency and crop quality.\nGrowing media: solid or liquid materials in which plants grow; substrate.\nBlends: the mixing of fertiliser inputs tailored to crop requirements.\nMAIN DOCUMENT\n            \nRegulation (EU) 2019/1009 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 5 June 2019 laying down rules on the making available on the market of EU fertilising products and amending Regulations (EC) No 1069/2009 and (EC) No 1107/2009 and repealing Regulation (EC) No 2003/2003 (OJ L 170, 25.6.2019, pp. 1-114)\nRELATED DOCUMENTS\n            \nRegulation (EC) No 2003/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 October 2003 relating to fertilisers (OJ L 304, 21.11.2003, pp. 1-194)\nSuccessive amendments to Regulation (EU) No 2003/2003 have been incorporated into the original text.
