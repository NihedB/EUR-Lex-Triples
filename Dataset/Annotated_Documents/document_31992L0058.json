Preliminary remarks\n1.1.\nWhere health and/or safety signs are required by the general rule in Article 3 of the Directive, they must conform to the specific requirements in Annexes II to IX.\n1.2.\nThis Annex introduces those requirements, describes the different uses of safety and/or health signs, and gives general rules on the interchanging and combining of signs.\n1.3.\nHealth and/or safety signs must be used only to convey the message or information specified in the Directive.\n2.   Types of signs\n2.1.   Permanent signs\n2.1.1.\nPermanent signboards must be used for signs relating to prohibitions, warnings and mandatory requirements and the location and identification of emergency escape routes and first-aid facilities.\nSignboards and/or a safety colour must be used to mark permanently the location and identification of fire-fighting equipment.\n2.1.2.\nSignboards on containers and pipes must be placed as laid down in Annex III.\n2.1.3.\nPlaces where there is a risk of colliding with obstacles or of falling must be permanently marked with a safety colour and/or with signboards.\n2.1.4.\nTraffic routes must be permanently marked with a safety colour.\n2.2.   Occasional signs\n2.2.1.\nIlluminated signs, acoustic signals and/or verbal communication must be used where the occasion requires, taking into account the possibilities for interchanging and combining signs set out in Section 3, to signal danger, to call persons to take a specific course of action and for the emergency evacuation of persons.\n2.2.2.\nHand signals and/or verbal communication must be used where the occasion requires, to guide persons carrying out hazardous or dangerous manoeuvres.\n3.   Interchanging and combining signs\n3.1.\nAny one of the following may be used if equally effective:\n—\na safety colour or a signboard to mark places where there is an obstacle or a drop,\n—\nilluminated signs, acoustic signals or verbal communication,\n—\nhand signals or verbal communication.\n3.2.\nSome types of signs may be used together:\n—\nilluminated signs and acoustic signals,\n—\nilluminated signs and verbal communication,\n—\nhand signals and verbal communication.\n4.   The instructions in the table below apply to all signs incorporating a safety colour:\nColour\nMeaning or purpose\nInstructions and information\nRed\nProhibition sign\nDangerous behaviour\nDanger alarm\nStop, shutdown, emergency cutout devices Evacuate\nFire-fighting equipment\nIdentification and location\nYellow or Amber\nWarning sign\nBe careful, take precautions\nExamine\nBlue\nMandatory sign\nSpecific behaviour or action\nWear personal protective equipment\nGreen\nEmergency escape, first aid sign\nDoors, exits, routes, equipment, facilities\nNo danger\nReturn to normal\n5.   The effectiveness of a sign must not be adversely affected by:\n5.1.\nthe presence of another emission source of the same type which interferes with visibility or audibility; therefore, in particular,\n5.1.1.\nthe placing of too many signs too close together should be avoided;\n5.1.2.\ntwo illuminated signs which are likely to be confused are not to be used at the same time;\n5.1.3.\nan illuminated sign is not to be used in the proximity of another similar illuminated source;\n5.1.4.\ntwo acoustic signals are not to be used at the same time;\n5.1.5.\nan acoustic signal is not be used if there is too much ambient noise;\n5.2.\npoor design, insufficient number, incorrect positioning, poor state of repair or incorrect functioning of the signs or signalling devices.\n6.   Depending on requirements, signs and signalling devices must be cleaned, maintained, checked, repaired, and if necessary replaced on a regular basis to ensure that they retain their intrinsic and/or functional qualitities.\n7.   The number and positioning of signs or signalling devices to be installed will depend on the extent of the hazards or dangers or on the zone to be covered.\n8.   Signs requiring some form of power must be provided with a guaranteed emergency supply in the event of a power cut, unless the hazard has thereby been eliminated.\n9.   The triggering of an illuminated sign and/or acoustic signal indicates when the required action should start, the sign or signal must be activated for as long as the action requires.\nIlluminated signs and acoustic signals must be reactivated immediately after use.\n10.   Illuminated signs and acoustic signals must be checked to ensure that they function correctly and that they are effective before they are put into service and subsequently at sufficiently frequent intervals.\n11.   If the hearing or the sight of the workers concerned is impaired, including impairment caused by the wearing of personal protective equipment, measures must be taken to supplement or replace the signs concerned.\n12.   Areas, rooms or enclosures used for the storage of significant quantities of dangerous substances or preparations must be indicated by a suitable warning sign taken from section 3.2. of Annex II, or marked as provided in section 1 of Annex III, unless the labelling of the individual packages or containers is adequate for this purpose.\nANNEX II\nMINIUM GENERAL REQUIREMENTS CONCERNING SIGNBOARDS\n1.   Intrinsic features\n1.1.\nThe shape and colours of signboards are set out in section 3, in accordance with their specific object (signboards indicating a prohibition, a warning, a mandatory action, an escape route, an emergency or fire-fighting equipment).\n1.2.\nPictograms must be as simple as possible and should contain only essential details.\n1.3.\nThe pictograms used may be slightly different from or more detailed than those shown in section 3, provided that they convey the same meaning and that no difference or adaptation obscures the meaning.\n1.4.\nSignboards are to be made of shock and weather-resistant material suitable for the surrounding environment.\n1.5.\nThe dimensions and colorimetric and photometric features of signoboards must be such that they can be easily seen and understood.\n2.

Signs for obstacles and dangerous locations\n1.1.\nPlaces where there is a risk of colliding with obstacles, of falling or of objects falling should be marked with alternating yellow and black, or red and white stripes in built-up zones in the undertaking to which workers have access during their work.\n1.2.\nThe dimensions of the markings must be commensurate with the scale of the obstacle or dangerous location in question.\n1.3.\nThe yellow and black or red and white stripes must be at an angle of approximately 45o and of more or less equal size.\n1.4.\nExample:\n2.   Marking of traffic routes\n2.1.\nWhere the use and equipment of rooms so requires for the protection of workers, traffic routes for vehicles must be clearly identified by continous stripes in a clearly visible colour, preferably white or yellow, taking into account the colour of the ground.\n2.2.\nThe stripes must be located so as to indicate the necessary safe distance between the vehicles and any object which may be near by, and between pedestrians and vehicles.\n2.3.\nPermanent traffic routes in built-up areas outdoors should, as far as is practicable, be similarly marked, unless they are provided with suitable barriers or pavements.\nANNEX VI\nMINIMUM REQUIREMENTS FOR ILLUMINATED SIGNS\n1.   Intrinsic features\n1.1.\nThe light emitted by a sign must produce a luminous contrast which is appropriate to its environment, in accordance with the intended conditions of use of the sign, but without producing glare for an excessive amount of light or poor visibility as a result of insufficient light.\n1.2.\nThe luminous area emitting a sign may be of a single colour or contain a pictogram on a specified background.\n1.3.\nThe single colour must correspond to the table of colours and their meanings set out in section 4 of Annex I.\n1.4.\nLikewise, when the sign contains a pictogram, the latter must comply with all the relevant rules set out in Annex II.\n2.   Specific rules governing use\n2.1.\nIf a device can emit both continuous and intermittent signs, the intermittent sign should be used to indicate a higher level of danger or a more urgent need for the requested/imposed intervention or action than is indicated by the continuous sign.\nThe duration of each flash and the frequency of the flashers of an intermittent illuminated sign must be such as to\n—\nensure the proper perception of the message, and\n—\navoid any confusion either between different illuminated signs or with a continuous illuminated sign.\n2.2.\nIf a flashing sign is used instead of — or together with — an acoustic signal, identical codes must be used.\n2.3.\nDevices for emitting flashing signs in the event of grave danger must be under special surveillance or be fitted with an auxiliary lamp.\nANNEX VII\nMINIMUM REQUIREMENTS FOR ACOUSTIC SIGNS\n1.   Intrinsic features\n1.1.\nAcoustic signals must:\n(a)\nhave a sound level which is considerably higher than the level of ambient noise, so that it is audible without being excessive or painful;\n(b)\nbe easily recognizable, particularly in terms of pulse length and the interval between pulses or groups of pulses, and be clearly distinct from any other acoustic signal and ambient noises.\n1.2.\nIf a device can emit an acoustic signal at variable and constant frequencies, the variable frequency should be used to indicate a higher level of danger or a more urgent need for the requested/imposed intervention or action in relation to the stable frequency.\n2.   Code\nThe signal for evacuation must be continuous.\nANNEX VIII\nMINIMUM REQUIREMENTS FOR VERBAL COMMUNICATION\n1.   Intrinsic features\n1.1.\nVerbal communication between a speaker or emitter and one or more hearers is to take the form of (sometimes coded) short texts, phrases, groups of words and/or individual words.\n1.2.\nSpoken messages are to be as short, simple and clear as possible; the verbal skills of the speaker and the hearing abilities of the hearer(s) must be such as to ensure reliable verbal communication.\n1.3.\nVerbal communication is direct (by means of the human voice) or indirect (by means of a human or artificial voice which is broadcast by whatever means is appropriate).\n2.   Specific rules governing use\n2.1.\nThe persons involved must have a good knowledge of the language used so that they are able to pronounce and understand the spoken message correctly and consequently behave in a way which is appropriate to health and /or safety.\n2.2.\nIf verbal communication is used instead of — or together with — gestures, code words should be used such as:\n—\nstart\nto indicate the start of a command\n—\nstop\nto interrupt or end a movement\n—\nend\nto stop the operation\n—\nraise\nto have a load raised\n—\nlower\nto have a load lowered\n—\nforwards\nto be coordinated with the corresponding hand signals\n—\nbackwards\n—\nright\n—\nleft\n—\ndanger\nfor an emergency stop\n—\nquickly\nto speed up a movement for safety reasons.\nANNEX IX\nMINIMUM REQUIREMENTS FOR HAND SIGNALS\n1.   Features\nHand signals must be precise, simple, expansive, easy to make and to understand, and clearly distinct from other such signals.\nWhere both arms are used at the same time, they must be moved symmetrically and for giving one sign only.\nProvided that they fulfil the conditions given above, the signals used may vary slightly from or be more detailed than those shown in section 3; they must, however, be equally meaningful and comprehensible.\n2.   Specific rules governing use\n2.1.\nThe person giving the signs, hereinafter referred to as the ‘signalman’, will use arm/hand movements to give manoeuvring instructions to the person receiving the signs, hereinafter referred to as the (operator).\n2.2.\nThe signalman must be able to monitor all manoeuvres visually without being endangered thereby.\n2.3.\nThe signalman's duties must consist exclusively of directing manoeuvres and ensuring the safety of workers in the vicinity.\n2.4.\nIf the conditions described in point 2.2 are not fulfilled, one or more extra singnalmen should be deployed.\n2.5.\nThe operator must interrupt the ongoing manoeuvre in order to request new instructions when he is unable to carry out the orders he has received with the necessary safety guarantees.\n2.6.\nAccessories:\nThe operator must be able to recognize the signalman without difficulty.\nThe signalman is to wear one or more appropriate distinctive items, e.g. a jacket, helmet, sleeves or armbandds, or carry bats.\nThe distinctive items are to be brightly coloured, preferably all of the same colour and for the exclusive use of signalmen.\n3.
