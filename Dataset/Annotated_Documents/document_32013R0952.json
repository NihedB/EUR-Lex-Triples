{"celex_id": "32013R0952", "reference": "10.10.2013\nEN\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\nL 269/1\nREGULATION (EU) No 952/2013 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL\nof 9 October 2013\nlaying down the Union Customs Code\n(recast)\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Articles 33, 114 and 207 thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee (1),\nActing in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure (2),\nWhereas:\n(1)\nA number of amendments are to be made to Regulation (EC) No 450/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 April 2008 laying down the Community Customs Code (Modernised Customs Code) (3). In the interests of clarity, that Regulation should be recast.\n(2)\nIt is appropriate to ensure that Regulation (EC) No 450/2008 is consistent with the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), in particular Articles 290 and 291 thereof. It is also appropriate that the Regulation take account of the evolution of Union law and that some of its provisions are adapted in order to facilitate their application.\n(3)\nIn order to supplement or amend certain non-essential elements of this Regulation, the power to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 TFEU should be delegated to the Commission. It is of particular importance that the Commission carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level. The Commission, when preparing and drawing up delegated acts, should ensure a simultaneous, timely and appropriate transmission of relevant documents to the European Parliament and to the Council.\n(4)\nIn particular, when preparing and drawing up delegated acts, the Commission should ensure that Member States' experts and the business community are consulted in a transparent manner, and well in advance.\n(5)\nIn order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of this Regulation, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission in order: to specify the format and code of the common data requirements for the purpose of the exchange of information between the customs authorities and between economic operators and customs authorities and the storage of such information and the procedural rules on the exchange and storage of information which can be made by means other than electronic data-processing techniques; to adopt decisions allowing one or several Member States to use means for the exchange and storage of information other than electronic data-processing techniques; to specify the customs authority which is responsible for the registration of economic operators and of other persons;

to adopt the modalities for the application of the criteria for the granting of the status of authorised economic operator; to adopt measures to ensure uniform application of customs controls, including the exchange of risk information and analysis,\ncommon risk criteria and standards, control measures and priority control areas; to determine the ports or airports where customs controls and formalities are to be carried out on cabin and hold baggage; to lay down the rules on currency conversion; to adopt measures on the uniform management of tariff quota and tariff ceilings and the management of the surveillance of the release for free circulation or export of goods; to adopt measures to determine the tariff classification of goods; to specify the procedural rules on the provision and the verification of the proof of non-preferential origin; the procedural rules on the facilitation of the establishment in the Union of the preferential origin of goods; to adopt measures to determine the origin of specific goods; the granting of a temporary derogation from the rules on preferential origin of goods benefiting from preferential measures adopted unilaterally by the Union; the determination of the origin of specific goods;\nto specify the procedural rules on the determination of the customs value of goods; to specify the procedural rules on the provision of a guarantee, the determination of its amount, its monitoring and release and the revocation and cancellation of an undertaking given by a guarantor; to specify the procedural rules regarding temporary prohibitions of the use of comprehensive guarantees; to adopt measures to ensure mutual assistance between the customs authorities in the event of the incurrence of a customs debt;

the procedural rules on the lodging, amendment and invalidation of the temporary storage declaration and on the movement of goods in temporary storage; the procedural rules for the provision and verification of the proof of the customs status of Union goods; the procedural rules on the determination of competent customs offices and on the lodging of the customs declaration where other means than electronic data processing techniques are used; the procedural rules on the lodging of a standard customs declaration and on the making available of supporting documents; the procedural rules on the lodging of a simplified declaration and a supplementary declaration; the procedural rules on the lodging of a customs declaration prior to the presentation of goods to customs, the acceptance of the customs declaration and the amendment of the customs declaration after the release of the goods; to adopt measures for the determination of the tariff subheading of the goods which are subject to the highest rate of import or export duty where a consignment is made of goods falling under different tariff subheadings;

the procedural rules on the placing of goods under the Union transit procedure and on the end of that procedure, on the operation of the simplifications of that procedure and on the customs supervision of goods passing through the territory of a country or territory outside the customs territory of the Union under the external Union transit procedure; the procedural rules on the placing of goods under the customs warehousing or free zone procedure; to lay down the time-limit within which risk analysis is to be carried out on the basis of the pre-departure declaration; to specify the procedural rules on the exit of goods;\nthe procedural rules on the lodging, amendment and invalidation of the exit summary declaration; the procedural rules on the lodging, amendment and invalidation of the re-export notification; to adopt a work programme supporting the development of related electronic systems and governing the setting up of transitional periods; to adopt decisions authorising Member States to test simplifications in the application of the customs legislation, especially when those simplifications are information technology (IT) related. Those powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 February 2011 laying down the rules and general principles concerning mechanisms for control by Member States of the Commission's exercise of implementing powers (4).\n(6)\nConsidering the cooperation which is needed between the Member States and the Commission to develop, maintain and employ the electronic systems required for the implementation of the Union Customs Code (the Code), the Commission should not adopt the work programme supporting that development and governing the setting up of transitional periods where no opinion is delivered by the committee examining the draft implementing act.\n(7)\nThe advisory procedure should be used for the adoption of: decisions allowing one or several Member States to use means for the exchange and storage of information other than electronic data-processing techniques, given that those decisions do not affect all Member States; decisions requesting Member States to revoke decisions relating to binding information, given that those decisions affect only one Member State and aim at ensuring compliance with the customs legislation; decisions on repayment or remission of an amount of import or export duty given that those decisions directly affect the applicant for that repayment or remission.\n(8)\nIn duly justified cases, where imperative grounds of urgency so require, the Commission should adopt immediately applicable implementing acts relating to: measures to ensure uniform application of customs controls, including the exchange of risk information and analysis, common risk criteria and standards, control measures and priority control areas; the determination of the tariff classification of goods; the determination of the origin of specific goods; measures temporarily prohibiting the use of comprehensive guarantees.\n(9)\nThe Union is based upon a customs union. It is advisable, in the interests both of economic operators and of the customs authorities in the Union, to assemble current customs legislation in a code. Based on the concept of an internal market, that code should contain the general rules and procedures which ensure the implementation of the tariff and other common policy measures introduced at Union level in connection with trade in goods between the Union and countries or territories outside the customs territory of the Union, taking into account the requirements of those common policies. Customs legislation should be better aligned on the provisions relating to the collection of import charges without change to the scope of the tax provisions in force.\n(10)\nIn order to ensure effective administrative simplification, the views of economic operators should be taken into account when the customs legislation is further modernised.\n(11)\nIn accordance with the Commission Communication of 9 August 2004 entitled \"Protecting the Communities' financial interests - Fight against fraud - Action Plan for 2004-2005\", it is appropriate to adapt the legal framework for the protection of the financial interests of the Union.\n(12)\nCouncil Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 of 12 October 1992 establishing the Community Customs Code (5) was based upon integration of the customs procedures applied separately in the respective Member States during the 1980s. That Regulation has been repeatedly and substantially amended since its introduction, in order to address specific problems such as the protection of good faith or the taking into account of security requirements. Further amendments to that Regulation were introduced by Regulation (EC) No 648/2005 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 April 2005 (6) - and subsequently included in Regulation (EC) No 450/2008 - as a consequence of the important legal changes which have occurred in recent years, at both Union and international level, such as the expiry of the Treaty establishing the European Coal and Steel Community and the entry into force of the 2003, 2005 and 2011 Acts of Accession, as well as the amendment to the International Convention on the simplification and harmonisation of customs procedures (the Revised Kyoto Convention), the Union's accession to which was approved by Council Decision 2003/231/EC of 17 March 2003 (7).\n(13)\nIt is appropriate to introduce in the Code a legal framework for the application of certain provisions of the customs legislation to trade in Union goods between parts of the customs territory to which the provisions of Council Directive 2006/112/EC of 28 November 2006 on the common system of value added tax (8) or Council Directive 2008/118/EC of 16 December 2008 concerning the general arrangements for excise duty (9) apply and parts of that territory where those provisions do not apply, or to trade between parts where those provisions do not apply. Considering the fact that the goods concerned are Union goods and considering the fiscal nature of the measures at stake in that intra-Union trade, it is justified to introduce, appropriate simplifications to the customs formalities to be applied to those goods.\n(14)\nIn order to take into account the special fiscal regime of certain parts of the customs territory of the Union, the power to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 TFEU should be delegated to the Commission in respect of the customs formalities and controls to be applied to the trade in Union goods between those parts and the rest of the customs territory of the Union.\n(15)\nThe facilitation of legitimate trade and the fight against fraud require simple, rapid and standard customs procedures and processes. It is therefore appropriate, in line with the Commission Communication of 24 July 2003 entitled \"A simple and paperless environment for customs and trade\", to simplify customs legislation, to allow the use of modern tools and technology and to promote further the uniform application of customs legislation and modernised approaches to customs control, thus helping to ensure the basis for efficient and simple clearance procedures. Customs procedures should be merged or aligned and the number of procedures reduced to those that are economically justified, with a view to increasing the competitiveness of business.\n(16)\nThe completion of the internal market, the reduction of barriers to international trade and investment and the reinforced need to ensure security and safety at the external borders of the Union have transformed the role of customs authorities giving them a leading role within the supply chain and, in their monitoring and management of international trade, making them a catalyst to the competitiveness of countries and companies. The customs legislation should therefore reflect the new economic reality and the new role and mission of customs authorities.\n(17)\nThe use of information and communication technologies, as laid down in Decision No 70/2008/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 January 2008 on a paperless environment for customs and trade (10), is a key element in ensuring trade facilitation and, at the same time, the effectiveness of customs controls, thus reducing costs for business and risk for society. It is therefore necessary to establish in the Code the legal framework within which that Decision can be implemented, in particular the legal principle that all customs and trade transactions are to be handled electronically and that information and communication systems for customs operations are to offer, in each Member State, the same facilities to economic operators.\n(18)\nIn order to ensure a paperless environment for customs and trade, the power to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 TFEU should be delegated to the Commission in respect of common data requirements for the purpose of the exchange and storage of information using electronic data processing techniques, cases where other means may be used for such exchange and storage and registration of persons. Means other than electronic data processing techniques could be used in particular on a transitional basis, where the necessary electronic systems are not yet operational, but not beyond 31 December 2020. Insofar as centralised clearance is concerned, those transitional measures would consist, until the necessary electronic systems are operational, in maintaining the procedure currently known as the 'single authorisation for simplified procedures'.\n(19)\nUse of information and communication technologies should be accompanied by harmonised and standardised application of customs controls by the Member States, to ensure an equivalent level of customs control throughout the Union so as not to give rise to anti-competitive behaviour at the various Union entry and exit points.\n(20)\nIn the interests of facilitating business, while at the same time providing for the proper levels of control of goods brought into or taken out of the customs territory of the Union, it is desirable that the information provided by economic operators be shared, taking account of the relevant data-protection provisions, between customs authorities and with other agencies involved in that control. Those controls should be harmonised, so that the economic operator need give the information only once and that goods are controlled by those authorities at the same time and at the same place.\n(21)\nIn the interests of facilitating business, all persons should continue to have the right to appoint a representative in their dealings with the customs authorities. However, it should no longer be possible for that right of representation to be reserved under a law laid down by one of the Member States. Furthermore, a customs representative who complies with the criteria for the granting of the status of authorised economic operator for customs simplifications should be entitled to provide his or her services in a Member State other than the Member State where he or she is established. As a general rule, a customs representative should be established in the customs territory of the Union. That obligation should be waived where the customs representative acts on behalf of persons who are not required to be established within the customs territory of the Union or in other justified cases.\n(22)\nAll decisions relating to the application of the customs legislation, including to binding information, should be covered by the same rules. Any such decisions should be valid throughout the Union and should be capable of being annulled, amended except where otherwise stipulated, or revoked where they do not conform to the customs legislation or its interpretation.\n(23)\nThe streamlining of customs procedures within an electronic environment requires the sharing of responsibilities between the customs authorities of different Member States. It is necessary to ensure an appropriate level of effective, dissuasive and proportionate penalties throughout the internal market.\n(24)\nCompliant and trustworthy economic operators should enjoy the status of 'authorised economic operator' subject to the granting of an authorisation for customs simplifications or an authorisation for security and safety, or both. Depending on the type of authorisation granted, authorised economic operators should be able to take maximum advantage of widespread use of customs simplifications or benefit from facilitations relating to security and safety. They should also be given more favourable treatment in respect of customs controls, such as fewer physical and document-based controls.\n(25)\nCompliant and trustworthy economic operators should benefit from international mutual recognition of the status of 'authorised economic operator'.\n(26)\nIn order to secure a balance between, on the one hand, the need for customs authorities to ensure the correct application of the customs legislation and, on the other, the right of economic operators to be treated fairly, the customs authorities should be granted extensive powers of control and economic operators a right of appeal.\n(27)\nIn accordance with the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, it is necessary, in addition to the right of appeal against any decision taken by the customs authorities, to provide for the right of every person to be heard before any decision is taken which would adversely affect him or her. However, restrictions to that right may be justified in particular where the nature or the level of the threat to the security and safety of the Union and its residents, to human, animal or plant health, to the environment or to consumers so requires.\n(28)\nIn order to minimise the risk to the Union, its citizens and its trading partners, the harmonised application of customs controls by the Member States should be based upon a common risk management framework and an electronic system for its implementation. The establishment of a risk management framework common to all Member States should not prevent them from controlling goods by random checks.\n(29)\nIn order to ensure a consistent and equal treatment of persons concerned by customs formalities and controls, the power to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 TFEU should be delegated to the Commission in respect of determining other cases where the customs representative is not obliged to be established in the customs territory of the Union and rules relating to decisions taken by the customs authorities, including those relating to binding information, authorised economic operator and simplifications.\n(30)\nIt is necessary to establish the factors on the basis of which import or export duty and other measures in respect of trade in goods are applied. It is also appropriate to lay down more detailed provisions for issuing proofs of origin in the Union, where the exigencies of trade so require.\n(31)\nIn order to supplement the factors on the basis of which import or export duty and other measures are applied, the power to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 TFEU should be delegated to the Commission in respect of rules on origin of goods.\n(32)\nIt is desirable to group together all cases of incurrence of a customs debt on import, other than following the submission of a customs declaration for release for free circulation or temporary admission with partial relief, in order to avoid difficulties in determining the legal basis on which the customs debt was incurred. The same should apply in cases of incurrence of a customs debt on export.\n(33)\nIt is appropriate to establish the place where the customs debt is incurred and where the import or export duty should be recovered.\n(34)\nThe rules for special procedures should allow for the use of a single guarantee for all categories of special procedures and for that guarantee to be comprehensive, covering a number of transactions.\n(35)\nA comprehensive guarantee with a reduced amount, including for customs debts and other charges which have been incurred, or a comprehensive guarantee with a guarantee waiver, should be authorised under certain conditions. A comprehensive guarantee with a reduced amount for customs debts and other charges which have been incurred should be equivalent to the provision of a guarantee for the whole amount of import or export duty payable, in particular for the purposes of the release of the goods concerned and of the entry in the accounts.\n(36)\nIn order to ensure better protection of the financial interests of the Union and of the Member States, a guarantee should cover non-declared or incorrectly declared goods included in a consignment or in a declaration for which it is provided. For the same reason, the undertaking of the guarantor should also cover amounts of import or export duty which fall to be paid following post-release controls.\n(37)\nIn order to safeguard the financial interests of the Union and of the Member States and to curb fraudulent practices, arrangements involving graduated measures for the application of a comprehensive guarantee are advisable. Where there is an increased risk of fraud it should be possible to prohibit temporarily the application of the comprehensive guarantee, taking account of the particular situation of the economic operators concerned.\n(38)\nIt is appropriate to take account of the good faith of the person concerned in cases where a customs debt is incurred through non-compliance with the customs legislation and to minimise the impact of negligence on the part of the debtor.\n(39)\nIn order to protect the financial interests of the Union and of the Member States and to supplement the rules concerning the customs debt and the guarantees, the power to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 TFEU should be delegated to the Commission in respect of the place of incurrence of the customs debt, the calculation of the amount of import and export duty, the guarantee of that amount and the recovery, repayment, remission and extinguishment of the customs debt.\n(40)\nIt is necessary to lay down the principle of how to determine the customs status of Union goods and the circumstances pertaining to the loss of such status, and to provide a basis for determining when that status remains unaltered in cases where goods are temporarily taken out of the customs territory of the Union.\n(41)\nIn order to ensure free movement of Union goods in the customs territory of the Union and customs treatment of non-Union goods brought into that territory, the power to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 TFEU should be delegated to the Commission in respect of the determination of the customs status of goods, the loss of the customs status of Union goods, the preservation of that status for goods temporarily leaving the customs territory of the Union and the duty relief for returned goods.\n(42)\nIt is appropriate, where an economic operator has provided, in advance, the information necessary for risk-based controls on the admissibility of the goods, to ensure that quick release of goods is then the rule. Fiscal and trade policy controls should primarily be performed by the customs office competent in respect of the premises of the economic operator.\n(43)\nThe rules for customs declarations and for the placing of goods under a customs procedure should be modernised and streamlined, in particular by requiring that, as a rule, customs declarations be made electronically and by providing for only one type of simplified declaration and for the possibility to lodge a customs declaration in the form of an entry in the declarant's records.\n(44)\nSince the Revised Kyoto Convention favours the lodging, registering and checking of the customs declaration prior to the arrival of the goods and, furthermore, the dissociation of the place where the declaration is lodged from the place where the goods are physically located, it is appropriate to provide for centralised clearance at the place where the economic operator is established.\n(45)\nIt is appropriate to lay down at Union level the rules governing the destruction or disposal otherwise of goods by the customs authorities, since these are matters which previously required national legislation.\n(46)\nIn order to supplement the rules regarding the placing of goods under a customs procedure and ensure equal treatment of the persons concerned, the power to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 TFEU should be delegated to the Commission in respect of the rules relating to the customs declaration and the release of goods.\n(47)\nIt is appropriate to lay down common and simple rules for the special procedures, supplemented by a small set of rules for each category of special procedure, in order to make it simple for the operator to choose the right procedure, to avoid errors and to reduce the number of post-release recoveries and repayments.\n(48)\nThe granting of authorisations for several special procedures with a single guarantee and a single supervising customs office should be facilitated and there should be simple rules on the incurrence of a customs debt in these cases. The basic principle should be that goods placed under a special procedure, or the products made from them, are to be assessed at the time when the customs debt is incurred. However, it should also be possible, where economically justified, to assess the goods at the time when they were placed under a special procedure. The same principles should apply to usual forms of handling.\n(49)\nIn view of increased security-related measures, the placing of goods into free zones should become a customs procedure and the goods should be subject to customs controls at entry and with regard to records.\n(50)\nGiven that the intention of re-export is no longer necessary, the inward processing suspension procedure should be merged with processing under customs control and the inward processing drawback procedure abandoned. This single inward processing procedure should also cover destruction, except where destruction is carried out by, or under the supervision of, customs.\n(51)\nIn order to supplement the rules on special procedures and ensure equal treatment of the persons concerned, the power to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 TFEU should be delegated to the Commission in respect of the rules relating to cases where goods are placed under special procedures, movements, usual forms of handling and equivalence of those goods and discharge of those procedures.\n(52)\nSecurity-related measures relating to Union goods taken out of the customs territory of the Union should apply equally to the re-export of non-Union goods. The same rules should apply to all types of goods, with the possibility of exceptions where necessary, such as for goods only transiting through the customs territory of the Union.\n(53)\nIn order to ensure the customs supervision of goods brought into and taken out of the customs territory of the Union and the application of security-related measures, the power to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 TFEU should be delegated to the Commission in respect of the rules relating to entry summary declaration and pre-departure declarations.\n(54)\nIn order to explore further customs and trade facilitation, in particular by making use of the most recent tools and technology, Member States should be authorised, under certain conditions and upon application, to test for a limited period of time simplifications in the application of the customs legislation. That possibility should not jeopardise the application of the customs legislation or create new obligations for economic operators, who may take part in these tests on a purely voluntary basis.\n(55)\nIn accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union (TEU), it is necessary and appropriate, for the achievement of the basic objectives of enabling the customs union to function effectively and implementing the common commercial policy, to lay down the general rules and procedures applicable to goods brought into or taken out of the customs territory of the Union. In accordance with the first subparagraph of Article 5(4) TEU, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives.\n(56)\nIn order to simplify and rationalise customs legislation, a number of provisions contained in autonomous Union acts have, for the sake of transparency, been incorporated into the Code.

Where point (b) of paragraph 1 or paragraphs 2, 7 or 8 apply, a BTI or BOI decision may still be used in respect of binding contracts which were based upon that decision and were concluded before it ceased to be valid or was revoked. That extended use shall not apply where a BOI decision is taken for goods to be exported.\nThe extended use referred to in the first subparagraph shall not exceed six months from the date on which the BTI or BOI decision ceases to be valid or is revoked. However, a measure referred to in Article 57(4) or in Article 67 may exclude that extended use or lay down a shorter period of time. In the case of products for which an import or export certificate is submitted when customs formalities are carried out, the period of six months shall be replaced by the period of validity of the certificate.\nIn order to benefit from the extended use of a BTI or BOI decision, the holder of that decision shall lodge an application to the customs authority that took the decision within 30 days of the date on which it ceases to be valid or is revoked, indicating the quantities for which a period of extended use is requested and the Member State or Member States in which goods will be cleared under the period of extended use. That customs authority shall take a decision on the extended use and notify the holder, without delay, and at the latest within 30 days of the date on which it receives all the information required in order to enable it to take that decision.\n10.   The Commission shall notify the customs authorities where:\n(a)\nthe taking of BTI and BOI decisions, for goods whose correct and uniform tariff classification or determination of origin is not ensured, is suspended; or\n(b)\nthe suspension referred to in point (a) is withdrawn.\n11.

An economic operator who is established in the customs territory of the Union and who meets the criteria set out in Article 39 may apply for the status of authorised economic operator.\nThe customs authorities shall, following consultation with other competent authorities if necessary, grant that status, which shall be subject to monitoring.\n2.   The status of authorised economic operator shall consist in the following types of authorisations:\n(a)\nthat of an authorised economic operator for customs simplifications, which shall enable the holder to benefit from certain simplifications in accordance with the customs legislation; or\n(b)\nthat of an authorised economic operator for security and safety that shall entitle the holder to facilitations relating to security and safety.\n3.   Both types of authorisations referred to in paragraph 2 may be held at the same time.\n4.   The status of authorised economic operator shall, subject to Articles 39, 40 and 41, be recognised by the customs authorities in all Member States.\n5.   Customs authorities shall, on the basis of the recognition of the status of authorised economic operator for customs simplifications and provided that the requirements related to a specific type of simplification provided for in the customs legislation are fulfilled, authorise the operator to benefit from that simplification. Customs authorities shall not re-examine those criteria which have already been examined when granting the status of authorised economic operator.\n6.   The authorised economic operator referred to in paragraph 2 shall enjoy more favourable treatment than other economic operators in respect of customs controls according to the type of authorisation granted, including fewer physical and document-based controls.\n7.   The customs authorities shall grant benefits resulting from the status of authorised economic operator to persons established in countries or territories outside the customs territory of the Union, who fulfil conditions and comply with obligations defined by the relevant legislation of those countries or territories, insofar as those conditions and obligations are recognised by the Union as equivalent to those imposed to authorised economic operators established in the customs territory of the Union. Such a granting of benefits shall be based on the principle of reciprocity unless otherwise decided by the Union, and shall be supported by an international agreement or Union legislation in the area of the common commercial policy.\nArticle 39\nGranting of status\nThe criteria for the granting of the status of authorised economic operator shall be the following:\n(a)\nthe absence of any serious infringement or repeated infringements of customs legislation and taxation rules, including no record of serious criminal offences relating to the economic activity of the applicant;\n(b)\nthe demonstration by the applicant of a high level of control of his or her operations and of the flow of goods, by means of a system of managing commercial and, where appropriate, transport records, which allows appropriate customs controls;\n(c)\nfinancial solvency, which shall be deemed to be proven where the applicant has good financial standing, which enables him or her to fulfil his or her commitments, with due regard to the characteristics of the type of business activity concerned;\n(d)\nwith regard to the authorisation referred to in point (a) of Article 38(2), practical standards of competence or professional qualifications directly related to the activity carried out; and\n(e)\nwith regard to the authorisation referred to in point (b) of Article 38(2), appropriate security and safety standards, which shall be considered as fulfilled where the applicant demonstrates that he or she maintains appropriate measures to ensure the security and safety of the international supply chain including in the areas of physical integrity and access controls, logistical processes and handling of specific types of goods, personnel and identification of his or her business partners.\nArticle 40\nDelegation of power\nThe Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts, in accordance with Article 284, in order to determine the following:\n(a)\nthe simplifications referred to in point (a) of Article 38(2);\n(b)\nthe facilitations referred to in point (b) of Article 38(2);\n(c)\nthe more favourable treatment referred to in Article 38(6).\nArticle 41\nConferral of implementing powers\nThe Commission shall adopt, by means of implementing acts, the modalities for the application of the criteria referred to in Article 39.\nThose implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 285(4).\nSection 5\nPenalties\nArticle 42\nApplication of penalties\n1.   Each Member State shall provide for penalties for failure to comply with the customs legislation. Such penalties shall be effective, proportionate and dissuasive.\n2.   Where administrative penalties are applied, they may take, inter alia, one or both of the following forms:\n(a)\na pecuniary charge by the customs authorities, including, where appropriate, a settlement applied in place of and in lieu of a criminal penalty;\n(b)\nthe revocation, suspension or amendment of any authorisation held by the person concerned.\n3.   Member States shall notify the Commission, within 180 days from the date of application of this Article, as determined in accordance with Article 288(2), of the national provisions in force, as envisaged in paragraph 1 of this Article, and shall notify it without delay of any subsequent amendment affecting those provisions.\nSection 6\nAppeals\nArticle 43\nDecisions taken by a judicial authority\nArticles 44 and 45 shall not apply to appeals lodged with a view to the annulment, revocation or amendment of a decision relating to the application of the customs legislation taken by a judicial authority, or by customs authorities acting as judicial authorities.\nArticle 44\nRight of appeal\n1.   Any person shall have the right to appeal against any decision taken by the customs authorities relating to the application of the customs legislation which concerns him or her directly and individually.\nAny person who has applied to the customs authorities for a decision and has not obtained a decision on that application within the time-limits referred to in Article 22(3) shall also be entitled to exercise the right of appeal.\n2.   The right of appeal may be exercised in at least two steps:\n(a)\ninitially, before the customs authorities or a judicial authority or other body designated for that purpose by the Member States;\n(b)\nsubsequently, before a higher independent body, which may be a judicial authority or an equivalent specialised body, according to the provisions in force in the Member States.\n3.   The appeal shall be lodged in the Member State where the decision was taken or was applied for.\n4.   Member States shall ensure that the appeals procedure enables the prompt confirmation or correction of decisions taken by the customs authorities.\nArticle 45\nSuspension of implementation\n1.   The submission of an appeal shall not cause implementation of the disputed decision to be suspended.\n2.   The customs authorities shall, however, suspend implementation of such a decision in whole or in part where they have good reason to believe that the disputed decision is inconsistent with the customs legislation or that irreparable damage is to be feared for the person concerned.\n3.   In the cases referred to in paragraph 2, where the disputed decision has the effect of causing import or export duty to be payable, suspension of implementation of that decision shall be conditional upon the provision of a guarantee, unless it is established, on the basis of a documented assessment, that such a guarantee would be likely to cause the debtor serious economic or social difficulties.\nSection 7\nControl of goods\nArticle 46\nRisk management and customs controls\n1.   The customs authorities may carry out any customs controls they deem necessary.\nCustoms controls may in particular consist of examining goods, taking samples, verifying the accuracy and completeness of the information given in a declaration or notification and the existence, authenticity, accuracy and validity of documents, examining the accounts of economic operators and other records, inspecting means of transport, inspecting luggage and other goods carried by or on persons and carrying out official enquiries and other similar acts.\n2.   Customs controls, other than random checks, shall primarily be based on risk analysis using electronic data-processing techniques, with the purpose of identifying and evaluating the risks and developing the necessary counter-measures, on the basis of criteria developed at national, Union and, where available, international level.\n3.   Customs controls shall be performed within a common risk management framework, based upon the exchange of risk information and risk analysis results between customs administrations and establishing common risk criteria and standards, control measures and priority control areas.\nControls based upon such information and criteria shall be carried out without prejudice to other controls carried out in accordance with paragraph 1 or with other provisions in force.\n4.   Customs authorities shall undertake risk management to differentiate between the levels of risk associated with goods subject to customs control or supervision and to determine whether the goods will be subject to specific customs controls, and if so, where.\nThe risk management shall include activities such as collecting data and information, analysing and assessing risk, prescribing and taking action and regularly monitoring and reviewing that process and its outcomes, based on international, Union and national sources and strategies.\n5.   Customs authorities shall exchange risk information and risk analysis results where:\n(a)\nthe risks are assessed by a customs authority as being significant and requiring customs control and the results of the control establish that the event triggering the risks has occurred; or\n(b)\nthe control results do not establish that the event triggering the risks has occurred, but the customs authority concerned considers the threat to present a high risk elsewhere in the Union.\n6.   For the establishment of the common risk criteria and standards, the control measures and the priority control areas referred to in paragraph 3, account shall be taken of all of the following:\n(a)\nthe proportionality to the risk;\n(b)\nthe urgency of the necessary application of the controls;\n(c)\nthe probable impact on trade flow, on individual Member States and on control resources.\n7.   The common risk criteria and standards referred to in paragraph 3 shall include all of the following:\n(a)\na description of the risks;\n(b)\nthe factors or indicators of risk to be used to select goods or economic operators for customs control;\n(c)\nthe nature of customs controls to be undertaken by the customs authorities;\n(d)\nthe duration of the application of the customs controls referred to in point (c).\n8.   Priority control areas shall cover particular customs procedures, types of goods, traffic routes, modes of transport or economic operators which are subject to increased levels of risk analysis and customs controls during a certain period, without prejudice to other controls usually carried out by the customs authorities.\nArticle 47\nCooperation between authorities\n1.   Where, in respect of the same goods, controls other than customs controls are to be performed by competent authorities other than the customs authorities, customs authorities shall, in close cooperation with those other authorities, endeavour to have those controls performed, wherever possible, at the same time and place as customs controls (one-stop-shop), with customs authorities having the coordinating role in achieving this.\n2.   In the framework of the controls referred to in this Section, customs and other competent authorities may, where necessary for the purposes of minimising risk and combating fraud, exchange with each other and with the Commission data received in the context of the entry, exit, transit, movement, storage and end-use of goods, including postal traffic, moved between the customs territory of the Union and countries or territories outside the customs territory of the Union, the presence and movement within the customs territory of the Union of non-Union goods and goods placed under the end-use procedure, and the results of any control. Customs authorities and the Commission may also exchange such data with each other for the purpose of ensuring a uniform application of the customs legislation.\nArticle 48\nPost-release control\nFor the purpose of customs controls, the customs authorities may verify the accuracy and completeness of the information given in a customs declaration, temporary storage declaration, entry summary declaration, exit summary declaration, re-export declaration or re-export notification, and the existence, authenticity, accuracy and validity of any supporting document and may examine the accounts of the declarant and other records relating to the operations in respect of the goods in question or to prior or subsequent commercial operations involving those goods after having released them. Those authorities may also examine such goods and/or take samples where it is still possible for them to do so.\nSuch controls may be carried out at the premises of the holder of the goods or of the holder's representative, of any other person directly or indirectly involved in those operations in a business capacity or of any other person in possession of those documents and data for business purposes.\nArticle 49\nIntra-Union flights and sea crossings\n1.   Customs controls or formalities shall be carried out in respect of the cabin and hold baggage of persons either taking an intra-Union flight, or making an intra-Union sea crossing, only where the customs legislation provides for such controls or formalities.\n2.

The customs debt on import or export shall be incurred even if it relates to goods which are subject to measures of prohibition or restriction on import or export of any kind.\n2.   However, no customs debt shall be incurred on either of the following:\n(a)\nthe unlawful introduction into the customs territory of the Union of counterfeit currency;\n(b)\nthe introduction into the customs territory of the Union of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances other than where strictly supervised by the competent authorities with a view to their use for medical and scientific purposes.\n3.   For the purposes of penalties as applicable to customs offences, the customs debt shall nevertheless be deemed to have been incurred where, under the law of a Member State, import or export duty or the existence of a customs debt provide the basis for determining penalties.\nArticle 84\nSeveral debtors\nWhere several persons are liable for payment of the amount of import or export duty corresponding to one customs debt, they shall be jointly and severally liable for payment of that amount.\nArticle 85\nGeneral rules for calculating the amount of import or export duty\n1.   The amount of import or export duty shall be determined on the basis of those rules for calculation of duty which were applicable to the goods concerned at the time at which the customs debt in respect of them was incurred.\n2.   Where it is not possible to determine precisely the time at which the customs debt is incurred, that time shall be deemed to be the time at which the customs authorities conclude that the goods are in a situation in which a customs debt has been incurred.\nHowever, where the information available to the customs authorities enables them to establish that the customs debt had been incurred prior to the time at which they reached that conclusion, the customs debt shall be deemed to have been incurred at the earliest time that such a situation can be established.\nArticle 86\nSpecial rules for calculating the amount of import duty\n1.   Where costs for storage or usual forms of handling have been incurred within the customs territory of the Union in respect of goods placed under a customs procedure or in temporary storage, such costs or the increase in value shall not be taken into account for the calculation of the amount of import duty where satisfactory proof of those costs is provided by the declarant.\nHowever, the customs value, quantity, nature and origin of non-Union goods used in the operations shall be taken into account for the calculation of the amount of import duty.\n2.   Where the tariff classification of goods placed under a customs procedure changes as a result of usual forms of handling within the customs territory of the Union, the original tariff classification for the goods placed under the procedure shall be applied at the request of the declarant.\n3.   Where a customs debt is incurred for processed products resulting from the inward processing procedure, the amount of import duty corresponding to such debt shall, at the request of the declarant, be determined on the basis of the tariff classification, customs value, quantity, nature and origin of the goods placed under the inward processing procedure at the time of acceptance of the customs declaration relating to those goods.\n4.   In specific cases, the amount of import duty shall be determined in accordance with paragraphs 2 and 3 of this Article without a request of the declarant in order to avoid the circumvention of tariff measures referred to in point (h) of Article 56(2).\n5.   Where a customs debt is incurred for processed products resulting from the outward processing procedure or replacement products as referred to in Article 261(1), the amount of import duty shall be calculated on the basis of the cost of the processing operation undertaken outside the customs territory of the Union.\n6.   Where the customs legislation provides for a favourable tariff treatment of goods, or for relief or total or partial exemption from import or export duty pursuant to points (d) to (g) of Article 56(2), Articles 203, 204, 205 and 208 or Articles 259 to 262 of this Regulation or pursuant to Council Regulation (EC) No 1186/2009 of 16 November 2009 setting up a Community system of reliefs from customs duty (15) such favourable tariff treatment, relief or exemption shall also apply in cases where a customs debt is incurred pursuant to Articles 79 or 82 of this Regulation, on condition that the failure which led to the incurrence of a customs debt did not constitute an attempt at deception.\nArticle 87\nPlace where the customs debt is incurred\n1.   A customs debt shall be incurred at the place where the customs declaration or the re-export declaration referred to in Articles 77, 78 and 81 is lodged.\nIn all other cases, the place where a customs debt is incurred shall be the place where the events from which it arises occur.\nIf it is not possible to determine that place, the customs debt shall be incurred at the place where the customs authorities conclude that the goods are in a situation in which a customs debt is incurred.\n2.   If the goods have been placed under a customs procedure which has not been discharged or when a temporary storage did not end properly, and the place where the customs debt is incurred cannot be determined pursuant to the second or third subparagraphs of paragraph 1 within a specific time-limit, the customs debt shall be incurred at the place where the goods were either placed under the procedure concerned or were introduced into the customs territory of the Union under that procedure or were in temporary storage.\n3.   Where the information available to the customs authorities enables them to establish that the customs debt may have been incurred in several places, the customs debt shall be deemed to have been incurred at the place where it was first incurred.\n4.   If a customs authority establishes that a customs debt has been incurred under Article 79 or Article 82 in another Member State and the amount of import or export duty corresponding to that debt is lower than EUR 10 000, the customs debt shall be deemed to have been incurred in the Member State where the finding was made.\nArticle 88\nDelegation of power\nThe Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts, in accordance with Article 284, in order to determine:\n(a)\nthe rules for the calculation of the amount of import or export duty applicable to goods for which a customs debt is incurred in the context of a special procedure, which supplement the rules laid down in Articles 85 and 86;\n(b)\nthe cases referred to in Article 86(4);\n(c)\nthe time-limit referred to in Article 87(2).\nCHAPTER 2\nGuarantee for a potential or existing customs debt\nArticle 89\nGeneral provisions\n1.   This Chapter shall apply to guarantees both for customs debts which have been incurred and for those which may be incurred, unless otherwise specified.\n2.   Where the customs authorities require a guarantee for a potential or existing customs debt to be provided, that guarantee shall cover the amount of import or export duty and the other charges due in connection with the import or export of the goods where:\n(a)\nthe guarantee is used for the placing of goods under the Union transit procedure; or\n(b)\nthe guarantee may be used in more than one Member State.\nA guarantee which may not be used outside the Member State where it is required shall be valid only in that Member State and shall cover at least the amount of import or export duty.\n3.   Where the customs authorities require a guarantee to be provided, it shall be required from the debtor or the person who may become the debtor. They may also permit the guarantee to be provided by a person other than the person from whom it is required.\n4.   Without prejudice to Article 97, the customs authorities shall require only one guarantee to be provided in respect of specific goods or a specific declaration.\nThe guarantee provided for a specific declaration shall apply to the amount of import or export duty corresponding to the customs debt and other charges in respect of all goods covered by or released against that declaration, whether or not that declaration is correct.\nIf the guarantee has not been released, it may also be used, within the limits of the secured amount, for the recovery of amounts of import or export duty and other charges payable following post-release control of those goods.\n5.   Upon application by the person referred to in paragraph 3 of this Article, the customs authorities may, in accordance with Article 95(1), (2) and (3), authorise the provision of a comprehensive guarantee to cover the amount of import or export duty corresponding to the customs debt in respect of two or more operations, declarations or customs procedures.\n6.   The customs authorities shall monitor the guarantee.\n7.   No guarantee shall be required from States, regional and local government authorities or other bodies governed by public law, in respect of the activities in which they engage as public authorities.\n8.   No guarantee shall be required in any of the following situations:\n(a)\ngoods carried on the Rhine, the Rhine waterways, the Danube or the Danube waterways;\n(b)\ngoods carried by a fixed transport installation;\n(c)\nin specific cases where goods are placed under the temporary admission procedure;\n(d)\ngoods placed under the Union transit procedure using the simplification referred to in point (e) of Article 233(4) and carried by sea or air between Union ports or between Union airports.\n9.   The customs authorities may waive the requirement for provision of a guarantee where the amount of import or export duty to be secured does not exceed the statistical value threshold for declarations laid down in Article 3(4) of Regulation (EC) No 471/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 May 2009 on Community statistics relating to external trade with non-member countries (16).\nArticle 90\nCompulsory guarantee\n1.   Where it is compulsory for a guarantee to be provided, the customs authorities shall fix the amount of such guarantee at a level equal to the precise amount of import or export duty corresponding to the customs debt and of other charges where that amount can be established with certainty at the time when the guarantee is required.\nWhere it is not possible to establish the precise amount, the guarantee shall be fixed at the maximum amount, as estimated by the customs authorities, of import or export duty corresponding to the customs debt and of other charges which have been or may be incurred.\n2.   Without prejudice to Article 95 where a comprehensive guarantee is provided for the amount of import or export duty corresponding to customs debts and other charges which vary in amount over time, the amount of such guarantee shall be set at a level enabling the amount of import or export duty corresponding to customs debts and other charges to be covered at all times.\nArticle 91\nOptional guarantee\nWhere the provision of a guarantee is optional, such guarantee shall in any case be required by the customs authorities if they consider that the amount of import or export duty corresponding to a customs debt and other charges are not certain to be paid within the prescribed period. Its amount shall be fixed by those authorities so as not to exceed the level referred to in Article 90.\nArticle 92\nProvision of a guarantee\n1.   A guarantee may be provided in one of the following forms:\n(a)\nby a cash deposit or by any other means of payment recognised by the customs authorities as being equivalent to a cash deposit, made in euro or in the currency of the Member State in which the guarantee is required;\n(b)\nby an undertaking given by a guarantor;\n(c)\nby another form of guarantee which provides equivalent assurance that the amount of import or export duty corresponding to the customs debt and other charges will be paid.\n2.   A guarantee in the form of a cash deposit or any other equivalent means of payment shall be given in accordance with the provisions in force in the Member State in which the guarantee is required.\nWhere a guarantee is given by making a cash deposit or any other equivalent means of payment, no interest thereon shall be payable by the customs authorities.\nArticle 93\nChoice of guarantee\nThe person required to provide a guarantee may choose between the forms of guarantee laid down in Article 92(1).\nHowever, the customs authorities may refuse to accept the form of guarantee chosen where it is incompatible with the proper functioning of the customs procedure concerned.\nThe customs authorities may require that the form of guarantee chosen be maintained for a specific period.\nArticle 94\nGuarantor\n1.   The guarantor referred to in point (b) of Article 92(1) shall be a third person established in the customs territory of the Union. The guarantor shall be approved by the customs authorities requiring the guarantee, unless the guarantor is a credit institution, financial institution or insurance company accredited in the Union in accordance with Union provisions in force.\n2.   The guarantor shall undertake in writing to pay the secured amount of import or export duty corresponding to a customs debt and other charges.\n3.   The customs authorities may refuse to approve the guarantor or the type of guarantee proposed where either does not appear certain to ensure payment within the prescribed period of the amount of import or export duty corresponding to the customs debt and of other charges.\nArticle 95\nComprehensive guarantee\n1.   The authorisation referred to in Article 89(5) shall be granted only to persons who satisfy all of the following conditions:\n(a)\nthey are established in the customs territory of the Union;\n(b)\nthey fulfil the criteria laid down in point (a) of Article 39;\n(c)\nthey are regular users of the customs procedures involved or operators of temporary storage facilities or they fulfil the criteria laid down in point (d) of Article 39.\n2.   Where a comprehensive guarantee is to be provided for customs debts and other charges which may be incurred, an economic operator may be authorised to use a comprehensive guarantee with a reduced amount or to have a guarantee waiver, provided that he or she fulfils the criteria laid down in points (b) and (c) of Article 39.\n3.   Where a comprehensive guarantee is to be provided for customs debts and other charges which have been incurred, an authorised economic operator for customs simplification shall, upon application, be authorised to use a comprehensive guarantee with a reduced amount.\n4.   The comprehensive guarantee with a reduced amount referred to in paragraph 3 shall be equivalent to the provision of a guarantee.\nArticle 96\nTemporary prohibitions relating to the use of comprehensive guarantees\n1.   In the context of special procedures or temporary storage, the Commission may decide to temporarily prohibit recourse to any of the following:\n(a)\nthe comprehensive guarantee for a reduced amount or a guarantee waiver referred to in Article 95(2);\n(b)\nthe comprehensive guarantee referred to in Article 95, in respect of goods which have been identified as being subject to large-scale fraud.\n2.   Where point (a) or point (b) of paragraph 1 of this Article applies, recourse to the comprehensive guarantee for a reduced amount or a guarantee waiver or recourse to the comprehensive guarantee referred to in Article 95 may be authorised where the person concerned fulfils either of the following conditions:\n(a)\nthat person can show that no customs debt has arisen in respect of the goods in question in the course of operations which that person has undertaken in the two years preceding the decision referred to in paragraph 1;\n(b)\nwhere customs debts have arisen in the two years preceding the decision referred to in paragraph 1, the person concerned can show that those debts were fully paid by the debtor or debtors or the guarantor within the prescribed time-limit.\nTo obtain authorisation to use a temporarily prohibited comprehensive guarantee, the person concerned must also fulfil the criteria laid down in points (b) and (c) of Article 39.\nArticle 97\nAdditional or replacement guarantee\nWhere the customs authorities establish that the guarantee provided does not ensure, or is no longer certain or sufficient to ensure, payment within the prescribed period of the amount of import or export duty corresponding to the customs debt and other charges, they shall require any of the persons referred to in Article 89(3) either to provide an additional guarantee or to replace the original guarantee with a new guarantee, according to his choice.\nArticle 98\nRelease of the guarantee\n1.   The customs authorities shall release the guarantee immediately when the customs debt or liability for other charges is extinguished or can no longer arise.\n2.   Where the customs debt or liability for other charges has been extinguished in part, or may arise only in respect of part of the amount which has been secured, a corresponding part of the guarantee shall be released accordingly at the request of the person concerned, unless the amount involved does not justify such action.\nArticle 99\nDelegation of power\nThe Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts, in accordance with Article 284, in order to determine:\n(a)\nthe specific cases, referred to in point (c) of Article 89(8), where no guarantee is required for goods placed under the temporary admission procedure;\n(b)\nthe form of the guarantee, referred to in point (c) of Article 92(1), and the rules concerning the guarantor referred to in Article 94;\n(c)\nthe conditions for the granting of an authorisation to use a comprehensive guarantee with a reduced amount or to have a guarantee waiver referred to in Article 95(2);\n(d)\ntime-limits for the release of a guarantee.\nArticle 100\nConferral of implementing powers\n1.   The Commission shall specify, by means of implementing acts, the procedural rules:\n(a)\nfor determining the amount of the guarantee, including the reduced amount referred to in Article 95(2) and (3);\n(b)\nregarding the provision and the monitoring of the guarantee referred to in Article 89, the revocation and cancellation of the undertaking given by the guarantor referred to in Article 94, and the release of the guarantee referred to in Article 98;\n(c)\nregarding the temporary prohibitions referred to in Article 96.\nThose implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 285(4).\n2.   The Commission shall adopt the measures referred to in Article 96 by means of implementing acts.\nThose implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 285(4).\nOn imperative grounds of urgency relating to such measures, duly justified by the need to rapidly enhance the protection of the financial interests of the Union and of its Member States, the Commission shall adopt immediately applicable implementing acts in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 285(5).\nWhere the opinion of the committee referred to in Article 285(1) is to be obtained by written procedure, Article 285(6) shall apply.\nCHAPTER 3\nRecovery, payment, repayment and remission of the amount of import or export duty\nSection 1\nDetermination of the amount of import or export duty, notification of the customs debt and entry in the accounts\nArticle 101\nDetermination of the amount of import or export duty\n1.   The amount of import or export duty payable shall be determined by the customs authorities responsible for the place where the customs debt is incurred, or is deemed to have been incurred in accordance with Article 87, as soon as they have the necessary information.\n2.   Without prejudice to Article 48, the customs authorities may accept the amount of import or export duty payable determined by the declarant.\n3.   Where the amount of import or export duty payable does not result in a whole number, that amount may be rounded.\nWhere the amount referred in the first subparagraph is expressed in euros, rounding may not be more than a rounding up or down to the nearest whole number.\nA Member State whose currency is not the euro may either apply mutatis mutandis the provisions of the second subparagraph or derogate from that subparagraph, provided that the rules applicable on rounding do not have a greater financial impact than the rule set out in the second subparagraph.\nArticle 102\nNotification of the customs debt\n1.   The customs debt shall be notified to the debtor in the form prescribed at the place where the customs debt is incurred, or is deemed to have been incurred in accordance with Article 87.\nThe notification referred to in the first subparagraph shall not be made in any of the following cases:\n(a)\nwhere, pending a final determination of the amount of import or export duty, a provisional commercial policy measure taking the form of a duty has been imposed;\n(b)\nwhere the amount of import or export duty payable exceeds that determined on the basis of a decision made in accordance with Article 33;\n(c)\nwhere the original decision not to notify the customs debt or to notify it with an amount of import or export duty at a figure less than the amount of import or export duty payable was taken on the basis of general provisions invalidated at a later date by a court decision;\n(d)\nwhere the customs authorities are exempted under the customs legislation from notification of the customs debt.\n2.   Where the amount of import or export duty payable is equal to the amount entered in the customs declaration, release of the goods by the customs authorities shall be equivalent to notifying the debtor of the customs debt.\n3.   Where paragraph 2 does not apply, the customs debt shall be notified to the debtor by the customs authorities when they are in a position to determine the amount of import or export duty payable and take a decision thereon.\nHowever, where the notification of the customs debt would prejudice a criminal investigation, the customs authorities may defer that notification until such time as it no longer prejudices the criminal investigation.\n4.   Provided that payment has been guaranteed, the customs debt corresponding to the total amount of import or export duty relating to all the goods released to one and the same person during a period fixed by the customs authorities may be notified at the end of that period. The period fixed by the customs authorities shall not exceed 31 days.\nArticle 103\nLimitation of the customs debt\n1.   No customs debt shall be notified to the debtor after the expiry of a period of three years from the date on which the customs debt was incurred.\n2.   Where the customs debt is incurred as the result of an act which, at the time it was committed, was liable to give rise to criminal court proceedings, the three-year period laid down in paragraph 1 shall be extended to a period of a minimum of five years and a maximum of 10 years in accordance with national law.\n3.   The periods laid down in paragraphs 1 and 2 shall be suspended where:\n(a)\nan appeal is lodged in accordance with Article 44; such suspension shall apply from the date on which the appeal is lodged and shall last for the duration of the appeal proceedings; or\n(b)\nthe customs authorities communicate to the debtor, in accordance with Article 22(6), the grounds on which they intend to notify the customs debt; such suspension shall apply from the date of that communication until the end of the period within which the debtor is given the opportunity to express his or her point of view.\n4.   Where a customs debt is reinstated pursuant to Article 116(7), the periods laid down in paragraphs 1 and 2 shall be considered as suspended from the date on which the application for repayment or remission was submitted in accordance with Article 121, until the date on which the decision on the repayment or remission was taken.\nArticle 104\nEntry in the accounts\n1.   The customs authorities referred to in Article 101 shall enter in their accounts, in accordance with the national legislation, the amount of import or export duty payable as determined in accordance with that Article.\nThe first subparagraph shall not apply in cases referred to in the second subparagraph of Article 102(1).\n2.   The customs authorities need not enter in the accounts amounts of import or export duty which, pursuant to Article 103, correspond to a customs debt which could no longer be notified to the debtor.\n3.   Member States shall determine the practical procedures for the entry in the accounts of the amounts of import or export duty. Those procedures may differ according to whether, in view of the circumstances in which the customs debt was incurred, the customs authorities are satisfied that those amounts will be paid.\nArticle 105\nTime of entry in the accounts\n1.   Where a customs debt is incurred as a result of the acceptance of the customs declaration of goods for a customs procedure, other than temporary admission with partial relief from import duty, or of any other act having the same legal effect as such acceptance, the customs authorities shall enter the amount of import or export duty payable in the accounts within 14 days of the release of the goods.\nHowever, provided that payment has been guaranteed, the total amount of import or export duty relating to all the goods released to one and the same person during a period fixed by the customs authorities, which may not exceed 31 days, may be covered by a single entry in the accounts at the end of that period. Such entry in the accounts shall take place within 14 days of the expiry of the period concerned.\n2.   Where goods may be released subject to certain conditions which govern either the determination of the amount of import or export duty payable or its collection, entry in the accounts shall take place within 14 days of the day on which the amount of import or export duty payable is determined or the obligation to pay that duty is fixed.\nHowever, where the customs debt relates to a provisional commercial policy measure taking the form of a duty, the amount of import or export duty payable shall be entered in the accounts within two months of the date of publication in the Official Journal of the European Union of the Regulation establishing the definitive commercial policy measure.\n3.   Where a customs debt is incurred in circumstances not covered by paragraph 1, the amount of import or export duty payable shall be entered in the accounts within 14 days of the date on which the customs authorities are in a position to determine the amount of import or export duty in question and take a decision.\n4.   Paragraph 3 shall apply with regard to the amount of import or export duty to be recovered or which remains to be recovered where the amount of import or export duty payable has not been entered in the accounts in accordance with paragraphs 1, 2 and 3, or has been determined and entered in the accounts at a level lower than the amount payable.\n5.   The time-limits for entry in the accounts laid down in paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 shall not apply in unforeseeable circumstances or in cases of force majeure.\n6.   The entry in the accounts may be deferred in the case referred to in the second subparagraph of Article 102(3), until such time as the notification of the customs debt no longer prejudices a criminal investigation.\nArticle 106\nDelegation of power\nThe Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts, in accordance with Article 284, in order to determine the cases referred to in point (d) of Article 102(1) where the customs authorities are exempted from notification of the customs debt.\nArticle 107\nConferral of implementing powers\nThe Commission shall adopt, by means of implementing acts, measures to ensure mutual assistance between the customs authorities in case of incurrence of a customs debt.\nThose implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 285(4).\nSection 2\nPayment of the amount of import or export duty\nArticle 108\nGeneral time-limits for payment and suspension of the time-limit for payment\n1.   Amounts of import or export duty, corresponding to a customs debt notified in accordance with Article 102, shall be paid by the debtor within the period prescribed by the customs authorities.\nWithout prejudice to Article 45(2), that period shall not exceed 10 days following notification to the debtor of the customs debt. In the case of aggregation of entries in the accounts under the conditions laid down in the second subparagraph of Article 105(1), it shall be so fixed as not to enable the debtor to obtain a longer period for payment than if he or she had been granted deferred payment in accordance with Article 110.\nThe customs authorities may extend that period upon application by the debtor where the amount of import or export duty payable has been determined in the course of post-release control as referred to in Article 48. Without prejudice to Article 112(1), such extensions shall not exceed the time necessary for the debtor to take the appropriate steps to discharge his or her obligation.\n2.   If the debtor is entitled to any of the payment facilities laid down in Articles 110 to 112, payment shall be made within the period or periods specified in relation to those facilities.\n3.   The time-limit for payment of the amount of import or export duty corresponding to a customs debt shall be suspended in any of the following cases:\n(a)\nwhere an application for remission of duty is made in accordance with Article 121;\n(b)\nwhere goods are to be confiscated, destroyed or abandoned to the State;\n(c)\nwhere the customs debt was incurred pursuant to Article 79 and there is more than one debtor.\nArticle 109\nPayment\n1.   Payment shall be made in cash or by any other means with similar discharging effect, including by adjustment of a credit balance, in accordance with national legislation.\n2.   Payment may be made by a third person instead of the debtor.\n3.   The debtor may in any case pay all or part of the amount of import or export duty without awaiting expiry of the period he or she has been granted for payment.\nArticle 110\nDeferment of payment\nThe customs authorities shall, upon application by the person concerned and upon provision of a guarantee, authorise deferment of payment of the duty payable in any of the following ways:\n(a)\nseparately in respect of each amount of import or export duty entered in the accounts in accordance with the first subparagraph of Article 105(1), or Article 105(4);\n(b)\nglobally in respect of all amounts of import or export duty entered in the accounts in accordance with the first subparagraph of Article 105(1) during a period fixed by the customs authorities and not exceeding 31 days;\n(c)\nglobally in respect of all amounts of import or export duty forming a single entry in accordance with the second subparagraph of Article 105(1).\nArticle 111\nPeriods for which payment is deferred\n1.   The period for which payment is deferred under Article 110 shall be 30 days.\n2.   Where payment is deferred in accordance with point (a) of Article 110, the period shall begin on the day following that on which the customs debt is notified to the debtor.\n3.   Where payment is deferred in accordance with point (b) of Article 110, the period shall begin on the day following that on which the aggregation period ends. It shall be reduced by the number of days corresponding to half the number of days covered by the aggregation period.\n4.   Where payment is deferred in accordance with point (c) of Article 110, the period shall begin on the day following the end of the period fixed for release of the goods in question. It shall be reduced by the number of days corresponding to half the number of days covered by the period concerned.\n5.   Where the number of days in the periods referred to in paragraphs 3 and 4 is an odd number, the number of days to be deducted from the 30-day period pursuant to those paragraphs shall be equal to half the next lowest even number.\n6.   Where the periods referred to in paragraphs 3 and 4 are weeks, Member States may provide that the amount of import or export duty in respect of which payment has been deferred is to be paid on the Friday of the fourth week following the week in question at the latest.\nIf those periods are months, Member States may provide that the amount of import or export duty in respect of which payment has been deferred is to be paid by the 16th day of the month following the month in question.\nArticle 112\nOther payment facilities\n1.   The customs authorities may grant the debtor payment facilities other than deferred payment on condition that a guarantee is provided.\n2.   Where facilities are granted pursuant to paragraph 1, credit interest shall be charged on the amount of import or export duty.\nFor a Member State whose currency is the euro, the rate of credit interest shall be equal to the interest rate as published in the Official Journal of the European Union, C series, which the European Central Bank applied to its main refinancing operations, on the first day of the month in which the due date fell, increased by one percentage point.\nFor a Member State whose currency is not the euro, the rate of credit interest shall be equal to the rate applied on the first day of the month in question by the National Central Bank for its main refinancing operations, increased by one percentage point, or, for a Member State for which the National Central Bank rate is not available, the most equivalent rate applied on the first day of the month in question on the Member State's money market, increased by one percentage point.\n3.   The customs authorities may refrain from requiring a guarantee or from charging credit interest where it is established, on the basis of a documented assessment of the situation of the debtor, that this would create serious economic or social difficulties.\n4.   The customs authorities shall refrain from charging credit interest where the amount for each recovery action is less than EUR 10.\nArticle 113\nEnforcement of payment\nWhere the amount of import or export duty payable has not been paid within the prescribed period, the customs authorities shall secure payment of that amount by all means available to them under the law of the Member State concerned.\nArticle 114\nInterest on arrears\n1.   Interest on arrears shall be charged on the amount of import or export duty from the date of expiry of the prescribed period until the date of payment.\nFor a Member State whose currency is the euro, the rate of interest on arrears shall be equal to the interest rate as published in the Official Journal of the European Union, C series, which the European Central Bank applied to its main refinancing operations, on the first day of the month in which the due date fell, increased by two percentage points.\nFor a Member State whose currency is not the euro, the rate of interest on arrears shall be equal to the rate applied on the first day of the month in question by the National Central Bank for its main refinancing operations, increased by two percentage points, or, for a Member State for which the National Central Bank rate is not available, the most equivalent rate applied on the first day of the month in question on the Member State's money market, increased by two percentage points.\n2.

The customs authorities may refrain from charging interest on arrears where it is established, on the basis of a documented assessment of the situation of the debtor, that to charge it would create serious economic or social difficulties.\n4.   The customs authorities shall refrain from charging interest on arrears where the amount for each recovery action is less than EUR 10.\nArticle 115\nDelegation of power\nThe Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts, in accordance with Article 284, in order to determine the rules for the suspension of the time-limit for payment of the amount of import or export duty corresponding to a customs debt referred to in Article 108(3) and the period of suspension.\nSection 3\nRepayment and remission\nArticle 116\nGeneral provisions\n1.

The customs authorities shall repay or remit the amount of import or export duty referred to in paragraph 1 where it is EUR 10 or more, except where the person concerned requests the repayment or remission of a lower amount.\n3.   Where the customs authorities consider that repayment or remission should be granted on the basis of Article 119 or 120, the Member State concerned shall transmit the file to the Commission for decision in any of the following cases:\n(a)\nwhere the customs authorities consider that the special circumstances are the result of the Commission failing in its obligations;\n(b)\nwhere the customs authorities consider that the Commission committed an error within the meaning of Article 119;\n(c)\nwhere the circumstances of the case relate to the findings of a Union investigation carried out under Council Regulation (EC) No 515/97 of 13 March 1997 on mutual assistance between the administrative authorities of the Member States and cooperation between the latter and the Commission to ensure the correct application of the law on customs and agricultural matters (17), or under any other Union legislation or any agreement concluded by the Union with countries or groups of countries in which provision is made for carrying out such Union investigations;\n(d)\nwhere the amount for which the person concerned may be liable in respect of one or more import or export operations equals or exceeds EUR 500 000 as a result of an error or special circumstances.\nNotwithstanding the first subparagraph, files shall not be transmitted in either of the following situations:\n(a)\nwhere the Commission has already adopted a decision on a case involving comparable issues of fact and of law;\n(b)\nwhere the Commission is already considering a case involving comparable issues of fact and of law.\n4.   Subject to the rules of competence for a decision, where the customs authorities themselves discover within the periods referred to in Article 121(1) that an amount of import or export duty is repayable or remissible pursuant to Articles 117, 119 or 120 they shall repay or remit on their own initiative.\n5.   No repayment or remission shall be granted when the situation which led to the notification of the customs debt results from deception by the debtor.\n6.   Repayment shall not give rise to the payment of interest by the customs authorities concerned.\nHowever, interest shall be paid where a decision granting repayment is not implemented within three months of the date on which that decision was taken, unless the failure to meet the deadline was outside the control of the customs authorities.\nIn such cases, the interest shall be paid from the date of expiry of the three-month period until the date of repayment. The rate of interest shall be established in accordance with Article 112.\n7.   Where the customs authorities have granted repayment or remission in error, the original customs debt shall be reinstated insofar as it is not time-barred under Article 103.\nIn such cases, any interest paid under the second subparagraph of paragraph 5 shall be reimbursed.\nArticle 117\nOvercharged amounts of import or export duty\n1.   An amount of import or export duty shall be repaid or remitted insofar as the amount corresponding to the customs debt initially notified exceeds the amount payable, or the customs debt was notified to the debtor contrary to points (c) or (d) of Article 102(1).\n2.   Where the application for repayment or remission is based on the existence, at the time when the declaration for release for free circulation was accepted, of a reduced or zero rate of import duty on the goods under a tariff quota, a tariff ceiling or other favourable tariff measures, repayment or remission shall be granted provided that, at the time of lodging the application accompanied by the necessary documents, either of the following conditions are fulfilled:\n(a)\nin the case of a tariff quota, its volume has not been exhausted;\n(b)\nin other cases, the rate of duty normally due has not been re-established.\nArticle 118\nDefective goods or goods not complying with the terms of the contract\n1.   An amount of import duty shall be repaid or remitted if the notification of the customs debt relates to goods which have been rejected by the importer because, at the time of release, they were defective or did not comply with the terms of the contract on the basis of which they were imported.\nDefective goods shall be deemed to include goods damaged before their release.\n2.   Notwithstanding paragraph 3, repayment or remission shall be granted provided the goods have not been used, except for such initial use as may have been necessary to establish that they were defective or did not comply with the terms of the contract and provided they are taken out of the customs territory of the Union.\n3.   Repayment or remission shall not be granted where:\n(a)\nthe goods, before being released for free circulation, were placed under a special procedure for testing, unless it is established that the fact that the goods were defective or did not comply with the terms of the contract could not normally have been detected in the course of such tests;\n(b)\nthe defective nature of the goods was taken into consideration in drawing up the terms of the contract, in particular the price, before the goods were placed under a customs procedure involving the incurrence of a customs debt; or\n(c)\nthe goods are sold by the applicant after it has been ascertained that they are defective or do not comply with the terms of the contract.\n4.   Instead of being taken out of the customs territory of the Union, and upon application by the person concerned, the customs authorities shall authorise that the goods be placed under the inward processing procedure, including for destruction, or the external transit, the customs warehousing or the free zone procedure.\nArticle 119\nError by the competent authorities\n1.   In cases other than those referred to in the second subparagraph of Article 116(1) and in Articles 117, 118 and 120, an amount of import or export duty shall be repaid or remitted where, as a result of an error on the part of the competent authorities, the amount corresponding to the customs debt initially notified was lower than the amount payable, provided the following conditions are met:\n(a)\nthe debtor could not reasonably have detected that error; and\n(b)\nthe debtor was acting in good faith.\n2.   Where the conditions laid down in Article 117(2) are not fulfilled, repayment or remission shall be granted where failure to apply the reduced or zero rate of duty was as a result of an error on the part of the customs authorities and the customs declaration for release for free circulation contained all the particulars and was accompanied by all the documents necessary for application of the reduced or zero rate.\n3.   Where the preferential treatment of the goods is granted on the basis of a system of administrative cooperation involving the authorities of a country or territory outside the customs territory of the Union, the issue of a certificate by those authorities, should it prove to be incorrect, shall constitute an error which could not reasonably have been detected within the meaning of point (a) of paragraph 1.\nThe issue of an incorrect certificate shall not, however, constitute an error where the certificate is based on an incorrect account of the facts provided by the exporter, except where it is evident that the issuing authorities were aware or should have been aware that the goods did not satisfy the conditions laid down for entitlement to the preferential treatment.\nThe debtor shall be considered to be in good faith if he or she can demonstrate that, during the period of the trading operations concerned, he or she has taken due care to ensure that all the conditions for the preferential treatment have been fulfilled.\nThe debtor may not rely on a plea of good faith if the Commission has published a notice in the Official Journal of the European Union stating that there are grounds for doubt concerning the proper application of the preferential arrangements by the beneficiary country or territory.\nArticle 120\nEquity\n1.   In cases other than those referred to in the second subparagraph of Article 116(1) and in Articles 117, 118 and 119 an amount of import or export duty shall be repaid or remitted in the interest of equity where a customs debt is incurred under special circumstances in which no deception or obvious negligence may be attributed to the debtor.\n2.   The special circumstances referred to in paragraph 1 shall be deemed to exist where it is clear from the circumstances of the case that the debtor is in an exceptional situation as compared with other operators engaged in the same business, and that, in the absence of such circumstances, he or she would not have suffered disadvantage by the collection of the amount of import or export duty.\nArticle 121\nProcedure for repayment and remission\n1.   Applications for repayment or remission in accordance with Article 116 shall be submitted to the customs authorities within the following periods:\n(a)\nin the case of overcharged, amounts of import or export duty, error by the competent authorities or equity, within three years of the date of notification of the customs debt;\n(b)\nin the case of defective goods or goods not complying with the terms of the contract, within one year of the date of notification of the customs debt;\n(c)\nin the case of invalidation of a customs declaration, within the period specified in the rules applicable to invalidation.\nThe period specified in points (a) and (b) of the first subparagraph shall be extended where the applicant provides evidence that he or she was prevented from submitting an application within the prescribed period as a result of unforeseeable circumstances or force majeure.\n2.   Where the customs authorities are not in a position, on the basis of the grounds adduced, to grant repayment or remission of an amount of import or export duty, it is required to examine the merits of an application for repayment or remission in the light of the other grounds for repayment or remission referred to in Article 116.\n3.

Where, in accordance with point (g) of paragraph 1, a customs debt is extinguished in respect of goods released for free circulation duty-free or at a reduced rate of import duty on account of their end-use, any scrap or waste resulting from their destruction shall be deemed to be non-Union goods.\n4.   The provisions in force pertaining to standard rates for irretrievable loss due to the nature of goods shall apply where the person concerned fails to show that the real loss exceeds that calculated by applying the standard rate for the goods in question.\n5.
