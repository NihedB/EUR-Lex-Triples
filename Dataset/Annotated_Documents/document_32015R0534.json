{"celex_id": "32015R0534", "reference": "31.3.2015\nEN\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\nL 86/13\nREGULATION (EU) 2015/534 OF THE EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK\nof 17 March 2015\non reporting of supervisory financial information (ECB/2015/13)\nTHE GOVERNING COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK,\nHaving regard to Council Regulation (EU) No 1024/2013 of 15 October 2013 conferring specific tasks on the European Central Bank concerning policies relating to the prudential supervision of credit institutions (1), and in particular Article 4(1), Article 4(3), Article 6(2), Article 6(5)(d) and Article 10 thereof,\nHaving regard to Regulation (EU) No 468/2014 of the European Central Bank of 16 April 2014 establishing the framework for cooperation within the Single Supervisory Mechanism between the European Central Bank and national competent authorities and with national designated authorities (SSM Framework Regulation) (ECB/2014/17) (2), and in particular Article 21(1), Article 140 and Article 141(1) thereof,\nWhereas:\n(1)\nCredit institutions are subject to regular reporting requirements as set out in Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council (3) (also referred to herein as the ‘CRR’) and Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 680/2014 (4). The information reported is collected by the ECB under Decision ECB/2014/29 (5). This Regulation complements Decision ECB/2014/29 by further specifying the requirements concerning the reporting of supervisory financial information.\n(2)\nImplementing Regulation (EU) No 680/2014 lays down uniform requirements for all institutions subject to Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 in relation to supervisory reporting to competent authorities for specific areas set out in Article 1 of Implementing Regulation (EU) No 680/2014. One of these areas is financial information on a consolidated basis. Under Article 99(2) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, the reporting of supervisory financial information on a consolidated basis is mandatory for credit institutions that prepare their consolidated accounts in conformity with the international accounting standards adopted in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 6(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1606/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council (6). The submission by national competent authorities (NCAs) to the ECB of the supervisory financial information mandatory under Implementing Regulation (EU) No 680/2014, concerning both significant and less significant supervised entities, currently takes place in accordance with Decision ECB/2014/29 and should continue unaffected, as it is not covered by the subject matter of this Regulation.\n(3)\nThe exercise of the discretion to require credit institutions to use international accounting standards as applicable under Regulation (EC) No 1606/2002 for supervisory reporting pursuant to Article 24(2) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 is outside the subject matter of this Regulation. Having regard to Article 150 of Regulation (EU) No 468/2014 (ECB/2014/17), previous decisions by NCAs concerning the exercise, or non-exercise, of this discretion should remain unaffected.\n(4)\nIn accordance with Article 99(3) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, for credit institutions applying international accounting standards as applicable under Regulation (EC) No 1606/2002 for supervisory reporting pursuant to Article 24(2) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, the reporting of supervisory financial information on a consolidated basis requires a decision by the competent authority to extend this reporting. The ECB should also take a decision to extend the requirement to submit supervisory financial information to significant supervised groups applying Regulation (EC) No 1606/2002 for supervisory reporting pursuant to Article 24(2) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013.\n(5)\nIn accordance with Article 99(6) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, for credit institutions applying national accounting frameworks based on Council Directive 86/635/EEC (7), the reporting of supervisory financial information on a consolidated basis requires a previous decision by the competent authority to extend this reporting. The ECB should also take a decision to extend the requirement to submit supervisory financial information to significant supervised groups applying national accounting frameworks based on Directive 86/635/EEC. The European Banking Authority has been consulted in accordance with Article 99(6) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013.\n(6)\nImplementing Regulation (EU) No 680/2014 lays down uniform requirements for supervisory reporting concerning the areas within its scope. Pursuant to Article 99(5) and (6) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, Implementing Regulation (EU) No 680/2014 only deals with supervisory financial information on a consolidated basis. Reporting of supervisory financial information on an individual basis is outside of its scope; therefore, competent authorities may impose requirements concerning the reporting of supervisory financial information on an individual basis. Having regard to the need to have comparable financial information for significant and less significant supervised entities, this Regulation should lay down the supervisory financial information that should be reported by significant and less significant supervised entities on an individual basis to NCAs. NCAs should thereafter submit this information to the ECB in accordance with Article 140(3) of Regulation (EU) No 468/2014 (ECB/2014/17).\n(7)\nPursuant to Article 40 of Directive 2013/36/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council (8), the competent authorities of host Member States may require that all credit institutions having branches within their territories report to them periodically on their activities in those host Member States. In accordance with Article 2(20) of Regulation (EU) No 468/2014 (ECB/2014/17), branches established in a participating Member State by a credit institution established in a non-participating Member State are supervised entities. Having regard to the need to have comparable financial information for significant supervised entities, this Regulation should lay down the information that should be reported by branches established in a participating Member State by a credit institution established in a non-participating Member State to NCAs. NCAs should thereafter submit this information to the ECB in accordance with Article 140(3) of Regulation (EU) No 468/2014 (ECB/2014/17).\n(8)\nArticle 6(4) of Regulation (EU) No 1024/2013 provides that the ECB shall have supervisory powers in respect of credit institutions, financial holding companies or mixed financial holding companies, or branches which are established in participating Member States of credit institutions established in non-participating Member States. Therefore, branches established in a participating Member State by a credit institution from a third country are not within the supervisory tasks conferred on the ECB. Consequently, these branches should not be subject to the reporting requirements in this Regulation. In addition, branches established in a participating Member State by a credit institution from another participating Member State should be excluded from these reporting requirements, because they are intended to be applied at the level of the supervised entity that has established the branch.\n(9)\nThe requirements laid down in this Regulation concerning significant and less significant supervised entities, including branches established in a participating Member State by a credit institution established in a non-participating Member State, should be aimed at ensuring that these supervised entities report a common minimum set of information to NCAs and not at imposing uniform reporting requirements. It may be appropriate for NCAs to collect the necessary minimum information as part of a broader reporting framework which they establish in accordance with the relevant Union or national law and which also serves purposes other than supervisory purposes, such as statistical purposes.\n(10)\nFor the exercise of the ECB's tasks, it is necessary to receive financial information from less significant supervised groups, other than those that prepare their consolidated accounts in conformity with the international accounting standards adopted in accordance with Article 6(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1606/2002. This Regulation should therefore lay down the supervisory financial information to be reported by such groups to NCAs. In particular, the formats, frequencies, reference dates and remittance periods and the time limits regarding submission of the information concerned should be specified. These requirements should be aimed at ensuring that such supervised groups report a common minimum set of information to NCAs and not at imposing uniform reporting requirements.\n(11)\nIn accordance with Article 6(2) of Regulation (EU) No 1024/2013, and Article 21 of Regulation (EU) No 468/2014 (ECB/2014/17), both the ECB and NCAs are subject to an obligation to exchange information. Without prejudice to the ECB's power to directly receive information reported by credit institutions, or to have direct access to that information, on an ongoing basis, the NCAs should specifically provide the ECB with all information necessary for the purposes of carrying out the tasks conferred on the ECB by Regulation (EU) No 1024/2013.\n(12)\nIn accordance with Article 2(3) of Implementing Regulation (EU) No 680/2014, institutions may be allowed to use an accounting year that deviates from the calendar year for reporting supervisory financial information on a consolidated basis. This Regulation should also allow the use of an accounting year that deviates from the calendar year for such reporting.\n(13)\nThe ECB has conducted a public consultation on this Regulation and has analysed the potential costs and benefits,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nTITLE I\nSUBJECT MATTER AND DEFINITIONS\nArticle 1\nSubject matter\n1.   This Regulation lays down requirements concerning reporting of supervisory financial information to be submitted to NCAs by:\n(a)\nsignificant supervised groups applying international accounting standards in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1606/2002 for supervisory reporting pursuant to Article 24(2) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, including any sub-group thereof;\n(b)\nsignificant supervised groups, other than those referred to in point (a), which are subject to national accounting frameworks based on Directive 86/635/EEC, including any sub-group thereof;\n(c)\nsignificant supervised entities, including branches established in a participating Member State by a credit institution established in a non-participating Member State;\n(d)\nsignificant supervised groups regarding subsidiaries established in a non-participating Member State or a third country;\n(e)\nless significant supervised groups applying international accounting standards in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1606/2002 for supervisory reporting pursuant to Article 24(2) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, including any sub-group thereof;\n(f)\nless significant supervised groups, other than those referred to in point (e), which are subject to national accounting frameworks based on Directive 86/635/EEC, including any sub-group thereof;\n(g)\nless significant supervised entities, including branches established in a participating Member State by a credit institution established in a non-participating Member State.\n2.   As an exception to Articles 7 and 14, supervised entities that have been given a waiver regarding the application of prudential requirements on an individual basis, in accordance with Article 7 or 10 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, shall not be required to report supervisory financial information in accordance with this Regulation.\n3.   Where competent authorities, including the ECB, require institutions to comply with the obligations laid down in Parts Two to Four and Parts Six to Eight of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 and in Title VII of Directive 2013/36/EU on a sub-consolidated basis in accordance with Article 11(5) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, those institutions shall comply with the requirements laid down in this Regulation on a sub-consolidated basis.\n4.   NCAs and/or national central banks may use the data collected pursuant to this Regulation for any other tasks.\n5.   This Regulation shall not affect the accounting standards applied by supervised groups and entities in their consolidated accounts or annual accounts, nor change the accounting standards applied for supervisory reporting. As supervised groups and entities apply different accounting standards, only information related to valuation rules, including methods for estimation of credit risk losses, which exist under the relevant accounting standards and are effectively applied by the corresponding supervised group or entity should be submitted. For these purposes, specific reporting templates are provided for supervised groups and entities applying national accounting frameworks based on Directive 86/635/EEC. Data points within the templates which are not applicable to the respective supervised entities do not have to be reported.\n6.   Branches established in a participating Member State by a credit institution established in a non-participating Member State may submit the information that they are required to provide under this Regulation to the relevant NCA through the credit institution by which they were established.\nArticle 2\nDefinitions\nFor the purposes of this Regulation, the definitions contained in Regulation (EU) No 468/2014 (ECB/2014/17) shall apply, unless otherwise provided, together with the following definitions:\n(1)\n‘IAS’ and ‘IFRS’ mean ‘International Accounting Standards’ and ‘International Financial Reporting Standards’, as mentioned in Article 2 of Regulation (EC) No 1606/2002;\n(2)\n‘subsidiary’ means a subsidiary as defined in Article 4(1)(16) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 and that is a credit institution within the meaning of Article 4(1)(1) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013;\n(3)\n‘sub-group’ means a group whose parent undertaking is not itself a subsidiary of another institution authorised in the same participating Member State, or of a financial holding company or mixed financial holding company established in the same participating Member State;\n(4)\n‘consolidated basis’ means consolidated basis as defined in Article 4(1)(48) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013;\n(5)\n‘sub-consolidated basis’ means sub-consolidated basis as defined in Article 4(1)(49) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013.\nArticle 3\nChange of status of a supervised entity or a supervised group\n1.   For the purposes of this Regulation, a supervised entity or supervised group shall be classified as significant 18 months after a decision as referred to in Article 45(1) of Regulation (EU) 468/2014 (ECB/2014/17) has been notified to it. It shall report information in accordance with Title II of this Regulation as a significant supervised entity or significant supervised group on the first reference date which occurs after it has been classified as significant.\n2.   For the purposes of this Regulation, a supervised entity or supervised group shall be classified as less significant when a decision as referred to in Article 46(1) of Regulation (EU) 468/2014 (ECB/2014/17) has been notified to it. Thereafter, it shall start to report information in accordance with Title III of this Regulation.\nTITLE II\nSIGNIFICANT SUPERVISED GROUPS AND ENTITIES\nCHAPTER I\nSignificant supervised groups\nArticle 4\nFormat and frequency of reporting on a consolidated basis and reference dates and remittance dates for significant supervised groups applying IFRS for supervisory reporting pursuant to Article 24(2) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013\nIn accordance with Article 99(3) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, significant supervised groups applying IFRS under Regulation (EC) No 1606/2002 for supervisory reporting pursuant to Article 24(2) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, shall report supervisory financial information as provided for in Articles 2, 3 and 10 of Implementing Regulation (EU) No 680/2014 on a consolidated basis. Sub-groups thereof applying IFRS under Regulation (EC) No 1606/2002 for supervisory reporting shall also report supervisory financial information as provided for in Articles 2, 3 and 10 of Implementing Regulation (EU) No 680/2014 on a consolidated basis.\nArticle 5\nFormat and frequency of reporting on a consolidated basis and reference dates and remittance dates for significant supervised groups applying national accounting frameworks based on Directive 86/635/EEC\nIn accordance with Article 99(6) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, significant supervised groups, other than those referred to in Article 4, which are subject to national accounting frameworks based on Directive 86/635/EEC, including any sub-group thereof, shall report supervisory financial information as provided for in Articles 2, 3 and 11 of Implementing Regulation (EU) No 680/2014 on a consolidated basis.\nCHAPTER II\nSignificant supervised entities\nArticle 6\nFormat and frequency of reporting on an individual basis for entities which are not part of a significant supervised group\n1.

When an update of the list of supervised entities, in accordance with Part IV Title II Chapter 3 of Regulation (EU) No 468/2014 (ECB/2014/17), reveals that the total value of the assets of a less significant supervised group exceeds EUR 3 billion, that group shall start to report information in accordance with paragraphs 4 and 5 on the first reference date which occurs 18 months after the publication of the updated list of supervised entities. When that update reveals that the total value of the assets of a less significant supervised group is below or equal to EUR 3 billion, that group shall start to report information in accordance with paragraph 6 on the first reference date which occurs after the publication of the updated list of supervised entities.\n8.   The information specified in paragraphs 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 shall be reported as provided for in Article 6(5) of this Regulation.\n9.   NCAs may collect the information to be submitted to the ECB specified in paragraphs 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as part of a broader reporting framework which, in compliance with the relevant Union or national law, includes additional supervisory financial information and also serves purposes other than supervisory purposes, such as statistical purposes.\nArticle 12\nReference dates and remittance dates for less significant supervised groups\n1.

Information referring to a period shall be reported cumulatively from the first day of the calendar year to the reference date.\n3.   As an exception to paragraphs 1 and 2, where less significant supervised groups are permitted by NCAs to report their supervisory financial information based on an accounting year that deviates from the calendar year, NCAs may adjust the reference dates to the accounting year-end. The adjusted reference dates shall be three, six, nine and 12 months after the beginning of the accounting year. Information referring to a period shall be reported cumulatively covering the period from the first day of the accounting year to the reference date.\n4.   NCAs shall submit to the ECB the information specified in Article 11 by close of business on the following remittance dates:\n(a)\nfor less significant supervised groups, including sub-groups, reporting on a consolidated basis, the 55th working day following the reference date to which it relates;\n(b)\nfor less significant supervised groups reporting on a sub-consolidated basis pursuant to Article 1(3), the 65th working day following the reference date to which it relates.\n5.   NCAs shall decide when supervised entities have to report supervisory financial information in order for them to meet these deadlines.\nCHAPTER II\nLess significant supervised entities\nArticle 13\nFormat and frequency of reporting on an individual basis for less significant supervised entities which are not part of a group\n1.   Less significant supervised entities applying IFRS under Regulation (EC) No 1606/2002 either because they prepare their annual accounts in conformity with the accounting standards referred to therein, or because they apply them for supervisory reporting pursuant to Article 24(2) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, and which are not part of a supervised group, including branches established in a participating Member State by a credit institution established in a non-participating Member State, shall report supervisory financial information to the relevant NCA on an individual basis.\n2.

Regulation (EU) 2015/534 specifies the requirements concerning the reporting of supervisory financial information by supervised entities to the national competent authorities and the ECB in the context of the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM), the system of financial supervision composed of the ECB and national competent authorities of participating EU countries.\nThe addressees of the regulation are:\nsignificant supervised entities — banks and banking groups that, according to the SSM framework regulation, meet at least one of the following criteria and are directly supervised by the ECB: total assets exceed €30 billion,economically important for their country or the EU as a whole,total assets of over €5 billion and cross-border assets and liabilities above 20%,have requested or received funding from the European Stability Mechanism or its predecessor, the European Financial Stability Facility,are one of a country’s three most significant banks;\nless significant entities — banks and banking groups that meet none of the criteria and are supervised by their national authorities subject to ECB oversight.\nNational competent authorities (NCAs):\nset the deadlines for the reporting of financial information by supervised entities to them;\nmonitor and ensure the quality and reliability of the information they submit to the ECB in a uniform technical format;\nmay use the data they collect under the regulation for other tasks.\nFROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?\n              \nRegulation (EU) 2015/534 has applied since 1 April 2015.\nBACKGROUND\n              \nThe ECB is responsible for the effective and consistent functioning of the whole system of European banking supervision, which comprises the ECB and the national banking supervisors of the participating countries. The main aims of this supervision are to:\nensure the safety and soundness of the European banking system;\nincrease financial integration and stability;\nensure consistent supervision.\nEuropean banking supervision is one of the two pillars of the EU banking union, along with the Single Resolution Mechanism.\nThe ECB oversees all significant and less significant banks in the participating countries through direct and indirect supervision.\nMAIN DOCUMENTS\n            \nRegulation (EU) 2015/534 of the European Central Bank of 17 March 2015 on reporting of supervisory financial information (ECB/2015/13) (OJ L 86, 31.3.2015, pp. 13-151)\nSuccessive amendments to Regulation (EU) 2015/534 have been incorporated into the original text.
