However, no decision can be taken to extend such authorisation to the Community as a whole. Member States are therefore free to authorise or prohibit the addition of vitamins to their national products although the free movement of goods within the Community is, in any case, to be guaranteed in accordance with the rules and principles deriving from the Treaty.(8) For products intended for infants, Commission Directive 91/321/EEC of 14 May 1991 on infant formulae and follow-on formulae(8) applies.(9) In accordance with the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality established by Article 5 of the Treaty, the objective of laying down common definitions and rules for the products concerned and bringing the provisions into line with general Community legislation on foodstuffs cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore, by reason of the nature of this Directive, be better achieved by the Community. This Directive does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve the said objective.(10) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Directive should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission(9).(11) To avoid creating new barriers to free movement, Member States should refrain from adopting, for the products in question, national provisions not provided for by this Directive,HAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:Article 1This Directive shall apply to partly or wholly dehydrated preserved milk defined in Annex I.Article 2Member States may, subject to Directive 90/496/EEC, authorise the addition of vitamins to the products defined in Annex I hereto.Article 3Directive 2000/13/EC shall apply to the products defined in Annex I, subject to the following conditions.1. (a) The product names listed in Annex I shall apply only to the products referred to therein and shall, without prejudice to subparagraph (b), be used in trade to designate them;(b) as an alternative to the product names referred to in subparagraph (a), Annex II provides a list of particular designations. These designations may be used in the language and under the conditions laid down in Annex II.2. The labelling must state the percentage of milk fat, expressed by weight in relation to the finished product, except in the case of the products defined in Annex I(1)(d) and (g) and Annex I(2)(d), and the percentage of fat-free dried milk extract in the case of the products defined in Annex I(1). These particulars shall appear near the trade name.3. In the case of the products defined in Annex I(2), the label must state the recommendations as to the method of dilution or reconstitution, including details of the fat content of the product thus diluted or reconstituted.4.

The procedure for such reference shall be adopted by Member States.Article 9This Directive shall enter into force on the day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.Article 10This Directive is addressed to the Member States.Done at Brussels, 20 December 2001.For the CouncilThe PresidentC.
