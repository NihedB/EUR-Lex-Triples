This Directive does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve the said objective.\n(8)\nThe measures necessary for the implementation of this Directive should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission (6).\n(9)\nTo avoid creating new barriers to free movement, Member States should refrain from adopting, for the products in question, national provisions not provided for by this Directive,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:\nArticle 1\nThis Directive shall apply to the products defined in Annex I.\nIt shall not apply to products intended for the manufacture of fine bakery wares, pastries or biscuits.\nArticle 2\nDirective 2000/13/EC shall apply to the products defined in Annex I hereto, subject to the following conditions:\n1.\nThe product names listed in Annex I shall apply only to the products referred to therein and shall be used in trade to designate them.\nThe product names used in Annex I may, however, be used in addition to the name and in accordance with practices used to designate other products which cannot be confused with those defined in Annex I.\n2.\nThe product names shall be supplemented by an indication of the fruit or fruits used, in descending order of weight of the raw materials used. However, for products manufactured from three or more fruits, the indication of the fruits used may be replaced by the words ‘mixed fruit’ or a similar wording, or by the number of fruits used.\n3.\nThe labelling shall indicate the fruit content by including the words ‘prepared with … g of fruit per 100 g’ of the finished product, after deduction of the weight of water used in preparing the aqueous extracts, if appropriate.\n4.\nThe labelling shall indicate the total sugar content by the words ‘total sugar content … g per 100 g’, the figure indicated representing the value determined by refractometer at 20 °C for the finished product, subject to a tolerance of ± 3 refractometric degrees.\nThe sugar content need not, however, be indicated where a nutrition claim is made for sugars on the labelling pursuant to Directive 90/496/EEC (7).\n5.\nThe particulars referred to in point 3 and the first subparagraph of point 4 shall appear in the same visual field as the product name and in clearly visible characters.\n6.\nWhere the residual content of sulphur dioxide is more than 10 mg/kg, its presence shall be indicated on the list of ingredients by way of derogation from Article 6(4) of Directive 2000/13/EC.\nArticle 3\nFor the products defined in Annex I, Member States shall not adopt national provisions not provided for by this Directive.\nArticle 4\nWithout prejudice to Directive 89/107/EEC (8) or to provisions adopted in order to give it effect, only the ingredients listed in Annex II hereto and raw materials which comply with Annex III hereto may be used in the manufacture of the products defined in Annex I hereto.\nArticle 5\nThe measures necessary for the implementation of this Directive relating to the matters referred to below shall be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure referred to in Article 6(2):\n—\nbringing this Directive into line with general Community legislation on foodstuffs,\n—\nadaptations to technical progress.\nArticle 6\n1.   The Commission shall be assisted by the Standing Committee on Foodstuffs (hereinafter referred to as ‘the Committee’) set up by Article 1 of Decision 69/414/EEC (9).\n2.   Where reference is made to this paragraph, Articles 5 and 7 of Decision 1999/468/EC shall apply.\nThe period laid down in Article 5(6) of Decision 1999/468/EC shall be set at three months.\n3.   The Committee shall adopt its rules of procedure.\nArticle 7\nDirective 79/693/EEC is hereby repealed with effect from 12 July 2003.\nReferences to the repealed Directive shall be construed as references to this Directive.\nArticle 8\nMember States shall bring into force the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive before 12 July 2003. They shall forthwith inform the Commission thereof.\nThe measures shall be applied so as to:\n—\nauthorise the marketing of the products defined in Annex I if they comply with the definitions and rules laid down in this Directive, with effect from 12 July 2003,\n—\nprohibit the marketing of products which do not comply with this Directive, with effect from 12 July 2004.\nHowever, the marketing of products which fail to conform to this Directive but which were labelled before 12 July 2004 in accordance with Directive 79/693/EEC shall be permitted until stocks run out.\nWhen Member States adopt these measures, they shall contain a reference to this Directive or shall be accompanied by such reference at the time of their official publication. The methods of making such reference shall be adopted by Member States.\nArticle 9\nThis Directive shall enter into force on the day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.\nArticle 10\nThis Directive is addressed to the Member States.\nDone at Brussels, 20 December 2001.\nFor the Council\nThe President\nC.
