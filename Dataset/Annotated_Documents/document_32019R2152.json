{"celex_id": "32019R2152", "reference": "17.12.2019\nEN\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\nL 327/1\nREGULATION (EU) 2019/2152 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL\nof 27 November 2019\non European business statistics, repealing 10 legal acts in the field of business statistics\n(Text with EEA relevance)\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 338(1) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European Central Bank (1),\nActing in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure (2),\nWhereas:\n(1)\nThe development, production and dissemination of statistical information on the economic activities of Member States' businesses has so far been based on a number of individual legal acts. Those legal acts cover short-term and structural business statistics, statistics on production, intra-Union and extra-Union trade (international trade) in goods and services, foreign affiliates, research and development (R&D), innovation and information and communication technologies (ICT) usage and e‐commerce. Moreover, a common framework for business registers for statistical purposes in the Union was established by Regulation (EC) No 177/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council (3).\n(2)\nThis structure based on individual legal acts does not provide the necessary consistency across the individual statistical domains, nor does it promote an integrated approach towards the development, production and dissemination of business statistics. For the purpose of this Regulation, European business statistics should also cover R&D statistics in the higher education, government and private non-profit sectors. A common legal framework should be established to ensure consistency across European business statistics and facilitate the integration of the corresponding statistical processes.\n(3)\nBetter integrated statistical processes based on common methodological principles, definitions and quality criteria should lead to harmonised statistics on the structure, the economic activities, the transactions and the performance of the business sector in the Union which meet the level of relevance and detail required to fulfil user needs.\n(4)\nThe EuroGroups Register is intended to ensure that Union guidance, such as Commission Recommendation 2003/361/EC (4), which is of relevance for European business statistics, can be more effectively followed, in particular with respect to the identification of autonomous enterprises as defined in Article 3 of that Recommendation. Such Union guidance is needed to foster legal certainty and business predictability and to create a level playing field for Union-based small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).\n(5)\nInternational guidance, such as the Frascati Manual, which concerns R&D statistics, and the Oslo Manual, which concerns innovation data, and international agreements adopted by the United Nations, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, the International Monetary Fund and other international and supranational organisations, are of relevance for European business statistics. Such guidance should, to the extent possible, be followed in the development, production and dissemination of Union statistics and within the European framework for statistical business registers, in order to ensure that the Union statistics are comparable with those compiled by the Union's main international partners. However, Union standards, agreements and guidelines should be applied consistently when collecting data for European business statistics on the R&D inputs and innovation topics.\n(6)\nThe administrative burden on businesses, in particular on SMEs, should be as limited as possible taking into account to the extent possible other data sources than surveys. For the purpose of alleviating the burden on enterprises it should be possible to establish different data requirements depending on the size and importance of the business economies of Member States.\n(7)\nThe European Statistical System (ESS) Vision 2020 stated that data should be used across statistical domains for better analysing emerging phenomena (e.g. globalisation) and for better serving Union policies of high impact. The data output should be based on efficient and robust statistical processes of the ESS. The broader scope of the common legal framework for business statistics should enable the integration of interdependent production processes drawing upon multiple sources.\n(8)\nThe Programme for the Modernisation of European Enterprise and Trade Statistics adopted pursuant to Decision No 1297/2008/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (5), which ran from 2009 to 2013, aimed at helping to adapt the business and trade-related statistics to new data needs and adjust the system for the production of business statistics. The conclusions and recommendations resulting from that programme regarding the priorities and new sets of indicators, the streamlining of the framework for business-related statistics, the more efficient production of statistics on enterprise and trade and the modernisation of intra-Union trade in goods statistics should be translated into legally binding provisions.\n(9)\nThere is a need for a more flexible approach within the framework for European business statistics to allow adaptations to methodological developments and a timely response to emerging and duly justified data-user needs resulting from the changing economic environment and the increasing globalisation and complexity of the business landscape. Such future adaptations should be supported by adequate cost-benefit analyses and resulting new data requirements should not impose a significant additional cost or burden on the Member States or on the respondents.\n(10)\nThe role of national statistical business registers and the EuroGroups register as basic infrastructure for the collection and compilation of data for European business statistics should be enhanced. National statistical business registers should be used as the main source of information for statistical analysis of the business population and its demography, for the definition of the survey population and for establishing the link to administrative data sources.\n(11)\nTo ensure the role of the national statistical business registers and the EuroGroups register, a unique identifier for all relevant units should be established and implemented.\n(12)\nThe proper delineation of enterprise groups in the EuroGroups register with timely and reliable data should be achieved by the use of harmonised criteria and regular updating of the information on links of control between the legal units being part of the enterprise groups.\n(13)\nIn order to improve the efficiency of the statistical production processes of the ESS and to reduce the statistical burden on respondents, national statistical authorities (NSAs) should have the right to access and use, promptly and free of charge, all national administrative records and to integrate those administrative records with statistics, to the extent necessary for the development, production and dissemination of European business statistics, in accordance with Article 17a of Regulation (EC) No 223/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council (6).\n(14)\nRegulation (EC) No 223/2009 provides a reference framework for European statistics. In particular, it requires compliance with the principles of professional independence, impartiality, objectivity, reliability, statistical confidentiality and cost-effectiveness.\n(15)\nThe exchange of and access to microdata by the NSAs producing business statistics and maintaining the European framework for statistical business registers should be introduced, for the development, production and dissemination of national or European business statistics or for increasing the quality of European business statistics. The exchange of microdata should be limited to duly justified cases.\n(16)\nThe creation of an additional data source based on the exchange of microdata on intra‐Union exports of goods, together with the possibility to use innovative methodologies increases the flexibility for the Member States in their compilation of intra-Union trade in goods statistics, thereby enabling the Member States to reduce the response burden on businesses. The purpose of the exchange is the efficient development, production and dissemination of statistics on international trade in goods and the improvement of the quality of such statistics.\n(17)\nThe negotiation, implementation and review of trade and investment agreements between the Union and third countries or multilaterally requires that the necessary statistical information on Member States′ trade flows with third countries be made available to the Commission.\n(18)\nA close link should be maintained between the system for collecting statistical information and the fiscal formalities related to the value added tax which exist in the context of trade in goods between Member States. That link makes it possible, in particular, for the purpose of intra-Union trade in goods statistics, to identify exporters and importers and to check the quality of the information collected.\n(19)\nThe cross-border movement of goods, in particular from or to third countries, is subject to customs supervision as provided for under Regulation (EU) No 952/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council (7). Customs authorities keep or have access to information or records concerning such movement. The information or records, which are related to or based on customs declarations, should be used for the production of statistics on Union trade in goods.\n(20)\nIn order to produce statistics on international trade in goods and to improve the quality of those statistics, the NSAs in the Member States should exchange data on imports and exports of goods which involve the customs authorities of more than one Member State. To ensure harmonised compilation of the statistics, the exchange of those microdata between the NSAs should be mandatory.\n(21)\nTo safeguard the quality and comparability of European business statistics or national accounts in line with the concepts and methodology of Regulation (EU) No 549/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council (8), the exchange of confidential data should be allowed between the NSAs of Member States concerned, their respective national central banks, the European Central Bank (ECB) and the Commission (Eurostat) only for statistical purposes.\n(22)\nIn order to carry out its tasks under the Treaties, especially tasks related to the functioning of the internal market, the Commission should have full, up-to-date and reliable information on the production of goods and services in the Union and on international trade flows. Enterprises also need such information in order to monitor their markets and the international dimension of those markets.\n(23)\nMembers States or national competent authorities should endeavour to simplify the collection of data from European businesses to the extent possible. The NSAs should take account of the latest digital developments at the time when the instruments and methods for collecting data for statistics are being established and should be encouraged to implement innovative approaches.\n(24)\nThere is a need to provide business statistics by sector of activity, in order to measure the productivity of businesses in the Union. In particular, there is an increasing demand for statistics on the services sector, which is the most dynamic sector of modern economies, especially in terms of that sector's potential for growth and employment creation and taking into account the relations with the manufacturing sector. This trend is further enhanced by the development of new digital services. The increasing demand for statistics is also the case for creative and cultural industries, as stated in the resolution of the European Parliament of 13 December 2016 on a coherent EU policy for cultural and creative industries (9). Statistics on trade in services are essential for monitoring the functioning of the internal market for services and the digital single market and assessing the impact of barriers on trade in services.\n(25)\nRegulation (EC) No 223/2009 constitutes the reference framework for this Regulation, including as regards the protection of confidential data. However, the very detailed level of information in the field of statistics on international trade in goods requires specific rules with regard to confidentiality. An importer or exporter of goods needs to submit a request to the NSA that statistical results allowing the indirect identification of such an importer or exporter are not disclosed. The NSA should consider the request to be justified where the statistical results allow the indirect identification of the importer or exporter. Otherwise, the NSA should be able to disseminate the statistical results in a form that make it possible for the importer or exporter to be identified indirectly.\n(26)\nThe monitoring of the progress towards the goals set by the Europe 2020 strategy at Member State and Union level requires harmonised statistics on the Union economy regarding climate change and resource efficiency, R&D, innovation, the information society covering both market and non-market activities and on the business landscape as a whole, in particular on business demography and employment related to market activities. Such information allows decision makers to take informed policy decisions in order to develop an economy based on knowledge and innovation, improve access to the internal market for SMEs, develop entrepreneurship and improve sustainability and competitiveness.\n(27)\nStatistics on innovation and R&D activities are needed for the development and monitoring of policies that aim to strengthen the competitiveness of Member States and increase their medium and long-term potential for smart growth and employment. An expanding digital economy and the increased use of ICT are also among the important drivers of competitiveness and growth in the Union, and statistics are needed to support the related strategies and policies, including the completion of the digital single market.\n(28)\nBusiness statistics are also needed for the compilation of national and regional accounts in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 549/2013.\n(29)\nReliable and timely statistics are necessary in order to report on the economic development in each Member State within the framework of the economic policy of the Union. The ECB needs quickly available short-term statistics in order to assess economic developments in the Member States in the context of the single monetary policy.\n(30)\nWhile maintaining the principle of providing business statistics on the entire economy, the data requirements should take into account, to the extent possible, simplifying measures for the purpose of alleviating the burden on the business economies of relatively small Member States, in accordance with the principle of proportionality. Additional requirements should not place a disproportionate administrative burden on respondents.\n(31)\nInternational standards, such as the Statistical Data and Metadata Exchange (SDMX) initiative, and statistical or technical standards elaborated within the ESS, such as metadata and validation standards, should be used to the extent relevant also for European business statistics. The ESS Committee (ESSC) has endorsed an ESS Standard for Quality Reports, in accordance with Article 12 of Regulation (EC) No 223/2009. Those standards should contribute to the harmonisation of quality assurance and reporting under this Regulation.\n(32)\nIn order to take account of economic and technical developments, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union should be delegated to the Commission in order to amend the types of statistical information, to further specify the details of the statistical information to be provided by the tax and customs authorities in accordance with Annexes V and VI, respectively, and to amend the detailed topics set out in Annex I and this Regulation by reducing the coverage rate for intra-Union exports of goods. It is of particular importance that the Commission carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level, and that those consultations be conducted in accordance with the principles laid down in the Interinstitutional Agreement of 13 April 2016 on Better Law-Making (10). In particular, to ensure equal participation in the preparation of delegated acts, the European Parliament and the Council receive all documents at the same time as Member States' experts, and their experts systematically have access to meetings of Commission expert groups dealing with the preparation of delegated acts.\n(33)\nIn order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of this Regulation with regard to the details of the variables as well as the format, security and confidentiality measures and the procedure for the exchange of confidential data for the purpose of the European framework for statistical business registers, the arrangements for, content of and deadlines for transmission of quality and metadata reports, the standards for data and metadata transmission, and derogations from the requirements of this Regulation or from the delegated or implementing acts adopted pursuant thereto, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission. For the same purpose, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission with regard to specifying the arrangements for the provision and exchange of certain administrative records as well as the format, security and confidentiality measures and the procedure for the exchange of confidential data for the purpose of the intra-Union trade in goods statistics, the specifications of the relevant metadata, the timetable, the arrangements for the collection and compilation of the statistical information on intra-Union exports of goods provided to the Member State of import, the arrangements for the application of the coverage rate of the total intra‐Union exports of goods with regard to the reference period, setting out the technical specifications related to the statistical data elements for the statistical information on intra-Union trade in goods to be provided to the Member State of import and the related simplifications. Those powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and the Council (11).\n(34)\nWhere appropriate the Commission should conduct cost-benefit analyses and ensure that any action it puts forward does not impose a significant additional cost or burden on Member States or respondents, in particular on SMEs, taking into account the expected user benefits and that it leads to an increase in the quality of the statistics.\n(35)\nThe Commission should be able to grant derogations from the application of this Regulation, or from delegated and implementing acts adopted pursuant thereto, where such application results in major adaptations to a national statistical system of a Member State in terms of organising additional surveys or making major adaptations to its statistical production system to accommodate new data sources or to allow for a combination of different sources.\n(36)\nWhere new data requirements or improvements to data sets covered by this Regulation are needed, the Commission should be able to launch pilot studies to be carried out by the Member States on a voluntary basis. As a priority, the Commission should be able to launch pilot studies that cover international trade in services, real estate, financial indicators and environment and climate.\n(37)\nSince the objective of this Regulation, namely the establishment of a common framework for European business statistics cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States but can rather, for reasons of harmonisation and comparability, be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union. In accordance with the principle of proportionality as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve that objective.\n(38)\nThe measures set out in this Regulation should replace those of Regulations (EC) No 48/2004 (12), (EC) No 638/2004 (13), (EC) No 808/2004 (14), (EC) No 716/2007 (15), (EC) No 177/2008, (EC) No 295/2008 (16) and (EC) No 471/2009 (17) of the European Parliament and of the Council, Decision No 1608/2003/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (18) and Council Regulations (EEC) No 3924/91 (19) and (EC) No 1165/98 (20). Those acts should therefore be repealed.\n(39)\nThe European Data Protection Supervisor has been consulted in accordance with Article 28(2) of Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council (21).\n(40)\nThe ESSC has been consulted,\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nCHAPTER I\nGeneral provisions\nArticle 1\nSubject-matter\nThis Regulation establishes a common legal framework for:\n(a)\nthe development, production and dissemination of European business statistics as referred to in Article 2(1);\n(b)\nthe European framework for statistical business registers.\nArticle 2\nScope\n1.

When exercising its power to adopt delegated acts pursuant to paragraph 4, the Commission shall ensure that the following conditions are fulfilled:\n(a)\nthe delegated acts aim to achieve cost and burden neutrality or reduction and do not, in any case, impose a significant additional cost or burden on the Member States or on the respondents;\n(b)\na maximum of one detailed topic for the domain short-term business statistics, three detailed topics for the domain country-level business statistics, two detailed topics for the domain regional business statistics and two detailed topics for the domain statistics on international activities listed in Annex I are replaced by another detailed topic and a maximum of one detailed topic in total for all domains is added over a period of five consecutive years;\n(c)\nthe delegated acts are adopted at least 18 months before the end of the reference period of the data, except for the topics of innovation and ICT usage and e‐commerce for which the delegated acts shall be adopted at least six and fifteen months respectively before the end of the reference period of the data;\n(d)\nany new detailed topic is assessed in respect of its feasibility by means of pilot studies carried out by the Member States in accordance with Article 20.\n6.   Point (b) of paragraph 5 shall not apply to:\n(a)\nthe detailed topics within the topics of innovation, ICT usage and e-commerce and global value chains;\n(b)\namendments that result from the changes to accounting frameworks of national and regional accounts in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 549/2013 and of balance of payments statistics in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 184/2005 of the European Parliament and of the Council (25).\nArticle 7\nTechnical specifications of data requirements\n1.   For the detailed topics listed in Annex I, Member States shall compile data relevant to each detailed topic. The Commission may adopt implementing acts further specifying the following elements of the data to be transmitted under this Regulation, their technical definitions and simplifications:\n(a)\nvariables;\n(b)\nmeasurement unit;\n(c)\nstatistical population (including the requirements in terms of market/non-market activities or producers);\n(d)\nclassifications (including the product, countries and territories as well as nature of transaction lists) and breakdowns;\n(e)\ntransmission of individual records of data on a voluntary basis;\n(f)\nuse of approximations and quality requirements;\n(g)\ndata transmission deadline;\n(h)\nfirst reference period;\n(i)\nweighting and change of base year for the domain short-term business statistics;\n(j)\nfurther specifications, including the reference period, related to the topic of international trade in goods.\nThose implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 23(2).\n2.   When exercising the powers referred to in paragraph 1 with regard to the simplifications, the Commission shall take into account the size and importance of the business economies, in accordance with the principle of proportionality, in order to alleviate the burden on enterprises. In addition, the Commission shall ensure that the input needed for compiling the accounting frameworks of national and regional accounts in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 549/2013 and of balance of payments statistics in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 184/2005 is maintained. Implementing acts, except for the first implementing acts to be adopted pursuant to this Regulation, shall be adopted at least 18 months before the end of the reference period of the data for the topics listed in Annex I. For the topics of innovation and ICT usage and e-commerce the implementing acts shall be adopted, respectively, at least six and fifteen months before the end of the reference period of the data.\n3.   When adopting implementing acts in accordance with point (a) of paragraph 1, except for the topics listed in points (b), (c) and (d) of Article 6(2), the Commission shall ensure that the number of variables in each domain listed in Article 6(1) does not exceed:\n(a)\n22 variables for the domain short-term business statistics;\n(b)\n93 variables for the domain country-level business statistics;\n(c)\n31 variables for the domain regional business statistics; and\n(d)\n26 variables for the domain statistics on international activities.\n4.

trade of manufactured goods and services.\nThe European framework for statistical business registers is the authoritative source for deriving high quality and harmonised statistical business register populations for the production of European business statistics. It comprises:\nnational statistical business registers covering all enterprises and their local units carrying out economic activities contributing to the gross domestic product (GDP);\nthe EuroGroups Register covering all enterprises and their legal units carrying out economic activities contributing to the GDP which are part of a multinational group;\nthe data exchanges between them.\nNational statistical authorities in EU countries may use the following sources for producing business statistics and setting up national statistical business registers:\nsurveys;\nadministrative records, including information from tax and customs authorities, such as annual financial statements;\nexchanged microdata;\nother relevant data that are comparable and meet the specific quality requirements.\nEuropean business statistics cover the following areas:\nshort-term;\ncountry-level;\nregional;\ninternational.\nEach area must include one or more key topics, for example business population, outputs and performance, ICT usage and e-commerce, R & D inputs, global value chains and international trade in goods and services. Annex I to the regulation describes the topics in detail.\nAnnex II sets out the frequency (monthly, quarterly, annually or multiannually), the reference period and the statistical unit for each topic.\nEU countries:\nestablish 1 or more national statistical business registers. These are the basis for: preparing and coordinating surveys,information for the statistical analysis of the business population and its demography,use of administrative data,identifying and constructing statistical units;\nensure the quality of the European business statistics, the national statistical business registers and the EuroGroups Register;\nsend the European Commission (Eurostat) data as well as quality and metadata reports.\nSpecific rules apply to the exchange between Eurostat, national statistical authorities and central banks and the European Central Bank of confidential data on multinational groups and internal EU trade in goods, provided this is exclusively for statistical purposes.\nEurostat:\nsets up the EuroGroups Register of multinational enterprise groups;\nassesses the quality of the data it receives;\nprovides annual quality and metadata reports related to the EuroGroups Register;\nmay launch pilot studies that national authorities carry out voluntarily where it identifies a need for new or improved data.\nThe Commission may adopt delegated and implementing acts to amend the legislation, provided these do not impose significant additional cost or burden on national authorities or respondents. It has adopted the following acts.\nImplementing Regulation (EU) 2020/1030 laying down the specifications of data requirements for the topic ‘ICT usage and e-commerce’ for the reference year 2021, pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2019/2152.\nImplementing Regulation (EU) 2020/1197 laying down specifications and arrangements pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2019/2152 on European business statistics, repealing 10 legal acts in the field of business statistics.\nImplementing Regulation (EU) 2020/1470 on the nomenclature of countries and territories for the European statistics on international trade in goods and on the geographical breakdown for other business statistics.
