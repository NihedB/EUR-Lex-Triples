The decision confirms EU countries’ commitment to implement the convention’s articles.\nThe convention has 3 aims:\nconservation of biological diversity (i.e. the variety of living things found on Earth);\nsustainable use of the components of biological diversity;\nfair and equitable sharing of the benefits from the use of genetic resources.\nBiological diversity has major ecological, genetic, social, economic, scientific, educational, cultural, leisure and aesthetic benefits.\nKEY POINTS\n              \nThe convention stipulates that each signatory government will:\ncooperate with fellow governments and international organisations to ensure the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity;\ndevelop appropriate strategies and integrate protection of biodiversity into national decision-making, cross-cutting plans, programmes and policies;\nidentify and monitor biodiversity and factors that influence it;\nconserve biodiversity by: establishing and duly managing protected areas and protecting ecosystems and natural habitats;promoting environmentally sound and sustainable development in areas adjacent to protected areas;restoring degraded ecosystems and helping recovery of threatened species;regulating, managing or controlling the risks associated with the use and release of living modified organisms from biotechnology (i.e. genetically modified organisms);preventing the introduction of, controlling or eradicating invasive alien species;protecting and encouraging traditional use of biological resources;adopting complementary conservation measures.\nThe convention further provides that signatories shall:\nintegrate biodiversity considerations into national decision-making;\navoid or minimise adverse impact from the use of biological resources (e.g. by means of environmental impact assessments);\nencourage cooperation on biodiversity conservation between authorities and the private sector and put in place incentives;\nassist developing countries to identify, conserve and make sustainable use of their biological diversity by providing research, scientific and technical education and appropriate training;\npromote awareness among the general public of the importance of biological diversity;\nassess the impact that decisions might have on biodiversity or on their neighbours.\nNational governments will facilitate access to their genetic resources for environmentally sound uses on mutually agreed terms, and subject to prior informed consent.\nParties shall ensure fair sharing of monetary and non-monetary benefits from the use (research and development) of those genetic resources.\nNational governments agree to:\nshare technology, particularly with developing countries;\nexchange publicly available information on the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity;\npromote international and scientific cooperation;\nshare the results and benefits of biotechnologies from genetic resources.\nThe Global Environment Facility provides financial resources to developing countries to implement the convention. Its core budget comes from national governments with significant additional voluntary contributions.\nDATE OF ENTRY INTO FORCEThe convention entered into force on 29 December 1993.\nBACKGROUND\n              \nTwo protocols have been agreed under the convention. The Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety governs the movements of living modified organisms from modern biotechnology from one country to another. The second is the Nagoya Protocol on Access and Benefit Sharing. The EU is party to both.\nIn October 2010 in Nagoya, Japan, the parties to the convention agreed on a 10-year strategic plan to combat biodiversity loss and defined 20 targets, known as the Aichi targets, to achieve this objective. These commitments are reflected in the EU biodiversity strategy to 2020.\nFor more information, see:\nNature and biodiversity (European Commission).\nMAIN DOCUMENTS\n            \nCouncil Decision 93/626/EEC of 25 October 1993 concerning the conclusion of the Convention on Biological Diversity (OJ L 309, 13.12.1993, pp. 1-2)\nConvention on biological diversity (OJ L 309, 13.12.1993, pp. 3-20)\nRELATED DOCUMENTS\n            \nCartagena protocol on biosafety to the convention on biological diversity (OJ L 201, 31.7.2002, pp. 50-65)\nNagoya Protocol on Access to Genetic Resources and the Fair and Equitable Sharing of Benefits Arising from their Utilization to the Convention on Biological Diversity (OJ L 150, 20.5.2014, pp. 234-249)\nRegulation (EU) No 1143/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 October 2014 on the prevention and management of the introduction and spread of invasive alien species (OJ L 317, 4.11.2014, pp. 35-55)\nSuccessive amendments to Regulation (EU) No 1143/2014 have been incorporated in the original text.
