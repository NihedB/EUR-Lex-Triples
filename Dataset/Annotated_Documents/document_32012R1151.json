{"celex_id": "32012R1151", "reference": "14.12.2012\nEN\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\nL 343/1\nREGULATION (EU) No 1151/2012 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL\nof 21 November 2012\non quality schemes for agricultural products and foodstuffs\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 43(2) and the first paragraph of Article 118 thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee (1),\nHaving regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions (2),\nActing in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure (3),\nWhereas:\n(1)\nThe quality and diversity of the Union’s agricultural, fisheries and aquaculture production is one of its important strengths, giving a competitive advantage to the Union’s producers and making a major contribution to its living cultural and gastronomic heritage. This is due to the skills and determination of Union farmers and producers who have kept traditions alive while taking into account the developments of new production methods and material.\n(2)\nCitizens and consumers in the Union increasingly demand quality as well as traditional products. They are also concerned to maintain the diversity of the agricultural production in the Union. This generates a demand for agricultural products or foodstuffs with identifiable specific characteristics, in particular those linked to their geographical origin.\n(3)\nProducers can only continue to produce a diverse range of quality products if they are rewarded fairly for their effort. This requires that they are able to communicate to buyers and consumers the characteristics of their product under conditions of fair competition. It also requires them to be able to correctly identify their products on the marketplace.\n(4)\nOperating quality schemes for producers which reward them for their efforts to produce a diverse range of quality products can benefit the rural economy. This is particularly the case in less favoured areas, in mountain areas and in the most remote regions, where the farming sector accounts for a significant part of the economy and production costs are high. In this way quality schemes are able to contribute to and complement rural development policy as well as market and income support policies of the common agricultural policy (CAP). In particular, they may contribute to areas in which the farming sector is of greater economic importance and, especially, to disadvantaged areas.\n(5)\nThe Europe 2020 policy priorities as set out in the Commission Communication entitled ‘Europe 2020: A strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth’, include the aims of achieving a competitive economy based on knowledge and innovation and fostering a high-employment economy delivering social and territorial cohesion. Agricultural product quality policy should therefore provide producers with the right tools to better identify and promote those of their products that have specific characteristics while protecting those producers against unfair practices.\n(6)\nThe set of complementary measures envisaged should respect the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality.\n(7)\nAgricultural product quality policy measures are laid down in Council Regulation (EEC) No 1601/91 of 10 June 1991 laying down general rules on the definition, description and presentation of aromatized wines, aromatized wine-based drinks and aromatized wine-product cocktails (4); Council Directive 2001/110/EC of 20 December 2001 relating to honey (5) and in particular in Article 2 thereof, Council Regulation (EC) No 247/2006 of 30 January 2006 laying down specific measures for agriculture in the outermost regions of the Union (6) and in particular in Article 14 thereof; Council Regulation (EC) No 509/2006 of 20 March 2006 on agricultural products and foodstuffs as traditional specialities guaranteed (7); Council Regulation (EC) No 510/2006 of 20 March 2006 on the protection of geographical indications and designations of origin for agricultural products and foodstuffs (8); Council Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 of 22 October 2007 establishing a common organisation of agricultural markets and on specific provisions for certain agricultural products (Single CMO Regulation) (9) and in particular in Part II, Title II, Chapter I, Section I and in Section Ia, Subsection I thereof; Council Regulation (EC) No 834/2007 of 28 June 2007 on organic production and labelling of organic products (10); and Regulation (EC) No 110/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 January 2008 on the definition, description, presentation, labelling and the protection of geographical indications of spirit drinks (11).\n(8)\nThe labelling of agricultural products and foodstuffs should be subject to the general rules laid down in Directive 2000/13/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 March 2000 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the labelling, presentation and advertising of foodstuffs (12), and in particular the provisions aimed at preventing labelling that may confuse or mislead consumers.\n(9)\nThe Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions on agricultural product quality policy identified the achievement of a greater overall coherence and consistency of agricultural product quality policy as a priority.\n(10)\nThe geographical indications scheme for agricultural products and foodstuffs and the traditional specialities guaranteed scheme have certain common objectives and provisions.\n(11)\nThe Union has for some time been pursuing an approach that aims to simplify the regulatory framework of the CAP. This approach should also be applied to regulations in the field of agricultural product quality policy, without, in so doing, calling into question the specific characteristics of those products.\n(12)\nSome regulations that form part of the agricultural product quality policy have been reviewed recently but are not yet fully implemented. As a result, they should not be included in this Regulation. However, they may be incorporated at a later stage, once the legislation has been fully implemented.\n(13)\nIn the light of the aforementioned considerations, the following provisions should be amalgamated into a single legal framework comprising the new or updated provisions of Regulations (EC) No 509/2006 and (EC) No 510/2006 and those provisions of Regulations (EC) No 509/2006 and (EC) No 510/2006 that are maintained.\n(14)\nIn the interests of clarity and transparency, Regulations (EC) No 509/2006 and (EC) No 510/2006 should therefore be repealed and replaced by this Regulation.\n(15)\nThe scope of this Regulation should be limited to the agricultural products intended for human consumption listed in Annex I to the Treaty and to a list of products outside the scope of that Annex that are closely linked to agricultural production or to the rural economy.\n(16)\nThe rules provided for in this Regulation should apply without affecting existing Union legislation on wines, aromatised wines, spirit drinks, product of organic farming, or outermost regions.\n(17)\nThe scope for designations of origin and geographical indications should be limited to products for which an intrinsic link exists between product or foodstuff characteristics and geographical origin. The inclusion in the current scheme of only certain types of chocolate as confectionery products is an anomaly that should be corrected.\n(18)\nThe specific objectives of protecting designations of origin and geographical indications are securing a fair return for farmers and producers for the qualities and characteristics of a given product, or of its mode of production, and providing clear information on products with specific characteristics linked to geographical origin, thereby enabling consumers to make more informed purchasing choices.\n(19)\nEnsuring uniform respect throughout the Union for the intellectual property rights related to names protected in the Union is a priority that can be achieved more effectively at Union level.\n(20)\nA Union framework that protects designations of origin and geographical indications by providing for their inclusion on a register facilitates the development of those instruments, since the resulting, more uniform, approach ensures fair competition between the producers of products bearing such indications and enhances the credibility of the products in the consumers’ eyes. Provision should be made for the development of designations of origin and geographical indications at Union level and for promoting the creation of mechanisms for their protection in third countries in the framework of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) or multilateral and bilateral agreements, thereby contributing to the recognition of the quality of products and of their model of production as a factor that adds value.\n(21)\nIn the light of the experience gained from the implementation of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2081/92 of 14 July 1992 on the protection of geographical indications and designations of origin for agricultural products and foodstuffs (13) and Regulation (EC) No 510/2006, there is a need to address certain issues, to clarify and simplify some rules and to streamline the procedures of this scheme.\n(22)\nIn the light of existing practice, the two different instruments for identifying the link between the product and its geographical origin, namely the protected designation of origin and the protected geographical indication, should be further defined and maintained. Without changing the concept of those instruments, some modifications to the definitions should be adopted in order to better take into account the definition of geographical indications laid down in the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights and to make them simpler and clearer for operators to understand.\n(23)\nAn agricultural product or foodstuff bearing such a geographical description should meet certain conditions set out in a specification, such as specific requirements aimed at protecting the natural resources or landscape of the production area or improving the welfare of farm animals.\n(24)\nTo qualify for protection in the territories of Member States, designations of origin and geographical indications should be registered only at Union level. With effect from the date of application for such registration at Union level, Member States should be able to grant transitional protection at national level without affecting intra-Union or international trade. The protection afforded by this Regulation upon registration, should be equally available to designations of origin and geographical indications of third countries that meet the corresponding criteria and that are protected in their country of origin.\n(25)\nThe registration procedure at Union level should enable any natural or legal person with a legitimate interest from a Member State, other than the Member State of the application, or from a third country, to exercise their rights by notifying their opposition.\n(26)\nEntry in the register of protected designations of origin and protected geographical indications should also provide information to consumers and to those involved in trade.\n(27)\nThe Union negotiates international agreements, including those concerning the protection of designations of origin and geographical indications, with its trade partners. In order to facilitate the provision to the public of information about the names so protected, and in particular to ensure protection and control of the use to which those names are put, the names may be entered in the register of protected designations of origin and protected geographical indications. Unless specifically identified as designations of origin in such international agreements, the names should be entered in the register as protected geographical indications.\n(28)\nIn view of their specific nature, special provisions concerning labelling should be adopted in respect of protected designations of origin and protected geographical indications that require producers to use the appropriate Union symbols or indications on packaging. In the case of Union names, the use of such symbols or indications should be made obligatory in order to make this category of products, and the guarantees attached to them, better known to consumers and in order to permit easier identification of these products on the market, thereby facilitating checks. Taking into account the requirements of the WTO, the use of such symbols or indications should be made voluntary for third-country geographical indications and designations of origin.\n(29)\nProtection should be granted to names included in the register with the aim of ensuring that they are used fairly and in order to prevent practices liable to mislead consumers. In addition, the means of ensuring that geographical indications and designations of origin are protected should be clarified, particularly as regards the role of producer groups and competent authorities of Member States.\n(30)\nProvision should be made for specific derogations that permit, for transitional periods, the use of a registered name alongside other names. Those derogations should be simplified and clarified. In certain cases, in order to overcome temporary difficulties and with the long-term objective of ensuring that all producers comply with the specifications, those derogations may be granted for a period of up to 10 years.\n(31)\nThe scope of the protection granted under this Regulation should be clarified, in particular with regard to those limitations on registration of new trade marks set out in Directive 2008/95/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 October 2008 to approximate the laws of the Member States relating to trade marks (14) that conflict with the registration of protected designations of origin and protected geographical indications as is already the case for the registration of new trade marks at Union level. Such clarification is also necessary with regard to the holders of prior rights in intellectual property, in particular those concerning trade marks and homonymous names registered as protected designations of origin or as protected geographical indications.\n(32)\nProtection of designations of origin and geographical indications should be extended to the misuse, imitation and evocation of the registered names on goods as well as on services in order to ensure a high level of protection and to align that protection with that which applies to the wine sector. When protected designations of origin or protected geographical indications are used as ingredients, the Commission Communication entitled ‘Guidelines on the labelling of foodstuffs using protected designations of origin (PDOs) or protected geographical indications (PGIs) as ingredients’ should be taken into account.\n(33)\nThe names already registered under Regulation (EC) No 510/2006 on 3 January 2013 should continue to be protected under this Regulation and they should be automatically included in the register.\n(34)\nThe specific objective of the scheme for traditional specialities guaranteed is to help the producers of traditional products to communicate to consumers the value-adding attributes of their product. However, as only a few names have been registered, the current scheme for traditional specialities guaranteed has failed to realise its potential. Current provisions should therefore be improved, clarified and sharpened in order to make the scheme more understandable, operational and attractive to potential applicants.\n(35)\nThe current scheme provides the option to register a name for identification purposes without reservation of the name in the Union. As this option has not been well understood by stakeholders and since the function of identifying traditional products can be better achieved at Member State or regional level in application of the principle of subsidiarity, this option should be discontinued. In the light of experience, the scheme should only deal with the reservation of names across the Union.\n(36)\nTo ensure that names of genuine traditional products are registered under the scheme, the criteria and conditions for registration of a name should be adapted, in particular those concerning the definition of ‘traditional’, which should cover products that have been produced for a significant period of time.\n(37)\nTo ensure that traditional specialities guaranteed comply with their specification and are consistent, producers organised into groups should themselves define the product in a specification. The option of registering a name as a traditional speciality guaranteed should be open to third-country producers.\n(38)\nTo qualify for reservation, traditional specialities guaranteed should be registered at Union level. The entry in the register should also provide information to consumers and to those involved in the trade.\n(39)\nIn order to avoid creating unfair conditions of competition, any producer, including a third-country producer, should be able to use a registered name of a traditional speciality guaranteed, provided that the product concerned complies with the requirements of the relevant specification and the producer is covered by a system of controls. For traditional specialities guaranteed produced within the Union, the Union symbol should be indicated on the labelling and it should be possible to associate it with the indication ‘traditional speciality guaranteed’.\n(40)\nIn order to protect registered names from misuse, or from practices that might mislead consumers, their use should be reserved.\n(41)\nFor those names already registered under Regulation (EC) No 509/2006 that, on 3 January 2013, would otherwise not be covered by the scope of this Regulation, the terms of use laid down in Regulation (EC) No 509/2006 should continue to apply for a transitional period.\n(42)\nA procedure should be introduced for registering names that are registered without reservation of name pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 509/2006, enabling them to be registered with reservation of name.\n(43)\nProvision should also be made for transitional measures applicable to registration applications received by the Commission before 3 January 2013.\n(44)\nA second tier of quality systems, based on quality terms which add value, which can be communicated on the internal market and which are to be applied voluntarily, should be introduced. Those optional quality terms should refer to specific horizontal characteristics, with regard to one or more categories of products, farming methods or processing attributes which apply in specific areas. The optional quality term ‘mountain product’ has met the conditions up to now and will add value to the product on the market. In order to facilitate the application of Directive 2000/13/EC where the labelling of foodstuffs may give rise to consumer confusion in relation to optional quality terms, including in particular ‘mountain products’, the Commission may adopt guidelines.\n(45)\nIn order to provide mountain producers with an effective tool to better market their product and to reduce the actual risks of consumer confusion as to the mountain provenance of products in the market place, provision should be made for the definition at Union level of an optional quality term for mountain products. The definition of mountain areas should build on the general classification criteria employed to identify a mountain area in Council Regulation (EC) No 1257/1999 of 17 May 1999 on support for rural development from the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund (EAGGF) (15).\n(46)\nThe added value of the geographical indications and traditional specialities guaranteed is based on consumer trust. It is only credible if accompanied by effective verification and controls. Those quality schemes should be subject to a monitoring system of official controls, in line with the principles set out in Regulation (EC) No 882/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on official controls performed to ensure the verification of compliance with feed and food law, animal health and animal welfare rules (16), and should include a system of checks at all stages of production, processing and distribution. In order to help Member States to better apply provisions of Regulation (EC) No 882/2004 for the controls of geographical indications and traditional specialities guaranteed, references to the most relevant articles should be mentioned in this Regulation.\n(47)\nTo guarantee to the consumer the specific characteristics of geographical indications and traditional specialities guaranteed, operators should be subject to a system that verifies compliance with the product specification.\n(48)\nIn order to ensure that they are impartial and effective, the competent authorities should meet a number of operational criteria. Provisions on delegating some competences of performing specific control tasks to control bodies should be envisaged.\n(49)\nEuropean standards (EN standards) developed by the European Committee for Standardisation (CEN) and international standards developed by the International Organisation for Standardisation (ISO) should be used for the accreditation of the control bodies as well as by those bodies for their operations. The accreditation of those bodies should take place in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 765/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 9 July 2008 setting out the requirements for accreditation and market surveillance relating to the marketing of products (17).\n(50)\nInformation on control activities for geographical indications and traditional specialities guaranteed should be included in the multiannual national control plans and annual report prepared by the Member States in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 882/2004.\n(51)\nMember States should be authorised to charge a fee to cover the costs incurred.\n(52)\nExisting rules concerning the continued use of names that are generic should be clarified so that generic terms that are similar to or form part of a name or term that is protected or reserved should retain their generic status.\n(53)\nThe date for establishing the seniority of a trade mark and of a designation of origin or a geographical indication should be that of the date of application of the trade mark for registration in the Union or in the Member States and the date of application for protection of a designation of origin or a geographical indication to the Commission.\n(54)\nThe provisions dealing with the refusal or coexistence of a designation of origin or a geographical indication on the ground of conflict with a prior trade mark should continue to apply.\n(55)\nThe criteria by which subsequent trade marks should be refused or, if registered, invalidated on the ground that they conflict with a prior designation of origin or geographical indication should correspond to the scope of protection of designation of origin or a geographical indication laid down.\n(56)\nThe provisions of systems establishing intellectual property rights, and particularly of those established by the quality scheme for designations of origin and geographical indications or those established under trade mark law, should not be affected by the reservation of names and the establishment of indications and symbols pursuant to the quality schemes for traditional specialities guaranteed and for optional quality terms.\n(57)\nThe role of groups should be clarified and recognised. Groups play an essential role in the application process for the registration of names of designations of origin and geographical indications and traditional specialities guaranteed, as well as in the amendment of specifications and cancellation requests. The group can also develop activities related to the surveillance of the enforcement of the protection of the registered names, the compliance of the production with the product specification, the information and promotion of the registered name as well as, in general, any activity aimed at improving the value of the registered names and effectiveness of the quality schemes. Moreover, it should monitor the position of the products on the market. Nevertheless, these activities should not facilitate nor lead to anti-competitive conduct incompatible with Articles 101 and 102 of the Treaty.\n(58)\nTo ensure that registered names of designations of origin and geographical indications and traditional specialities guaranteed meet the conditions laid down by this Regulation, applications should be examined by the national authorities of the Member State concerned, in compliance with minimum common provisions, including a national opposition procedure. The Commission should subsequently scrutinise applications to ensure that there are no manifest errors and that Union law and the interests of stakeholders outside the Member State of application have been taken into account.\n(59)\nRegistration as designations of origin, geographical indications and traditional specialities guaranteed should be open to names that relate to products originating in third countries and that satisfy the conditions laid down by this Regulation.\n(60)\nThe symbols, indications and abbreviations identifying participation in a quality scheme, and the rights therein pertaining to the Union, should be protected in the Union as well as in third countries with the aim of ensuring that they are used on genuine products and that consumers are not misled as to the qualities of products. Furthermore, in order for the protection to be effective, the Commission should have recourse to reasonable budget resources on a centralised basis within the framework of Council Regulation (EC) No 1698/2005 of 20 September 2005 on support for rural development by the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD) (18) and in accordance with Article 5 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005 of 21 June 2005 on the financing of the common agricultural policy (19).\n(61)\nThe registration procedure for protected designations of origin, protected geographical indications and traditional specialities guaranteed, including the scrutiny and the opposition periods, should be shortened and improved, in particular as regards decision making. The Commission, in certain circumstances acting with the assistance of Member States, should be responsible for decision-making on registration. Procedures should be laid down to allow the amendment of product specifications after registration and the cancellation of registered names, in particular if the product no longer complies with the corresponding product specification or if a name is no longer used in the market place.\n(62)\nIn order to facilitate cross-border applications for joint registration of protected designations of origin, protected geographical indications or traditional specialities guaranteed, provision should be made for appropriate procedures.\n(63)\nIn order to supplement or amend certain non-essential elements of this Regulation, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty should be delegated to the Commission in respect of supplementing the list of products set out in Annex I to this Regulation; establishing the restrictions and derogations with regard to the sourcing of feed in the case of a designation of origin; establishing restrictions and derogations with regard to the slaughtering of live animals or with regard to the sourcing of raw materials; laying down rules which limit the information contained in the product specification; establishing the Union symbols; laying down additional transitional rules in order to protect the rights and legitimate interests of producers or stakeholders concerned; laying down further details on the eligibility criteria for the names of traditional specialities guaranteed; laying down detailed rules relating to the criteria for optional quality terms; reserving an additional optional quality term, laying down its conditions of use and amending those conditions; laying down derogations to the use of the term ‘mountain product’ and establishing the methods of production, and other criteria relevant for the application of that optional quality term, in particular, laying down the conditions under which raw materials or feedstuffs are permitted to come from outside the mountain areas; laying down additional rules for determining the generic status of terms in the Union; laying down rules for determining the use of the name of a plant variety or of an animal breed; defining the rules for carrying out the national objection procedure for joint applications concerning more than one national territory; and for complementing the rules of the application process, the opposition process, the amendment application process and the cancellation process in general. It is of particular importance that the Commission carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level. The Commission, when preparing and drawing up delegated acts, should ensure a simultaneous, timely and appropriate transmission of relevant documents to the European Parliament and to the Council.\n(64)\nIn order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of this Regulation, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission as regards laying down rules on the form of the product specification; laying down detailed rules on the form and content of the register of protected designations of origin and protected geographical indications; defining the technical characteristics of the Union symbols and indications as well as the rules on their use on products, including the appropriate linguistic versions to be used; granting and extending transitional periods for temporary derogations for use of protected designations of origin and protected geographical indication; laying down detailed rules on the form and content of the register of traditional specialities guaranteed; laying down rules for the protection of traditional specialities guaranteed; laying down all measures relating to forms, procedures and other technical details for the application of Title IV; laying down rules for the use of optional quality terms; laying down rules for the uniform protection of indications, abbreviations and symbols referring to the quality schemes; laying down detailed rules on the procedure, form and presentation of applications for registration and of oppositions; rejecting the application; deciding on the registration of a name if an agreement has not been reached; laying down detailed rules on the procedure, form and presentation of an amendment application; cancelling the registration of a protected designation of origin, a protected geographical indication or a traditional speciality guaranteed; and laying down detailed rules on the procedure and form of the cancellation process and on the presentation of the requests for cancellation. Those powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 February 2011 laying down the rules and general principles concerning mechanisms for control by Member States of the Commission’s exercise of implementing powers (20).\n(65)\nIn respect of establishing and maintaining registers of protected designations of origin, protected geographical indications and traditional specialties guaranteed, recognised under this scheme; defining the means by which the name and address of product certification bodies are to be made public; and registering a name if there is no notice of opposition or no admissible reasoned statement of opposition or in the case there is one the agreement has been reached, the Commission should be empowered to adopt implementing acts without applying Regulation (EU) No 182/2011,\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nTITLE I\nGENERAL PROVISIONS\nArticle 1\nObjectives\n1.   This Regulation aims to help producers of agricultural products and foodstuffs to communicate the product characteristics and farming attributes of those products and foodstuffs to buyers and consumers, thereby ensuring:\n(a)\nfair competition for farmers and producers of agricultural products and foodstuffs having value-adding characteristics and attributes;\n(b)\nthe availability to consumers of reliable information pertaining to such products;\n(c)\nrespect for intellectual property rights; and\n(d)\nthe integrity of the internal market.\nThe measures set out in this Regulation are intended to support agricultural and processing activities and the farming systems associated with high quality products, thereby contributing to the achievement of rural development policy objectives.\n2.   This Regulation establishes quality schemes which provide the basis for the identification and, where appropriate, protection of names and terms that, in particular, indicate or describe agricultural products with:\n(a)\nvalue-adding characteristics; or\n(b)\nvalue-adding attributes as a result of the farming or processing methods used in their production, or of the place of their production or marketing.\nArticle 2\nScope\n1.   This Regulation covers agricultural products intended for human consumption listed in Annex I to the Treaty and other agricultural products and foodstuffs listed in Annex I to this Regulation.\nIn order to take into account international commitments or new production methods or material, the Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts, in accordance with Article 56, supplementing the list of products set out in Annex I to this Regulation. Such products shall be closely linked to agricultural products or to the rural economy.\n2.   This Regulation shall not apply to spirit drinks, aromatised wines or grapevine products as defined in Annex XIb to Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007, with the exception of wine-vinegars.\n3.   This Regulation shall apply without prejudice to other specific Union provisions relating to the placing of products on the market and, in particular, to the single common organisation of the markets, and to food labelling.\n4.   Directive 98/34/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 June 1998 laying down a procedure for the provision of information in the field of technical standards and regulations and of rules on Information Society services (21) shall not apply to the quality schemes established by this Regulation.\nArticle 3\nDefinitions\nFor the purposes of this Regulation the following definitions shall apply:\n(1)\n‘quality schemes’ means the schemes established under Titles II, III and IV;\n(2)\n‘group’ means any association, irrespective of its legal form, mainly composed of producers or processors working with the same product;\n(3)\n‘traditional’ means proven usage on the domestic market for a period that allows transmission between generations; this period is to be at least 30 years;\n(4)\n‘labelling’ means any words, particulars, trade marks, brand name, pictorial matter or symbol relating to a foodstuff and placed on any packaging, document, notice, label, ring or collar accompanying or referring to such foodstuff;\n(5)\n‘specific character’ in relation to a product means the characteristic production attributes which distinguish a product clearly from other similar products of the same category;\n(6)\n‘generic terms ’ means the names of products which, although relating to the place, region or country where the product was originally produced or marketed, have become the common name of a product in the Union;\n(7)\n‘production step’ means production, processing or preparation;\n(8)\n‘processed products’ means foodstuffs resulting from the processing of unprocessed products. Processed products may contain ingredients that are necessary for their manufacture or to give them specific characteristics.\nTITLE II\nPROTECTED DESIGNATIONS OF ORIGIN AND PROTECTED GEOGRAPHICAL INDICATIONS\nArticle 4\nObjective\nA scheme for protected designations of origin and protected geographical indications is established in order to help producers of products linked to a geographical area by:\n(a)\nsecuring fair returns for the qualities of their products;\n(b)\nensuring uniform protection of the names as an intellectual property right in the territory of the Union;\n(c)\nproviding clear information on the value-adding attributes of the product to consumers.\nArticle 5\nRequirements for designations of origin and geographical indications\n1.   For the purpose of this Regulation, ‘designation of origin’ is a name which identifies a product:\n(a)\noriginating in a specific place, region or, in exceptional cases, a country;\n(b)\nwhose quality or characteristics are essentially or exclusively due to a particular geographical environment with its inherent natural and human factors; and\n(c)\nthe production steps of which all take place in the defined geographical area.\n2.   For the purpose of this Regulation, ‘geographical indication’ is a name which identifies a product:\n(a)\noriginating in a specific place, region or country;\n(b)\nwhose given quality, reputation or other characteristic is essentially attributable to its geographical origin; and\n(c)\nat least one of the production steps of which take place in the defined geographical area.\n3.   Notwithstanding paragraph 1, certain names shall be treated as designations of origin even though the raw materials for the products concerned come from a geographical area larger than, or different from, the defined geographical area, provided that:\n(a)\nthe production area of the raw materials is defined;\n(b)\nspecial conditions for the production of the raw materials exist;\n(c)\nthere are control arrangements to ensure that the conditions referred to in point (b) are adhered to; and\n(d)\nthe designations of origin in question were recognised as designations of origin in the country of origin before 1 May 2004.\nOnly live animals, meat and milk may be considered as raw materials for the purposes of this paragraph.\n4.   In order to take into account the specific character of production of products of animal origin, the Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts, in accordance with Article 56, concerning restrictions and derogations with regard to the sourcing of feed in the case of a designation of origin.\nIn addition, in order to take into account the specific character of certain products or areas, the Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 56, concerning restrictions and derogations with regard to the slaughtering of live animals or with regard to the sourcing of raw materials.\nThese restrictions and derogations shall, based on objective criteria, take into account quality or usage and recognised know-how or natural factors.\nArticle 6\nGeneric nature, conflicts with names of plant varieties and animal breeds, with homonyms and trade marks\n1.   Generic terms shall not be registered as protected designations of origin or protected geographical indications.\n2.   A name may not be registered as a designation of origin or geographical indication where it conflicts with a name of a plant variety or an animal breed and is likely to mislead the consumer as to the true origin of the product.\n3.

A name proposed for registration as a designation of origin or geographical indication shall not be registered where, in the light of a trade mark’s reputation and renown and the length of time it has been used, registration of the name proposed as the designation of origin or geographical indication would be liable to mislead the consumer as to the true identity of the product.\nArticle 7\nProduct specification\n1.

In the case of products originating in third countries marketed under a name entered in the register, the indications referred to in paragraph 3 or the Union symbols associated with them may appear on the labelling.\n7.   In order to ensure that the appropriate information is communicated to the consumer, the Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts, in accordance with Article 56, establishing the Union symbols.\nThe Commission may adopt implementing acts defining the technical characteristics of the Union symbols and indications as well as the rules of their use on the products marketed under a protected designation of origin or a protected geographical indication, including rules concerning the appropriate linguistic versions to be used.

Protected designations of origin and protected geographical indications shall not become generic.\n3.   Member States shall take appropriate administrative and judicial steps to prevent or stop the unlawful use of protected designations of origin and protected geographical indications, as referred to in paragraph 1, that are produced or marketed in that Member State.\nTo that end Member States shall designate the authorities that are responsible for taking these steps in accordance with procedures determined by each individual Member State.\nThese authorities shall offer adequate guarantees of objectivity and impartiality, and shall have at their disposal the qualified staff and resources necessary to carry out their functions.\nArticle 14\nRelations between trade marks, designations of origin and geographical indications\n1.

In such cases, the use of the protected designation of origin or protected geographical indication shall be permitted as well as use of the relevant trade marks.\nArticle 15\nTransitional periods for use of protected designations of origin and protected geographical indications\n1.   Without prejudice to Article 14, the Commission may adopt implementing acts granting a transitional period of up to five years to enable products originating in a Member State or a third country the designation of which consists of or contains a name that contravenes Article 13(1) to continue to use the designation under which it was marketed on condition that an admissible statement of opposition under Article 49(3) or Article 51 shows that:\n(a)\nthe registration of the name would jeopardise the existence of an entirely or partly identical name; or\n(b)\nsuch products have been legally marketed with that name in the territory concerned for at least five years preceding the date of the publication provided for point (a) of Article 50(2).\nThose implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 57(2).\n2.

Operators who prepare and store a product marketed under the traditional speciality guaranteed, protected designation of origin or protected geographical indication schemes or who place such products on the market shall also be subject to the controls laid down in Chapter I of this Title.\n3.   Member States shall ensure that operators willing to adhere to the rules of a quality scheme set out in Titles III and IV are able to do so and do not face obstacles to participation that are discriminatory or otherwise not objectively founded.\nArticle 47\nFees\nWithout prejudice to Regulation (EC) No 882/2004 and in particular the provisions of Chapter VI of Title II thereof, Member States may charge a fee to cover their costs of managing the quality schemes, including those incurred in processing applications, statements of opposition, applications for amendments and requests for cancellations provided for in this Regulation.\nCHAPTER IV\nApplication and registration processes for designations of origin, geographical indications, and traditional specialities guaranteed\nArticle 48\nScope of application processes\nThe provisions of this Chapter shall apply in respect of the quality schemes set out in Title II and Title III.\nArticle 49\nApplication for registration of names\n1.   Applications for registration of names under the quality schemes referred to in Article 48 may only be submitted by groups who work with the products with the name to be registered. In the case of a ‘protected designations of origin’ or ‘protected geographical indications’ name that designates a trans-border geographical area or in the case of a ‘traditional specialities guaranteed’ name, several groups from different Member States or third countries may lodge a joint application for registration.\nA single natural or legal person may be treated as a group where it is shown that both of the following conditions are fulfilled:\n(a)\nthe person concerned is the only producer willing to submit an application;\n(b)\nwith regard to protected designations of origin and protected geographical indications, the defined geographical area possesses characteristics which differ appreciably from those of neighbouring areas or the characteristics of the product are different from those produced in neighbouring areas.\n2.   Where the application under the scheme set out in Title II relates to a geographical area in a Member State, or where an application under the scheme set out in Title III is prepared by a group established in a Member State, the application shall be addressed to the authorities of that Member State.\nThe Member State shall scrutinise the application by appropriate means in order to check that it is justified and meets the conditions of the respective scheme.\n3.   As part of the scrutiny referred to in the second subparagraph of paragraph 2 of this Article, the Member State shall initiate a national opposition procedure that ensures adequate publication of the application and that provides for a reasonable period within which any natural or legal person having a legitimate interest and established or resident on its territory may lodge an opposition to the application.\nThe Member State shall examine the admissibility of oppositions received under the scheme set out in Title II in the light of the criteria referred to in Article 10(1), or the admissibility of oppositions received under the scheme set out in Title III in the light of the criteria referred to in Article 21(1).\n4.   If, after assessment of any opposition received, the Member State considers that the requirements of this Regulation are met, it may take a favourable decision and lodge an application dossier with the Commission. It shall in such case inform the Commission of admissible oppositions received from a natural or legal person that have legally marketed the products in question, using the names concerned continuously for at least five years preceding the date of the publication referred to in paragraph 3.\nThe Member State shall ensure that its favourable decision is made public and that any natural or legal person having a legitimate interest has an opportunity to appeal.\nThe Member State shall ensure that the version of the product specification on which its favourable decision is based, is published, and shall provide electronic access to the product specification.\nWith reference to protected designations of origin and protected geographical indications, the Member State shall also ensure adequate publication of the version of the product specification on which the Commission takes its decision pursuant to Article 50(2).\n5.   Where the application under the scheme set out in Title II relates to a geographical area in a third country, or where an application under the scheme set out in Title III is prepared by a group established in a third country, the application shall be lodged with the Commission, either directly or via the authorities of the third country concerned.\n6.   The documents referred to in this Article which are sent to the Commission shall be in one of the official languages of the Union.\n7.   In order to facilitate the application process, the Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts, in accordance with Article 56, defining the rules for carrying out the national objection procedure for joint applications concerning more than one national territory and complementing the rules of the application process.\nThe Commission may adopt implementing acts laying down detailed rules on procedures, form and presentation of applications, including for applications concerning more than one national territory. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 57(2).\nArticle 50\nScrutiny by the Commission and publication for opposition\n1.   The Commission shall scrutinise by appropriate means any application that it receives pursuant to Article 49, in order to check that it is justified and that it meets the conditions of the respective scheme. This scrutiny should not exceed a period of six months. Where this period is exceeded, the Commission shall indicate in writing to the applicant the reasons for the delay.\nThe Commission shall, at least each month, make public the list of names for which registration applications have been submitted to it, as well as their date of submission.\n2.   Where, based on the scrutiny carried out pursuant to the first subparagraph of paragraph 1, the Commission considers that the conditions laid down in this Regulation are fulfilled, it shall publish in the Official Journal of the European Union:\n(a)\nfor applications under the scheme set out in Title II, the single document and the reference to the publication of the product specification;\n(b)\nfor applications under the scheme set out in Title III, the specification.\nArticle 51\nOpposition procedure\n1.   Within three months from the date of publication in the Official Journal of the European Union, the authorities of a Member State or of a third country, or a natural or legal person having a legitimate interest and established in a third country may lodge a notice of opposition with the Commission.\nAny natural or legal person having a legitimate interest, established or resident in a Member State other than that from which the application was submitted, may lodge a notice of opposition with the Member State in which it is established within a time limit permitting an opposition to be lodged pursuant to the first subparagraph.\nA notice of opposition shall contain a declaration that the application might infringe the conditions laid down in this Regulation. A notice of opposition that does not contain this declaration is void.\nThe Commission shall forward the notice of opposition to the authority or body that lodged the application without delay.\n2.   If a notice of opposition is lodged with the Commission and is followed within two months by a reasoned statement of opposition, the Commission shall check the admissibility of this reasoned statement of opposition.\n3.   Within two months after the receipt of an admissible reasoned statement of opposition, the Commission shall invite the authority or person that lodged the opposition and the authority or body that lodged the application to engage in appropriate consultations for a reasonable period that shall not exceed three months.\nThe authority or person that lodged the opposition and the authority or body that lodged the application shall start such appropriate consultations without undue delay. They shall provide each other with the relevant information to assess whether the application for registration complies with the conditions of this Regulation. If no agreement is reached, this information shall also be provided to the Commission.\nAt any time during these three months, the Commission may, at the request of the applicant extend the deadline for the consultations by a maximum of three months.\n4.   Where, following the appropriate consultations referred to in paragraph 3 of this Article, the details published in accordance with Article 50(2) have been substantially amended, the Commission shall repeat the scrutiny referred to in Article 50.\n5.   The notice of opposition, the reasoned statement of opposition and the related documents which are sent to the Commission in accordance with paragraphs 1 to 4 of this Article shall be in one of the official languages of the Union.\n6.   In order to establish clear procedures and deadlines for opposition, the Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts, in accordance with Article 56, complementing the rules of the opposition procedure.\nThe Commission may adopt implementing acts laying down detailed rules on procedures, form and presentation of the oppositions. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 57(2).\nArticle 52\nDecision on registration\n1.   Where, on the basis of the information available to the Commission from the scrutiny carried out pursuant to the first subparagraph of Article 50(1), the Commission considers that the conditions for registration are not fulfilled, it shall adopt implementing acts rejecting the application. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 57(2).\n2.   If the Commission receives no notice of opposition or no admissible reasoned statement of opposition under Article 51, it shall adopt implementing acts, without applying the procedure referred to in Article 57(2), registering the name.\n3.   If the Commission receives an admissible reasoned statement of opposition, it shall, following the appropriate consultations referred to in Article 51(3), and taking into account the results thereof, either:\n(a)\nif an agreement has been reached, register the name by means of implementing acts adopted without applying the procedure referred to in Article 57(2), and, if necessary, amend the information published pursuant to Article 50(2) provided such amendments are not substantial; or\n(b)\nif an agreement has not been reached, adopt implementing acts deciding on the registration. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 57(2).\n4.   Acts of registration and decisions on rejection shall be published in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nArticle 53\nAmendment to a product specification\n1.   A group having a legitimate interest may apply for approval of an amendment to a product specification.\nApplications shall describe and give reasons for the amendments requested.\n2.   Where the amendment involves one or more amendments to the specification that are not minor, the amendment application shall follow the procedure laid down in Articles 49 to 52.\nHowever, if the proposed amendments are minor, the Commission shall approve or reject the application. In the event of the approval of amendments implying a modification of the elements referred to in Article 50(2), the Commission shall publish those elements in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nFor an amendment to be regarded as minor in the case of the quality scheme described in Title II, it shall not:\n(a)\nrelate to the essential characteristics of the product;\n(b)\nalter the link referred to in point (f)(i) or (ii) of Article 7(1);\n(c)\ninclude a change to the name, or to any part of the name of the product;\n(d)\naffect the defined geographical area; or\n(e)\nrepresent an increase in restrictions on trade in the product or its raw materials.\nFor an amendment to be regarded as minor in the case of the quality scheme described in Title III, it shall not:\n(a)\nrelate to the essential characteristics of the product;\n(b)\nintroduce essential changes to the production method; or\n(c)\ninclude a change to the name, or to any part of the name of the product.\nThe scrutiny of the application shall focus on the proposed amendment.\n3.   In order to facilitate the administrative process of an amendment application, including where the amendment does not involve any change to the single document and where it concerns a temporary change in the specification resulting from the imposition of obligatory sanitary or phytosanitary measures by the public authorities, the Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts, in accordance with Article 56, complementing the rules of the amendment application process.\nThe Commission may adopt implementing acts laying down detailed rules on procedures, form and presentation of an amendment application. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 57(2).\nArticle 54\nCancellation\n1.   The Commission may, on its own initiative or at the request of any natural or legal person having a legitimate interest, adopt implementing acts to cancel the registration of a protected designation of origin or of a protected geographical indication or of a traditional speciality guaranteed in the following cases:\n(a)\nwhere compliance with the conditions of the specification is not ensured;\n(b)\nwhere no product is placed on the market under the traditional speciality guaranteed, the protected designation of origin or the protected geographical indication for at least seven years.\nThe Commission may, at the request of the producers of product marketed under the registered name, cancel the corresponding registration.\nThose implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 57(2).\n2.   In order to ensure legal certainty that all parties have the opportunity to defend their rights and legitimate interests, the Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts, in accordance with Article 56 complementing the rules regarding the cancellation process.\nThe Commission may adopt implementing acts laying down detailed rules on procedures and form of the cancellation process, as well as on the presentation of the requests referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 57(2).\nTITLE VI\nPROCEDURAL AND FINAL PROVISIONS\nCHAPTER I\nLocal farming and direct sales\nArticle 55\nReporting on local farming and direct sales\nNo later than 4 January 2014 the Commission shall present a report to the European Parliament and to the Council on the case for a new local farming and direct sales labelling scheme to assist producers in marketing their produce locally. That report shall focus on the ability of the farmer to add value to his produce through the new label, and should take into account other criteria, such as the possibilities of reducing carbon emissions and waste through short production and distribution chains.\nThat report shall, if necessary, be accompanied by appropriate legislative proposals on the creation of a local farming and direct sales labelling scheme.\nCHAPTER II\nProcedural rules\nArticle 56\nExercise of the delegation\n1.

agricultural products and foodstuffs\nSUMMARY OF:\nRegulation (EU) No 1151/2012 on quality schemes for agricultural products and foodstuffs\nWHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?\nIt seeks to enhance Europe’s quality policy for agricultural products by increasing the coherence of various quality schemes.\nIt includes measures to support agricultural and processing activities, along with the farming systems associated with high-quality products, in line with EU rural development policy objectives. The regulation, does not, however, apply to spirit drinks, aromatised wines or grapevine products.\nKEY POINTS\n              \nThe regulation’s main features are:\nit groups in a single regulation rules for registering products as Protected Designation of Origin (PDO), Protected Geographical Indication (PGI) and Traditional Speciality Guaranteed (TSG);\nit lays down a single set of rules for PDO, PGI and TSG as regards procedures and the role of producers;\nit strengthens and simplifies the PDO, PGI and TSG schemes;\nit reinforces and clarifies the level of protection of registered names and the common EU symbols;\nit shortens and simplifies the procedure to register names (PDO, PGI and TSG);\nit requires EU products registered and marketed as PDO, PGI or TSG in line with this regulation to have labels showing the European Union symbol and the name of the product (since 4 January 2016);\nit introduces a new framework to develop optional quality terms, providing consumers with extra information. This includes the new term mountain product.\nAmending legislation\nIn 2017, Regulation (EU) No 1151/2012 was amended by Regulation (EU) 2017/625 on official controls and other official activities performed to ensure the application of food and feed law, rules on animal health and welfare, plant health and plant protection products (see summary).\nThe amended text requires that verification of compliance with product specifications before placing products on the market be carried out by:\nthe competent authorities designated in accordance with amending Regulation (EU) 2017/625 (Article 4); or\ndelegated bodies (as defined in Article 3(5) of amending Regulation (EU) 2017/625).\nDelegated bodies performing controls in non-EU countries must be accredited to the relevant harmonised standard for ‘conformity assessment — requirements for bodies certifying products, processes and services’. These bodies may be accredited either by a national accreditation body outside the EU, in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 765/2008 (see summary), or by an accreditation body outside the EU that is a signatory of a multilateral recognition arrangement under the auspices of the International Accreditation Forum.\nFROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?\nRegulation (EU) No 1151/2012 has applied since 3 January 2013, although Article 12(3) and Article 23(3) have applied since 4 January 2016, without prejudice to products already placed on the market before that date.\nAmending Regulation (EU) 2017/625 has applied since 14 December 2019.\nBACKGROUND\n              \nFor more information, see:\nAims of EU quality schemes (European Commission).\nMAIN DOCUMENT\n            \nRegulation (EU) No 1151/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 November 2012 on quality schemes for agricultural products and foodstuffs (OJ L 343, 14.12.2012, pp. 1–29).\nSuccessive amendments to Regulation (EU) No 1151/2012 have been incorporated into the original text.
