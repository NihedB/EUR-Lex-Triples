Introduction\nThis Annex provides a breakdown of the contributions of the Parties referred to in Article 4. They are related to the design, development and implementation of EGNOS up to the completion of a first implementation phase involving the use of at least two geostationary navigation transponders. A description of EGNOS is given below.\nThe EGNOS system is an augmentation of existing satellite-based radio-navigation and positioning systems using geostationary satellites that will enhance the performance of these systems over Europe and more generally over the whole geostationary broadcast area(s).\nBy using navigation transponders on geostationary satellites and processing data from a network of terrestrial monitoring stations, EGNOS shall provide additional satellite ranging capability, service integrity and wide area differential (WAD) correction data. The aim of the WAD service is to improve the accuracy of existing satellite-based radio-navigation systems, in particular over Europe. The EGNOS system will improve the overall satellite navigation service availability.\nThe EGNOS infrastructure will consist of:\n—\nmission control centres (MCCs),\n—\nnavigation transponders on geostationary satellites,\n—\nnavigation land earth stations (NLESs) for accessing the navigation transponders,\n—\nranging and integrity monitoring stations (RIMSs),\n—\nupgraded RIMSs for accurate orbit determination of the geostationary satellites hosting the navigation transponders,\n—\na network of reference stations for verifying the integrity of the WAD corrections computed by EGNOS. Simplified RIMSs will be used as reference stations.\n2.   ESA contribution\nESA shall contribute through the implementation of its ARTES programme, in particular Element 9 thereof.\nIn particular, ESA shall undertake the following activities:\n—\nEGNOS project management,\n—\nmission analysis and system definition,\n—\nearly trials,\n—\ntest and simulation,\n—\nranging-system development,\n—\nintegrity-system development,\n—\nWAD system development,\n—\ntesting and technical validation of EGNOS, including provisions for ground communications and MCCs running costs during the testing and validation period.\n3.   Eurocontrol contribution\nEurocontrol shall undertake, in the context of its satellite navigation applications activities and in close cooperation with the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO), the following:\n—\nprovision of civil aviation user requirements,\n—\noperational testing and validation for civil aviation GNSS 1 users. This will include static ground measurements, dedicated flight trials and data recording campaigns on commercial airliners,\n—\nsupport to the European activities to ensure that GNSS is operationally acceptable for civil aviation. This work shall be carried out with the widest cooperation possible within the civil aviation environment, including the Joint Aviation Authorities (JAA).\n4.
