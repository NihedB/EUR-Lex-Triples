Livestock farming and the placing on the market of food of animal origin constitute an important source of income for farmers. The implementation of veterinary measures aimed at raising the level of public and animal health in the Community assists the rational development of the farming sector.(2) The protection of human health against diseases and infections transmissible directly or indirectly between animals and humans (zoonoses) is of paramount importance.(3) Zoonoses transmissible through food may cause human suffering, as well as economic losses to food production and the food industry.(4) Zoonoses transmitted through sources other than food, especially from wild animal and pet animal populations, are also a matter of concern.(5) Council Directive 92/117/EEC of 17 December 1992 concerning measures for protection against specified zoonoses and specified zoonotic agents in animals and products of animal origin in order to prevent outbreaks of food-borne infections and intoxications(4) provided for the establishment of a monitoring system for certain zoonoses both at the level of Member States and at Community level.(6) With the assistance of the Community reference laboratory for the epidemiology of zoonoses, the Commission collects the results of monitoring yearly from Member States and compiles them. Publication of the results has taken place yearly since 1995. They provide a basis for the evaluation of the current situation concerning zoonoses and zoonotic agents. However, the data collection systems are not harmonised and therefore do not permit comparisons between Member States.(7) Other Community legislation provides for the monitoring and control of certain zoonoses in animal populations. In particular, Council Directive 64/432/EEC of 26 June 1964 on animal health problems affecting intra-Community trade in bovine animals and swine(5) deals with bovine tuberculosis and bovine brucellosis. Council Directive 91/68/EEC of 28 January 1991 on animal health conditions governing intra-Community trade in ovine and caprine animals(6) deals with ovine and caprine brucellosis. This Directive should not create any unnecessary duplication of those existing requirements.(8) Moreover, a future regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the hygiene of foodstuffs should cover specific elements necessary for prevention, control and monitoring of zoonoses and zoonotic agents and include specific requirements for the microbiological quality of food.(9) Directive 92/117/EEC provides for collection of data on human cases of zoonoses. The aim of Decision No 2119/98/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 September 1998 setting up a network for the epidemiological surveillance and control of communicable diseases in the Community(7) is to reinforce the collection of such data and to contribute to improving the prevention and control, in the Community, of communicable diseases.(10) The collection of data on the occurrence of zoonoses and zoonotic agents in animals, food, feed and humans is necessary to determine the trends and sources of zoonoses.(11) In its opinion on zoonoses adopted on 12 April 2000, the Scientific Committee on Veterinary Measures relating to Public Health considered that the measures in place at that time to control food-borne zoonotic infections were insufficient. It further considered that the epidemiological data that Member States were collecting were incomplete and not fully comparable. As a consequence, the Committee recommended improved monitoring arrangements and identified risk-management options. In particular, the Committee identified Salmonella spp., Campylobacter spp., verotoxigenic Escherichia coli (VTEC), Listeria monocytogenes, Cryptosporidium spp., Echinococcus granulosus/multilocularis and Trichinella spiralis as public health priorities.(12) It is therefore necessary to improve the existing monitoring and data collection systems established by Directive 92/117/EEC. Simultaneously, Regulation (EC) No 2160/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 November 2003 on the control of salmonella and other specified food-borne zoonotic agents(8) will replace the specific control measures established by Directive 92/117/EEC. Directive 92/117/EEC should therefore be repealed.(13) The new framework for scientific advice and scientific support in matters of food safety set up by Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 28 January 2002 laying down the general principles and requirements of food law, establishing the European Food Safety Authority and laying down procedures in matters of food safety(9) should be used to collect and analyse the relevant data.(14) Where necessary to make data easier to compile and compare, monitoring should take place on a harmonised basis. This would make it possible to evaluate trends and sources of zoonoses and zoonotic agents within the Community. The data collected, together with data from other sources, should form the basis for risk assessment of zoonotic organisms.(15) Priority should be given to those zoonoses posing the greatest risk to human health. However, the monitoring systems should also facilitate the detection of emerging or newly emerging zoonotic diseases and new strains of zoonotic organisms.(16) The alarming emergence of resistance to antimicrobial agents (such as antimicrobial medicinal products and antimicrobial feed additives) is a characteristic that should be monitored. Provision should be made for such monitoring to cover not only zoonotic agents but also, in so far as they present a threat to public health, other agents. In particular, the monitoring of indicator organisms might be appropriate. Such organisms constitute a reservoir of resistance genes, which they can transfer to pathogenic bacteria.(17) In addition to general monitoring, specific needs may be recognised which may necessitate the establishment of coordinated monitoring programmes. Attention should be paid in particular to zoonoses listed in Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 2160/2003.(18) If thoroughly investigated, food-borne outbreaks of zoonoses provide the opportunity to identify the pathogen, the food vehicle involved and the factors in the food preparation and handling that contributed to the outbreak. It is therefore appropriate to make provision for such investigations and for close cooperation between the various authorities.(19) Transmissible spongiform encephalopathies are covered by Regulation (EC) No 999/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 May 2001 laying down rules for the prevention, control and eradication of certain transmissible spongiform encephalopathies(10).(20) To ensure that information collected on zoonoses and zoonotic agents can be used effectively, appropriate rules should be laid down concerning the exchange of all relevant information. That information should be collected in Member States and transmitted to the Commission in the form of reports, which should be forwarded to the European Food Safety Authority and made available to the public in an appropriate way without delay.(21) The reports should be submitted on an annual basis. However, additional reports may be appropriate, when warranted by circumstances.(22) It may be appropriate to designate national and Community reference laboratories for giving guidance and assistance for analysis and testing in relation to zoonoses and zoonotic agents falling within the scope of this Directive.(23) Council Decision 90/424/EEC of 26 June 1990 on expenditure in the veterinary field(11) should be amended in so far as concerns the detailed rules governing the Community's financial contribution towards certain actions relating to the monitoring and control of zoonoses and zoonotic agents.(24) Appropriate procedures should be laid down for amending certain provisions of this Directive to take account of technical and scientific progress and for the adoption of implementing and transitional measures.(25) To take account of technical and scientific progress, close and effective cooperation should be ensured between the Commission and the Member States within the Standing Committee set up by Regulation (EC) No 178/2002.(26) Member States cannot, acting alone, collect comparable data to provide a basis for risk assessment of zoonotic organisms of significance at Community level. The collection of such data can better be achieved at Community level. The Community may therefore adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Directive does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives. The responsibility for establishing and maintaining monitoring systems should lie with Member States.(27) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Directive should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission(12),HAVE ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:CHAPTER I INTRODUCTORY PROVISIONSArticle 1Subject matter and scope1.

Monitoring is at the level of primary production* or other stages of the food chain, both for animal feed and for food for human consumption.\nAs a priority, monitoring concerns the following zoonoses:\nbrucellosis,\ncampylobacteriosis,\nechinococcosis,\nlisteriosis,\nsalmonellosis,\ntrichinellosis,\ntuberculosis due to Mycobacterium bovis,\nverotoxigenic Escherichia coli.\nDepending on the epidemiological situation, monitoring also concerns:\nviral zoonoses (calicivirus, hepatitis A virus, influenza virus, rabies and viruses transmitted by arthropods),\nbacterial zoonoses (borreliosis, botulism, leptospirosis, psittacosis, tuberculosis other than that specified above, vibriosis, yersiniosis and agents thereof),\nparasitic zoonoses (anisakiasis, cryptosporidiosis, cysticercosis and toxoplasmosis).\nMonitoring method\nIn some cases, data collected through routine monitoring are insufficient. Coordinated monitoring programmes for one or more zoonoses may prove necessary in order to assess specific risks or establish base-line values.\nEU countries are responsible for ensuring that monitoring provides comparable data on the occurrence of antimicrobial resistance in zoonotic and, where necessary, other important agents.\nThe monitoring of zoonoses, zoonotic agents and antimicrobial resistance in food, feed and animals supplements the monitoring of the human isolates that are conducted in accordance with Decision No 1082/2013/EU on addressing serious cross-border health threats.\nInvestigating foodborne outbreaks\nEU countries’ competent authorities must investigate foodborne outbreaks, gathering data on the epidemiological profile, the foodstuffs potentially implicated and the potential causes.\nSharing information\nSharing information is necessary to obtain exhaustive and comparable data at EU level. In each EU country, one or more competent authorities cooperate with the authorities responsible for animal health, feed and food hygiene. Particularly in the case of foodborne outbreaks, the quick exchange of information through alert networks (e.g. the Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed) is essential to minimise the public health and economic impact of such an outbreak. EU and national reference laboratories are also designated to ensure high-quality analyses of samples.\nEU countries must assess trends and sources of zoonoses, zoonotic agents and antimicrobial resistance and submit a report to the European Commission by the end of May each year. The Commission forwards these reports to the European Food Safety Authority, which will examine them and publish a summary report by the end of November each year.\nFROM WHEN DOES THE DIRECTIVE APPLY?\n              \nIt has applied since 12 December 2003. It had to become law in the EU countries by 12 April 2004.\nBACKGROUND\n              \nFor more information, see:\nFood-borne diseases (zoonoses) (European Commission).\nKEY TERMS\n              \nAntimicrobial resistance: the ability of a microorganism to survive or grow in a given concentration of an antimicrobial agent that is usually sufficient to inhibit or kill microorganisms of that species.\nPrimary production: the production, breeding or cultivation of primary products, including the rearing, processing and production of farm animals before slaughter. It also covers the hunting, fishing and harvesting of wild products.\nMAIN DOCUMENT\n            \nDirective 2003/99/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 November 2003 on the monitoring of zoonoses and zoonotic agents, amending Council Decision 90/424/EEC and repealing Council Directive 92/117/EEC (OJ L 325, 12.12.2003, pp. 31-40)\nSuccessive amendments to Directive 2003/99/EC have been incorporated into the original document.

Livestock farming and the placing on the market of food of animal origin constitute an important source of income for farmers. The implementation of veterinary measures aimed at raising the level of public and animal health in the Community assists the rational development of the farming sector.(2) The protection of human health against diseases and infections transmissible directly or indirectly between animals and humans (zoonoses) is of paramount importance.(3) Zoonoses transmissible through food may cause human suffering, as well as economic losses to food production and the food industry.(4) Zoonoses transmitted through sources other than food, especially from wild animal and pet animal populations, are also a matter of concern.(5) Council directive 92/117/eec of 17 December 1992 concerning measures for protection against specified zoonoses and specified zoonotic agents in animals and products of animal origin in order to prevent outbreaks of food-borne infections and intoxications(4) provided for the establishment of a monitoring system for certain zoonoses both at the level of Member States and at Community level.(6) With the assistance of the Community reference laboratory for the epidemiology of zoonoses, the Commission collects the results of monitoring yearly from Member States and compiles them. Publication of the results has taken place yearly since 1995. They provide a basis for the evaluation of the current situation concerning zoonoses and zoonotic agents. However, the data collection systems are not harmonised and therefore do not permit comparisons between Member States.(7) Other Community legislation provides for the monitoring and control of certain zoonoses in animal populations. In particular, Council directive 64/432/eec of 26 June 1964 on animal health problems affecting intra-Community trade in bovine animals and swine(5) deals with bovine tuberculosis and bovine brucellosis. Council directive 91/68/eec of 28 January 1991 on animal health conditions governing intra-Community trade in ovine and caprine animals(6) deals with ovine and caprine brucellosis. This Directive should not create any unnecessary duplication of those existing requirements.(8) Moreover, a future regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the hygiene of foodstuffs should cover specific elements necessary for prevention, control and monitoring of zoonoses and zoonotic agents and include specific requirements for the microbiological quality of food.(9) directive 92/117/eec provides for collection of data on human cases of zoonoses. The aim of decision 2119/98/ec of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 September 1998 setting up a network for the epidemiological surveillance and control of communicable diseases in the Community(7) is to reinforce the collection of such data and to contribute to improving the prevention and control, in the Community, of communicable diseases.(10) The collection of data on the occurrence of zoonoses and zoonotic agents in animals, food, feed and humans is necessary to determine the trends and sources of zoonoses.(11) In its opinion on zoonoses adopted on 12 April 2000, the Scientific Committee on Veterinary Measures relating to Public Health considered that the measures in place at that time to control food-borne zoonotic infections were insufficient. It further considered that the epidemiological data that Member States were collecting were incomplete and not fully comparable. As a consequence, the Committee recommended improved monitoring arrangements and identified risk-management options. In particular, the Committee identified Salmonella spp., Campylobacter spp., verotoxigenic Escherichia coli (VTEC), Listeria monocytogenes, Cryptosporidium spp., Echinococcus granulosus/multilocularis and Trichinella spiralis as public health priorities.(12) It is therefore necessary to improve the existing monitoring and data collection systems established by directive 92/117/eec. Simultaneously, regulation 2160/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 November 2003 on the control of salmonella and other specified food-borne zoonotic agents(8) will replace the specific control measures established by directive 92/117/eec. directive 92/117/eec should therefore be repealed.(13) The new framework for scientific advice and scientific support in matters of food safety set up by regulation 178/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 28 January 2002 laying down the general principles and requirements of food law, establishing the European Food Safety Authority and laying down procedures in matters of food safety(9) should be used to collect and analyse the relevant data.(14) Where necessary to make data easier to compile and compare, monitoring should take place on a harmonised basis. This would make it possible to evaluate trends and sources of zoonoses and zoonotic agents within the Community. The data collected, together with data from other sources, should form the basis for risk assessment of zoonotic organisms.(15) Priority should be given to those zoonoses posing the greatest risk to human health. However, the monitoring systems should also facilitate the detection of emerging or newly emerging zoonotic diseases and new strains of zoonotic organisms.(16) The alarming emergence of resistance to antimicrobial agents (such as antimicrobial medicinal products and antimicrobial feed additives) is a characteristic that should be monitored. Provision should be made for such monitoring to cover not only zoonotic agents but also, in so far as they present a threat to public health, other agents. In particular, the monitoring of indicator organisms might be appropriate. Such organisms constitute a reservoir of resistance genes, which they can transfer to pathogenic bacteria.(17) In addition to general monitoring, specific needs may be recognised which may necessitate the establishment of coordinated monitoring programmes. Attention should be paid in particular to zoonoses listed in Annex I to regulation 2160/2003.(18) If thoroughly investigated, food-borne outbreaks of zoonoses provide the opportunity to identify the pathogen, the food vehicle involved and the factors in the food preparation and handling that contributed to the outbreak. It is therefore appropriate to make provision for such investigations and for close cooperation between the various authorities.(19) Transmissible spongiform encephalopathies are covered by regulation 999/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 May 2001 laying down rules for the prevention, control and eradication of certain transmissible spongiform encephalopathies(10).(20) To ensure that information collected on zoonoses and zoonotic agents can be used effectively, appropriate rules should be laid down concerning the exchange of all relevant information. That information should be collected in Member States and transmitted to the Commission in the form of reports, which should be forwarded to the European Food Safety Authority and made available to the public in an appropriate way without delay.(21) The reports should be submitted on an annual basis. However, additional reports may be appropriate, when warranted by circumstances.(22) It may be appropriate to designate national and Community reference laboratories for giving guidance and assistance for analysis and testing in relation to zoonoses and zoonotic agents falling within the scope of this Directive.(23) Council decision 90/424/eec of 26 June 1990 on expenditure in the veterinary field(11) should be amended in so far as concerns the detailed rules governing the Community's financial contribution towards certain actions relating to the monitoring and control of zoonoses and zoonotic agents.(24) Appropriate procedures should be laid down for amending certain provisions of this Directive to take account of technical and scientific progress and for the adoption of implementing and transitional measures.(25) To take account of technical and scientific progress, close and effective cooperation should be ensured between the Commission and the Member States within the Standing Committee set up by regulation 178/2002.(26) Member States cannot, acting alone, collect comparable data to provide a basis for risk assessment of zoonotic organisms of significance at Community level. The collection of such data can better be achieved at Community level. The Community may therefore adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Directive does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives. The responsibility for establishing and maintaining monitoring systems should lie with Member States.(27) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Directive should be adopted in accordance with Council decision 1999/468/ec of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission(12),HAVE ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:CHAPTER I INTRODUCTORY PROVISIONSArticle 1Subject matter and scope1.

Member States shall ensure, in accordance with the requirements set out in Annex II, that monitoring provides comparable data on the occurrence of antimicrobial resistance in zoonotic agents and, in so far as they present a threat to public health, other agents.2. Such monitoring shall supplement the monitoring of human isolates conducted in accordance with decision 2119/98/ec.3. Detailed rules for the implementation of this Article shall be laid down in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 12(2).CHAPTER IV FOOD-BORNE OUTBREAKSArticle 8Epidemiological investigation of food-borne outbreaks1. Member States shall ensure that, when a food business operator provides information to the competent authority pursuant to Article 19(3) of regulation 178/2002, the foodstuff involved, or an appropriate sample of it, is preserved in order not to impede its investigation in a laboratory or the investigation of any food-borne outbreak.2. The competent authority shall investigate food-borne outbreaks in cooperation with the authorities referred to in Article 1 of decision 2119/98/ec. The investigation shall provide data on the epidemiological profile, the foodstuffs potentially implicated and the potential causes of the outbreak. The investigation shall include, as far as possible, adequate epidemiological and microbiological studies. The competent authority shall transmit to the Commission (which shall send it to the European Food Safety Authority) a summary report of the results of the investigations carried out, containing the information referred to in Part E of Annex IV.3. Detailed rules concerning the investigation of food-borne outbreaks may be laid down in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 12(2).4. Paragraphs 1 and 2 shall apply without prejudice to Community provisions on product safety, early warning and response systems for the prevention and control of communicable human diseases, food hygiene and the general requirements of food law, in particular those concerning emergency measures and procedures for withdrawing food and feed from the market.CHAPTER V EXCHANGE OF INFORMATIONArticle 9Assessment of trends and sources of zoonoses, zoonotic agents and antimicrobial resistance1. Member States shall assess trends and sources of zoonoses, zoonotic agents and antimicrobial resistance in their territory.Each Member State shall transmit to the Commission every year by the end of May a report on trends and sources of zoonoses, zoonotic agents and antimicrobial resistance, covering the data collected pursuant to Articles 4, 7 and 8 during the previous year.

Other zoonoses and zoonotic agentsANNEX IIRequirements for monitoring of antimicrobial resistance pursuant to Article 7A. General requirementsMember States must ensure that the monitoring system for antimicrobial resistance provided for in Article 7 provides at least the following information:1. animal species included in monitoring;2. bacterial species and/or strains included in monitoring;3. sampling strategy used in monitoring;4. antimicrobials included in monitoring;5. laboratory methodology used for the detection of resistance;6. laboratory methodology used for the identification of microbial isolates;7. methods used for the collection of the data.B. Specific requirementsMember States must ensure that the monitoring system provides relevant information at least with regard to a representative number of isolates of Salmonella spp., Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli from cattle, pigs and poultry and food of animal origin derived from those species.ANNEX IIICoordinated monitoring programmes as referred to in Article 5When a coordinated monitoring programme is established, at least the following characteristics of the programme must be defined:- its purpose;- its duration;- its geographical area or region;- the zoonoses and/or zoonotic agents concerned;- the type of samples and other data units requested;- minimum sampling schemes;- the type of laboratory testing methods;- the tasks of competent authorities;- the resources to be allocated;- the estimation of its costs and how they will be covered; and- the method and time of reporting the results.ANNEX IVRequirements for the reports to be submitted pursuant to Article 9(1)The report referred to in Article 9(1) must provide at least the following information. Parts A to D apply to reports on monitoring carried out in accordance with Article 4 or 7. Part E applies to reports on monitoring carried out in accordance with Article 8.A. Initially the following must be described for each zoonosis and zoonotic agent (later only changes have to be reported):(a) monitoring systems (sampling strategies, frequency of sampling, kind of specimen, case definition, diagnostic methods used);(b) vaccination policy and other preventive actions;(c) control mechanism and, where relevant, programmes;(d) measures in case of positive findings or single cases;(e) notification systems in place;(f) history of the disease and/or infection in the country.B. Each year the following must be described:(a) relevant susceptible animal population (together with the date the figures relate to):- number of herds or flocks,- total number of animals, and- where relevant, methods of production involved;(b) number and general description of the laboratories and institutions involved in monitoring.C. Each year the following details on each zoonotic agent and data category concerned must be described with their consequences:(a) changes in the systems already described;(b) changes in previously described methods;(c) results of the investigations and of further typing or other method of characterisation in laboratories (for each category reported on separately);(d) national evaluation of the recent situation, the trend and the sources of infection;(e) relevance as zoonotic disease;(f) relevance to human cases, as a source of human infection, of findings in animals and food;(g) control strategies recognised that could be used to prevent or minimise transmission of the zoonotic agent to humans;(h) if necessary, any specific action decided in the Member State or suggested for the Community as a whole on the basis of the recent situation.D. Reporting of results of examinationsResults shall be given by stating the number of epidemiological units investigated (flocks, herds, samples, batches) and the number of positive samples according to the case definition. The results shall, when necessary, be presented in a way which shows the geographical distribution of the zoonosis or the zoonotic agent.E. For food-borne outbreak data:(a) total number of outbreaks over a year;(b) number of human deaths and illnesses in these outbreaks;(c) the causative agents of the outbreaks, including, where possible, serotype or other definitive description of the agents. Where the identification of the causative agent is not possible, the reason for such unidentifiability should be stated;(d) foodstuffs implicated in the outbreak and other potential vehicles;(e) identification of the type of place where the foodstuff incriminated was produced/purchased/acquired/consumed;(f) contributory factors, for example, deficiencies in food processing hygiene.", "triples": [" directive 2003/99/ec,  amending,  decision 90/424/eec", " directive 2003/99/ec,  repealing,  directive 92/117/eec"]}}, "summary_annotations": {"32003L0099_p1": {"text": "directive 2003/99/ec of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 November 2003 on the monitoring of zoonoses and zoonotic agents, amending Council decision 90/424/eec and repealing Council directive 92/117/eec (OJ L 325, 12.12.2003, pp. 31-40)", "triples": [" directive 2003/99/ec,  amending,  decision 90/424/eec", " directive 2003/99/ec,  repealing,  directive 92/117/eec"]}, "32003L0099_p2": {"text": "decision 1082/2013/eu of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 October 2013 on serious cross-border threats to health and repealing decision 2119/98/ec (OJ L 293, 5.11.2013, pp. 1-15)", "triples": [" decision 1082/2013/eu,  repealing,  decision 2119/98/ec"]}}}
