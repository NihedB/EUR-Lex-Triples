{"celex_id": "32008D0376", "reference": "20.5.2008\nEN\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\nL 130/7\nCOUNCIL DECISION\nof 29 April 2008\non the adoption of the Research Programme of the Research Fund for Coal and Steel and on the multiannual technical guidelines for this programme\n(2008/376/EC)\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,\nHaving regard to the Protocol, annexed to the Treaty establishing the European Community, on the financial consequences of the expiry of the ECSC Treaty and on the Research Fund for Coal and Steel,\nHaving regard to Council Decision 2003/76/EC of 1 February 2003 establishing the measures necessary for the implementation of the Protocol, annexed to the Treaty establishing the European Community, on the financial consequences of the expiry of the ECSC Treaty and on the Research Fund for Coal and Steel (1), and in particular Article 4(3) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the Commission,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European Parliament (2),\nWhereas:\n(1)\nThe revenue from investments of the net worth of the assets of the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) in liquidation and, on completion of the liquidation, the assets of the Research Fund for Coal and Steel, are being assigned to the Research Fund for Coal and Steel, which is intended exclusively to fund research projects outside the Community framework programme for research, technological development and demonstration activities in the sectors related to the coal and steel industry.\n(2)\nThe Research Fund for Coal and Steel is to be managed by the Commission in accordance with principles similar to those governing the former ECSC coal and steel technical research programmes and on the basis of multiannual technical guidelines which should constitute an extension of those ECSC programmes, providing a high concentration of research activities and ensuring that they supplement those of the Community framework programme for research, technological development and demonstration activities.\n(3)\nThe Seventh Framework Programme of the European Community for research, technological development and demonstration activities (2007-2013) set out in Decision No 1982/2006/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 December 2006 (3) (hereinafter referred to as ‘the Seventh Framework Programme’) provides an incentive to review Council Decision 2003/78/EC of 1 February 2003 laying down the multiannual technical guidelines for the research programme of the Research Fund for Coal and Steel (4) in order to ensure that the Research Fund for Coal and Steel complements the Seventh Framework Programme in the sectors related to the coal and steel industry.\n(4)\nResearch and technical development constitute a very important means of supporting Community energy objectives with regard to the supply of Community coal and its competitive and environmentally friendly conversion and utilisation. Moreover, the growing international dimension of the coal market and the global scale of the problems confronting it means that the Community has to take a leading role in meeting challenges relating to modern techniques, mine safety and environmental protection at worldwide level by ensuring the transfer of know-how required for further technological progress, improved working conditions (health and safety) and enhanced environmental protection.\n(5)\nWith the general aim of increasing competitiveness and contributing to sustainable development, the main emphasis of research and technological development is on the development of new or improved technologies to guarantee the economic, clean and safe production of steel and steel products characterised by steadily increasing performance, suitability to use, customer satisfaction, prolonged service life, easy recovery and recycling.\n(6)\nThe order in which the research objectives for coal and steel are presented in this Decision should not represent a priority as between those objectives.\n(7)\nIn the framework of the management activities of the Research Fund for Coal and Steel, the Commission should be assisted by advisory groups and technical groups representing a wide range of interests of industries and other stakeholders.\n(8)\nThe recent enlargement incorporating new Member States requires modification of the multiannual technical guidelines laid down in Decision 2003/78/EC, notably as regards the composition of the advisory groups and the definition of coal.\n(9)\nIn accordance with Statement No 4 of the Decision of the Representatives of the Governments of the Member States meeting within the Council 2002/234/ECSC of 27 February 2002 (5), the Commission has re-examined the definition of steel and come to the conclusion that it is not necessary to change that definition. Indeed, steel castings, forgings and powder metallurgy products are topics already covered by the Seventh Framework Programme.\n(10)\nThe general approach for revising the Decision 2003/78/EC should be to keep intact the procedures that were considered by the assisting groups as effective, together with a limited but necessary number of modifications and administrative simplifications in order to ensure complementarity with the Seventh Framework Programme.\n(11)\nThose modifications include the deletion of some accompanying measures as already foreseen in the Seventh Framework Programme. It is also necessary to align the periodicity of the revision and the experts’ nominations concerning the Research Programme of the Research Fund for Coal and Steel on those used in the Seventh Framework Programme.\n(12)\nThe rules on the composition of the advisory groups should be revised, notably as regards the representation of interested Member States and gender balance according to Commission Decision 2000/407/EC of 19 June 2000 relating to gender balance within the committees and expert groups established by it (6).\n(13)\nThe Commission should be given the opportunity to launch dedicated calls in the framework of the research objectives defined in this Decision.\n(14)\nThe maximum total financial contribution from the Research Fund for Coal and Steel for pilot and demonstration projects should be increased to 50 % of the eligible costs.\n(15)\nThe eligible costs approach should be kept together with a better definition of the cost categories and a revised percentage for the calculation of the overheads.\n(16)\nThe Commission has reassessed the multiannual technical guidelines laid down in Decision 2003/78/EC and found that in view of the changes required it is appropriate to replace that Decision.\n(17)\nIn order to ensure the necessary continuity with Decision 2003/78/EC, this Decision should apply from 16 September 2007. Applicants submitting proposals between 16 September 2007 and the date this Decision takes effect should be invited to resubmit their proposals in accordance with this Decision, which should enable them to benefit from the more favourable conditions provided by this Decision, notably as regards the financial contribution to pilot and demonstration projects.\n(18)\nThe measures necessary for the implementation of this Decision should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission (7),\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\nCHAPTER I\nGENERAL PROVISIONS\nArticle 1\nSubject matter\nThis Decision provides for the adoption of the Research Programme of the Research Fund for Coal and Steel and lays down the multiannual technical guidelines for the implementation of that programme.\nCHAPTER II\nRESEARCH PROGRAMME OF THE RESEARCH FUND FOR COAL AND STEEL\nSECTION 1\nAdoption of the Research Programme\nArticle 2\nAdoption\nThe Research Programme for the Research Fund for Coal and Steel (hereinafter referred to as ‘the Research Programme’) is hereby adopted.\nThe Research Programme shall support the competitiveness of the Community sectors related to the coal and steel industry.

This included revising the rules governing the advisory and technical groups to ensure transparency, to achieve a better balance of expertise and gender, as well as simplifying procedures to make it easier for small and medium-sized businesses to participate in the programme.\nAmending Decision (EU) 2021/1094 revises the programme’s research objectives, in line with the European Green Deal (see summary) and the Just Transition Mechanism. This fits with the EU’s objectives to achieve climate neutrality by 2050 (Regulation (EU) 2021/1119 — see summary), which were adopted further to the Paris Agreement (see summary) and ratified by the EU in 2016. It also ensures that RFCS research complements the activities of Horizon Europe.\nKEY POINTS\n              \nDecision 2008/376/EC, as amended by Decision (EU) 2021/1094, revises and refocuses the research priorities under the RFCS:\nwith regard to coal, they aim to: support the just transition of the coal sector and regions,improve health and safety in coal mines under closure and in previously exploited coal mines,minimise the environmental impacts of coal mining sites in transition;\nwith regard to steel, they include work on: new, sustainable and low-carbon steelmaking and finishing processes,advanced steel grades and applications,conservation of resources, protection of the environment and the circular economy,management of the work force (developing and disseminating competencies to keep pace with new near-zero-carbon steel production processes) and improving working conditions (including health, safety and ergonomics in and around the workplace).\nResearch on breakthrough technologies for the reduction of CO2 emissions in the steel industrial sector may be implemented through co-programmed European Partnerships (involving the pooling of resources between public or private partners or both). These may be established in accordance with the rules set out in Regulation (EU) 2021/695 establishing Horizon Europe (see summary).\nProcedure\nThe RFCS is managed by the European Commission.\nThe Coal and Steel Committee, comprising representatives from the EU Member States, assists the Commission with the RFCS’s overall management.\nCoal and steel advisory groups advise the Commission on developing the research programme, including the setting of annual priorities.\nCoal and steel technical groups support the Commission in evaluating and monitoring projects.\nThe RFCS issues annual calls for proposals, namely €40 million to finance collaborative research and €71 million to finance research for breakthrough technologies leading to near-zero-carbon steelmaking and research projects. These projects manage the just transition of formerly operating coal mines, coal mines in the process of closure and related infrastructure, in line with the Just Transition Mechanism and in compliance with Article 4(2) Supporting the just transition of the coal sector and regions.\nThe RFCS programme is monitored by the Commission and is assessed every 7 years.\nFROM WHEN DOES THE DECISION APPLY?\nDecision 2008/376/EC has applied since 16 September 2007.\nAmending Decision (EU) 2017/955 has applied since 27 June 2017.\nAmending Decision (EU) 2021/1094 has applied since 25 July 2021.\nBACKGROUND\n              \nFor more information, see:\nResearch Fund for Coal and Steel (RFCS) (European Commission).\nMAIN DOCUMENT\n            \nCouncil Decision 2008/376/EC of 29 April 2008 on the adoption of the Research Programme of the Research Fund for Coal and Steel and on the multiannual technical guidelines for this programme (OJ L 130, 20.5.2008, pp. 7–17).\nSuccessive amendments to Decision 2008/376/EC have been incorporated into the original text.
