To that end, the Comprehensive Plan emphasises the necessity of highlighting a number of practical measures, including the establishment of a joint approach and cooperation between Member States with regard to the implementation of return measures. Common standards should therefore be adopted for return procedures.\n(2)\nThe plan for the management of the external borders of the European Union, approved by the Council on 13 June 2002, which built upon the Communication of 7 May 2002 from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament ‘Towards integrated management of the external borders of the Member States of the European Union’, provides for rational repatriation operations as one of the measures and actions for the integrated management of the external borders of the Member States of the European Union.\n(3)\nThe Return Action Programme, approved by the Council on 28 November 2002, which built upon the Commission Green Paper of 10 April 2002 on a Community return policy on illegal residents, as well as on the Communication of 14 October 2002 from the Commission to the European Parliament and to the Council on a Community return policy on illegal residents recommends, as one of the measures and actions with regard to improved operational cooperation among Member States, that the return of third-country nationals illegally resident in a Member State should be made as efficient as possible by sharing existing capacities for organising joint flights.\n(4)\nIt is important to avoid a vacuum of the Community in the field of the organisation of joint flights.\n(5)\nAs from 1 May 2004 the Council can no longer act on an initiative of a Member State.\n(6)\nThe Council has exhausted all the possibilities to obtain in time the opinion of the European Parliament.\n(7)\nUnder these exceptional circumstances the Decision should be adopted without the opinion of the European Parliament.\n(8)\nMember States are to implement this Decision with due respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, and in particular for the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms of 4 November 1950, the United Nations Convention against torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment of 10 December 1984, the Geneva Convention of 28 July 1951 and the New York Protocol thereto of 31 January 1967, relating to the status of refugees, the Convention on the rights of the child of 20 November 1989, and the Charter of fundamental rights of the European Union of 18 December 2000 (3).\n(9)\nThis Decision should apply without prejudice to the relevant international instruments in the area of removal by air, such as Annex 9 to the 1944 Chicago Convention on International Civil Aviation (ICAO) and the relevant documents of the European Civil Aviation Conference (ECAC).\n(10)\nThe non-binding Common Guidelines on security provisions for joint removals by air should provide useful guidance in the implementation of this Decision.\n(11)\nIn accordance with Articles 1 and 2 of the Protocol on the position of Denmark annexed to the Treaty on European Union and the Treaty establishing the European Community, Denmark is not taking part in the adoption of this Decision, and is not bound by it or subject to its application. However, given that this Decision builds upon the Schengen acquis under the provisions of Title IV of Part Three of the Treaty establishing the European Community, Denmark, in accordance with Article 5 of the said Protocol, is to decide within a period of six months after the Council has adopted this Decision, whether it will implement it in its national law.\n(12)\nAs regards the Republic of Iceland and the Kingdom of Norway, this Decision constitutes a development of the provisions of the Schengen acquis within the meaning of the Agreement concluded on 18 May 1999 between the Council of the European Union and the Republic of Iceland and the Kingdom of Norway concerning the latters' association with the implementation, application and development of the Schengen acquis\n (4), which fall within the area referred to in Article 1, point C of Council Decision 1999/437/EC of 17 May 1999 on certain arrangements for the application of that Agreement (5). As a result of the procedures laid down in the said Agreement, the rights and obligations arising from this Decision should also apply to those two States and in relations between those two States and the Member States of the European Community to which this Decision is addressed.\n(13)\nIn accordance with Article 3 of the Protocol on the position of the United Kingdom and Ireland annexed to the Treaty on the European Union and to the Treaty establishing the European Community, these Member States have notified their wish to take part in the adoption and application of this Decision,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\nArticle 1\nPurpose\nThe purpose of this Decision is to coordinate joint removals by air, from two or more Member States, of third-country nationals who are subjects of individual removal orders (hereinafter referred to as third-country nationals).\nArticle 2\nDefinitions\nFor the purpose of this Decision:\n(a)\n‘third-country national’, means any person who is not a national of a Member State of the European Union, the Republic of Iceland or the Kingdom of Norway;\n(b)\n‘organising Member State’, means a Member State, which is responsible for the organisation of joint flights;\n(c)\n‘participating Member State’, means a Member State which participates in joint flights organised by an organising Member State;\n(d)\n‘joint flight’, means the transport of third-country nationals carried out by an air carrier selected for that purpose;\n(e)\n‘removal operations’ and ‘joint removals by air’, mean all the activities which are necessary to return the third-country nationals concerned, including transport on joint flights;\n(f)\n‘escort(s)’, means the security personnel responsible for accompanying third-country nationals on a joint flight and the persons in charge of medical care and interpreters.\nArticle 3\nNational authority\nEach Member State shall appoint the national authority responsible for organising and/or participating in joint flights and communicate the relevant information to the other Member States.\nArticle 4\nTasks of the organising Member State\n1.

PRE-RETURN PHASE\n1.1.   Requirements for returnees\n1.1.1.   Legal situation\nJoint flights are organised for illegal residents, who are persons who do not, or no longer, fulfil the conditions for entry to, presence in, or residence on the territory of a Member State of the European Union. The organising Member State and each participating Member State shall ensure that the legal situation of each of the returnees for which they are responsible allows for removal.\n1.1.2.   Medical condition and medical records\nThe organising Member State and each participating Member State shall ensure that the returnees for whom they are responsible are in an appropriate state of health, which allows legally and factually for a safe removal by air. Medical records shall be provided for returnees with a known medical disposition or where medical treatment is required. These medical records shall include the results of medical examinations, a diagnosis and the specification of possibly needed medication to allow for necessary medical measures. Multilingual versions of medical records shall be provided, if the accompanying medical staff is not able to understand properly the original language. Organising and participating Member States are encouraged to use common standardised forms for medical records or fit-for-fly declarations. Participating Member States shall inform the organising Member State in advance of a removal operation of any medical condition which would have a bearing on the removability of a returnee. The organising Member State shall reserve the right to refuse access to a joint flight to any returnee with a medical condition which would mean that their return was not compatible with the principles of safety and dignity.\n1.1.3.   Documentation\nThe organising Member State and each participating Member State shall ensure that for each returnee valid travel documents and other necessary additional documents, certificates or records are available. An authorised person shall keep the documentation until arrival in the country of destination.\nIt is the responsibility of the organising Member State and each participating State to ensure that escorts and representatives have entry visas where necessary for the country(ies) of transit and destination of the joint flight.\n1.1.4.   Notifications\nThe organising Member State shall ensure that the airlines, the transit states, where applicable, and the country of destination are notified and consulted duly in advance about the removal operation.\n1.2.   Requirements for escorts\n1.2.1.   Escorts from the organising Member State\nWhere the organising Member State provides the escorts for all the returnees, each participating Member State shall assign at least two representatives to be present on board the aircraft; they shall be in charge of handing over the returnees for whom they are responsible to the local authorities in the country of destination.\n1.2.2.   Escorts from participating Member States\nWhere the organising Member State intends to take charge solely of the returnees from its own country, the participating Member States shall provide escorts for the returnees, for whom they are responsible. In such cases, the participation of the various national units requires mutual agreement between the organising Member State and the participating Member States on the security rules as set out in these Common Guidelines or in other agreements between Member States and there shall be prior consultation on any other details of the operation.\n1.2.3.   Use of private-sector escorts\nWhen a participating Member State makes use of private-sector escorts, the authorities of that Member State shall provide for at least one official representative on board the flight.\n1.2.4.   Skills and training of escorts\nEscorts assigned on board the joint flights shall have received prior special training in order to carry out these missions; they must be provided with the necessary medical support depending on the mission.\nEscorts used for joint flights should preferably be familiar with the removal standards of the organising Member State and the participating Member States. Member States are encouraged, therefore, to exchange information on their respective training courses for escorts and to offer training courses to escorts from other Member States.\n1.2.5.   Code of conduct for escorts\nThe escorts shall not be armed. They may wear civilian dress, which shall have a distinctive emblem for identification purposes. Other duly accredited accompanying staff shall also wear a distinctive emblem.\nThe members of the escort shall be strategically positioned in the aircraft in order to provide optimum safety. Moreover, they shall be seated with the returnees for whom they have responsibility.\n1.2.6.   Arrangements regarding the number of escorts\nThe number of escorts shall be determined on a case-by-case basis following an analysis of the potential risks and following mutual consultation. It is recommended in most cases that they are at least equivalent to the number of returnees on board. A back-up unit shall be available for support, where necessary (e.g. in cases of long-distance destinations).\n2.   PRE-DEPARTURE PHASE IN DEPARTURE OR STOPOVER AIRPORTS\n2.1.   Transportation to the airport and stay in the airport\nAs regards transportation to and stay in the airport the following shall apply:\n(a)\nin principle, the escorts and the returnees should be at the airport at least three hours before departure;\n(b)\nreturnees should be briefed regarding the enforcement of their removal and advised that it is in their interest to cooperate fully with the escorts. It should be made clear that any disruptive behaviour will not be tolerated and will not lead to the aborting of the removal operation;\n(c)\nthe organising Member State shall provide a secure area at the departure airport in order to ensure a discrete gathering and safe boarding of the returnees. This area shall also secure the arrival of the aircraft of any other Member State, which is transporting returnees to join the joint flight;\n(d)\nif a joint flight has to stop over at an airport of another Member State for the collection of returnees, it is the responsibility of that Member State to provide for a secure area at the airport;\n(e)\nthe representatives of the participating Member State shall hand over the returnees, for whom they are responsible, to officials of the Member State of the present location, who will usually be from the organising Member State. The representatives of the participating Member States shall indicate, if need be, which of the returnees have expressed their intention not to board the aircraft and in particular which of them need special attention due to their physical or psychological condition;\n(f)\nthe Member State of the present location of the removal operation is responsible for the performance of any sovereign power (e.g. coercive measures). The powers of the escorts from other participating Member States are limited to self-defence. In addition, in the absence of law enforcement officers from the Member State of the present location, or for the purpose of supporting the law-enforcement officers, the escorts may take reasonable and proportionate action in response to an immediate and serious risk in order to prevent the returnee from escaping, causing injury to himself or to a third party, or damage to property.\n2.2.   Check-in, boarding and security check before take-off\nThe arrangements as regards check-in, boarding and security checking before take-off shall be as follows:\n(a)\nthe escorts of the Member State of the present location are responsible for checking in and for assisting in passing control areas;\n(b)\nall returnees shall undergo a meticulous security search before they board a joint flight.

Use of coercive measures\nCoercive measures shall be used as follows:\n(a)\ncoercive measures shall be implemented with due respect to the individual rights of the returnees;\n(b)\ncoercion may be used on individuals who refuse or resist removal. All coercive measures shall be proportional and shall not exceed reasonable force. The dignity and physical integrity of the returnee shall be maintained. As a consequence, in case of doubt, the removal operation including the implementation of legal coercion based on the resistance and dangerousness of the returnee, shall be stopped following the principle ‘no removal at all cost’;\n(c)\nany coercive measures should not compromise or threaten the ability of the returnee to breathe normally. In the event that coercive force is used, it shall be ensured that the chest of the returnee remains in upright position and that nothing affects his or her chest in order to maintain normal respiratory function;\n(d)\nthe immobilisation of resisting returnees may be achieved by means of restraints that will not endanger their dignity and physical integrity;\n(e)\nthe organising Member State and each participating Member State shall agree on a list of authorised restraints in advance of the removal operation. The use of sedatives to facilitate the removal is forbidden without prejudice to emergency measures to ensure flight security;\n(f)\nall escorts shall be informed and made aware of the authorised and forbidden restraints;\n(g)\nrestrained returnees shall remain under constant surveillance throughout the flight;\n(h)\nthe decision temporarily to remove a means of restraint shall be made by the head or deputy-head of the removal operation.\n3.3.

Previously unknown medical dispositions, which are discovered immediately before departure and which may affect the enforcement of the removal, should be assessed with the responsible authorities;\n(c)\nonly a doctor may, after a precise medical diagnosis has been made, administer medication to the returnees. Medicine required by a returnee during the course of the flight shall be held on board;\n(d)\neach returnee shall be able to address the doctor or the escorts directly, or via an interpreter in a language in which he or she can express him- or herself;\n(e)\nthe organising Member States shall ensure that appropriate medical and language staff are available for the removal operation.\n3.4.   Documentation and monitoring of removal operation\n3.4.1.   Recording and observers from third parties\nAny video- and/or audio-recording or monitoring by third-party observers on joint flights shall be subject to prior agreement between the organising Member State and the participating Member States.\n3.4.2.   Internal reports on the removal operation\nThe organising Member State and participating Member States shall exchange their internal reports on the removal operation, if a common report is not to be prepared. This is particularly important if the removal operation has failed. All mission reports are strictly confidential and for internal use only. Reports shall include statements on incidents, and coercive and medical measures, if any have taken place.\n3.4.3.   Media coverage\nThe organising and participating Member States shall agree before a removal operation on the nature and timing of publicity (if any) to be given to the removal operation. Information about the removal operation will normally be issued only after its completion. Publication of photographs or personal details of the escorts is to be avoided.\n4.   TRANSIT PHASE\nCouncil Directive 2003/110/EC of 25 November 2003 on assistance in cases of transit for the purposes of removal by air (1) shall apply during transit in a Member State.\n5.   ARRIVAL PHASE\nOn arrival:\n(a)\nthe organising Member State shall be responsible for contacting the authorities of the country of destination; participating Member States shall be involved in this process;\n(b)\nthe head of the removal operation of the organising Member State shall be the spokesperson to establish first contact with the local authorities upon arrival, unless another spokesperson has been determined among the organising and participating Member States prior to arrival;\n(c)\nthe organising Member State and each participating Member State shall hand over the returnees, for whom they are responsible, to the authorities of the country of destination, with their luggage and any items that were seized prior to boarding. The lead representatives of the organising and participating Member States will be responsible for handing over the returnees to the local authorities upon arrival. The escorts will not normally leave the aircraft;\n(d)\nwhere appropriate and feasible, the organising and participating Member States should invite consular staff, immigration liaison officers or advance parties of the Member States concerned to facilitate the handover of the returnees to the local authorities insofar as this is consistent with national practices and procedure;\n(e)\nthe returnees shall be free of handcuffs or any other restraint when handed over to the local authorities;\n(f)\nthe handover of returnees shall take place outside the aircraft (either at the bottom of the gangway or in adequate premises of the airport, as considered appropriate). As far as possible the local authorities shall be prevented from coming on board the aircraft;\n(g)\nthe time spent at the airport of destination should be kept to a minimum;\n(h)\nit is the responsibility of the organising Member State and each participating Member State to have in place contingency arrangements for escorts and representatives (and returnees whose readmission has not been permitted) in the event that the departure of the aircraft is delayed following disembarkation of the returnees. These arrangements should include the provision of overnight accommodation, if necessary.\n6.   FAILURE OF THE REMOVAL OPERATION\nIn the event that the authorities of the country of destination refuse entry to the territory, or the removal operation has to be aborted for other reasons, the organising Member State and each participating Member State shall take responsibility, at its own cost, for the return of the returnees, for whom they are responsible, to their respective territories.\n(1)  OJ L 321, 6.12.2003, p. 26.", "summary": "Return of illegal immigrants to their countries: joint flights\nReturn of illegal immigrants to their countries: joint flights\nSUMMARY OF:\nDecision 2004/573/EC — Joint flights for removals from the territory of two or more EU countries of illegal immigrants\nWHAT IS THE AIM OF THIS DECISION?\n              \nIt sets out the procedures when two or more EU countries cooperate to deport illegal immigrants by air from the EU.\nKEY POINTS\nEvery EU country appoints a national authority responsible for organising or participating in joint flights.\nThe authority organising a joint flight must:\nprovide the relevant information to other EU countries;\nselect the airline involved and ensure all the contractual and practical arrangements are in place;\nrequest and receive authorisations from the flight’s transit and destination countries;\nmake the appropriate arrangements, including financial ones, with other EU countries participating in the flight;\ndefine the operational details and procedures, including the number of escorts required.\nAn EU country participating in a joint flight must:\ninform the national authority organising the flight of its intention to participate;\nprovide a sufficient number of escorts;\nensure the presence of at least 2 of its representatives if the organising country provides all the escorts.\nOrganising and participating countries must:\nensure escorts and all those being deported have valid travel papers and other necessary documents, such as visas and certificates;\nprovide the flight arrangements to their embassies and consulates in the transit and destination countries involved to receive any necessary assistance.\nThe decision sets out detailed procedures and requirements for the five phases involved in removing illegal immigrants:\npre-return\npre-departure\nin-flight\ntransit\narrival.\nThese cover issues such as check-in, security and the use of coercive measures*.\nOperational cooperation between EU countries also covers:\ntransit assistance for removal flights;\norganisation of flights for illegal immigrants subject to individual removal orders;\nmutual recognition of expulsion decisions.\nFROM WHEN DOES THIS DECISION APPLY?\n              \nIt has applied since 7 August 2004.\nBACKGROUND\n              \nBetween 400,000 and 500,000 foreign nationals are ordered to leave the EU every year because they have entered, or are staying, illegally.
