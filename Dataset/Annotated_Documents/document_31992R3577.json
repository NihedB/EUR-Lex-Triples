As from 1 January 1993, freedom to provide maritime transport services within a Member State (maritime cabotage) shall apply to Community shipowners who have their ships registered in, and flying the flag of a Member State, provided that  these ships comply with all conditions for carrying out cabotage in that Member State, including ships registered in Euros, once that Register is approved by the Council.  2. By way of derogation, the application of the provision of paragraph 1 requiring that ships fulfil all conditions for carrying out cabotage in the Member State in which they are registered at that time shall be temporarily suspended until 31 December  1996.  Article 2  For the purposes of this Regulation:  1. 'maritime transport services within a Member State (maritime cabotage)' shall mean services normally provided for remuneration and shall in particular include:  (a) mainland cabotage: the carriage of passengers or goods by sea between ports situated on the mainland or the main territory of one and the same Member State without calls at islands;  (b) off-shore supply services: the carriage of passengers or goods by sea between any port in a Member State and installations or structures situated on the continental shelf of that Member State;  (c) island cabotage: the carriage of passengers or goods by sea between:  - ports situated on the mainland and on one or more of the islands of one and the same Member State,  - ports situated on the islands of one and the same Member State;  Ceuta and Melilla shall be treated in the same way as island ports.  2. 'Community shipowner' shall mean:  (a) nationals of a Member State established in a Member State in accordance with the legislation of that Member State and pursuing shipping activities;  (b) shipping companies established in accordance with the legislation of a Member State and whose principal place of business is situated, and effective control exercised, in a Member State;  or  (c) nationals of a Member State established outside the Community or shipping companies established outside the Community and controlled by nationals of a Member State, if their ships are registered in and fly the flag of a Member State in accordance  with its legislation;  3. 'a public service contract' shall mean a contract concluded between the competent authorities of a Member State and a Community shipowner in order to provide the public with adequate transport services.  A public service contract may cover notably:  - transport services satisfying fixed standards of continuity, regularity, capacity and quality,  - additional transport services,  - transport services at specified rates and subject to specified conditions, in particular for certain categories of passengers or on certain routes,  - adjustments of services to actual requirements;  4. 'public service obligations' shall mean obligations which the Community shipowner in question, if he were considering his own commercial interest, would not assume or would not assume to the same extent or under the same conditions;  5. 'a serious disturbance of the internal transport market' shall mean the appearance on the market of problems specific to that market and which:  - are likely to lead to a serious and potentially lasting excess of supply over demand,  - are due to, or aggravated by, maritime cabotage operations, and  - pose a serious threat to the financial stability and survival of a significant number of Community shipowners,  provided that the short-term and medium-term forecasts for the market in question do not indicate any substantial and lasting improvements.  Article 3  1. For vessels carrying out mainland cabotage and for cruise liners, all matters relating to manning shall be the responsibility of the State in which the vessel is registered (flag state), except for ships smaller than 650 gt, where host  State conditions may be applied.  2. For vessels carrying out island cabotage, all matters relating to manning shall be the responsibility of the State in which the vessel is performing a maritime transport service (host State).  3. However, from 1 January 1999, for cargo vessels over 650 gt carrying out island cabotage, when the voyage concerned follows or precedes a voyage to or from another State, all matters relating to manning shall be the responsibility of the State in  which the vessel is registered (flag State).  4. The Commission shall make an in-depth examination of the economic and social impact of the liberalization of island cabotage and shall submit a report to the Council before 1 January 1997 at the latest.  On the basis of this report, the Commission shall submit a proposal to the Council which may include adjustments to the manning nationality provisions laid down in paragraphs 2 and 3 so that the definitive system shall be approved by the Council in due  time and before 1 January 1999.  Article 4  1. A Member State may conclude public service contracts with or impose public service obligations as a condition for the provision of cabotage services, on shipping companies participating in regular services to, from and between islands.  Whenever a Member State concludes public service contracts or imposes public service obligations, it shall do so on a non-discriminatory basis in respect of all Community shipowners.  2. In imposing public service obligations, Member States shall be limited to requirements concerning ports to be served, regularity, continuity, frequency, capacity to provide the service, rates to be charged and manning of the vessel.  Where applicable, any compensation for public service obligations must be available to all Community shipowners.  3. Existing public service contracts may remain in force up to the expiry date of the relevant contract.  Article 5  1. In the event of a serious disturbance of the internal transport market due to cabotage liberalization, a Member State may request the Commission to adopt safeguard measures.  After consulting the other Member States, the Commission shall decide where appropriate on the necessary safeguard measures, within 30 working days of receipt of the relevant request from a Member State. Such measures may involve the temporary  exclusion, not exceeding 12 months, of the area concerned from the scope of this Regulation.  The Commission shall communicate to the Council and the Member States any decision on its safeguard measures.  If after the period of 30 working days the Commission has taken no decision on the subject, the Member State concerned shall be entitled to apply the measures requested until the Commission has taken its decision.  However, in the event of an emergency, Member States may unilaterally adopt the appropriate provisional measures which may remain in force for no more than three months. In such an event, Member States must immediately inform the Commission of the  adoption of such measures. The Commission may abrogate the measures or confirm them with or without modification until it takes its final decision in accordance with the second subparagraph.  2. The Commission may also adopt safeguard measures on its own initiative, after consulting the Member States.  Article 6  1. By way of derogation, the following maritime transport services carried out in the Mediterranean and along the coast of Spain, Portugal and France shall be temporarily exempted from the implementation of this Regulation:  - cruise services, until 1 January 1995,  - transport of strategic goods (oil, oil products and drinking water), until 1 January 1997,  - services by ships smaller than 650 gt, until 1 January 1998,  - regular passenger and ferry services, until 1 January 1999.  2. By way of derogation, island cabotage in the Mediterranean and cabotage with regard to the Canary, Azores and Madeira archipelagoes, Ceuta and Melilla, the French islands along the Atlantic coast and the French overseas departments shall be  temporarily exempted from the implementation of this Regulation until 1 January 1999.  3. For reasons of socio-economic cohesion, the derogation provided for in paragraph 2 shall be extended for Greece until 1 January 2004 for regular passenger and ferry services and services provided by vessels less than 650 gt.  Article 7  Article 62 of the Treaty shall apply to the matters covered by this Regulation.  Article 8  Without prejudice to the provisions of the Treaty relating to the right of establishment and to this Regulation, a person providing a maritime transport service may, in order to do so, temporarily pursue his activity in the Member States  where the service is provided, under the same conditions as are imposed by that State on its own nationals.  Article 9  Before adopting laws, regulations or administrative provisions in implementation of this Regulation, Member States shall consult the Commission. They shall inform the latter of any measures thus adopted.  Article 10  The Commission shall submit to the Council, before 1 January 1995, and thereafter every two years, a report on the implementation of this Regulation and, if appropriate, shall also put forward any necessary proposals.  Article 11  This Regulation shall enter into force on 1 January 1993. This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.

Shipping companies based in countries outside the EU, but controlled by EU nationals, may also offer such services.\nThe regulation defines ‘maritime transport services within an EU country (maritime cabotage)’, ‘Community shipowners’, ‘public service contract’, ‘public service obligations’, and ‘serious disturbance of the internal transport market’.\nManning\nDepending on the kind of transport service, matters relating to manning are the responsibility either of the EU country of registration (flag State) or of the country in which the cabotage service is performed (host State).\nPublic service\nEU countries may make the right to provide transport services subject to public service obligations or may conclude public service contracts in the interests of maintaining adequate cabotage services between the mainland and its islands and between the islands themselves.\nSafeguard measures\nWhere the market's opening up to cabotage results in problems (such as the serious excess of supply over demand) that threaten the financial survival of shipping companies, the Commission may introduce safeguard measures. These may include the temporary exclusion of the area concerned from the scope of the regulation.\nNon-discrimination\nPersons providing maritime transport services in an EU country other than their own may do so temporarily on the same terms as those applied by that country to its own nationals.\nTimetable\nMaritime cabotage was liberalised on 1 January 1993. For France, Italy, Greece, Portugal and Spain, mainland cabotage was gradually liberalised according to a specific timetable for each type of transport service. Mainland-island and inter-island cabotage for these countries was liberalised in 1999. This exemption was extended for Greece until 2004 for scheduled passenger and lighter services and services involving vessels of less than 650 gross tonnes (gt). Exemptions were granted to Croatia till 31 December 2016 for existing public service contracts and for cruise services between Croatian ports by ships smaller than 650 gt, which are reserved for Croatian ships till 31 December 2014.\nBackground\nFurther information is available from this web site.\nREFERENCES\nAct\nEntry into force\nDeadline for transposition in the Member States\nOfficial Journal\nRegulation (EEC) No 3577/92\n1.1.1993\n-\nL 364 of 12.12.1992\nAmending act\nEntry into force\nDeadline for transposition in the Member States\nOfficial Journal\nAct concerning the conditions of accession of Croatia\n1.7.2013\n-\nOJ L 112 of 24.4.2012\nRELATED ACTS\nCommunication from the Commission to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions on the interpretation of Council Regulation (EEC) No\n3577/92\napplying the principle of freedom to provide services to maritime transport within Member States (maritime cabotage) (\nCOM(2003) 595\nfinal - Not published in the Official Journal).\nDecision\n93/125/EEC\non Spain's request for adoption by the Commission of safeguard measures under Article 5 of Council Regulation (EEC) No\n3577/92\nagainst applying the principle of freedom to provide services to maritime transport within Member States (maritime cabotage) - (Official Journal L 49 of 27.02.1993).\nThis Decision authorises Spain to exclude the Spanish mainland, for six months from the date of notification of this Decision, from the scope of Regulation (EEC) No 3577/92. The exclusion does not apply to feeder services. If no Spanish vessel is available to meet the demand for cabotage transport services, other EU countries' vessels will be allowed to offer such services.\nReport from the Commission to the Council: Fifth report on the implementation of Council Regulation (EEC) No 3577/92 applying the principle of freedom to provide services to maritime cabotage (2001-2010) (COM(2014) 231 final of 22.4.2014 - not published in the Official Journal).\nThis report is divided into 4 chapters:\n1.\nRecent case-law and legislative developments in EU and EFTA countries;\n2.\nMarket trends in EU and EFTA countries;\n3.\nThe available data on employment in maritime cabotage (due to the lack of reliable and conclusive data this part no longer contains the statistics on the crew costs).\n4.\nConclusion: the Regulation is fit for purpose and does not require revision. Some issues raised in the consultation suggest there are problems of interpretation and implementation. These have been addressed in the communication on maritime cabotage (see next entry).\nCommunication from the Commission on the interpretation of Council Regulation (EEC) No 3577/92 applying the principle of freedom to provide services to maritime transport within Member States (maritime cabotage) [\nCOM(2014) 232 final\n of 22.4.2014 - not published in the Official Journal].\nDrawing on over 20 years' experience of the practical application of Regulation (EEC) No 3577/92, in the interests of transparency and legal certainty, the Commission has decided to update and amend its interpretation of the provisions of the Regulation.\nThis Communication amends and replaces previous Commission's interpretative communications of 2003 and 2006. It is for information purposes only, to help explain the Regulation and indicates how the Commission intends to apply the Regulation. It does not set out either to revise the Regulation or to encroach on the Court of Justice's jurisdiction in matters of interpretation.\nIt starts by specifying the scope of the freedom to provide services in the maritime cabotage sector. It indicates who enjoys that freedom and recalls which services the Regulation covers.\nIt goes on to describe the extent of the three derogations to the freedom to provide services, as provided for in the regulation:\n—\nEU countries can impose manning rules on board ships smaller than 650 gt and vessels performing island cabotage services between two ports on their territory.\n—\nEU countries may impose public service obligations and conclude public service contracts in order to ensure an adequate scheduled transport service to, from and between islands.\n—\nEU countries may ask the Commission to adopt safeguard measures to remedy a serious disturbance of the internal market.\nLastly, it provides guidance on the application of Regulation (EC) No 1370/2007 on public passenger transport services by rail and by road to maritime cabotage services.\nLast updated: 11.08.2014", "tags": ["liberalisation of trade", "freedom to provide services", "domestic market", "maritime transport"], "subjects": ["Transport", "Freedom of establishment"], "split": "train", "reference_annotations": {}, "summary_annotations": {}}
