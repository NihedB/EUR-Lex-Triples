whereas these additional import duties may be imposed in particular if the  import prices fall below the trigger prices; Whereas, therefore, specific implementing rules should be laid down for the poultrymeat and egg  sectors as well as for egg albumin and the trigger prices should be published; Whereas the import prices to be taken into consideration for imposing an additional import duty  should be checked against the representative prices on the world market or on the Community import  market for the products in question; whereas it is necessary that Member States communicate the  prices at various stages of marketing at regular intervals in order to be able to determine the  representative prices and the corresponding additional duties; Whereas the importer may choose that the additional duty is calculated on a basis which is  different from the representative price; whereas, however, in that case there should be provision  for the lodging of a security equal to the amount of additional duty which he would have paid if  the additional duty had been determined on the basis of the representative price; whereas the  security will be reimbursed if, within a certain time limit, proof is provided that the conditions  for the disposal of the consignment have been met; whereas, as part of a posteriori checks,  additional duty due will be recovered pursuant to Article 220 of Council Regulation (EEC) No  2913/92  (5) establishing the Community customs code; whereas it is only fair that, within the  framework of such checks, interest will be added to the duty due; Whereas the provisions of Commission Regulation No 163/67/EEC of 26 June 1967 on fixing the  additional amount for imports of poultry-farming products from third countries  (6), as last  amended by Regulation (EEC) No 3821/92  (7), are replaced by the provisions of this Regulation;  whereas the aforementioned Regulation should, therefore, be replaced as from the date of entry into  force of the Agreement on Agriculture of the Uruguay Round; Whereas it results from regular monitoring of the information providing the basis for the  verification of the import prices in the poultrymeat and egg sectors as well as for egg albumin  that additional duties should be imposed on the import of certain products, taking into account  variation of prices according to origin; whereas, therefore, representative prices and  corresponding additional duties should be published for those products; Whereas additional duties may not be imposed in particular on products imported within tariff  quotas agreed upon in the framework of the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations; Whereas the Management Committee for Poultrymeat and Eggs has not delivered an opinion within the  time limit set by the chairman, HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION: Article 1 The additional import duties referred to in Article 5 (1) of  Regulations (EEC) No 2771/75 and (EEC) No 2777/75 and in Article 3 (1) of Regulation (EEC) No  2783/75, hereinafter referred to as 'additional duties`, are applied to the products listed in  Annex I and originating in the countries indicated therein. The corresponding trigger prices referred to in Article 5 (2) of Regulations (EEC) No 2771/75 and  (EEC) No 2777/75 and in Article 3 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 2783/75 are shown in Annex II.

These prices are shown in Annex I. 2.  The Member States shall communicate to the Commission, each Monday, the prices referred to at  the third indent of paragraph 1 for representative shipments of products listed in Annex II. Article 3 1.  At the request of the importer the additional duty may be established on the basis  of the cif import price of the consignment in question, if this price is higher than the applicable  representative price, referred to in Article 2 (1).

In the case referred to in paragraph 1, the importer must lodge the security referred to in  Article 248 (1) of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93  (1), equal to the amount of additional  duty which he would have paid if the calculation of the additional duty had been made on the basis  of the representative price applicable to the product in question. The importer shall have one month from the sale of the products in question, subject to a limit of  four months from the date of acceptance of the declaration of release for free circulation, to  prove that the consignment was disposed of under conditions confirming the correctness of the  prices referred to in paragraph 1. Failure to meet one or other of these deadlines shall entail the  loss of the security lodged. However, the time limit of four months may be extended by the  competent authorities by a maximum of three months at the request of the importer, which must be  duly substantiated. The security lodged shall be released to the extent that proof of the conditions of disposal is  provided to the satisfaction of the customs authorities. Otherwise, the security shall be forfeit by way of payment of the additional duties. If on verification the competent authorities establish that the requirements of this Article have  not been met, they shall recover the duty due in accordance with Article 220 of Regulation (EEC) No  2913/92. The amount of the duty to be recovered or remaining to be recovered shall include interest  from the date the goods were released for free circulation up to the date of recovery. The interest  rate applied shall be that in force for recovery operations under national law. 3.  In the absence of the request referred to in paragraph 1, the import price of the consignment  in question to be taken into consideration for imposing an additional duty shall be the  representative price referred to in Article 2 (1). Article 4 1.  If the difference between the trigger price in question refered to in Article 1 (2)  and the import price to be taken into consideration for imposing an additional duty in accordance  with Article 3 (1) of (3): (a)  is less than or equal to 10  % of the trigger price, no additional duty shall be imposed; (b)  is greater than 10  % but less than or equal to 40  % of the trigger price, the additional  duty shall equal 30  % of the amount by which the difference exceeds 10  %; (c)  is greater than 40  % but less than or equal to 60  % of the trigger price, the additional  duty shall equal 50  % of the amount by which the difference exceeds 40  %, plus the additional  duty allowed under (b); (d)  is greater than 60  % but less than or equal to 75  %, the additional duty shall equal 70  %  of the amount by which the difference exceeds 60  % of the trigger price, plus the additional  duties allowed under (b) and (c); (e)  is greater than 75  % of the trigger price, the additional duty shall equal 90  % of the  amount by which the difference exceeds 75  %, plus the additional duties allowed under (b), (c) and  (d). 2.

This is the price of a good delivered at the frontier of the importing country, before the payment of any import duties or other taxes on imports or trade and transport margins within the country. This is checked against the representative prices* (listed in Annex I) which the European Commission determines on the basis of the data provided by the European Union (EU) Member States. The trigger prices, at which additional import duty becomes payable, are listed in Annex II.\nWhen the CIF import price per 100 kg of a consignment is higher than the representative price, the importer must present at least the following proofs to the competent authorities of the importing Member State:\npurchasing contract (or an equivalent document),\ninsurance contract,\ninvoice,\ncertificate of origin (where applicable),\ntransport contract,\nbill of lading (in case of sea transport).\nThe importer must also lodge a security payment that is equal to the difference between the amount of additional import duty calculated on the basis of the representative price, and the amount of additional import duty calculated on the basis of the CIF import price.\nThe importer has 2 months from the sale of the products in question — subject to a 9-month limit (extendable by up to 3 months in justified cases) from the date the declaration of release for free circulation was accepted — to prove that the consignment was disposed of under conditions confirming the correctness of the prices referred to above.\nThe security payment may be waived if the customs authorities are satisfied with the proof of conditions of disposal.\nIf these requirements are not met, the duty that is due must be recovered, including interest.\nDuty payable\nIf the difference between the trigger price and the CIF import price is:\n1.less than or equal to 10% of the trigger price — no additional duty is payable;\n2.greater than 10% but less than or equal to 40% of the trigger price — the additional duty will be 30% of the amount by which the difference exceeds 10%;\n3.greater than 40% but less than or equal to 60% of the trigger price — the additional duty will be 50% of the amount by which the difference exceeds 40%, plus the additional duty allowed under (2);\n4.greater than 60% but less than or equal to 75% of the trigger price — the additional duty will be 70% of the amount by which the difference exceeds 60% of the trigger price, plus the additional duties allowed under (2) and (3);\n5.greater than 75% of the trigger price — the additional duty will be 90% of the amount by which the difference exceeds 75%, plus the additional duties allowed under (2), (3) and (4).\nScope\nThe additional import duties apply to the products listed in Annex I to the regulation and originating in the countries indicated therein.\nIf necessary, the Commission may, at the request of a Member State or on its own initiative, add or remove the countries of origin or goods to which additional import duties apply in Annex I, and, if the prices are at least 5% different from the determined price, adjust the representative prices.\nThe regulation repeals Regulation No 163/67/EEC.\nFROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?\n              \nIt has applied since 1 July 1995.\nBACKGROUND\n              \nSee also:\nPoultry (European Commission)\nEU import conditions for poultry and poultry products — factsheet (European Commission)\nEggs (European Commission).\nKEY TERMS\n              \nRepresentative price.
