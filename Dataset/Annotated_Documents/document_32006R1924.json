{"celex_id": "32006R1924", "reference": "30.12.2006\nEN\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\nL 404/9\nREGULATION (EC) No 1924/2006 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL\nof 20 December 2006\non nutrition and health claims made on foods\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 95 thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the Commission,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee (1),\nActing in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty (2),\nWhereas:\n(1)\nAn increasing number of foods labelled and advertised in the Community bear nutrition and health claims. In order to ensure a high level of protection for consumers and to facilitate their choice, products put on the market must be safe and adequately labelled.\n(2)\nDifferences between national provisions relating to such claims may impede the free movement of foods and create unequal conditions of competition. They thus have a direct impact on the functioning of the internal market. It is therefore necessary to adopt Community rules on the use of nutrition and health claims on foods.\n(3)\nGeneral labelling provisions are contained in Directive 2000/13/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 March 2000 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the labelling, presentation and advertising of foodstuffs (3). Directive 2000/13/EC generally prohibits the use of information that would mislead the purchaser or attribute medicinal properties to food. This Regulation should complement the general principles in Directive 2000/13/EC and lay down specific provisions concerning the use of nutrition and health claims concerning foods to be delivered as such to the consumer.\n(4)\nThis Regulation should apply to all nutrition and health claims made in commercial communications, including, inter alia, generic advertising of food and promotional campaigns, such as those supported in whole or in part by public authorities. It should not apply to claims which are made in non-commercial communications, such as dietary guidelines or advice issued by public health authorities and bodies, or non-commercial communications and information in the press and in scientific publications. This Regulation should also apply to trade marks and other brand names which may be construed as nutrition or health claims.\n(5)\nNon-beneficial nutrition claims are not covered by the scope of this Regulation; Member States intending to introduce national schemes relating to non-beneficial nutrition claims should notify such schemes to the Commission and to other Member States in accordance with Directive 98/34/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 June 1998 laying down a procedure for the provision of information in the field of technical standards and regulations and of rules on Information Society services (4).\n(6)\nAt international level the Codex Alimentarius has adopted General Guidelines on claims in 1991 and Guidelines for the use of nutrition claims in 1997. An amendment to the latter has been adopted by the Codex Alimentarius Commission in 2004. That amendment concerns the inclusion of health claims in the 1997 Guidelines. Due consideration is given to the definitions and conditions set in the Codex Guidelines.\n(7)\nThe possibility of using the claim ‘low fat’ for spreadable fats provided for in Council Regulation (EC) No 2991/94 of 5 December 1994 laying down standards for spreadable fats (5) should be adapted to the provisions of this Regulation as soon as possible. In the meantime, Regulation (EC) No 2991/94 applies for the products it covers.\n(8)\nThere is a wide range of nutrients and other substances including, but not limited to, vitamins, minerals including trace elements, amino acids, essential fatty acids, fibre, various plants and herbal extracts with a nutritional or physiological effect that might be present in a food and be the subject of a claim. Therefore, general principles applicable to all claims made on foods should be established in order to ensure a high level of consumer protection, give the consumer the necessary information to make choices in full knowledge of the facts, as well as creating equal conditions of competition for the food industry.\n(9)\nFoods promoted with claims may be perceived by consumers as having a nutritional, physiological or other health advantage over similar or other products to which such nutrients and other substances are not added. This may encourage consumers to make choices which directly influence their total intake of individual nutrients or other substances in a way which would run counter to scientific advice. To address this potential undesirable effect, it is appropriate to impose certain restrictions as regards the products bearing claims. In this context, factors such as the presence of certain substances, for example the alcohol content of the product or the nutrient profile of the product, are appropriate criteria for determining whether the product can bear claims. The use of such criteria at national level, whilst justified for the purpose of allowing consumers to make informed nutritional choices, is likely to result in barriers to intra-Community trade and should therefore be harmonised at Community level.\n(10)\nThe application of nutrient profiles as a criterion would aim to avoid a situation where nutrition or health claims mask the overall nutritional status of a food product, which could mislead consumers when trying to make healthy choices in the context of a balanced diet. Nutrient profiles as provided for in this Regulation would be intended for the sole purpose of governing the circumstances in which claims may be made. They should be based on generally accepted scientific data relative to the relationship between diet and health. However, profiles should also allow for product innovation and should take into account the variability of dietary habits and traditions, and the fact that individual products may have an important role in the context of an overall diet.\n(11)\nThe establishment of nutrient profiles should take into account the content of different nutrients and substances with a nutritional or physiological effect, in particular those such as fat, saturated fat, trans-fatty acids, salt/sodium and sugars, excessive intakes of which in the overall diet are not recommended, as well as poly- and mono-unsaturated fats, available carbohydrates other than sugars, vitamins, minerals, protein and fibre. When setting the nutrient profiles, the different categories of foods and the place and role of these foods in the overall diet should be taken into account. Exemptions from the requirement to respect established nutrient profiles may be necessary for certain foods or categories of foods depending on their role and importance in the diet of the population. These would be complex technical tasks and the adoption of the relevant measures should be entrusted to the Commission, taking into account the advice of the European Food Safety Authority.\n(12)\nFood supplements as defined in Directive 2002/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 10 June 2002 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to food supplements (6) presented in a liquid form and containing more than 1,2 % by volume of alcohol are not considered as beverages under this Regulation.\n(13)\nThere is a wide variety of claims currently used in the labelling and advertising of foods in some Member States relating to substances that have not been shown to be beneficial or for which at present there is not sufficient scientific agreement. It is necessary to ensure that the substances for which a claim is made have been shown to have a beneficial nutritional or physiological effect.\n(14)\nIn order to ensure that the claims made are truthful, it is necessary that the substance that is the subject of the claim is present in the final product in quantities that are sufficient, or that the substance is absent or present in suitably reduced quantities, to produce the nutritional or physiological effect claimed. The substance should also be available to be used by the body. In addition, and where appropriate, a significant amount of the substance producing the claimed nutritional or physiological effect should be provided by a quantity of the food that can reasonably be expected to be consumed.\n(15)\nIt is important that claims on foods can be understood by the consumer and it is appropriate to protect all consumers from misleading claims. However, since the enactment of Council Directive 84/450/EEC of 10 September 1984 concerning misleading and comparative advertising (7), the Court of Justice of the European Communities has found it necessary in adjudicating on advertising cases to examine the effect on a notional, typical consumer. In line with the principle of proportionality, and to enable the effective application of the protective measures contained in it, this Regulation takes as a benchmark the average consumer, who is reasonably well-informed and reasonably observant and circumspect, taking into account social, cultural and linguistic factors, as interpreted by the Court of Justice, but makes provision to prevent the exploitation of consumers whose characteristics make them particularly vulnerable to misleading claims. Where a claim is specifically aimed at a particular group of consumers, such as children, it is desirable that the impact of the claim be assessed from the perspective of the average member of that group. The average consumer test is not a statistical test. National courts and authorities will have to exercise their own faculty of judgment, having regard to the case-law of the Court of Justice, to determine the typical reaction of the average consumer in a given case.\n(16)\nScientific substantiation should be the main aspect to be taken into account for the use of nutrition and health claims and the food business operators using claims should justify them.\n(17)\nA nutrition or health claim should not be made if it is inconsistent with generally accepted nutrition and health principles or if it encourages or condones excessive consumption of any food or disparages good dietary practice.\n(18)\nGiven the positive image conferred on foods bearing nutrition and health claims and the potential impact these foods may have on dietary habits and overall nutrient intakes, the consumer should be able to evaluate their global nutritional quality. Therefore, nutrition labelling should be compulsory and should be extensive on all foods bearing health claims.\n(19)\nGeneral nutritional labelling provisions are contained in Council Directive 90/496/EEC of 24 September 1990 on nutrition labelling for foodstuffs (8). According to that Directive, where a nutrition claim appears on labelling, in presentation or in advertising, with the exclusion of generic advertising, nutrition labelling should be compulsory. Where a nutrition claim is made for sugars, saturates, fibre or sodium, the information to be given should be that of Group 2 as defined in Article 4(1) of Directive 90/496/EEC. In order to achieve a high level of consumer protection, this obligation to provide the information of Group 2 should apply, mutatis mutandis, where any health claim is made, with the exception of generic advertising.\n(20)\nA list of permitted nutrition claims and their specific conditions of use should also be created based on the conditions for the use of such claims that have been agreed at national or international level and laid down in Community legislation. Any claim considered to have the same meaning for consumers as a nutrition claim included in the aforementioned list should be subject to the same conditions of use indicated therein. For example, claims related to the addition of vitamins and minerals such as ‘with …’, ‘restored …’, ‘added …’, or ‘enriched …’ should be subject to the conditions set for the claim ‘source of …’. The list should be regularly updated in order to take into account scientific and technological developments. Furthermore, for comparative claims it is necessary that the products being compared be clearly identified to the final consumer.\n(21)\nConditions for claims such as ‘lactose-free’ or ‘gluten-free’, addressed to a group of consumers with specific disorders, should be dealt with in Council Directive 89/398/EEC of 3 May 1989 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to foodstuffs intended for particular nutritional uses (9). In addition, that Directive provides the possibility that foodstuffs for normal consumption can indicate their suitability for use by these groups of consumers if they fulfil the conditions for such statement. Until the conditions for such statements are set at Community level, Member States may maintain or adopt relevant national measures.\n(22)\nHealth claims should only be authorised for use in the Community after a scientific assessment of the highest possible standard. In order to ensure harmonised scientific assessment of these claims, the European Food Safety Authority should carry out such assessments.\n(23)\nThere are many factors, other than dietary ones, that can influence psychological and behavioural functions. Communication on these functions is thus very complex and it is difficult to convey a comprehensive, truthful and meaningful message in a short claim to be used in the labelling and advertising of foods. Therefore, it is appropriate, when using psychological and behavioural claims, to require scientific substantiation.\n(24)\nIn the light of Commission Directive 96/8/EC of 26 February 1996 on foods intended for use in energy-restricted diets for weight reduction (10) which prohibits, in the labelling, presentation and advertising of products covered by that Directive, any reference to the rate or amount of weight loss which may result from their use, it is considered appropriate to extend this restriction to all foods.\n(25)\nHealth claims other than those referring to the reduction of disease risk, based on generally accepted scientific data, should undergo a different type of assessment and authorisation. It is therefore necessary to adopt a Community list of such permitted claims after consulting the European Food Safety Authority.\n(26)\nIn order to keep up with scientific and technological developments, the list referred to above should be revised promptly whenever necessary. Such revisions are implementing measures of a technical nature and their adoption should be entrusted to the Commission in order to simplify and expedite the procedure.\n(27)\nA varied and balanced diet is a prerequisite for good health and single products have a relative importance in the context of the total diet. Furthermore, diet is one of the many factors influencing the onset of certain human diseases. Other factors such as age, genetic predisposition, the level of physical activity, the consumption of tobacco and other drugs, environmental exposure and stress may all influence the onset of human diseases. Specific labelling requirements should therefore apply in respect of claims relating to the reduction of a disease risk.\n(28)\nIn order to ensure that health claims are truthful, clear, reliable and useful to the consumer in choosing a healthy diet, the wording and the presentation of health claims should be taken into account in the opinion of the European Food Safety Authority and in the subsequent authorisation procedure.\n(29)\nIn some cases, scientific risk assessment alone cannot provide all the information on which a risk management decision should be based. Other legitimate factors relevant to the matter under consideration should therefore be taken into account.\n(30)\nFor the sake of transparency and in order to avoid multiple applications in respect of claims which have already been assessed, a public register containing the lists of such claims should be established and updated by the Commission.\n(31)\nIn order to stimulate research and development within the agri-food industry, it is appropriate to protect the investment made by innovators in gathering the information and data supporting an application pursuant to this Regulation. This protection should however be limited in time in order to avoid the unnecessary repetition of studies and trials.\n(32)\nGiven the particular nature of foods bearing claims, additional means to those usually available to monitoring bodies should be available in order to facilitate efficient monitoring of those products.\n(33)\nAdequate transitional measures are necessary to enable food business operators to adapt to the requirements of this Regulation.\n(34)\nSince the objective of this Regulation, namely to ensure the effective functioning of the internal market as regards nutrition and health claims whilst providing a high level of consumer protection, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve that objective.\n(35)\nThe measures necessary for the implementation of this Regulation should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission (11),\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nCHAPTER I\nSUBJECT MATTER, SCOPE AND DEFINITIONS\nArticle 1\nSubject matter and scope\n1.   This Regulation harmonises the provisions laid down by law, regulation or administrative action in Member States which relate to nutrition and health claims in order to ensure the effective functioning of the internal market whilst providing a high level of consumer protection.\n2.   This Regulation shall apply to nutrition and health claims made in commercial communications, whether in the labelling, presentation or advertising of foods to be delivered as such to the final consumer, including foods which are placed on the market unpacked or supplied in bulk.\nIt shall also apply in respect of foods intended for supply to restaurants, hospitals, schools, canteens and similar mass caterers.\n3.   A trade mark, brand name or fancy name appearing in the labelling, presentation or advertising of a food which may be construed as a nutrition or health claim may be used without undergoing the authorisation procedures provided for in this Regulation, provided that it is accompanied by a related nutrition or health claim in that labelling, presentation or advertising which complies with the provisions of this Regulation.\n4.   This Regulation shall apply without prejudice to the following Community provisions:\n(a)\nDirective 89/398/EEC and Directives adopted on the basis thereof;\n(b)\nCouncil Directive 80/777/EEC of 15 July 1980 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the exploitation and marketing of natural mineral waters (12);\n(c)\nCouncil Directive 98/83/EC of 3 November 1998 on the quality of water intended for human consumption (13).\nArticle 2\nDefinitions\n1.

Derogations in the case of nutrients for which sufficient quantities cannot be provided by a balanced and varied diet, including the conditions for their application, may be adopted in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 24(2), taking into account the special conditions present in Member States;\n(e)\nrefer to changes in bodily functions which could give rise to or exploit fear in the consumer, either textually or through pictorial, graphic or symbolic representations.\nArticle 4\nConditions for the use of nutrition and health claims\n1.   By 19 January 2009, the Commission shall, in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 24(2), establish specific nutrient profiles and the conditions, including exemptions, which shall be respected for the use of nutrition and health claims on foods and/or categories of foods.\nThese nutrient profiles established for food and/or certain categories of food, and the conditions for the use of nutrition or health claims with respect to the nutrient profiles, shall be laid down taking into account in particular:\n(a)\nthe quantities of certain nutrients and other substances contained in the food, such as fat, saturated fatty acids, trans-fatty acids, sugars and salt/sodium;\n(b)\nthe role and importance of the food (or of categories of foods) in the diet of the population in general or, as appropriate, of certain risk groups including children;\n(c)\nthe overall nutritional composition of the food and the presence of nutrients that have been scientifically recognised as having an effect on health.\nThe nutrient profiles shall be based on scientific knowledge about diet and nutrition, and their relation to health.\nIn setting the nutrient profiles, the Commission shall request the Authority to provide, within 12 months, relevant scientific advice, focusing in particular on:\n(i)\nwhether profiles should be set for food in general and/or categories of food;\n(ii)\nthe choice and balance of nutrients to be taken into account;\n(iii)\nthe choice of reference quantity/basis for profiles;\n(iv)\nthe approach to the calculation of the profiles, and\n(v)\ntesting of a proposed system.\nIn setting the nutrient profiles, the Commission shall carry out consultations with interested parties, in particular food business operators and consumer groups.\nNutrient profiles and their conditions of use shall be updated to take into account relevant scientific developments in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 24(2).\n2.   By way of derogation from paragraph 1, nutrition claims referring to the reduction of fat, saturated fatty acids, trans-fatty acids, sugars and salt/sodium shall be allowed without reference to a profile for the specific nutrient/s for which the claim is made, provided they comply with the conditions laid down in this Regulation.\n3.   Beverages containing more than 1,2 % by volume of alcohol shall not bear:\n(a)\nhealth claims;\n(b)\nnutrition claims, other than those which refer to a reduction in the alcohol or energy content.\n4.   In the absence of specific Community rules regarding nutrition claims referring to the reduction or absence of alcohol or energy in beverages which normally contain alcohol, relevant national rules may apply in compliance with the provisions of the Treaty.\n5.   Foods or categories of foods other than those referred to in paragraph 3, for which nutrition or health claims are to be restricted or prohibited, may be determined in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 24(2) and in the light of scientific evidence.\nArticle 5\nGeneral conditions\n1.   The use of nutrition and health claims shall only be permitted if the following conditions are fulfilled:\n(a)\nthe presence, absence or reduced content in a food or category of food of a nutrient or other substance in respect of which the claim is made has been shown to have a beneficial nutritional or physiological effect, as established by generally accepted scientific data;\n(b)\nthe nutrient or other substance for which the claim is made:\n(i)\nis contained in the final product in a significant quantity as defined in Community legislation or, where such rules do not exist, in a quantity that will produce the nutritional or physiological effect claimed as established by generally accepted scientific data; or\n(ii)\nis not present or is present in a reduced quantity that will produce the nutritional or physiological effect claimed as established by generally accepted scientific data;\n(c)\nwhere applicable, the nutrient or other substance for which the claim is made is in a form that is available to be used by the body;\n(d)\nthe quantity of the product that can reasonably be expected to be consumed provides a significant quantity of the nutrient or other substance to which the claim relates, as defined in Community legislation or, where such rules do not exist, a significant quantity that will produce the nutritional or physiological effect claimed as established by generally accepted scientific data;\n(e)\ncompliance with the specific conditions set out in Chapter III or Chapter IV as the case may be.\n2.   The use of nutrition and health claims shall only be permitted if the average consumer can be expected to understand the beneficial effects as expressed in the claim.\n3.   Nutrition and health claims shall refer to the food ready for consumption in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions.\nArticle 6\nScientific substantiation for claims\n1.   Nutrition and health claims shall be based on and substantiated by generally accepted scientific data.\n2.   A food business operator making a nutrition or health claim shall justify the use of the claim.\n3.   The competent authorities of the Member States may request a food business operator or a person placing a product on the market to produce all relevant elements and data establishing compliance with this Regulation.\nArticle 7\nNutrition information\nThe obligation and the modalities for providing information pursuant to Directive 90/496/EEC where a nutrition claim is made shall apply, mutatis mutandis, where a health claim is made, with the exception of generic advertising. However, the information to be provided shall consist of information in Group 2 as defined in Article 4(1) of Directive 90/496/EEC.\nIn addition and as the case may be, the amount(s) of the substance(s) to which a nutrition or health claim relates that does not appear in the nutrition labelling shall also be stated in the same field of vision of the nutrition information and be expressed in accordance with Article 6 of Directive 90/496/EEC.\nIn the case of food supplements, the nutrition information shall be provided in accordance with Article 8 of Directive 2002/46/EC.\nCHAPTER III\nNUTRITION CLAIMS\nArticle 8\nSpecific conditions\n1.   Nutrition claims shall only be permitted if they are listed in the Annex and are in conformity with the conditions set out in this Regulation.\n2.

Without prejudice to Directive 84/450/EEC, a comparison may only be made between foods of the same category, taking into consideration a range of foods of that category. The difference in the quantity of a nutrient and/or the energy value shall be stated and the comparison shall relate to the same quantity of food.\n2.   Comparative nutrition claims shall compare the composition of the food in question with a range of foods of the same category, which do not have a composition which allows them to bear a claim, including foods of other brands.\nCHAPTER IV\nHEALTH CLAIMS\nArticle 10\nSpecific conditions\n1.   Health claims shall be prohibited unless they comply with the general requirements in Chapter II and the specific requirements in this Chapter and are authorised in accordance with this Regulation and included in the lists of authorised claims provided for in Articles 13 and 14.\n2.   Health claims shall only be permitted if the following information is included in the labelling, or if no such labelling exists, in the presentation and advertising:\n(a)\na statement indicating the importance of a varied and balanced diet and a healthy lifestyle;\n(b)\nthe quantity of the food and pattern of consumption required to obtain the claimed beneficial effect;\n(c)\nwhere appropriate, a statement addressed to persons who should avoid using the food; and\n(d)\nan appropriate warning for products that are likely to present a health risk if consumed to excess.\n3.   Reference to general, non-specific benefits of the nutrient or food for overall good health or health-related well-being may only be made if accompanied by a specific health claim included in the lists provided for in Article 13 or 14.\n4.   Where appropriate, guidelines on the implementation of this Article shall be adopted in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 24(2) and, if necessary, in consultation with interested parties, in particular food business operators and consumer groups.\nArticle 11\nNational medical associations and health-related charities\nIn the absence of specific Community rules concerning recommendations of or endorsements by national medical associations and health-related charities, relevant national rules may apply in compliance with the provisions of the Treaty.\nArticle 12\nRestrictions on the use of certain health claims\nThe following health claims shall not be allowed:\n(a)\nclaims which suggest that health could be affected by not consuming the food;\n(b)\nclaims which make reference to the rate or amount of weight loss;\n(c)\nclaims which make reference to recommendations of individual doctors or health professionals and other associations not referred to in Article 11.\nArticle 13\nHealth claims other than those referring to the reduction of disease risk\n1.   Health claims describing or referring to:\n(a)\nthe role of a nutrient or other substance in growth, development and the functions of the body, or\n(b)\npsychological and behavioural functions; or\n(c)\nwithout prejudice to Directive 96/8/EC, slimming or weight-control or a reduction in the sense of hunger or an increase in the sense of satiety or to the reduction of the available energy from the diet,\nwhich are included in the list provided for in paragraph 3 may be made without undergoing the authorisation procedure laid down in Articles 15 to 18, if they are:\n(i)\nbased on generally accepted scientific data; and\n(ii)\nwell understood by the average consumer.\n2.   Member States shall provide the Commission with lists of claims as referred to in paragraph 1 by 31 January 2008 at the latest accompanied by the conditions applying to them and by references to the relevant scientific justification.\n3.   After consulting the Authority, the Commission shall adopt, in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 24(2), a Community list of permitted claims as referred to in paragraph 1, and all necessary conditions for the use of these claims by 31 January 2010 at the latest.\n4.   Any changes to the list referred to in paragraph 3, based on generally accepted scientific data, shall be adopted in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 24(2), after consulting the Authority, on the Commission's own initiative or following a request by a Member State.\n5.   Any additions of claims to the list referred to in paragraph 3 based on newly developed scientific data and/or which include a request for the protection of proprietary data shall be adopted following the procedure laid down in Articles 15 to 18.\nArticle 14\nReduction of disease risk claims\n1.   Notwithstanding Article 2(1)(b) of Directive 2000/13/EC, reduction of disease risk claims may be made where they have been authorised in accordance with the procedure laid down in Articles 15 to 18 of this Regulation for inclusion in a Community list of such permitted claims together with all the necessary conditions for the use of these claims.\n2.   In addition to the general requirements laid down in this Regulation and the specific requirements of paragraph 1, for reduction of disease risk claims the labelling or, if no such labelling exists, the presentation or advertising shall also bear a statement indicating that the disease to which the claim is referring has multiple risk factors and that altering one of these risk factors may or may not have a beneficial effect.\nArticle 15\nApplication for authorisation\n1.   When reference is made to this Article, an application for authorisation shall be submitted in accordance with the following paragraphs.\n2.   The application shall be sent to the national competent authority of a Member State.\n(a)\nThe national competent authority shall:\n(i)\nacknowledge receipt of an application in writing within 14 days of its receipt. The acknowledgement shall state the date of receipt of the application;\n(ii)\ninform without delay the Authority; and\n(iii)\nmake the application and any supplementary information supplied by the applicant available to the Authority;\n(b)\nthe Authority shall:\n(i)\ninform without delay the other Member States and the Commission of the application and shall make the application and any supplementary information supplied by the applicant available to them;\n(ii)\nmake the summary of the application referred to in paragraph 3(g) available to the public.\n3.   The application shall include the following:\n(a)\nthe name and address of the applicant;\n(b)\nthe nutrient or other substance, or the food or the category of food, in respect of which the health claim is to be made and its particular characteristics;\n(c)\na copy of the studies, including, where available, independent, peer-reviewed studies, which have been carried out with regard to the health claim and any other material which is available to demonstrate that the health claim complies with the criteria provided for in this Regulation;\n(d)\nwhere appropriate, an indication of the information which should be regarded as proprietary accompanied by verifiable justification;\n(e)\na copy of other scientific studies which are relevant to that health claim;\n(f)\na proposal for the wording of the health claim for which authorisation is sought including, as the case may be, specific conditions for use;\n(g)\na summary of the application.\n4.   The Commission, having first consulted the Authority, shall establish in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 24(2) implementing rules for the application of this Article, including rules concerning the preparation and presentation of the application.\n5.   The Commission, in close cooperation with the Authority, shall make available appropriate technical guidance and tools to assist food business operators, in particular SMEs, in the preparation and presentation of the application for scientific assessment.\nArticle 16\nOpinion of the Authority\n1.   In giving its opinion, the Authority shall endeavour to respect a time limit of six months from the date of receipt of a valid application. Such time limit shall be extended whenever the Authority seeks supplementary information from the applicant as provided for in paragraph 2.\n2.

Such substances must be in quantities that can be reasonably consumed and in an amount to give the desired effect.\nHealth claims will only be allowed if the following information is on the label:\nthe target population for the claim;\na statement of the importance of a varied and balanced diet and a healthy lifestyle;\nthe quantity and pattern of consumption needed to obtain the claimed beneficial effect;\na statement aimed at persons who should avoid consuming the food (e.g. pregnant women);\na warning for products likely to present a health risk if consumed to excess;\nwhere reduced risk of disease is claimed, a statement that the disease has multiple risk factors and altering one of these may or may not have a beneficial effect;\nany other restrictions or directions for use.\nHealth claims based on generally accepted scientific data, well understood by the average consumer, may be exempted from the authorisation process.\nDrinks containing more than 1.2 % by volume of alcohol must not bear any health or nutrition claims other than one referring to the reduction in the alcohol or energy content.\nRegulation (EU) No 432/2012 provides for the list of permitted health claims, other than those related to the reduction of disease risk and to children’s development and health. This regulation has applied since 14 December 2012 and is regularly amended to update the list of newly authorised health claims.\nApplication for authorisation\nAny manufacturer may request the inclusion of a new claim to the permitted list by submitting an application to any EU country. The latter forwards it to the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and the Commission then takes a decision on the use of the claim based on the EFSA’s scientific opinion.\nFROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?\n              \nIt has applied since 1 July 2007.\nBACKGROUND\n              \nFor more information, see:\n‘Nutrition and health claims’ on the European Commission's website\n‘EU register of nutrition and health claims made on foods’ on the European Commission's website\nCommission guidance on the implementation of Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006 (2007)\nGuidelines for the implementation of specific conditions for health claims laid down in Article 10 of Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006\n* KEY TERMS\n              \nClaim: any message or representation, which is not mandatory under EU or national legislation, including pictorial, graphic or symbolic representation in any form that states, suggests or implies that a food has particular characteristics.\nNutrition claim: any claim that states, suggests or implies that a food has particular beneficial nutritional properties due to:the energy (calorific value) that it:provides,provides at a reduced or increased rate, ordoes not provide; and/orthe nutrients or other substances that it:contains,contains in reduced or increased proportions, ordoes not contain. \nHealth claim: any claim that states, suggests or implies that a relationship exists between a food category, a food or one of its constituents and health.\nNutrient: protein, carbohydrate, fat, fibre, sodium, vitamins and minerals listed in the annex to Regulation (EU) No 1169/2011, and substances that belong to or are components of one of those categories.\nOther substance: a substance other than a nutrient that has a nutritional or physiological effect.\nMAIN DOCUMENT\n            \nRegulation (EC) No 1924/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 December 2006 on nutrition and health claims made on foods (OJ L 404, 30.12.2006, pp. 9-25)\nSuccessive amendments to Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006 have been incorporated in the original text.
