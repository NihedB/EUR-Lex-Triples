Members of those committees remain in office until they are replaced or their appointments are renewed.\n(5)\nTherefore, and for the sake of clarity, it is necessary to replace Decision 2004/210/EC with a new Decision.\n(6)\nSound and timely scientific advice is an essential requirement for Commission proposals, decisions and policy relating to consumer safety, public health and the environment. A flexible advisory structure is necessary in that respect, in order to ensure easier access to highly qualified scientific expertise in a wide range of fields.\n(7)\nThe scientific advice on matters relating to consumer safety, public health and the environment must be based on the principles of excellence, independence and impartiality, and transparency, as developed in the Commission Communication on ‘The collection and use of expertise by the Commission: principles and guidelines. Improving the knowledge for better policies’ (5), and it must be organised in conformity with best practice principles of risk assessment.\n(8)\nIt is essential that the Scientific Committees make best use of scientific expertise in the EU and beyond as may be necessary for a specific question. To that aim a pool of Scientific Advisors should be established adequately covering the fields of competence of the Committees.\n(9)\nThe reorganisation of the advisory structure must provide increased flexibility to allow it to advise the Commission on matters falling under established areas of competence as well as on emerging and newly identified health risks and matters not within the competence of other Community risk assessment bodies, and must be able to provide rapid advice when needed, ensure full transparency and a high level of consistency and collaboration with other Community bodies and relevant scientific organisations.\n(10)\nThe need for independent scientific advice both in established and new areas of Community responsibilities falling within the competence of the Scientific Committees is likely to continue to increase. The scientific advice structure on risk assessment needs therefore to be reinforced, in its composition as well as by more effective working practices.\n(11)\nVarious Community bodies have been established which have among their tasks the assessment of risks in various domains. It is necessary to ensure consistency and promote coordination between the Scientific Committees and such bodies. The Scientific Committees need to reinforce their effectiveness also by appropriate exchanges of information and expertise and through collaboration with other scientific bodies and organisation at national and international level.\n(12)\nThe working practices of the Scientific Committees should be improved by including, in addition to the internal work, the organisation of scientific meetings and workshops and the establishment of networks.\n(13)\nWhile preserving full independence, it is important to ensure openness and transparency of the work of the Scientific Committees by establishing appropriate stakeholder dialogue procedures.\n(14)\nThe openness and transparency sought in the implementation of this Decision should be ensured while fully respecting the requirements laid down in the Community legislation with regard to the protection of personal data and to the access of the public to documents, including the protection of commercial confidentiality,\nHAS DECIDED AS FOLLOWS:\nCHAPTER 1\nGENERAL PROVISIONS\nArticle 1\nThe advisory structure and its fields of competence\n1.

Their job is to provide the Commission with scientific advice in their respective fields.\nACT\nCommission Decision 2008/721/EC of 5 August 2008 setting up an advisory structure of Scientific Committees and experts in the field of consumer safety, public health and the environment and repealing Decision 2004/210/EC [See Amending act(s)].\nSUMMARY\nThe current Decision sets up an advisory structure to assist the Commission in evaluating scientific risks related to consumer safety, public health and the environment.\nThis structure is composed of three committees: the Scientific Committee on Consumer Products (SCCP), the Scientific Committee on Health and Environmental Risks (SCHER) and the Scientific Committee on Emerging and Newly Identified Health Risks (SCENIHR).\nThe committees are consulted on questions which do not fall within the competence of other Community bodies. They give opinions at the request of the Commission or on their own initiative, in particular in the case of an emergency concerning a specific risk or to identify new research needs.\nFields of competence\nThe SCCP provides opinions on all existing risks to the health and safety of consumers concerning non-food products, such as cosmetic products, toys, textiles, clothing, personal care products, household products (detergents, etc.) and consumer services (tattooing, etc.).\nThe SCHER provides opinions on the health and environmental risks caused by pollution or changing physical conditions such as air, water and soil quality. It provides environmental assessments on the life cycle and toxicity and ecotoxicity of biocides. In collaboration with other competent European bodies, it can provide opinions on the toxicity and ecotoxicity of chemical, biochemical and biological compounds.\nThe SCENIHR provides opinions on questions concerning emerging or newly identified health risks, as well as on broader issues or those related indirectly to risk assessment. Examples of potential areas of activity include antimicrobial resistance, new technologies (nanotechnologies, etc.), medical devices (including those incorporating substances of animal and/or human origin), tissue engineering, blood products, fertility reduction, cancer of endocrine organs, physical hazards such as noise and electromagnetic fields (from mobile phones, transmitters and electronically controlled home environments). It can also provide opinions on risks related to public health determinants and non-transmissible diseases.\nHow the Committees work\nThe members of the three Committees are appointed by the Commission on the basis of their skills and according to a geographical distribution.\nThe SCCP, the SCHER and the SCENIHR comprise a maximum of 17 members each. The Commission decides the number of appointed members to each committee depending on the scientific requirements. Members have a renewable term of three years. They cannot be appointed to the same committee more than three times consecutively.\nThe Commission appoints scientific advisors to the Pool for a period of five years, renewable. The committees can invite five experts as associate members to contribute to the preparation of opinions and deliberations. When required the scientific committees can use the assistance of working groups open to specialised external experts.\nThe three Committees have adopted common rules of procedure which ensure their compliance with the principles of excellence, independence, transparency and confidentiality. The committees are coordinated by an Inter-Committee Coordination Group (ICCG) composed of the Chairs and Vice-Chairs of the scientific committees.\nContext\nDecision 2004/210/EC is repealed to improve the effectiveness of the advisory structure of scientific committees, to enlarge the scope of scientific expertise and to reduce the reaction time to risks.\nReferences\nAct\nEntry into force\nDeadline for transposition in the Member States\nOfficial Journal\nDecision 2008/721/EC\n5.9.2008\n-\nOJ L 241 of 10.9.2008\nAmending act(s)\nEntry into force\nDeadline for transposition in the Member States\nOfficial Journal\nDecision 2009/566/EC\n27.7.2009\n-\nOJ L 196 of 28.7.2009\nDecision 2010/309/EU\n5.6.2010\n-\nOJ L 138 of 4.6.2010\nLast updated: 20.08.2010", "tags": ["environmental protection", "consumer protection", "public health", "operation of the Institutions", "scientific committee (EU)", "scientific report"], "subjects": ["Consumer protection", "Public health", "Provisions governing the Institutions"], "split": "train", "reference_annotations": {}, "summary_annotations": {"32008D0721_p1": {"text": "Commission decision 2008/721/ec of 5 August 2008 setting up an advisory structure of Scientific Committees and experts in the field of consumer safety, public health and the environment and repealing decision 2004/210/ec [See Amending act(s)].", "triples": [" decision 2008/721/ec,  repealing,  decision 2004/210/ec"]}}}
