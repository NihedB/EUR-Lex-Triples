Consultations between the Parties shall take place within the SAC concerning the Agreements referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 and, where requested, on other major issues related to their respective trade policies towards third countries. In particular in the event of a third country acceding to the EU, such consultations shall take place so as to ensure that account is taken of the mutual interests of the EU and Kosovo as set out in this Agreement.\nArticle 42\nDumping and subsidy\n1.   This Agreement shall not prevent any of the Parties from taking trade defence action in accordance with paragraph 2 of this Article and with Article 43.\n2.   If one of the Parties finds that dumping and/or countervailable subsidisation is taking place in trade with the other Party, that Party may take appropriate measures against this practice consistent with the WTO Agreement on Implementation of Article VI of the GATT 1994 or the WTO Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures and the respective internal legislation related to those agreements.\nArticle 43\nSafeguards clause\n1.   The parties agree that the rules and principles of Article XIX GATT 1994 and the WTO Agreement on Safeguards are applied.\n2.   Notwithstanding paragraph 1, the importing Party may take appropriate bilateral safeguard measures under the conditions and in accordance with the procedures laid down in this Article, where any product of one Party is being imported into the territory of the other Party in such increased quantities and under such conditions as to cause or threaten to cause:\n(a)\nserious injury to the domestic industry of like or directly competitive products in the territory of the importing Party; or\n(b)\nserious disturbances in any sector of the economy or difficulties which could bring about serious deterioration in the economic situation of a region of the importing Party.\n3.   Bilateral safeguard measures directed at imports from the other Party shall not exceed what is necessary to remedy the problems, as defined in paragraph 2, which have arisen as a result of application of this Agreement. The safeguard measure adopted shall consist of a suspension in the increase or in the reduction of the margins of preferences provided for under this Agreement for the product concerned up to a maximum limit corresponding to the basic duty referred to in Article 20, paragraph 4(a) and (b) and paragraph 5, for the same product. Such measures shall contain clear elements progressively leading to their elimination at the end of the set period, at the latest, and shall not be taken for a period exceeding two years.\nIn very exceptional circumstances, measures may be extended for a further period of maximum two years. No bilateral safeguard measure shall be applied to the import of a product that has previously been subject to such a measure for a period of time equal to that during which such measure had been previously applied, provided that the period of non-application is at least two years since the expiry of the measure.\n4.   In the cases specified in this Article, before taking the measures provided for therein or, in the cases to which paragraph 5(b) of this Article applies, as soon as possible, the EU or Kosovo shall supply the SAC with all relevant information required for a thorough examination of the situation, with a view to seeking a solution acceptable to the Parties.\n5.   For the implementation of the paragraphs 1, 2, 3 and 4 the following provisions shall apply:\n(a)\nThe problems arising from the situation referred to in this Article shall be immediately referred for examination to the SAC, which may take any decisions needed to put an end to such problems.\nIf the SAC or the exporting Party has not taken a decision putting an end to the problems, or no other satisfactory solution has been reached within 30 days of the matter being referred to the SAC, the importing Party may adopt the appropriate measures to remedy the problem in accordance with this Article. In the selection of safeguard measures, priority must be given to those which least disturb the functioning of the arrangements established in this Agreement. Safeguard measures shall preserve the level/margin of preference granted under this Agreement.\n(b)\nWhere exceptional and critical circumstances requiring immediate action make prior information or examination, as the case may be, impossible, the Party concerned may, in the situations specified in this Article, apply forthwith provisional measures necessary to deal with the situation and shall inform the other Party immediately thereof.\nThe safeguard measures shall be notified immediately to the SAC and shall be the subject of periodic consultations within that body, particularly with a view to establishing a timetable for their abolition as soon as circumstances so permit.\n6.   In the event of the EU, or Kosovo, subjecting imports of products liable to give rise to the problems referred to in this Article to an administrative procedure having as its purpose the rapid provision of information on the trend of trade flows, it shall inform the other Party.\nArticle 44\nShortage clause\n1.   Where compliance with this Title leads to:\n(a)\ncritical shortage, or threat thereof, of foodstuffs or other products essential to the exporting Party; or\n(b)\nre-export to a third country of a product against which the exporting Party maintains quantitative export restrictions, export duties or measures or charges having equivalent effect, and where the situations referred to above give rise, or are likely to give rise to major difficulties for the exporting Party,\nthat Party may take appropriate measures under the conditions and in accordance with the procedures laid down in this Article.\n2.   In the selection of measures, priority must be given to those which least disturb the functioning of the arrangements in this Agreement. Such measures shall not be applied in a manner which would constitute a means of arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination where the same conditions prevail, or a disguised restriction on trade, and shall be eliminated when conditions no longer justify their maintenance.\n3.   Before taking the measures provided for in paragraph 1 or, as soon as possible in cases to which paragraph 4 applies, the EU or Kosovo shall supply the SAC with all relevant information, with a view to seeking a solution acceptable to the Parties. The SAC may agree on any means needed to put an end to the difficulties. If no agreement is reached within 30 days of the matter being referred to the SAC, the exporting Party may apply measures under this Article on the exportation of the product concerned.\n4.   Where exceptional and critical circumstances requiring immediate action make prior information or examination, as the case may be, impossible, the EU or Kosovo may apply forthwith the precautionary measures necessary to deal with the situation and shall inform the other Party immediately thereof.\n5.   Any measures applied pursuant to this Article shall be immediately notified to the SAC and shall be the subject of periodic consultations within that body, particularly with a view to establishing a timetable for their elimination as soon as circumstances so permit.\nArticle 45\nState monopolies\nWith regard to state monopolies of a commercial character, Kosovo shall ensure that, by the entry into force of this Agreement, no discrimination regarding the conditions under which goods are procured and marketed exists between nationals of the Member States and Kosovo citizens.\nArticle 46\nRules of origin\nExcept as otherwise stipulated in this Agreement, Protocol III lays down the rules of origin for the implementation of this Agreement.\nArticle 47\nRestrictions authorised\nThis Agreement shall not preclude prohibitions or restrictions on imports, exports or goods in transit justified on grounds of public morality, public policy or public security; the protection of health and life of humans, animals or plants; the protection of treasures of artistic, historic or archaeological value or the protection of intellectual, industrial and commercial property, or rules relating to gold and silver. Such prohibitions or restrictions shall not, however, constitute a means of arbitrary discrimination or a disguised restriction on trade between the Parties.\nArticle 48\nFailure to provide administrative cooperation\n1.   The Parties agree that administrative cooperation is essential for the implementation and the control of the preferential treatment granted under this Title and underline their commitment to combating irregularities and fraud in customs and related matters.\n2.   Where a Party has made a finding, on the basis of objective information, of a failure to provide administrative cooperation and/or of irregularities or fraud under this Title, that Party (referred to in this Article as ‘the Party concerned’) may temporarily suspend the relevant preferential treatment of the product(s) concerned in accordance with this Article.\n3.   For the purpose of this Article a failure to provide administrative cooperation means, inter alia:\n(a)\na repeated failure to respect the obligations to verify the originating status of the product(s) concerned;\n(b)\na repeated refusal or undue delay in carrying out and/or communicating the results of subsequent verification of the proof of origin;\n(c)\na repeated refusal or undue delay in obtaining authorisation to conduct administrative cooperation missions to verify the authenticity of documents or accuracy of information relevant to the granting of the preferential treatment in question.\nFor the purpose of this Article, a finding of irregularities or fraud may be made, inter alia, where there is a rapid increase, without satisfactory explanation, in imports of goods exceeding the usual level of production and export capacity of the other Party, which is linked to objective information concerning irregularities or fraud.\n4.   The application of a temporary suspension shall be subject to the following conditions:\n(a)\nthe Party which has made a finding, on the basis of objective information, of a failure to provide administrative cooperation and/or of irregularities or fraud shall immediately notify the Stabilisation and Association Committee of its finding, together with the objective information, and enter into consultations with the other Party within the Stabilisation and Association Committee, on the basis of all relevant information and objective findings, with a view to reaching a solution acceptable to both Parties.\n(b)\nWhere the Parties have entered into consultations within the Stabilisation and Association Committee under point (a) and have failed to agree on an acceptable solution within three months following the notification, the Party concerned may temporarily suspend the relevant preferential treatment of the product(s) concerned. A temporary suspension shall be notified to the Stabilisation and Association Committee immediately.\n(c)\nTemporary suspensions under this Article shall be limited to the minimum necessary to protect the financial interests of the Party concerned. They shall not exceed a period of six months, which may be renewed. Temporary suspensions shall be notified immediately after their adoption to the Stabilisation and Association Committee. They shall be subject to periodic consultations within the Stabilisation and Association Committee, in particular with a view to their termination as soon as the conditions for their application no longer prevail.\n5.   At the same time as the notification to the Stabilisation and Association Committee under paragraph 4(a), the Party concerned shall publish a notice to importers in its Official Journal. The notice to importers should indicate for the product concerned that there is a finding, on the basis of objective information, of a failure to provide administrative cooperation and/or of irregularities or fraud.\nArticle 49\nIn case of error by the competent authorities in the proper management of the preferential system at export, and in particular in the application of Protocol III where this error leads to consequences in terms of import duties, the Party facing such consequences may request the SAC to examine the possibilities of adopting all appropriate measures with a view to resolving the situation.\nTITLE V\nESTABLISHMENT, SUPPLY OF SERVICES AND CAPITAL\nArticle 50\nDefinition\nFor the purposes of this Agreement:\n(1)\n‘EU company’ and ‘Kosovo company’ means, respectively, a company set up in accordance with the laws of a Member State, or of Kosovo, and having its registered office or central administration or principal place of business in the territory of the EU or of Kosovo. However, should the company have only its registered office in the territory of the EU or of Kosovo respectively, the company shall be considered an EU or a Kosovo company if its operations possess a real and continuous link with the economy of one of the Member States or of Kosovo;\n(2)\n‘Subsidiary’ of a company means a company which is effectively controlled by another company;\n(3)\n‘Branch’ of a company means a place of business not having legal personality which has the appearance of permanency, such as the extension of a parent body, has a management and is materially equipped to negotiate business with third parties so that the latter, although knowing that there will, where necessary, be a legal link with the parent body, the head office of which is abroad, do not have to deal directly with such parent body but may transact business at the place of business constituting the extension;\n(4)\n‘Establishment’ means the right to take up economic activities by means of the setting up of companies including subsidiaries and branches in the EU or in Kosovo respectively;\n(5)\n‘Operations’ means the pursuit of economic activities;\n(6)\n‘Economic activities’ in principle includes activities of an industrial, commercial or professional character and activities of craftsmen;\n(7)\n‘EU national’ and ‘citizen of Kosovo’ means respectively a natural person who is a national of a Member State or a citizen of Kosovo;\n(8)\n‘Financial services’ means the activities described in Annex VI.\nCHAPTER I\nEstablishment\nArticle 51\n1.   Kosovo shall facilitate the setting up of operations on its territory by EU companies. To that end, Kosovo shall grant, upon entry into force of this Agreement:\n(a)\nas regards the establishment of EU companies on the territory of Kosovo, treatment no less favourable than that accorded to its own companies or to any third country company, whichever is the better;\n(b)\nas regards the operation of subsidiaries and branches of EU companies on the territory of Kosovo once established, treatment no less favourable than that accorded to its own companies and branches or to any subsidiary and branch of any third country company, whichever is the better.\n2.   The EU shall grant, from the entry into force of this Agreement:\n(a)\nas regards the establishment of Kosovo companies treatment no less favourable than that accorded by the EU to its own companies or to any company of any third country, whichever is the better;\n(b)\nas regards the operation of subsidiaries and branches of Kosovo companies, established in its territory, treatment no less favourable than that accorded by the EU to its own companies and branches, or to any subsidiary and branch of any third country company, established in its territory, whichever is the better.\n3.   The Parties shall not adopt any new regulations or measures which introduce discrimination as regards the establishment of the other Party’s companies on their territory or in respect of their operation, once established, by comparison with their own companies.\n4.   Notwithstanding this Article,\n(a)\nsubsidiaries and branches of EU companies shall have, from the entry into force of this Agreement, the right to use and rent real property in Kosovo;\n(b)\nsubsidiaries and branches of EU companies shall, within five years from the entry into force of this Agreement, have the right to acquire and enjoy ownership rights over real property as Kosovo companies and, as regards public goods/goods of common interest, the same rights as enjoyed by Kosovo companies respectively where these rights are necessary for the conduct of the economic activities for which they are established.\nArticle 52\n1.   Subject to Article 54 the Parties may regulate the establishment and operation of companies on their territory, insofar as these regulations do not discriminate against companies of the other Party in comparison with its own companies.\n2.   In respect of financial services, notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement, a Party shall not be prevented from taking measures for prudential reasons, including for the protection of investors, depositors, policy holders or persons to whom a fiduciary duty is owed by a financial service supplier, or to ensure the integrity and stability of the financial system. Such measures shall not be used as a means of avoiding the Party’s obligations under this Agreement.\n3.   Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to require a Party to disclose information relating to the affairs and accounts of individual customers or any confidential or proprietary information in the possession of public entities.\nArticle 53\n1.   This Chapter is without prejudice to provisions of the Treaty establishing the Transport Community with the Western Balkans and of the Multilateral Agreement on the establishment of the European Common Aviation Area signed on 9 June 2006 (4).\n2.   Within the scope of the EU transport policy, the SAC may make recommendations in specific cases for improving establishment and operations in the areas covered by paragraph 1.\n3.   This Chapter shall not apply to maritime transport.\nArticle 54\n1.   Articles 51 and 52 do not preclude the application by a Party of particular rules concerning the establishment and operation in its territory of branches of companies of another Party not incorporated in the territory of the first Party, which are justified by legal or technical differences between such branches as compared to branches of companies incorporated in its territory or, as regards financial services, for prudential reasons.\n2.   The difference in treatment shall not go beyond what is strictly necessary as a result of such legal or technical differences or, as regards financial services, for prudential reasons.\nCHAPTER II\nSupply of services\nArticle 55\n1.   An EU company established in the territory of Kosovo or a Kosovo company established in the EU shall be entitled to employ, or have employed by one of its subsidiaries or branches, in accordance with the legislation in force in the host territory of establishment, in the territory of the EU and of Kosovo respectively, employees who are nationals of the EU or citizens of Kosovo respectively, provided that such employees are key personnel as defined in paragraph 2 and that they are employed exclusively by companies, subsidiaries or branches.\n2.   Key personnel of the abovementioned companies hereinafter referred to as ‘organisations’ are ‘intra-corporate transferees’ as defined in point (c) in the following categories, provided that the organisation is a legal person and that the persons concerned have been employed by it or have been partners in it (other than as majority shareholders), for at least the year immediately preceding such movement:\n(a)\nPersons working in a senior position with an organisation, who primarily direct the management of the establishment, receiving general supervision or direction principally from the board of directors or stockholders of the business or their equivalent including:\n(i)\ndirecting the establishment of a department or sub-division of the establishment;\n(ii)\nsupervising and controlling the work of other supervisory, professional or managerial employees;\n(iii)\nhaving the authority personally to recruit and dismiss or recommend recruiting, dismissing or other personnel actions;\n(b)\nPersons working within an organisation who possess specialised knowledge essential to the establishment’s service, research equipment, techniques or management. The assessment of such knowledge may reflect, apart from knowledge specific to the establishment, a high level of qualification referring to a type of work or trade requiring specific technical knowledge, including membership of an accredited profession;\n(c)\nAn ‘intra-corporate transferee’ is defined as a natural person working within an organisation in the territory of a Party, and being temporarily transferred in the context of the pursuit of economic activities in the territory of the other Party; the organisation concerned must have its principal place of business in the territory of a Party and the transfer be to an establishment (branch, subsidiary) of that organisation, effectively pursuing like economic activities in the territory of the other Party.\n3.   The entry into and the temporary presence within the territory of the EU or in Kosovo of Kosovo citizens and EU nationals respectively shall be permitted when these representatives of companies are persons working in a senior position, as defined in paragraph 2(a), within a company, and are responsible for the setting up of an EU subsidiary or branch of a Kosovo company or of a Kosovo subsidiary or branch of an EU company in a Member State or in Kosovo respectively, when:\n(a)\nthose representatives are not engaged in making direct sales or supplying services, and do not receive remuneration from a source located within the host territory of establishment; and\n(b)\nthe company has its principal place of business outside the EU or Kosovo, respectively, and has no other representative, office, branch or subsidiary in that Member State or in Kosovo respectively.\nArticle 56\nIn order to make it easier for EU nationals and citizens of Kosovo to take up and pursue regulated professional activities in Kosovo and in the EU respectively, within two years from the entry into force of this Agreement, the SAC shall examine which steps are necessary for the mutual recognition of qualifications. It may take all necessary measures to that end.\nArticle 57\nSix years from entry into force of this Agreement, the SAC shall establish the modalities to extend the provisions of this chapter to EU nationals and citizens of Kosovo with a view to the temporary entry and stay of service suppliers established as self-employed in a territory of a Party and who have concluded a bona fide contract to supply services with a final consumer in that Party, requiring their presence on a temporary basis in that Party in order to fulfil the contract to provide services.\nArticle 58\n1.   The EU and Kosovo undertake, in accordance with paragraphs 2 and 3, to take the necessary steps to allow progressively the supply of services by EU companies, Kosovo companies or by EU nationals or citizens of Kosovo which are established in the territory of a Party other than that of the person for whom the services are intended.\n2.   In step with the liberalisation process referred to in paragraph 1, the Parties shall permit the temporary movement of natural persons providing the service or who are employed by the service provider as key personnel as defined in Article 55, including natural persons who are representatives of an EU or Kosovo company or an EU national or Kosovo citizen and are seeking temporary entry for the purpose of negotiating for the sale of services or entering into agreements to sell services for that service provider, where those representatives will not be engaged in making direct sales to the general public or in supplying services themselves.\n3.   After five years from the entry into force of this Agreement, the SAC shall take the measures necessary to progressively implement paragraphs 1 and 2. Account shall be taken of the progress achieved by Kosovo in its approximation of laws with the EU acquis.\nArticle 59\n1.   The Parties shall not take any measures or actions which render the conditions for the supply of services by EU nationals or companies and Kosovo citizens or companies which have their place of permanent residence or establishment in a Party other than that of the person for whom the services are intended significantly more restrictive as compared to the situation existing on the day preceding the day of entry into force of this Agreement.\n2.   If one Party is of the view that measures introduced by the other Party since the entry into force of this Agreement result in a situation which is significantly more restrictive in respect of the supply of services as compared with the situation existing at the date of entry into force of this Agreement, such Party may request the other Party to enter into consultations.\nArticle 60\nWith regard to supply of transport services between the EU and Kosovo, the following provisions shall apply:\n(1)\nWith regard to air transport, the conditions of mutual market access shall be dealt with by the Multilateral Agreement on the Establishment of the European Common Aviation Area.\n(2)\nWith regard to land transport, the conditions of mutual market access and transit traffic in road transport shall be dealt with by the Treaty establishing the Transport Community.\n(3)\nKosovo shall adapt its legislation, including administrative, technical and other rules, to that of the EU existing at any time in the field of air and land transport insofar as it furthers liberalisation purposes and mutual access to markets of the Parties and facilitates the movement of passengers and of goods.\n(4)\nKosovo commits to abide by any international conventions relating to road safety, while paying particular attention to the agreed comprehensive network of the South East Europe Transport Observatory (SEETO).\n(5)\nThis Chapter shall not apply to maritime services.\nCHAPTER III\nTransit traffic\nArticle 61\nDefinitions\nFor the purposes of this Agreement, the following definitions shall apply:\n(1)\nEU transit traffic: the carriage, by a carrier established in the EU, of goods in transit through the territory of Kosovo en route to or from a Member State;\n(2)\nKosovo transit traffic: the carriage, by a carrier established in Kosovo, of goods in transit from Kosovo through EU territory and destined for a third country or of goods from a third country destined for Kosovo.\nArticle 62\nGeneral provisions\n1.   This chapter shall cease to apply once the Treaty establishing the Transport Community enters into force.\n2.   The Parties agree to grant unrestricted access to EU transit traffic through Kosovo and to Kosovo transit traffic through the EU with effect from the date of entry into force of this Agreement.\n3.   If, as a result of the rights granted under paragraph 2 of this Article, transit traffic by EU hauliers increases to such a degree as to cause or threaten to cause serious harm to road infrastructure and/or traffic fluidity on the axes, and under the same circumstances problems arise on EU territory close to the border/boundary of Kosovo, the matter shall be submitted to the SAC in accordance with Article 128 of this Agreement. The Parties may propose exceptional temporary, non-discriminatory measures as are necessary to limit or mitigate such harm.\n4.   The Parties shall refrain from taking any unilateral action that might lead to discrimination between carriers or vehicles from the EU and carriers or vehicles from Kosovo. The Parties shall take all steps necessary to facilitate road transport to or through the territory of the other Party.\nArticle 63\nSimplification of formalities\n1.   The Parties agree to simplify the flow of goods by rail and road, whether bilateral or in transit.\n2.   The Parties agree to take joint action, to the extent necessary, on, and to encourage, the adoption of further simplification measures.\nCHAPTER IV\nCurrent payments and movement of capital\nArticle 64\nThe Parties undertake to authorise, in freely convertible currency, in accordance with Article VIII of the Articles of Agreement of the International Monetary Fund, any payments and transfers on the current account of balance of payments between the EU and Kosovo.\nArticle 65\n1.   With regard to transactions on the capital and financial account of balance of payments, from the entry into force of this Agreement, the Parties shall ensure the free movement of capital relating to direct investments made in companies formed in accordance with the applicable legislation and investments made in accordance with Chapter I of Title V, and the liquidation or repatriation of these investments and of any profit stemming therefrom.\n2.   With regard to transactions on the capital and financial account of balance of payments, from the entry into force of this Agreement, the Parties shall ensure the free movement of capital relating to credits related to commercial transactions or to the provision of services, including financial loans and credits, in which a resident of one of the Parties is participating. This Article does not cover portfolio investment, notably the acquisition of shares on the capital market solely with the intention of making a financial investment without any intention to influence the management and control of the undertaking.\n3.   Kosovo shall, within five years from the entry into force of this Agreement, grant national treatment to EU nationals acquiring real estate on its territory.\n4.   Without prejudice to paragraph 1, the Parties shall not introduce any new restrictions on the movement of capital and current payments between residents of the EU and Kosovo and shall not make the existing arrangements more restrictive.\n5.   Without prejudice to this Article and to Article 64, where, in exceptional circumstances, movements of capital cause, or threaten to cause, serious difficulties for the operation of exchange rate policy or monetary policy in the EU or Kosovo, the EU and Kosovo, respectively, may take safeguard measures with regard to movements of capital between the EU and Kosovo for a period not exceeding six months if such measures are strictly necessary.\n6.   The Parties shall consult each other with a view to facilitating the movement of capital between the EU and Kosovo in order to promote the objectives of this Agreement.\nArticle 66\n1.   During the first year following the date of entry into force of this Agreement, Kosovo shall take measures permitting the creation of the necessary conditions for the further gradual application of EU rules on the free movement of capital.\n2.   By the end of the second year following the date of entry into force of this Agreement, the SAC shall determine the modalities for full application of EU rules on the free movement of capital in Kosovo.\nCHAPTER V\nGeneral provisions\nArticle 67\n1.   This Title shall be applied subject to limitations justified on grounds of public policy, public security or public health.\n2.   This Title shall not apply to activities that in the territory of either of the Parties are connected, even occasionally, with the exercise of official authority.\nArticle 68\n1.   For the purpose of this Title, nothing in this Agreement shall prevent the Parties from applying their laws and regulations regarding entry and stay, employment, working conditions, establishment of natural persons and supply of services, notably insofar as the granting, renewal or refusal of a residence permit is concerned, provided that, in so doing, they do not apply them in such a manner as to nullify or impair the benefits accruing to either Party under the terms of a specific provision of this Agreement and the EU acquis. This provision shall be without prejudice to the application of Article 67.\n2.   This Title shall not apply to measures affecting natural persons seeking access to the employment market of either Party, nor shall it apply to measures regarding citizenship, residence or employment on a permanent basis.\nArticle 69\nCompanies which are controlled and exclusively owned jointly by EU companies or EU nationals and by Kosovo companies or citizens of Kosovo shall also be covered by this Title.\nArticle 70\n1.   The Most-Favoured-Nation treatment granted in accordance with this Title shall not apply to the tax advantages that the Parties are providing or will provide in the future on the basis of Agreements designed to avoid double taxation or other tax arrangements.\n2.   This Title shall not be construed to prevent the adoption or enforcement by the Parties of any measure aimed at preventing the avoidance or evasion of taxes pursuant to the tax provisions of Agreements to avoid double taxation and other tax arrangements or domestic fiscal legislation.\n3.   This Title shall not be construed to prevent the Parties, when applying the relevant provisions of their fiscal legislation, from distinguishing between taxpayers who are not in identical situations, in particular as regards their place of residence.\nArticle 71\n1.   The Parties shall endeavour wherever possible to avoid the imposition of restrictive measures, including measures relating to imports, for balance of payments purposes. A Party adopting such measures shall present as soon as possible to the other Party a timetable for their removal.\n2.   Where one or more Member States or Kosovo is in serious balance of payments difficulties, or facing imminent threat thereof, the EU and Kosovo may, in accordance with the conditions established under the WTO Agreement, adopt restrictive measures, including measures relating to imports, which shall be of limited duration and shall not go beyond what is strictly necessary to remedy the balance of payments situation. The EU and Kosovo shall inform the other Party forthwith.\nArticle 72\nThis Title shall be progressively adjusted, notably in the light of requirements arising from Article V of the GATS.\nArticle 73\nThis Agreement shall be without prejudice to the application by either Party of any measure necessary to prevent the circumvention of its measures concerning third-country access to its market through this Agreement.\nTITLE VI\nAPPROXIMATION OF KOSOVO’S LAW TO THE EU ACQUIS, LAW ENFORCEMENT AND COMPETITION RULES\nArticle 74\n1.   The Parties recognise the importance of the approximation of the existing legislation in Kosovo to that of the EU and of its effective implementation. Kosovo shall endeavour to ensure that its existing law and future legislation will gradually be made compatible with the EU acquis. Kosovo shall ensure that existing law and future legislation will be properly implemented and enforced.\n2.   This approximation shall start on the date of signature of this Agreement, and shall gradually extend to all the elements of the EU acquis referred to in this Agreement by the end of the transitional period defined in Article 9.\n3.   Approximation will, at an early stage, focus on fundamental elements of the EU acquis in the field of the Internal Market, and in the field of Freedom, Security and Justice, as well as on trade-related areas. At a further stage, Kosovo shall focus on the remaining parts of the EU acquis.\nApproximation shall be carried out on the basis of a programme to be agreed between the European Commission and Kosovo.\n4.   Kosovo shall also define, in agreement with the European Commission, the modalities for the monitoring of the implementation of approximation of legislation and law enforcement actions to be taken, including efforts by Kosovo to reform its judiciary to implement its overall legal framework.\nArticle 75\nCompetition and other economic provisions\n1.   The following are incompatible with the proper functioning of this Agreement, insofar as they may affect trade between the EU and Kosovo:\n(a)\nall Agreements between undertakings, decisions by associations of undertakings and concerted practices between undertakings which have as their object or effect the prevention, restriction or distortion of competition;\n(b)\nabuse by one or more undertakings of a dominant position in the territories of the EU or of Kosovo as a whole or in a substantial part thereof;\n(c)\nany state aid which distorts or threatens to distort competition by favouring certain undertakings or certain products.\n2.   Any practices contrary to this Article shall be assessed on the basis of criteria arising from the application of the competition rules applicable in the EU, in particular from Articles 101, 102, 106 and 107 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union and interpretative instruments adopted by the EU institutions.\n3.   The Parties shall ensure that an operationally independent authority is entrusted with the powers necessary for the full application of paragraph 1(a) and (b) of this Article, regarding private and public undertakings and undertakings to which special rights have been granted.\n4.   Kosovo shall ensure that an operationally independent authority is entrusted with the powers necessary for the full application of paragraph 1(c). This authority shall have, inter alia, the powers to authorise state aid schemes and individual aid grants in conformity with paragraph 2, as well as the powers to order the recovery of state aid that has been unlawfully granted.\n5.   The EU on one side and Kosovo on the other side shall ensure transparency in the area of state aid, inter alia, by providing to the other Party a regular annual report, or equivalent, following the methodology and the presentation of the EU survey on state aid. Upon request by one Party, the other Party shall provide information on particular individual cases of state aid.\n6.   Kosovo shall establish a comprehensive inventory of aid schemes instituted and shall align such aid schemes with the criteria referred to in paragraph 2 within a period of no more than three years from the entry into force of this Agreement.\n7.\n(a)\nFor the purposes of applying paragraph 1(c), the Parties recognise that during the first five years after the entry into force of this Agreement, any state aid granted by Kosovo shall be assessed taking into account the fact that Kosovo shall be regarded as an area identical to those areas of the EU described in Article 107(3)(a) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.\n(b)\nWithin four years from the entry into force of this Agreement, Kosovo shall submit to the European Commission its GDP per capita figures harmonised at NUTS II level. The authority referred to in paragraph 4 and the European Commission shall then jointly evaluate the eligibility of the regions of Kosovo as well as the maximum aid intensities in relation thereto in order to draw up the regional aid map on the basis of the relevant EU guidelines.\n8.

The complaining Party shall state in its request the subject-matter of the dispute and, as the case may be, the measure adopted by the other Party, or the failure to act, which it considers to be in breach of the provisions referred to in Article 2.\nArticle 4\nComposition of the arbitration panel\n1.   An arbitration panel shall be composed of three arbitrators.\n2.   Within 10 days of the date of the submission of the request for the establishment of an arbitration panel to the Stabilisation and Association Committee, the Parties shall consult in order to reach an agreement on the composition of the arbitration panel.\n3.   In the event that the Parties are unable to agree on the composition of the arbitration panel within the time frame referred to in paragraph 2, either Party may request the chairperson of the Stabilisation and Association Committee, or his delegate, to select all three members by lot from the list established under Article 15, one among the individuals proposed by the complaining Party, one among the individuals proposed by the Party complained against and one among the arbitrators selected by the Parties to act as chairperson.\nIn case the Parties agree on one or more of the members of the arbitration panel, any remaining members shall be appointed in accordance with the same procedure.\n4.   The selection of the arbitrators by the chairperson of the Stabilisation and Association Committee, or his delegate, shall be done in the presence of a representative of each Party.\n5.   The date of establishment of the arbitration panel shall be the date on which the chairperson of the panel is informed of the appointment in common agreement between the Parties of the three arbitrators or, as the case may be, the date of their selection in accordance with paragraph 3.\n6.   Where a Party considers that an arbitrator does not comply with the requirements of the Code of Conduct referred to in Article 18, the Parties shall consult and, if they so agree, replace the arbitrator and select a replacement pursuant to paragraph 7. Where the Parties fail to agree on the need to replace an arbitrator, the matter shall be referred to the chairperson of the arbitration panel, whose decision will be final.\nWhere a Party considers that the chairperson of the arbitration panel does not comply with the Code of Conduct referred to in Article 18, the matter shall be referred to one of the remaining members of the pool of arbitrators selected to act as chairperson, his name being drawn by lot by the chairperson of the Stabilisation and Association Committee, or his delegate, in the presence of a representative of each Party, unless otherwise agreed between the Parties.\n7.   If an arbitrator is unable to participate in the proceeding, withdraws or is replaced pursuant to paragraph 6, a replacement shall be selected within five days in accordance with the selection procedures followed to select the original arbitrator.

Under no circumstances should the ruling be issued later than 120 days from the date of the establishment of the panel.\n2.   In cases of urgency, including those involving perishable goods, the arbitration panel shall make every effort to issue its ruling within 45 days from the date of the establishment of the panel. Under no circumstance should it take longer than 100 days from the date of the establishment of the panel. The arbitration panel may give a preliminary ruling within 10 days of its establishment on whether it deems the case to be urgent.\n3.   The ruling shall set out the findings of fact, the applicability of the relevant provisions of this Agreement and the basic rationale behind any findings and conclusions that it makes. The ruling may contain recommendations on the measures to be adopted for compliance with it.\n4.   The complaining Party may withdraw its complaint by written notification to the chairperson of the arbitration panel, the Party complained against and the Stabilisation and Association Committee, at any time before the ruling is notified to the Parties and the Stabilisation and Association Committee. Such withdrawal is without prejudice to the complaining Party’s right to introduce a new complaint regarding the same measure at a later point in time.\n5.   The arbitration panel shall, at the request of both Parties, suspend its work at any time for a period not exceeding 12 months. Once the period of 12 months has been exceeded, the authority for the establishment of the panel will lapse, without prejudice to the right of the complaining Party to request at a later stage the establishment of a panel on the same measure.\nSection II\nCompliance\nArticle 6\nCompliance with the arbitration panel ruling\nEach Party shall take any measure necessary to comply with the arbitration panel ruling, and the Parties will endeavour to agree on the reasonable period of time to comply with the ruling.\nArticle 7\nReasonable period of time for compliance\n1.   No later than 30 days after the notification of the arbitration panel ruling to the Parties, the Party complained against shall notify the complaining Party of the time it will require for compliance (hereinafter referred to as ‘reasonable period of time’). Both parties shall endeavour to agree on the reasonable period of time.\n2.   If there is disagreement between the Parties on the reasonable period of time to comply with the arbitration panel ruling, the complaining Party may request the Stabilisation and Association Committee, within 20 days of the notification made under paragraph 1, to reconvene the original arbitration panel to determine the length of the reasonable period of time. The arbitration panel shall notify its ruling within 20 days from the date of the submission of the request.\n3.   In the event of the original panel, or some of its members, being unable to reconvene, the procedures set out in Article 4 shall apply. The time-limit for notifying the ruling remains 20 days from the date of the panel’s establishment.\nArticle 8\nReview of any measure taken to comply with the arbitration panel ruling\n1.   The Party complained against shall notify the other Party and the Stabilisation and Association Committee before the end of the reasonable period of time of any measure that it has taken to comply with the arbitration panel ruling.\n2.   In the event that there is disagreement between the Parties concerning the compatibility of any measure notified under paragraph 1 of this Article, with the provisions referred to in Article 2, the complaining Party may request the original arbitration panel to rule on the matter. Such request shall explain why the measure is not in conformity with this Agreement. Once re-convened, the arbitration panel shall issue its ruling within 45 days of the date of its re-establishment.\n3.   In the event of the original arbitration panel, or some of its members, being unable to reconvene, the procedures laid down in Article 4 shall apply. The time-limit for notifying the ruling remains 45 days from the date of the panel’s establishment.\nArticle 9\nTemporary remedies in case of non-compliance\n1.   If the Party complained against fails to notify any measure taken to comply with the arbitration panel ruling before the expiry of the reasonable period of time, or if the arbitration panel rules that the measure notified under Article 8(1) is not in conformity with that Party’s obligations under this Agreement, the Party complained against shall, if so requested by the complaining Party, present an offer for temporary compensation.\n2.   If no agreement on compensation is reached within 30 days of the end of the reasonable period of time, or of the arbitration panel ruling under Article 8 that a measure taken to comply is not in conformity with this Agreement, the complaining Party shall be entitled, upon notification to the other Party and to the Stabilisation and Association Committee, to suspend the application of benefits granted under the provisions referred to in Article 2 of this Protocol at a level equivalent to the adverse economic impact caused by the violation. The complaining Party may implement the suspension 10 days after the date of the notification, unless the Party complained against has requested arbitration under paragraph 3.\n3.   If the Party complained against considers that the level of suspension is not equivalent to the adverse economic impact caused by the violation, it may request, in writing and before the expiry of the ten-day period referred to in paragraph 2, that the chairperson of the original arbitration panel reconvene the original arbitration panel. The arbitration panel shall notify its ruling on the level of the suspension of benefits to the Parties and to the Stabilisation and Association Committee within 30 days of the date of the submission of the request. Benefits shall not be suspended until the arbitration panel has issued its ruling, and any suspension shall be consistent with the ruling of the arbitration panel.\n4.   The suspension of benefits shall be temporary and shall be applied only until any measure found to violate this Agreement has been withdrawn or amended so as to bring it into conformity with this Agreement, or until the Parties have agreed to settle the dispute.\nArticle 10\nReview of any measure taken to comply after the suspension of benefits\n1.   The Party complained against shall notify the other Party and the Stabilisation and Association Committee of any measure it has taken to comply with the ruling of the arbitration panel and of its request for an end to the suspension of benefits applied by the complaining Party.\n2.   If the Parties do not reach an agreement on the compatibility of the notified measure with this Agreement within 30 days of the date of the submission of the notification, the complaining Party may request, in writing, that the chairperson of the original arbitration panel rule on the matter. Such request shall be notified simultaneously to the other Party and to the Stabilisation and Association Committee. The arbitration panel ruling shall be notified within 45 days of the date of the submission of the request. If the arbitration panel rules that any measure taken to comply is not in conformity with this Agreement, the arbitration panel will determine whether the complaining party can continue the suspension of benefits at the original or at a different level. If the arbitration panel rules that any measure taken to comply is in conformity with this Agreement, the suspension of benefits shall be terminated.\n3.   In the event of the original arbitration panel, or some of its members, being unable to reconvene, the procedures laid down in Article 4 shall apply. The period for notifying the ruling remains 45 days from the date of the panel’s establishment.\nSection III\nCommon provisions\nArticle 11\nOpen Hearings\nThe meetings of the arbitration panel shall be open to the public under the conditions laid down in the Rules of Procedure referred to in Article 18, unless the arbitration panel decides otherwise on its own initiative or at the request of the Parties.\nArticle 12\nInformation and technical advice\nAt the request of a Party, or upon its own initiative, the panel may seek information from any source it deems appropriate for the panel proceeding. The panel shall also have the right to seek the opinion of experts as it deems appropriate. Any information obtained in this manner shall be disclosed to both Parties and shall be open for comments by both of them.\nInterested parties shall be authorised to submit amicus curiae briefs to the arbitration panel under the conditions laid down in the Rules of Procedure referred to in Article 18.\nArticle 13\nInterpretation principles\nThe arbitration panel shall apply and interpret this Agreement in accordance with customary rules of interpretation of public international law, including the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties. The arbitration panel shall not provide any interpretation of the EU acquis. The fact that a provision is identical in substance to a provision of the Treaty on European Union and the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union shall not be decisive in the interpretation of that provision.\nArticle 14\nArbitration panel decisions and rulings\n1.   All decisions of the arbitration panel, including the adoption of the ruling, shall be taken by majority vote.\n2.   All rulings of the arbitration panel shall be binding on the Parties. They shall be notified to the Parties and to the Stabilisation and Association Committee, which shall make them publicly available unless it decides by consensus not to do so.\nCHAPTER III\nGeneral provisions\nArticle 15\nList of arbitrators\n1.

However, where a Party has, with regard to a particular measure, instituted a dispute settlement proceeding, either under Article 3(1) of this Protocol or under the WTO Agreement, it may not institute a dispute settlement proceeding regarding the same measure in the other forum until the first proceeding has ended. For the purposes of this paragraph, dispute settlement proceedings under the WTO Agreement are deemed to be initiated by a Party’s request for the establishment of a panel under Article 6 of the Understanding on Rules and Procedures Governing the Settlement of Disputes of the WTO;\n(c)\nThis Protocol shall not preclude a Party from implementing the suspension of obligations authorised by a WTO Dispute Settlement Body.\nArticle 17\nTime-limits\n1.   All time-limits laid down in this Protocol shall be counted in calendar days from the day following the act or fact to which they refer.\n2.
