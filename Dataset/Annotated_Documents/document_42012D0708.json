Unless immediate action is essential to prevent further non-compliance with points (c) or (d) of paragraph 1 of this Article, the rights established by this Article shall be exercised only after consultation with the competent authorities of the other Party.3. Neither Party shall use its rights established by the present Article to refuse, revoke, suspend or limit authorisations or permissions of any air carriers of a Party on the grounds that majority ownership and/or effective control of that air carrier is vested in one or more Party to the ECAA or their nationals, provided that such Party or Parties to the ECAA offer reciprocal treatment.Article 6InvestmentNotwithstanding Article 3 (Authorisation) and Article 5 (Refusal, revocation, suspension, limitation of authorisation) of this Agreement, the majority ownership or the effective control of an air carrier of Georgia by Member States or their nationals, or of an air carrier of the European Union by Georgia or its nationals, shall be permitted by virtue of a prior decision of the Joint Committee established by this Agreement in accordance with Article 22(2) (Joint Committee) of this Agreement.This decision shall specify the conditions associated with the operation of the agreed services under this Agreement and with the services between third countries and the Parties.

The Parties acknowledge that it is their joint objective to have a fair and competitive environment for the operation of air services. The Parties recognise that fair competitive practices by air carriers are most likely to occur where these air carriers operate on a fully commercial basis and are not subsidised.2. Within the scope of this Agreement, and without prejudice to any special provisions contained therein, any discrimination on grounds of nationality shall be prohibited.3. State aid which distorts or threatens to distort competition by favouring certain undertakings or certain aviation products or services is incompatible with the proper functioning of this Agreement, in so far as it may affect trade between the Parties in the aviation sector.4. Any practices contrary to this Article shall be assessed on the basis of criteria arising from the application of the competition rules applicable in the European Union, in particular from Article 107 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union and interpretative instruments adopted by the European Union institutions.5. If one Party finds that conditions exist in the territory of the other Party, in particular due to a subsidy, which would adversely affect the fair and equal opportunity of its air carriers to compete, it may submit observations to the other Party. Furthermore, it may request a meeting of the Joint Committee, as provided for in Article 22 (Joint Committee) of this Agreement. From the receipt of such a request consultations shall start within 30 days. Failure to reach a satisfactory agreement within 30 days from the start of consultations shall constitute grounds for the Party that requested the consultations to take action to refuse, withhold, revoke, suspend or impose appropriate conditions on the authorisations of the air carrier(s) concerned, consistent with Article 5 (Refusal, revocation, suspension or limitation of authorisation) of this Agreement.6. The actions, referred to in paragraph 5 of this Article, shall be appropriate, proportionate and restricted with regard to scope and duration to what is strictly necessary. They shall be exclusively directed towards the air carrier or air carriers benefiting from a subsidy or the conditions referred to in this Article, and shall be without prejudice to the right of either Party to take action under Article 24 (Safeguard measures) of this Agreement.7. Each Party, upon notification to the other Party, may approach responsible government entities in the territory of the other Party including entities at the state, provincial or local level to discuss matters relating to this Article.8. The provisions of this Article shall apply without prejudice to the Parties’ laws and regulations regarding public service obligations in the territories of the Parties.Article 9Commercial opportunitiesAir carrier representatives1. The air carriers of each Party shall have the right to establish offices in the territory of the other Party for the promotion and sale of air transport and related activities.2.

(a) Without prejudice to point (b) below, each air carrier shall have in relation to ground handling in the territory of the other Party:(i) the right to perform its own ground handling (\"self-handling\"); or, at its option(ii) the right to select among competing suppliers that provide ground handling services in whole or in part where such suppliers are allowed market access on the basis of the laws and regulations of each Party, and where such suppliers are present in the market.(b) For the following categories of ground handling services, i.e. baggage handling, ramp handling, fuel and oil handling, freight and mail handling as regards the physical handling of freight and mail between the air terminal and the aircraft, the rights under point (a)(i) and (ii) shall be subject only to physical or operational constraints according to the laws and regulations applicable in the territory of the other Party. Where such constraints preclude self-handling and where there is no effective competition between suppliers that provide ground handling services, all such services shall be available on both an equal and non discriminatory basis to all air carriers; prices of such services shall not exceed their full cost including a reasonable return on assets, after depreciation.Sales, local expenses, and transfer of funds4. Any air carrier of each Party may engage in the sale of air transport in the territory of the other Party directly and/or, at the air carrier’s discretion, through its sales agents, other intermediaries appointed by the air carrier or through internet.

(a) In relation to the transport of passengers, surface transportation providers shall not be subject to laws and regulations governing air transport on the sole basis that such surface transportation is held out by an air carrier under its own name. Surface transportation providers have the discretion to decide whether to enter into cooperative arrangements. In deciding on any particular arrangement, surface transportation providers may consider, among other things, consumer interests and technical, economic, space, and capacity constraints.(b) Moreover, and notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, air carriers and indirect providers of cargo transportation of the Parties shall be permitted, without restriction, to employ in connection with air transport any surface transportation for cargo to or from any points in the territories of Georgia and the European Union, or in third countries, including transport to and from all airports with customs facilities, and including, where applicable, the right[s] to transport cargo in bond under applicable laws and regulations. Such cargo, whether moving by surface or by air, shall have access to airport customs processing and facilities. Air carriers may elect to perform their own surface transportation or to provide it through arrangements with other surface carriers, including surface transportation operated by other air carriers and indirect providers of cargo air transport.

Each Party shall ensure that user charges that may be imposed by its competent charging authorities or bodies on the air carriers of the other Party for the use of air navigation and air traffic control, airport, aviation security and related facilities and services shall be just, reasonable, not unjustly discriminatory, and equitably apportioned among categories of users. These charges may reflect, but shall not exceed, the full cost to the competent charging authorities or bodies of providing the appropriate airport and aviation security facilities and services at that airport or within that airport’s system. These charges may include a reasonable return on assets, after depreciation. Facilities and services for which user charges are made shall be provided on an efficient and economic basis. In any event, these charges shall be assessed on the air carriers of the other Party on terms not less favourable than the most favourable terms available to any other air carrier at the time the charges are assessed.2.

The competent authorities of a Party may request consultations at any time concerning the safety standards maintained by the other Party.5. The competent authorities of a Party shall take all appropriate and immediate measures whenever they ascertain that an aircraft, a product or an operation may:(a) fail to satisfy the minimum standards established pursuant to the Convention or the legislation specified in Part C of Annex III to this Agreement, whichever is applicable;(b) give rise to serious concerns — established through an inspection referred to in paragraph 3 of this Article — that an aircraft or the operation of an aircraft does not comply with the minimum standards established pursuant to the Convention or the legislation specified in Part C of Annex III to this Agreement, whichever is applicable; or(c) give rise to serious concerns that there is a lack of effective maintenance and administration of minimum standards established pursuant to the Convention or the legislation specified in Part C of Annex III to this Agreement, whichever is applicable.6. Where the competent authorities of one Party take action under paragraph 5, they shall promptly inform the competent authorities of the other Party of taking such action, providing reasons for their action.7. Where measures taken in application of paragraph 5 of this Article are not discontinued even though the basis for taking them has ceased to exist, either Party may refer the matter to the Joint Committee.Article 15Aviation security1.

Georgia may be subjected to a European Commission inspection in accordance with the relevant European Union security legislation as referred to in Annex III to this Agreement. The Parties shall establish the necessary mechanism for the exchange of information on the results of such security inspections.3. The assurance of safety for civil aircraft, their passengers and crew being a fundamental precondition for the operation of international air services, the Parties reaffirm their obligations to each other to provide for the security of civil aviation against acts of unlawful interference, and in particular their obligations under the Convention, the Convention on Offences and Certain Other Acts Committed on Board Aircraft, signed at Tokyo on 14 September 1963, the Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Seizure of Aircraft, signed at The Hague on 16 December 1970, the Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts against the Safety of Civil Aviation, signed at Montreal on 23 September 1971, the Protocol for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts of Violence at Airports Serving International Civil Aviation, signed at Montreal on 24 February 1988 and the Convention on the marking of plastic explosives for purpose of detection signed at Montreal on 1 March 1991, in so far as both Parties are parties to these conventions, as well as all other conventions and protocols relating to civil aviation security of which both Parties are parties.4. The Parties shall provide upon request all necessary assistance to each other to prevent acts of unlawful seizure of civil aircraft and other unlawful acts against the safety of such aircraft, their passengers and crew, airports and air navigation facilities, and any other threat to the security of civil aviation.5. The Parties shall, in their mutual relations, act in conformity with the aviation security standards and, so far as they are applied by them, the recommended practices established by the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) and designated as Annexes to the Convention, to the extent that such security provisions are applicable to the Parties. Both Parties shall require that operators of aircraft of their registry, operators who have their principal place of business or permanent residence in their territory, and the operators of airports in their territory, act in conformity with such aviation security provisions.6. Each Party shall ensure that effective measures are taken within its territory to protect aircraft, to screen passengers and their carry-on items, and to carry out appropriate checks on crew, cargo (including hold baggage) and aircraft stores prior to and during boarding or loading and that those measures are adjusted to meet increases in the threat. Each Party agrees that their air carriers may be required to observe the aviation security provisions referred to in paragraph 5 of this Article required by the other Party, for entrance into, departure from, or while within, the territory of that other Party.7. Each Party shall also give positive consideration to any request from the other Party for reasonable special security measures to meet a particular threat. Except where not reasonably possible in case of emergency, each Party will inform the other Party in advance of any special security measures it intends to introduce which could have a significant financial or operational impact on the air transport services provided under this Agreement. Either Party may request a meeting of the Joint Committee to discuss such security measures, as provided for in Article 22 (Joint Committee) of this Agreement.8. When an incident or threat of an incident of unlawful seizure of civil aircraft or other unlawful acts against the safety of such aircraft, their passengers and crew, airports or air navigation facilities occurs, the Parties shall assist each other by facilitating communications and other appropriate measures intended to terminate rapidly and safely such incident or threat thereof.9. Each Party shall take all measures it finds practicable to ensure that an aircraft subjected to an act of unlawful seizure or other acts of unlawful interference which is on the ground in its territory is detained on the ground unless its departure is necessitated by the overriding duty to protect human life. Wherever practicable, such measures shall be taken on the basis of mutual consultations.10. When a Party has reasonable grounds to believe that the other Party has departed from the aviation security provisions of this Article, that Party shall request immediate consultations with the other Party.11. Without prejudice to Article 5 (Refusal, revocation, suspension, limitation of authorisations) of this Agreement, failure to reach a satisfactory agreement within fifteen (15) days from the date of such request shall constitute grounds to withhold, revoke, limit or impose conditions on the operating authorisation of one or more air carriers of such other Party.12. When required by an immediate and extraordinary threat, a Party may take interim action prior to the expiry of fifteen (15) days.13. Any action taken in accordance with the paragraph 11 of this Article shall be discontinued upon compliance by the other Party with the full provisions of this Article.Article 16Air traffic management1.

Unless immediate action is essential to prevent further non-compliance with points (c) or (d) of paragraph 1 of this Article, the rights established by this Article shall be exercised only after consultation with the competent authorities of the other Party.3. Neither Party shall use its rights established by the present Article to refuse, revoke, suspend or limit authorisations or permissions of any air carriers of a Party on the grounds that majority ownership and/or effective control of that air carrier is vested in one or more Party to the ECAA or their nationals, provided that such Party or Parties to the ECAA offer reciprocal treatment.Article 6InvestmentNotwithstanding Article 3 (Authorisation) and Article 5 (Refusal, revocation, suspension, limitation of authorisation) of this Agreement, the majority ownership or the effective control of an air carrier of Georgia by Member States or their nationals, or of an air carrier of the European Union by Georgia or its nationals, shall be permitted by virtue of a prior decision of the Joint Committee established by this Agreement in accordance with Article 22(2) (Joint Committee) of this Agreement.This decision shall specify the conditions associated with the operation of the agreed services under this Agreement and with the services between third countries and the Parties.

The Parties acknowledge that it is their joint objective to have a fair and competitive environment for the operation of air services. The Parties recognise that fair competitive practices by air carriers are most likely to occur where these air carriers operate on a fully commercial basis and are not subsidised.2. Within the scope of this Agreement, and without prejudice to any special provisions contained therein, any discrimination on grounds of nationality shall be prohibited.3. State aid which distorts or threatens to distort competition by favouring certain undertakings or certain aviation products or services is incompatible with the proper functioning of this Agreement, in so far as it may affect trade between the Parties in the aviation sector.4. Any practices contrary to this Article shall be assessed on the basis of criteria arising from the application of the competition rules applicable in the European Union, in particular from Article 107 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union and interpretative instruments adopted by the European Union institutions.5. If one Party finds that conditions exist in the territory of the other Party, in particular due to a subsidy, which would adversely affect the fair and equal opportunity of its air carriers to compete, it may submit observations to the other Party. Furthermore, it may request a meeting of the Joint Committee, as provided for in Article 22 (Joint Committee) of this Agreement. From the receipt of such a request consultations shall start within 30 days. Failure to reach a satisfactory agreement within 30 days from the start of consultations shall constitute grounds for the Party that requested the consultations to take action to refuse, withhold, revoke, suspend or impose appropriate conditions on the authorisations of the air carrier(s) concerned, consistent with Article 5 (Refusal, revocation, suspension or limitation of authorisation) of this Agreement.6. The actions, referred to in paragraph 5 of this Article, shall be appropriate, proportionate and restricted with regard to scope and duration to what is strictly necessary. They shall be exclusively directed towards the air carrier or air carriers benefiting from a subsidy or the conditions referred to in this Article, and shall be without prejudice to the right of either Party to take action under Article 24 (Safeguard measures) of this Agreement.7. Each Party, upon notification to the other Party, may approach responsible government entities in the territory of the other Party including entities at the state, provincial or local level to discuss matters relating to this Article.8. The provisions of this Article shall apply without prejudice to the Parties’ laws and regulations regarding public service obligations in the territories of the Parties.Article 9Commercial opportunitiesAir carrier representatives1. The air carriers of each Party shall have the right to establish offices in the territory of the other Party for the promotion and sale of air transport and related activities.2.

(a) Without prejudice to point (b) below, each air carrier shall have in relation to ground handling in the territory of the other Party:(i) the right to perform its own ground handling (\"self-handling\"); or, at its option(ii) the right to select among competing suppliers that provide ground handling services in whole or in part where such suppliers are allowed market access on the basis of the laws and regulations of each Party, and where such suppliers are present in the market.(b) For the following categories of ground handling services, i.e. baggage handling, ramp handling, fuel and oil handling, freight and mail handling as regards the physical handling of freight and mail between the air terminal and the aircraft, the rights under point (a)(i) and (ii) shall be subject only to physical or operational constraints according to the laws and regulations applicable in the territory of the other Party. Where such constraints preclude self-handling and where there is no effective competition between suppliers that provide ground handling services, all such services shall be available on both an equal and non discriminatory basis to all air carriers; prices of such services shall not exceed their full cost including a reasonable return on assets, after depreciation.Sales, local expenses, and transfer of funds4. Any air carrier of each Party may engage in the sale of air transport in the territory of the other Party directly and/or, at the air carrier’s discretion, through its sales agents, other intermediaries appointed by the air carrier or through internet.

(a) In relation to the transport of passengers, surface transportation providers shall not be subject to laws and regulations governing air transport on the sole basis that such surface transportation is held out by an air carrier under its own name. Surface transportation providers have the discretion to decide whether to enter into cooperative arrangements. In deciding on any particular arrangement, surface transportation providers may consider, among other things, consumer interests and technical, economic, space, and capacity constraints.(b) Moreover, and notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, air carriers and indirect providers of cargo transportation of the Parties shall be permitted, without restriction, to employ in connection with air transport any surface transportation for cargo to or from any points in the territories of Georgia and the European Union, or in third countries, including transport to and from all airports with customs facilities, and including, where applicable, the right[s] to transport cargo in bond under applicable laws and regulations. Such cargo, whether moving by surface or by air, shall have access to airport customs processing and facilities. Air carriers may elect to perform their own surface transportation or to provide it through arrangements with other surface carriers, including surface transportation operated by other air carriers and indirect providers of cargo air transport.

The competent authorities of a Party may request consultations at any time concerning the safety standards maintained by the other Party.5. The competent authorities of a Party shall take all appropriate and immediate measures whenever they ascertain that an aircraft, a product or an operation may:(a) fail to satisfy the minimum standards established pursuant to the Convention or the legislation specified in Part C of Annex III to this Agreement, whichever is applicable;(b) give rise to serious concerns — established through an inspection referred to in paragraph 3 of this Article — that an aircraft or the operation of an aircraft does not comply with the minimum standards established pursuant to the Convention or the legislation specified in Part C of Annex III to this Agreement, whichever is applicable; or(c) give rise to serious concerns that there is a lack of effective maintenance and administration of minimum standards established pursuant to the Convention or the legislation specified in Part C of Annex III to this Agreement, whichever is applicable.6. Where the competent authorities of one Party take action under paragraph 5, they shall promptly inform the competent authorities of the other Party of taking such action, providing reasons for their action.7. Where measures taken in application of paragraph 5 of this Article are not discontinued even though the basis for taking them has ceased to exist, either Party may refer the matter to the Joint Committee.Article 15Aviation security1. Subject to the transitional provisions set out in Annex II to this Agreement, the Parties shall act in conformity with the provisions of the European Union’s aviation security legislation specified in Part D of Annex III to this Agreement, under the conditions set out hereafter.2. Georgia may be subjected to a European Commission inspection in accordance with the relevant European Union security legislation as referred to in Annex III to this Agreement. The Parties shall establish the necessary mechanism for the exchange of information on the results of such security inspections.3. The assurance of safety for civil aircraft, their passengers and crew being a fundamental precondition for the operation of international air services, the Parties reaffirm their obligations to each other to provide for the security of civil aviation against acts of unlawful interference, and in particular their obligations under the Convention, the Convention on Offences and Certain Other Acts Committed on Board Aircraft, signed at Tokyo on 14 September 1963, the Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Seizure of Aircraft, signed at The Hague on 16 December 1970, the Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts against the Safety of Civil Aviation, signed at Montreal on 23 September 1971, the Protocol for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts of Violence at Airports Serving International Civil Aviation, signed at Montreal on 24 February 1988 and the Convention on the marking of plastic explosives for purpose of detection signed at Montreal on 1 March 1991, in so far as both Parties are parties to these conventions, as well as all other conventions and protocols relating to civil aviation security of which both Parties are parties.4. The Parties shall provide upon request all necessary assistance to each other to prevent acts of unlawful seizure of civil aircraft and other unlawful acts against the safety of such aircraft, their passengers and crew, airports and air navigation facilities, and any other threat to the security of civil aviation.5. The Parties shall, in their mutual relations, act in conformity with the aviation security standards and, so far as they are applied by them, the recommended practices established by the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) and designated as Annexes to the Convention, to the extent that such security provisions are applicable to the Parties. Both Parties shall require that operators of aircraft of their registry, operators who have their principal place of business or permanent residence in their territory, and the operators of airports in their territory, act in conformity with such aviation security provisions.6. Each Party shall ensure that effective measures are taken within its territory to protect aircraft, to screen passengers and their carry-on items, and to carry out appropriate checks on crew, cargo (including hold baggage) and aircraft stores prior to and during boarding or loading and that those measures are adjusted to meet increases in the threat. Each Party agrees that their air carriers may be required to observe the aviation security provisions referred to in paragraph 5 of this Article required by the other Party, for entrance into, departure from, or while within, the territory of that other Party.7. Each Party shall also give positive consideration to any request from the other Party for reasonable special security measures to meet a particular threat. Except where not reasonably possible in case of emergency, each Party will inform the other Party in advance of any special security measures it intends to introduce which could have a significant financial or operational impact on the air transport services provided under this Agreement. Either Party may request a meeting of the Joint Committee to discuss such security measures, as provided for in Article 22 (Joint Committee) of this Agreement.8. When an incident or threat of an incident of unlawful seizure of civil aircraft or other unlawful acts against the safety of such aircraft, their passengers and crew, airports or air navigation facilities occurs, the Parties shall assist each other by facilitating communications and other appropriate measures intended to terminate rapidly and safely such incident or threat thereof.9. Each Party shall take all measures it finds practicable to ensure that an aircraft subjected to an act of unlawful seizure or other acts of unlawful interference which is on the ground in its territory is detained on the ground unless its departure is necessitated by the overriding duty to protect human life. Wherever practicable, such measures shall be taken on the basis of mutual consultations.10. When a Party has reasonable grounds to believe that the other Party has departed from the aviation security provisions of this Article, that Party shall request immediate consultations with the other Party.11. Without prejudice to Article 5 (Refusal, revocation, suspension, limitation of authorisations) of this Agreement, failure to reach a satisfactory agreement within fifteen (15) days from the date of such request shall constitute grounds to withhold, revoke, limit or impose conditions on the operating authorisation of one or more air carriers of such other Party.12. When required by an immediate and extraordinary threat, a Party may take interim action prior to the expiry of fifteen (15) days.13. Any action taken in accordance with the paragraph 11 of this Article shall be discontinued upon compliance by the other Party with the full provisions of this Article.Article 16Air traffic management1.
