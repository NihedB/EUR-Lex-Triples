This ensures that policy approaches are coordinated and, where appropriate, that there are harmonised conditions for the availability and efficient use of the radio spectrum necessary for the establishment and functioning of the internal market in Union policy areas such as electronic communications, transport and research and development.\n(2)\nDecision No 676/2002/EC provides that the Commission may organise consultations in order to take into account the views of Member States, Union institutions, and industry, as well as of all radio spectrum users involved (commercial and non-commercial), and other parties with an interest in technological, market and regulatory developments that may relate to the use of radio spectrum.\n(3)\nAn advisory group called the Radio Spectrum Policy Group (‘the Group’) has been established by Commission Decision 2002/622/EC (2) in order to assist and advise the Commission on radio spectrum policy issues. Those include radio spectrum availability, harmonisation and allocation of radio spectrum, provision of information concerning allocation, availability and use of radio spectrum, methods for granting rights to use spectrum, refarming, relocation, valuation and efficient use of radio spectrum and the protection of human health.\n(4)\nIn December 2018, the European Parliament and Council adopted Directive (EU) 2018/1972 (3), which recast and revised the Union's regulatory framework for electronic communications, including conferring new tasks on the Group.\n(5)\nThe Group should further contribute to the development of a radio spectrum policy in the Union that takes into account not only technical parameters but also economic, political, cultural, strategic, health and social considerations, as well as the various potentially conflicting needs of radio spectrum users with a view to ensuring that a fair, non-discriminatory and proportionate balance is achieved.\n(6)\nThe Group should include high-level governmental experts from the Member States. The Group might also include observers and invite other persons to attend meetings as appropriate, including regulators, competition authorities, market participants, and user or consumer groups.\n(7)\nAs the focal point for addressing radio spectrum policy issues in the context of all relevant Union policies, close operational links should be maintained between the Group and specific groups or committees set up for the purpose of implementing sectoral Union policies including transport policy, internal market policy for radio equipment, audiovisual policy, space policy, and communications.\n(8)\nWhile different national government bodies have responsibility over different parts of the radio spectrum, in order to ensure that discussions are effective, each national delegation that attends a meeting of the Group should have a consolidated and coordinated national view of all policies which affect the use of radio spectrum in that Member State in relation not only to the internal market but also to public order, public security, civil protection and defence policies as the use of radio spectrum for such policies may influence the organisation of radio spectrum as a whole.\n(9)\nThe Group should consult the relevant radio spectrum users, both for commercial use and non-commercial use, as well as any other interested parties on technological, market and regulatory developments relating to the use of radio spectrum. The Group should ensure that those consultations are extensive and carried out in a forward-looking manner.\n(10)\nAs the use of radio spectrum does not stop at borders, the Group should be opened to participation of observers from acceding countries and from European Economic Area countries.\n(11)\nThe European Conference of Postal and Telecommunications administrations (CEPT) should be invited as an observer of the Group's work considering that the activities of the Group have a significant impact on radio spectrum at pan-European level and that CEPT and its affiliate bodies have extensive technical expertise in radio spectrum management. Drawing on CEPT's expertise is also appropriate based on mandates granted thereto pursuant to the Radio Spectrum Decision in order to develop technical implementing measures in the areas of radio spectrum allocation and information availability. In view of the importance of European standardisation for the development of equipment using radio spectrum, it is likewise important to associate as observer the European Telecommunications Standardisation Institute (ETSI).\n(12)\nFollowing the entry into force of Directive (EU) 2018/1972 and of Regulation (EU) 2018/1971 of the European Parliament and of the Council (4), the tasks of the Group should be adapted to that new regulatory framework and the role of the Group should be strengthened accordingly. This should facilitate the shaping of Union spectrum policy in various areas of the European electronic communications market, in particular wireless broadband, further improve the strategic orientation and transparency of spectrum policy and support the strategic planning and coordination of radio spectrum policy approaches at the Union level.\n(13)\nIn line with the new tasks conferred on the Group by Directive (EU) 2018/1972, the Group should provide advice to the European Parliament and to the Council upon their request on matters of radio spectrum. Furthermore, this decision should provide the basis for the Group to become the forum for the coordination of implementation by Member States of their obligations related to radio spectrum under that Directive, including through a peer review process, and to play a central role in fields essential for the internal market such as cross-border radio spectrum coordination and standardisation.\n(14)\nConsidering the number of amendments that are necessary as a result of the entry into force of Directive (EU) 2018/1972, for the sake of clarity, Decision 2002/622/EC should be repealed and replaced.\n(15)\nRules on disclosure of information by members of the group should also be laid down in line with Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council (5) and personal data should be processed in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 of the European Parliament and of the Council (6).\n(16)\nThis Decision should be in line with the horizontal rules defined by the Commission on the creation and operation of Commission expert groups (7) in particular regarding membership of the group, observers, participation of invited experts and meeting expenses,\nHAS DECIDED AS FOLLOWS:\nArticle 1\nSubject matter\nAn advisory group on radio spectrum policy, called the Radio Spectrum Policy Group (‘the Group’), is established.\nArticle
