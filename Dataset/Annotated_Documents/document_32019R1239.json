{"celex_id": "32019R1239", "reference": "25.7.2019\nEN\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\nL 198/64\nREGULATION (EU) 2019/1239 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL\nof 20 June 2019\nestablishing a European Maritime Single Window environment and repealing Directive 2010/65/EU\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 100(2) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee (1),\nAfter consulting the Committee of the Regions,\nActing in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure (2),\nWhereas:\n(1)\nDirective 2010/65/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council (3) requires Member States to accept the fulfilment of the reporting obligations of ships arriving in and departing from Union ports in electronic format and to ensure their transmission via a single window in order to facilitate and expedite maritime transport.\n(2)\nMaritime transport is the backbone of trade and communications within and beyond the single market. For the facilitation of maritime transport, and in order to further reduce the administrative burden for shipping companies, the information procedures for fulfilment of reporting obligations imposed on shipping companies by Union legal acts, by international legal acts and by national law of Member States should be further simplified and harmonised and should be technology-neutral, promoting future-proof reporting solutions.\n(3)\nBoth the European Parliament and the Council have frequently called for more interoperability and for more comprehensive, user-friendly communication and information flows, in order to improve the functioning of the internal market and to meet the needs of citizens and businesses.\n(4)\nThe main aim of this Regulation is to lay down harmonised rules for the provision of the information that is required for port calls, in particular by ensuring that the same data sets can be reported to each maritime National Single Window in the same way. This Regulation also aims to facilitate the transmission of information between declarants, relevant authorities and the providers of port services in the port of call, and other Member States. The application of this Regulation should not alter the time frames for, or the substance of, reporting obligations, and should not affect the subsequent storage and processing of information at Union level or at national level.\n(5)\nThe existing maritime National Single Window in each Member State should be maintained as the basis for a technologically neutral and interoperable European Maritime Single Window environment (‘EMSWe’). The maritime National Single Window should constitute a comprehensive reporting entry point for maritime transport operators, performing the functionalities of data collection from the declarants and data distribution to all relevant competent authorities and providers of port services.\n(6)\nIn order to enhance the efficiency of the maritime National Single Windows and to prepare for future developments, it should be possible to maintain present or establish new arrangements in Member States to use the maritime National Single Window for the reporting of similar information for other transport modes.\n(7)\nThe front-end interfaces of those maritime National Single Windows on the side of the declarants should be harmonised at Union level, in order to facilitate reporting and further reduce administrative burden. This harmonisation should be achieved by the use in every maritime National Single Window of common interface software for system-to-system exchanges of information, developed at Union level. The Member States should bear the responsibility for integrating and managing the interface module and for updating the software regularly and in a timely manner when new versions are provided by the Commission. The Commission should develop this module and provide updates when needed, since the development of digital technologies is moving fast and any technological solution could rapidly become outdated in the light of new developments.\n(8)\nOther reporting channels provided by Member States and service providers, such as Port Community Systems, could be maintained as optional entry points for reporting and should be able to act as data service providers.\n(9)\nIn order not to impose a disproportionate administrative burden on landlocked Member States which do not have maritime ports, such Member States should be exempted from the obligation to develop, establish, operate and make available a maritime National Single Window. This means that, for as long as they make use of this exemption, such Member States should not be required to fulfil obligations that are linked to the development, establishment, operation and making available of a maritime National Single Window.\n(10)\nAn easy-to-use graphical user interface with common functionalities should be part of the maritime National Single Windows for manual reporting by declarants. Member States should offer the graphical user interface for manual entry of data by declarants also by way of uploading harmonised digital spreadsheets. In addition to ensuring common functionalities, the Commission and Member States should coordinate efforts with the aim of ensuring that the user experience of those graphical user interfaces is as similar as possible.\n(11)\nEmerging new digital technologies present ever-growing opportunities to increase the efficiency of the maritime transport sector and to reduce administrative burdens. In order for the benefits of such new technologies to accrue as early as possible, the Commission should be empowered to amend the technical specifications, standards and procedures of the harmonised reporting environment by means of implementing acts. This should leave flexibility for market players to develop new digital technologies and new technologies should also be taken into account when this Regulation is reviewed.\n(12)\nAdequate support and information on the processes and technical requirements related to the use of maritime National Single Window should be provided to declarants via easily accessible and user-friendly national websites with common ‘look and feel’ standards.\n(13)\nThe Convention on Facilitation of International Maritime Traffic (‘the FAL Convention’) (4) provides that public authorities must in all cases require only essential reporting information and keep the number of items to a minimum. However, local conditions may require specific information to ensure safety of navigation.\n(14)\nIn order to enable the functioning of the EMSWe, it is necessary to establish a comprehensive EMSWe data set which should cover all information elements that might be requested by national authorities or port operators for administrative or operational purposes when a ship makes a port call. When establishing the EMSWe data set, the Commission should take into account relevant work carried out at international level. Since the scope of reporting obligations varies from one Member State to another, a maritime National Single Window in a given Member State should be designed to accept the EMSWe data set without any modification, and disregard any information not relevant for that Member State.\n(15)\nIn exceptional circumstances, a Member State should be able to request additional data elements from declarants. Such exceptional circumstances may arise, for example, when there is an urgent need to protect internal order and security or to address a serious threat against human or animal health or against the environment. The notion of exceptional circumstances should be interpreted strictly.\n(16)\nThe relevant reporting obligations contained in the Union and international legal acts should be listed in the Annex to this Regulation. Those reporting obligations should provide the basis for the establishment of the comprehensive EMSWe data set. The Annex should also refer to the relevant categories of reporting obligations at national level, and the Member States should be able to request the Commission to amend the EMSWe data set on the basis of reporting obligations contained in their national legislation and requirements. Union legal acts which amend the EMSWe data set on the basis of a reporting obligation contained in the national legislation and requirements should include explicit reference to that national legislation and requirements.\n(17)\nWhenever the information from the maritime National Single Window is distributed to the competent authorities, the transmission should comply with the common data requirements, formats and codes for the reporting obligations and formalities provided for in the Union legal acts listed in the Annex and should be made through the IT systems established therein, such as the electronic data-processing techniques referred to in Article 6(1) of Regulation (EU) No 952/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council (5).\n(18)\nThe implementation of this Regulation should take into account the SafeSeaNet systems established at national and Union level, which should continue to facilitate the exchange and distribution of information received through the maritime National Single Window between the Member States in accordance with Directive 2002/59/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (6).\n(19)\nPorts are not the final destination of goods. The efficiency of the ship port calls have an impact on the entire logistics chain related to the transport of goods and passengers to and from the ports. In order to ensure the interoperability, multimodality, and smooth integration of maritime transport with the overall logistics chain, and in order to facilitate other transport modes, the maritime National Single Windows should allow for the possibility of exchanging relevant information, such as arrival and departure times, with similar frameworks developed for other transport modes.\n(20)\nIn order to improve the efficiency of maritime transport and to limit the duplication of the information which must be provided for operational purposes when a ship makes a port call, the information provided by declarants to a maritime National Single Window should be also shared with certain other entities, such as port or terminal operators, when authorised by the declarant, and taking into account the need to respect confidentiality, commercial sensitivities and legal constraints. This Regulation aims to improve the handling of data following the once-only principle when fulfilling the reporting obligations.\n(21)\nRegulation (EU) No 952/2013 provides that goods which are brought into the customs territory of the Union must be covered by an entry summary declaration that must be submitted to the customs authorities electronically. Given the importance of the entry summary declaration information for the management of security and financial risks, a specific electronic system is currently being developed for the submission and management of entry summary declarations in the Union customs territory. It will not, therefore, be possible to submit entry summary declarations through the harmonised reporting interface module. However, considering that some of the data elements submitted in the entry summary declaration are also required for the fulfilment of other customs and maritime reporting obligations when a ship calls in a port of the Union, the EMSWe should be able to process the data elements of the entry summary declaration. The possibility that the maritime National Single Window could retrieve relevant information that has already been submitted through the entry summary declaration should also be envisaged.\n(22)\nIn order to fully harmonise reporting requirements, customs, maritime and other relevant authorities should cooperate at both national and Union level. National coordinators with specific responsibilities should enhance the effectiveness of this cooperation and the smooth functioning of the maritime National Single Windows.\n(23)\nIn order to enable the reuse of the information provided through the maritime National Single Windows and facilitate the submission of information by declarants, it is necessary to provide for common databases. An EMSWe ship database should be established which includes a reference list of ship particulars and their reporting exemptions, as reported to the respective maritime National Single Window. To facilitate the submission of information by declarants, a Common Location Database should be established which holds a reference list of location codes, including the United Nations Code for Trade and Transport Locations (UN/LOCODE), the SafeSeaNet-specific codes, and the port facility codes as registered in the Global Integrated Shipping Information System (GISIS) of the International Maritime Organization (IMO). Furthermore, a Common Hazmat Database should be established which incorporates a list of dangerous and polluting goods that are to be notified to the maritime National Single Window in accordance with Directive 2002/59/EC and IMO FAL 7, taking into consideration the relevant data elements from the IMO Conventions and Codes.\n(24)\nThe processing of personal data within the framework of this Regulation by competent authorities should comply with Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council (7). The processing of personal data by the Commission within the framework of this Regulation should comply with Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 of the European Parliament and of the Council (8).\n(25)\nThe EMSWe and the maritime National Single Windows should not provide any other grounds for any processing of personal data than what is required for their functioning and should not be used to grant any new access rights to personal data.\n(26)\nThe power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union should be delegated to the Commission in respect of supplementing this Regulation by establishing and amending the EMSWe data set and by determining definitions, categories and data specifications for the data elements, and in respect of amending the Annex to incorporate reporting obligations existing at national level as well as to take into account any new reporting obligations adopted by the Union legal acts. The Commission should ensure that the common data requirements, formats and codes established in the Union and international legal acts listed in the Annex are respected. It is of particular importance that the Commission carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level, and that those consultations be conducted in accordance with the principles laid down in the Interinstitutional Agreement of 13 April 2016 on Better Law-Making (9). In particular, to ensure equal participation in the preparation of delegated acts, the European Parliament and the Council receive all documents at the same time as Member States’ experts, and their experts systematically have access to meetings of Commission expert groups dealing with the preparation of delegated acts.\n(27)\nWhen preparing delegated acts, the Commission should ensure that Member States’ experts and the business community are consulted in a transparent manner, and well in advance.\n(28)\nIn order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of this Regulation, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission. Those powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council (10).\n(29)\nIn particular, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission to lay down the functional and technical specifications, quality control mechanisms and procedures for deploying, maintaining and employing the harmonised interface module and the related harmonised elements of the maritime National Single Windows. Implementing powers should also be conferred on the Commission to lay down the technical specifications, standards and procedures for common services of the EMSWe.\n(30)\nThis Regulation should build on Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council (11) which lays down conditions under which Member States recognise certain means of electronic identification for natural and legal persons falling under a notified electronic identification scheme of another Member State. Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 establishes the conditions for users to be able to use their electronic identification and authentication means in order to access online public services in cross-border situations.\n(31)\nThe Commission should carry out an evaluation of this Regulation. Information should be collected in order to inform that evaluation and allow the assessment of the performance of this Regulation against the objectives it pursues. The Commission should also evaluate, among other options, the added value of establishing a centralised and harmonised European reporting system, such as a central reporting interface.\n(32)\nDirective 2010/65/EU should therefore be repealed, with effect from the date of the application of this Regulation.\n(33)\nThe European Data Protection Supervisor was consulted in accordance with Article 28(2) of Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council (12),\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nCHAPTER I\nGENERAL PROVISIONS\nArticle 1\nSubject matter

The Commission shall establish and amend the EMSWe data set pursuant to paragraph 3 of this Article.\n2.   By 15 February 2020, the Member States shall notify the Commission of any reporting obligations stemming from national legislation and requirements, as well as of the data elements to be included in the EMSWe data set. They shall precisely identify those data elements.\n3.   The Commission is empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 23 in order to amend the Annex to this Regulation for the purpose of introducing, deleting or adapting references to national legislation or requirements, Union or international legal acts, and in order to establish and amend the EMSWe data set.\nThe first such delegated act shall be adopted by 15 August 2021.\nAs set out in Article 4, a Member State may request the Commission to introduce or amend data elements in the EMSWe data set, in accordance with the reporting obligations contained in the national legislation and requirements. When assessing whether data elements are to be included in the EMSWe data set, the Commission shall take into account safety concerns, as well as the principles of the FAL Convention, namely the principle of only requiring the reporting of essential information and keeping the number of items to a minimum.\nThe Commission shall decide, within three months after the request, whether to introduce the data elements in the EMSWe data set. The Commission shall justify its decision.\nA delegated act which introduces or amends a data element in the EMSWe data set shall include an explicit reference to the national legislation and requirements referred to in the third subparagraph.\nIn the event that the Commission decides not to introduce the requested data element, the Commission shall give substantiated grounds for its refusal, with reference to the safety of navigation and the principles of the FAL Convention.\nArticle 4\nAmendments to the EMSWe data set\n1.   Where a Member State intends to amend a reporting obligation under in its national legislation and requirements which would involve the provision of information other than the information that is included in the EMSWe data set, that Member State shall immediately notify the Commission. In that notification, the Member State shall precisely identify the information that is not covered by the EMSWe data set and shall indicate the intended period during which the reporting obligation in question is to apply.\n2.   A Member State shall not introduce new reporting obligations unless such introduction has been approved by the Commission through the procedure set out in Article 3 and the corresponding information has been incorporated in the EMSWe data set and applied in the harmonised reporting interfaces.\n3.   The Commission shall assess the necessity of amending the EMSWe data set in accordance with Article 3(3). Amendments to the EMSWe data set shall only be introduced once a year, except in duly justified cases.\n4.   In exceptional circumstances, a Member State may ask declarants to provide additional data elements without the approval of the Commission during a period of less than three months. The Member State shall notify those data elements to the Commission without delay. The Commission may allow the Member State to continue to request the additional data elements for two further periods of three months if the exceptional circumstances persist.\nNo later than one month before the end of the last three-month period referred to in the first subparagraph, the Member State may request the Commission that the additional data elements become part of the EMSWe data set, in accordance with Article 3(3). The Member State may continue to ask declarants to provide the additional data elements until a decision by the Commission has been taken, and in the event of a positive decision, until the amended EMSWe data set has been implemented.\nCHAPTER III\nPROVISION OF INFORMATION\nArticle 5\nMaritime National Single Window\n1.   Each Member State shall establish a maritime National Single Window through which, in accordance with this Regulation and without prejudice to Articles 7 and 11, all information necessary for the fulfilment of reporting obligations shall be provided once, by means of and in compliance with the EMSWe data set, using the harmonised reporting interface module and the graphical user interface as set out in Article 6 and, where applicable, other reporting means as set out in Article 7, for the purpose of making this information available to the relevant authorities of the Member States to the extent necessary to allow those authorities to perform their respective functions.\nMember States shall be responsible for the operation of their maritime National Single Window.\nMember States may jointly establish a maritime single window with one or more other Member States. Those Member States shall designate that maritime single window as their maritime National Single Window, and shall remain responsible for its operation in accordance with this Regulation.\n2.

It is a network of maritime national single windows* with harmonised reporting interfaces and includes data exchanges using SafeSeaNet and other systems, as well as services for:\nuser registry and access management;\ncommon addressing service;\nEMSWe ship database;\ncommon location database;\ncommon hazardous material (‘hazmat’) database; and\nship sanitation database.\nEstablishing the common EMSWe data set\nThe regulation maintains the existing maritime national single window in each EU country as the basis for a technologically neutral and interoperable EMSWe.\nThe European Commission is empowered to adopt delegated acts to establish a new common EMSWe data set, incorporating and adapting the most relevant requirements in existing national or EU legislation. EU countries must notify the Commission of any reporting obligations and requirements stemming from national legislation and any data elements they wish to be included in the EMSWe data set.\nHarmonised reporting Interfaces\nThe Commission will adopt implementing acts laying down the functional and technical specifications for the harmonised reporting interface module for the maritime national single windows, aiming for them to be interoperable with different user technologies and reporting systems.\nOnce-only principle\nThe Convention on Facilitation of International Maritime Traffic (FAL Convention) provides that public authorities must in all cases require only essential reporting information and keep the number of items to a minimum.
