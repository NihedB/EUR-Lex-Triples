The Commission then immediately transmits that information to all EU countries along with other information it considers relevant.\nThe EU country where the obstacle is taking place must promptly respond to information requests from the Commission and from other EU countries concerning the nature of the obstacle and the action that it has taken or proposes to take. All information exchanged between EU countries must also be transmitted to the Commission.\nWhen an obstacle occurs, the relevant EU country must take all necessary and proportionate measures so that the free movement of goods is resumed, and then inform the Commission of its actions.\nWhen the Commission determines that an obstacle is occurring, it notifies the relevant EU country of the reasons that led it to that conclusion and requests the EU country to take all necessary and proportionate measures to remove the said obstacle. The EU country then has 5 days to inform the Commission of the steps it has taken or plans to take, or to give a reasoned answer as to why measures are not needed.\nEU countries that do not respond by the deadline given by the Commission can be referred to the Court of Justice of the European Union.\nFROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?\n              \nIt has applied since 1 January 1999.\nBACKGROUND\nThe quick and efficient free movement of goods is a key principle of the EU. When obstacles get in the way of this free movement of goods, it can cause serious economic losses, which is what the Rapid Intervention Mechanism aims to prevent.\nThis regulation is based on Article 268 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU and applies to clear, unmistakable and unjustified obstacles to the free movement of goods originating in action or inaction on the part of an EU country.\nFor more information, see:\n‘Physical barriers to trade’ on the European Commission's website.\nMAIN DOCUMENT\n            \nCouncil Regulation (EC) No 2679/98 of 7 December 1998 on the functioning of the internal market in relation to the free movement of goods among the Member States (OJ L 337, 12.12.1998, pp. 8-9)\nlast update 06.12.2016", "tags": ["strike", "free movement of goods", "export policy", "import policy", "single market", "trade restriction"], "subjects": ["Free movement of goods", "Provisions under Article 235 EEC", "Provisions governing the Institutions", "Internal market - Principles", "Protocol on Ireland/Northern Ireland"], "split": "train", "reference_annotations": {}, "summary_annotations": {}}
