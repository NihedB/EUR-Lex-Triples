In the interests of clarity and rationality the said Directive should be codified.\n(2)\nProcessed cereal-based foods and baby foods for infants and young children are used as part of a diversified diet and do not constitute the sole source of nourishment of infants and young children.\n(3)\nThere is a great variety of the products in question reflecting the widely varied diet of infants being weaned and young children owing to social and cultural circumstances existing in the Community.\n(4)\nThe essential composition of the products in question must be appropriate for the nutritional requirements of infants and young children in good health as established by generally accepted scientific data, account being taken of the abovementioned factors.\n(5)\nThe essential nutritional requirements for the composition of the two broad categories of these products, namely processed cereal-based foods and baby foods, should be laid down.\n(6)\nAlthough, because of the nature of such products, a number of mandatory requirements and other restrictions as to the level of vitamins, minerals and other nutrients should be imposed, it should be allowed that such nutrients are added voluntarily by manufacturers, provided that they use exclusively certain substances to be specified by this Directive.\n(7)\nThe use of the products to which such nutrients have been voluntarily added at levels currently observed in the Community do not appear to result in excessive intakes of those nutrients by infants and young children. Attention should be paid to any future developments of the situation, and if necessary, appropriate measures should be taken.\n(8)\nDifferent rules on the maximum levels of pesticide residues in processed cereal-based foods and baby foods cause trade barriers between certain Member States.\n(9)\nMaximum levels for pesticide residues stipulated in Council Directive 76/895/EEC of 23 November 1976 relating to the fixing of maximum levels for pesticide residues in and on fruit and vegetables (4), in Council Directive 86/362/EEC of 24 July 1986 on the fixing of maximum levels for pesticide residues in and on cereals (5), in Council Directive 86/363/EEC of 24 July 1986 on the fixing of maximum levels for pesticide residues in and on foodstuffs of animal origin (6), and in Council Directive 90/642/EEC of 27 November 1990 on the fixing of maximum levels for pesticide residues in and on certain products of plant origin, including fruit and vegetables (7), are without prejudice to specific provisions applicable to processed cereal-based foods and baby foods.\n(10)\nTaking into account the Community’s international obligations, in cases where the relevant scientific evidence is insufficient, the precautionary principle allows the Community to provisionally adopt measures on the basis of available pertinent information, pending an additional assessment of risk and a review of the measure within a reasonable period of time.\n(11)\nOn the basis of the two opinions given by the Scientific Committee for Food on 19 September 1997 and 4 June 1998 there are at present doubts as to the adequacy of existing acceptable daily intake values (ADI) of pesticides and pesticide residues for the protection of the health of infants and young children. Therefore, as far as foodstuffs for particular nutritional uses intended for infants and young children are concerned, it is appropriate to adopt a very low common limit for all pesticides pending case-by-case scientific screening and evaluation of substances. This very low common limit should be fixed at 0,01 mg/kg which normally is in practice the minimum detectable level.\n(12)\nSevere limitations on pesticide residues should be required. With careful selection of raw materials, and given that processed cereal-based foods and baby foods undergo extensive processing during their manufacture, it is feasible to produce products containing very low levels of pesticide residues. However, in the case of a small number of pesticides or metabolites of pesticides even a maximum residue level of 0,01 mg/kg might, under worst-case intake conditions, allow infants and young children to exceed the ADI. This is the case for pesticides or metabolites of pesticides with an ADI lower than 0,0005 mg/kg body weight.\n(13)\nThis Directive establishes the principle of the prohibition of the use of these pesticides in the production of agricultural products intended for processed cereal-based foods and baby foods. However, this prohibition does not necessarily guarantee that products are free from such pesticides, since some pesticides contaminate the environment and their residues may be found in the products concerned.\n(14)\nThe health of infants and young children can be better protected by applying additional requirements which can be enforced by analysis regardless of a product’s origin.\n(15)\nMost of the pesticides which have ADI values lower than 0,0005 mg/kg body weight are already prohibited in the Community. The prohibited pesticides should not be detectable in processed cereal-based foods and baby foods by state of the art analytical methods. However, some pesticides degrade slowly and still contaminate the environment. They might be present in processed cereal-based foods and baby foods even if they have not been used. For the purposes of control, a harmonised approach should be followed.\n(16)\nPending Commission Decisions on whether they satisfy the safety requirements of Article 5 of Council Directive 91/414/EEC of 15 July 1991 concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market (8), the continued use of authorised pesticides should be permitted as long as their residues comply with the maximum residue levels established in this Directive. The latter should be set at levels ensuring that their respective ADI values are not exceeded by infants and young children under worst-case intake conditions.\n(17)\nThe use of novel food ingredients should be dealt with horizontally for all foodstuffs in a separate measure.\n(18)\nThis Directive reflects current knowledge about the products concerned. Any amendment, to allow for innovation based on scientific and technical progress, should be decided by the procedure referred to in Article 13(2) of Directive 89/398/EEC.\n(19)\nIn view of the persons for whom the products are intended, the necessary microbiological criteria and maximum levels for contaminants should be laid down.\n(20)\nPursuant to Article 7(1) of Directive 89/398/EEC, the products covered by this Directive are subject to the general rules laid down by Directive 2000/13/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 March 2000 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the labelling, presentation and advertising of foodstuffs (9).\n(21)\nIn this Directive the additions and exceptions to those general rules should be adopted and expanded upon, where appropriate.\n(22)\nIn particular, the nature and destination of the products covered by this Directive require nutritional labelling showing the energy value and principal nutrients they contain. On the other hand, the method of use should be specified in accordance with point 9 of Article 3(1) and Article 11 of Directive 2000/13/EC, in order to prevent inappropriate uses liable to harm the health of infants.\n(23)\nWhilst claims not specifically prohibited may generally be made for the products in question in conformity with the rules applicable for all foodstuffs, such claims should, where appropriate, take into account the compositional criteria specified in this Directive.\n(24)\nOn the provisions liable to affect public health, the consultation in accordance with Article 4 of Directive 89/398/EEC has taken place.\n(25)\nThe measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health.\n(26)\nThis Directive should be without prejudice to the obligations of the Member States relating to the time-limits for transposition into national law of the Directives set out in Annex VIII, Part B,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:\nArticle 1\n1.   This Directive is a ‘specific Directive’ within the meaning of Article 4(1) of Directive 89/398/EEC.\n2.

OF:\nDirective 2006/125/EC on processed cereal-based foods and baby foods for infants and young children\nWHAT IS THE AIM OF THE DIRECTIVE?\nIt lays down harmonised rules for the composition and labelling of processed cereal-based foods and baby foods for infants* and young children*.\nThese products are carefully monitored since they may contain pesticide residues* which may endanger the health of this sensitive population group. Pesticide residues are prohibited or controlled on the basis of maximum permissible quantities which may not exceed the acceptable daily intake values.\nIt is a specific directive within the meaning of Directive 89/398/EEC, a directive which has since been replaced by Regulation (EU) No 609/2013 on food intended for infants and young children, food for special medical purposes, and total diet replacement for weight control (see summary).\nIt codifies previous directives (96/5/EC, 98/36/EC, 1999/39/EC and 2003/13/EC).\nKEY POINTS\nScope\nThis directive covers foodstuffs for particular nutritional use that fulfil the nutritional requirements of infants and young children in good health and are intended for use by infants while they are being weaned, and by young children as a supplement to their diet and/or for their progressive adaptation to ordinary food.\nThey comprise:\nprocessed cereal-based foods, which are divided into the following 4 categories: simple cereals which are or have to be reconstituted with milk or other appropriate nutritious liquids;cereals with an added high protein food which are or have to be reconstituted with water or other protein-free liquid;pastas which are to be used after cooking in boiling water or other appropriate liquids;rusks and biscuits which are to be used either directly or, after pulverisation, with the addition of water, milk or other suitable liquids;\nbaby foods other than processed cereal-based foods.\nThis directive does not apply to milks intended for young children.\nGeneral obligation\nEU countries must ensure that only products which comply with this directive are sold.\nComposition\nOnly ingredients suitable for particular nutritional use for infants and young children (supported by scientific data) may be used in the manufacture of the foods concerned.\nProcessed cereal-based foods must comply with the compositional criteria specified in Annex I.\nBaby foods which are described in Annex II must comply with the compositional criteria specified therein.\nOnly the nutritional substances listed in Annex IV may be added in the manufacture of processed cereal-based foods and baby foods within the maximum limits laid down by the directive. The purity criteria for those substances must be laid down at a later stage.\nProcessed cereal-based foods and baby foods may not contain any substance in such quantity as to endanger the health of infants and young children (see Regulation (EC) No 1881/2006) (see summary).\nLabelling\nIn addition to the mandatory particulars stipulated by Regulation (EU) No 1169/2011 (see summary), labelling must bear the following information:\nthe age from which the product may be used, which must not be less than 4 months. Products recommended for use from the age of 4 months may indicate that they are suitable from that age unless persons having qualifications in medicine, nutrition etc. advise otherwise;\nthe presence or absence of gluten if the indicated age from which the product may be used is below 6 months;\nthe available energy value (in kJ and kcal) and the protein, carbohydrate and lipid content (in numerical form) per 100 g or 100 ml of the product as sold and, where appropriate, per specified quantity of the product as proposed for consumption;\nthe average quantity of each mineral substance and of each vitamin governed by a specific level in Annex I and Annex II respectively, expressed in numerical form, per 100 g or 100 ml of the product as sold and, where appropriate, per specified quantity of the product as proposed for consumption;\ninstructions for appropriate preparation, when necessary, and a statement as to the importance of following those instructions.\nThe labelling may include non-mandatory particulars:\nthe average quantity of the nutrients set out in Annex IV (in numerical form) per 100 g or 100 ml of the product as sold and, where appropriate, per specified quantity of the product as proposed for consumption;\ninformation on vitamins and minerals shown in Annex V (as a percentage of the reference values given therein) per 100 g or 100 ml of the product as sold, and where appropriate, per specified quantity of the product as proposed for consumption, provided that the quantities present are at least equal to 15% of the reference values.\nMaximum pesticide levels\nThis directive sets the maximum permissible level of pesticide residues in processed cereal-based foods and baby foods at 0.01 mg/kg, except for certain substances whose limit is laid down in Annex VI.\nStandardised analytical methods must be used for determining the presence of pesticide residues.\nProhibited pesticides\nThis directive prohibits the use of certain pesticides in agricultural products intended for baby foods (list in Annex VII).\nFor pesticides or pesticide metabolites in this list, the maximum level of 0.01 mg/kg may be excessive for infants and young children. This is the case for pesticides or metabolites of pesticides with an acceptable daily intake lower than 0.0005 mg/kg body weight.\nThe limit of quantification of the analytical methods is 0.003 mg/kg. At this level, pesticides are considered not to have been used. This limit may be altered in the light of technical progress or data on environmental contamination.\nFROM WHEN DOES THE DIRECTIVE APPLY?\n              \nIt has applied since 26 December 2006.\nBACKGROUND\n              \nFor more information, see:\nFood for infants and young children (European Commission).\nKEY TERMS\n              \nInfants: children under the age of 12 months.\nYoung children: children aged between 1 and 3 years.\nPesticide residues: residues of a plant protection product in processed cereal-based foods and baby foods, including its metabolites (intermediate products created during cell metabolism) and products resulting from its degradation or reaction.\nMAIN DOCUMENT\n            \nCommission Directive 2006/125/EC of 5 December 2006 on processed cereal-based foods and baby foods for infants and young children (Codified version) (OJ L 339, 6.12.2006, pp. 16-35)\nRELATED DOCUMENTS\n            \nRegulation (EU) No 609/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 June 2013 on food intended for infants and young children, food for special medical purposes, and total diet replacement for weight control and repealing Council Directive 92/52/EEC, Commission Directives 96/8/EC, 1999/21/EC, 2006/125/EC and 2006/141/EC, Directive 2009/39/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council and Commission Regulations (EC) No 41/2009 and (EC) No 953/2009 (OJ L 181, 29.6.2013, pp. 35-56)\nSuccessive amendments to Regulation (EU) No 609/2013 have been incorporated into the original text.
