However, this decision establishes a liaison office in Brussels.\nThis decision reaffirms that SATCEN operations are in the context of the EU‚Äôs common foreign and security policy (CFSP) and, in particular, the common security and defence policy (CSDP).\nThe Political and Security Committee (PSC) of the Council of the EU exercises political supervision over the activities of SATCEN. The High Representative of the EU for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy is responsible for the operational direction. The SATCEN board is responsible for the annual and long-term programmes and the appropriate budget.\nSATCEN is responsible for the residual administrative tasks, such as administering pensions, medical insurance and employee disputes, for employees of the dissolved Western European Union (WEU)*.\nUnder this decision, primarily through Earth observation satellites, SATCEN offers geospatial intelligence products and services to users that request it, such as the European external action service, individual EU countries, the European Commission or international organisations such as the United Nations or NATO.\nEvery September, the SATCEN director, who is appointed by the board for the duration of 3 years, establishes an annual work programme. This annual work programme, as well as the long-term work programme and the budget, must be approved by the board. The board is composed of a representative appointed by each EU country and the European Commission and chaired by the High Representative.\nBy 31 July 2019, the High Representative of the EU must present a report and, if necessary, recommendations, to the Council of the EU on the functioning of SATCEN.\nFROM WHEN DOES THE DECISION APPLY?\n              \nIt applies from 26 June 2014.\nBACKGROUND\n              \nSatellites are essential for strengthening early warning* and crisis monitoring functions in the context of security and defence.
