{"celex_id": "32013R0168", "reference": "2.3.2013\nEN\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\nL 60/52\nREGULATION (EU) No 168/2013 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL\nof 15 January 2013\non the approval and market surveillance of two- or three-wheel vehicles and quadricycles\n(Text with EEA relevance)\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 114 thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative act to the national Parliaments,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee (1),\nActing in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure (2),\nWhereas:\n(1)\nThe internal market comprises an area without internal frontiers in which the free movement of goods, persons, services and capital must be ensured. To that end a comprehensive EC type-approval system for two- or three-wheel vehicles was established by Directive 2002/24/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (3) on the type-approval of such vehicles. Those principles should continue to apply for this Regulation and the delegated and implementing acts adopted pursuant to this Regulation.\n(2)\nThe internal market should be based on transparent, simple and consistent rules which provide legal certainty and clarity from which businesses and consumers alike can benefit.\n(3)\nWith the aim of simplifying and accelerating the adoption of type-approval legislation, a new regulatory approach has been introduced in EU vehicle type-approval legislation, under which the legislator in the ordinary legislative procedure sets out only the fundamental rules and principles and delegates the laying down of further technical details to the Commission. With regard to substantive requirements, this Regulation should therefore lay down only fundamental provisions on functional safety and environmental performance, and empower the Commission to lay down the technical specifications.\n(4)\nThis Regulation should be without prejudice to measures at national or Union level regarding the use of L-category vehicles on the road, such as specific drivers’ licence requirements, limitations of maximum speed or measures regulating access to certain roads.\n(5)\nMarket surveillance in the automotive sector, and in particular the L-category vehicle sector, should be improved by enhancing the legal provisions governing conformity of production and specifying the obligations of the economic operators in the supply chain. In particular, the role and responsibilities of the authorities in the Member States in charge of type-approval and market surveillance should be clarified, and the requirements relating to the competence, obligations and performance of the technical services that perform tests for vehicle type-approval reinforced. Compliance with the type-approval and conformity-of-production requirements of the legislation governing the automotive sector should remain the key responsibility of the approval authorities, while market surveillance may be a competence shared between different national authorities. Effective coordination and monitoring at Union and national levels should be deployed to ensure that approval and market surveillance authorities apply the new measures effectively.\n(6)\nThe national authorities’ obligations laid down in the market surveillance provisions of this Regulation are more specific than the corresponding provisions of Regulation (EC) No 765/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 9 July 2008 setting out the requirements for accreditation and market surveillance relating to the marketing of products (4).\n(7)\nThis Regulation should contain substantive requirements for environmental protection and vehicle functional safety. The main elements of the relevant requirements of this Regulation are based on the results of the impact assessment of 4 October 2010 carried out by the Commission analysing different options by listing possible advantages and disadvantages in terms of economic, environmental, safety and societal aspects. Both qualitative and quantitative aspects were included in that analysis. After comparison of the different options the preferred options were identified and chosen to form the basis for this Regulation.\n(8)\nThis Regulation aims to lay down harmonised rules for the type-approval of L-category vehicles, with a view to ensuring the functioning of the internal market. L-category vehicles are two-, three- or four-wheel vehicles such as powered two-wheel vehicles, tricycles and quadricycles. In addition, this Regulation aims to simplify the current legal framework, to reduce the emissions from L-category vehicles, thus resulting in a more proportionate share of L-category vehicle emissions in overall road transport emissions, to increase the overall level of safety, to adapt to technical progress and to strengthen the rules on market surveillance.\n(9)\nIn order to ensure a high level of vehicle functional safety, occupational safety and environmental protection, the technical requirements and environmental standards applicable to vehicles, systems, components and separate technical units with regard to type-approval should be harmonised.\n(10)\nThe objectives of this Regulation should not be affected by the fitting of certain systems, components or separate technical units after vehicles have been placed on the market, registered or entered into service. Thus, appropriate measures should be taken in order to make sure that systems, components or separate technical units which can be fitted to vehicles, and which could significantly impair the functioning of systems that are essential for environmental protection or functional safety, are subject to prior control by an approval authority before they are placed on the market, registered or are entered into service.\n(11)\nDirective 95/1/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 2 February 1995 on the maximum design speed, maximum torque and maximum net engine power of two- or three-wheel motor vehicles (5) gave the option to Member States to refuse the initial registration and any subsequent registration within their territory of vehicles with a maximum net power of more than 74 kW. The anticipated correlation between safety and absolute power limitation could not be confirmed in several scientific studies. For that reason and in order to remove internal barriers to trade on the Union market, that option should no longer be maintained. Other, more effective safety measures should be introduced to help reduce the high numbers of fatalities and injuries among riders of powered two-wheel vehicles in road accidents in the Union.\n(12)\nThis Regulation sets environmental requirements for two stages with the second stage (Euro 5) being mandatory for new types of vehicles as of 1 January 2020, thereby creating long-term planning predictability for the vehicle manufacturers and the supplier industry. Based on future available data, an environmental effect study required by this Regulation should provide additional underpinning through modelling, technical feasibility and cost-effectiveness analysis based on the latest available data. In addition, the study should, inter alia, assess the feasibility and cost-effectiveness of in-service conformity testing requirements, off-cycle emission requirements and a particulate number emission limit for certain (sub-)categories. On the basis of the study results, the Commission should consider presenting a proposal introducing these new elements into future type-approval legislation applicable after the stages provided for in this Regulation.\n(13)\nThe EU type-approval system is intended to enable each Member State to confirm that each type of vehicle has undergone the checks provided for in this Regulation and in delegated and implementing acts adopted pursuant to this Regulation, and that its manufacturer has obtained a type-approval certificate. It furthermore obliges manufacturers to issue a certificate of conformity for each vehicle produced in accordance with the type-approval. When a vehicle is accompanied by such a certificate it should be permitted to be made available on the market and registered for use throughout the Union.\n(14)\nIn order to ensure that the procedure for monitoring conformity of production, which is one of the cornerstones of the EU type-approval system, has been correctly implemented and functions properly, manufacturers should be regularly checked by a competent authority or by an appropriately qualified technical service designated for that purpose.\n(15)\nThis Regulation constitutes a set of specific safety and environmental requirements. Therefore, it is important to establish provisions to ensure that, in cases where a vehicle presents a serious risk for users or the environment, the manufacturer or any other economic operator in the supply chain has taken effective protective measures, including the recall of vehicles, within the meaning of Article 20 of Regulation (EC) No 765/2008. Approval authorities should therefore be able to assess whether those measures are sufficient.\n(16)\nIn certain limited cases, it is appropriate to allow for national small series type-approval. In order to prevent misuse, any simplified procedure for small-series vehicles should be restricted to cases of very limited production. It is therefore necessary to define precisely the concept of small series in terms of the number of vehicles produced.\n(17)\nThe Union is a contracting party of the Agreement of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe concerning the adoption of uniform technical prescriptions for wheeled vehicles, equipment and parts which can be fitted to and/or be used on wheeled vehicles and the conditions for reciprocal recognition of approvals granted on the basis of these prescriptions (‘Revised 1958 Agreement’) (6). In order to simplify the type-approval legislation in line with the recommendations of the report published by the Commission in 2006 entitled ‘CARS 21: A Competitive Automotive Regulatory System for the 21st century’, it is appropriate to repeal all separate Directives without reducing the level of protection. The requirements set out in those Directives should be carried over to this Regulation or to the delegated acts adopted pursuant to this Regulation and should be replaced, where appropriate, with references to the corresponding United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) regulations which the Union has voted in favour of or to which the Union has acceded and which are annexed to the Revised 1958 Agreement. To reduce the administrative burden of the type-approval process, vehicle manufacturers should be allowed to seek type-approval in accordance with this Regulation, where appropriate, directly by means of obtaining approval under the relevant UNECE regulations referred to in the Annexes to this Regulation or in the delegated acts adopted pursuant to this Regulation.\n(18)\nConsequently, UNECE regulations and the amendments thereto on which the Union has voted in favour, in application of Decision 97/836/EC, should be incorporated within the EU type-approval legislation. Accordingly, the power should be delegated to the Commission to adopt the necessary adaptations to the Annexes to this Regulation or to the delegated acts adopted pursuant to this Regulation.\n(19)\nUnrestricted access to vehicle repair information, via a standardised format which can be used to retrieve the technical information, and effective competition on the market for vehicle repair and maintenance information services are necessary to improve the functioning of the internal market, particularly as regards the free movement of goods, the freedom of establishment and the freedom to provide services. A great proportion of such information is related to on-board diagnostic systems and their interaction with other vehicle systems. It is appropriate to lay down technical specifications that the websites of the manufacturers should follow, along with targeted measures to ensure reasonable access for small and medium-sized enterprises.\n(20)\nIn order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of this Regulation, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission. Those powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 February 2011 laying down the rules and general principles concerning mechanisms for control by Member States of the Commission’s exercise of implementing powers (7).\n(21)\nIn order to supplement this Regulation with further technical details, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union should be delegated to the Commission in respect of requirements on environmental and propulsion performance, on functional safety and on vehicle construction. It is of particular importance that the Commission carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level. The Commission, when preparing and drawing up delegated acts, should ensure simultaneous, timely and appropriate transmission of relevant documents to the European Parliament and to the Council.\n(22)\nMember States should lay down rules on penalties applicable to infringements of this Regulation and the delegated or implementing acts adopted pursuant to this Regulation and ensure that they are implemented. Those penalties should be effective, proportionate and dissuasive.\n(23)\nIn order to be able to assess and decide whether to extend mandatory fitting of certain advanced brake systems to additional categories of motorcycles, the Commission should report to the European Parliament and to the Council on the basis, inter alia, of road accident data provided by Member States.\n(24)\nWhile nothing in this Regulation prevents Member States from continuing to apply their respective individual approval systems, the Commission should report to the European Parliament and the Council on the operation of these national systems, based on information provided by Member States, in order to reconsider the question of whether to submit a legislative proposal for the harmonisation of the individual approval system at Union level.\n(25)\nIn the context of the revision of Directive 2007/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 5 September 2007 establishing a framework for the approval of motor vehicles and their trailers, and of systems, components and separate technical units intended for such vehicles (8), the delineation between this Regulation and Directive 2007/46/EC should be considered in the light of the experience gained by Member States in the application of this Regulation, in particular in order to ensure fair competition between vehicle categories.\n(26)\nIn the interest of clarity, predictability, rationality and simplification and in order to reduce the burden for vehicle manufacturers, this Regulation should contain only a limited number of implementation stages for the introduction of new emission levels and safety requirements. Industry should be allowed sufficient time to adapt to the new provisions laid down in this Regulation and to the technical specifications and administrative provisions set out in the delegated and implementing acts adopted pursuant to this Regulation. Timely definition of requirements is essential to ensuring sufficient lead-time for manufacturers to develop, test and implement technical solutions for vehicles produced in series, and for manufacturers and approval authorities in the Member States to put in place the necessary administrative systems.\n(27)\nDirective 2002/24/EC and the separate Directives referred to in that Directive have been substantially amended several times. In the interests of clarity, rationality and simplification, Directive 2002/24/EC and the separate Directives referred to in that Directive should be repealed and replaced by one Regulation and a small number of delegated and implementing acts. The adoption of a Regulation ensures that the provisions concerned are directly applicable and can be updated much faster and more efficiently to take better account of technical progress.\n(28)\nThe following Directives should be repealed:\n—\nDirective 2002/24/EC,\n—\nCouncil Directive 93/14/EEC of 5 April 1993 on the braking of two or three-wheel motor vehicles (9),\n—\nCouncil Directive 93/30/EEC of 14 June 1993 on audible warning devices for two- or three-wheel motor vehicles (10),\n—\nCouncil Directive 93/33/EEC of 14 June 1993 on protective devices intended to prevent the unauthorized use of two- or three-wheel motor vehicles (11),\n—\nCouncil Directive 93/93/EEC of 29 October 1993 on the masses and dimensions of two or three-wheel motor vehicles (12),\n—\nDirective 95/1/EC,\n—\nDirective 97/24/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 June 1997 on certain components and characteristics of two or three-wheel motor vehicles (13),\n—\nDirective 2000/7/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 March 2000 on speedometers for two- or three-wheel motor vehicles (14),\n—\nDirective 2002/51/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 19 July 2002 on the reduction of the level of pollutant emissions from two- and three-wheel motor vehicles (15),\n—\nDirective 2009/62/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 July 2009 relating to the space for mounting the rear registration plate of two or three-wheel motor vehicles (16),\n—\nDirective 2009/67/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 July 2009 on the installation of lighting and light-signalling devices on two or three-wheel motor vehicles (17),\n—\nDirective 2009/78/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 July 2009 on stands for two-wheel motor vehicles (18),\n—\nDirective 2009/79/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 July 2009 on passenger hand-holds on two-wheel motor vehicles (19),\n—\nDirective 2009/80/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 July 2009 on the identification of controls, tell-tales and indicators for two or three-wheel motor vehicles (20),\n—\nDirective 2009/139/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 November 2009 on statutory markings for two- or three-wheel motor vehicles (21).\n(29)\nSince the objectives of this Regulation, namely to lay down harmonised rules on the administrative and technical requirements for the type-approval of L-category vehicles and on market surveillance of such vehicles, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States, and can therefore, by reason of their scale and effects, be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives,\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nCHAPTER I\nSUBJECT MATTER, SCOPE AND DEFINITIONS\nArticle 1\nSubject matter\n1.

Where a component or separate technical unit fulfils its function or offers a specific feature only in conjunction with other parts of the vehicle, thereby making it possible to verify compliance with the requirements only when the component or separate technical unit is operating in conjunction with those other vehicle parts, the scope of the EU type-approval of the component or the separate technical unit shall be restricted accordingly.\nIn such cases, the EU type-approval certificate shall specify any restriction on the use of the component or separate technical unit and shall indicate the special conditions for its mounting.\nWhere such a component or separate technical unit is fitted by the vehicle manufacturer, compliance with any applicable restrictions on use or conditions for mounting shall be verified at the time when the vehicle is approved.\nArticle 32\nTests required for EU type-approval\n1.   Compliance with the technical prescriptions laid down in this Regulation and in the acts listed in Annex II shall be demonstrated by means of appropriate tests performed by designated technical services.\nThe test procedures referred to in the first subparagraph and the specific equipment and tools prescribed to perform those tests shall be those laid down in the relevant acts listed in Annex II.\nThe format of the test reports shall comply with the general requirements as laid down by the Commission by means of implementing acts. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 73(2). The first such implementing acts shall be adopted by 31 December 2014.\n2.   The manufacturer shall make available to the approval authority as many vehicles, components or separate technical units as are required under the relevant acts listed in Annex II for the performance of the required tests.\n3.   The required tests shall be performed on vehicles, components and separate technical units which are representative of the type to be approved.\nHowever, the manufacturer may select, in agreement with the approval authority, a vehicle, system, component or separate technical unit which, while not representative of the type to be approved, combines a number of the most unfavourable features with regard to the required level of performance. Virtual testing methods may be used to aid decision-making during the selection process.\n4.   Subject to the agreement of the approval authority, virtual testing methods may be used as alternatives to the test procedures referred to in paragraph 1 at the request of the manufacturer with respect to those requirements established in the delegated acts adopted pursuant to paragraph 6.\n5.   Virtual testing methods shall fulfil the conditions set out in the delegated acts adopted pursuant to paragraph 6.\n6.   In order to ensure that the results obtained through virtual testing are as meaningful as those obtained through physical testing, the Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 75 concerning the requirements which can be subject to virtual testing and the conditions under which the virtual testing are to be performed. When adopting those delegated acts, the Commission shall take as a basis the requirements and procedures provided for in Annex XVI to Directive 2007/46/EC, as appropriate.\nArticle 33\nConformity of production arrangements\n1.   An approval authority which grants an EU type-approval shall take the necessary measures to verify, if necessary in cooperation with the approval authorities of the other Member States, that adequate arrangements have been made to ensure that the vehicles, systems, components or separate technical units in production will conform to the approved type.\n2.   An approval authority which grants a whole-vehicle type-approval shall take the necessary measures to verify that certificates of conformity issued by the manufacturer conform to Article 38.

An EU type-approval of a vehicle shall become invalid in any of the following cases:\n(a)\nnew requirements applicable to the approved vehicle type become mandatory for the making available on the market, registration or entry into service of vehicles, and it is not possible to update the type-approval accordingly;\n(b)\nproduction of the approved vehicle is definitively discontinued voluntarily;\n(c)\nthe validity of the approval expires by virtue of a restriction in accordance with Article 40(6);\n(d)\nthe approval has been withdrawn in accordance with Article 33(5), Article 49(1) or Article 52(4).\n3.   Where only one variant within a type or one version within a variant becomes invalid, the EU type-approval of the vehicle in question shall lose validity only in so far as the particular variant or version is concerned.\n4.   When production of a particular type of vehicle is definitively discontinued, the manufacturer shall notify the approval authority that granted the EU type-approval for that vehicle.\nWithin one month of receiving the notification referred to in the first subparagraph, the approval authority which granted the EU type-approval for the vehicle shall inform the approval authorities of the other Member States accordingly.\n5.   Without prejudice to paragraph 4, in cases where an EU type-approval of a vehicle is due to become invalid, the manufacturer shall notify the approval authority that granted the EU type-approval.\nThe approval authority that granted the EU type-approval shall without delay communicate all relevant information to the approval authorities of the other Member States so as to enable the application, where appropriate, of Article 44.\nThe communication referred to in the second subparagraph shall specify, in particular, the date of production and the vehicle identification number of the last vehicle produced.\nCHAPTER VIII\nCERTIFICATE OF CONFORMITY AND MARKINGS\nArticle 38\nCertificate of conformity\n1.   The manufacturer, in its capacity as the holder of a vehicle type-approval, shall deliver a certificate of conformity as a paper document to accompany each vehicle, whether complete, incomplete or completed, which is manufactured in conformity with the approved vehicle type.\nSuch a certificate shall be delivered free of charge to the buyer together with the vehicle. Its delivery may not be made dependent on an explicit request or the submission of additional information to the manufacturer.\nFor a period of 10 years after the production date of the vehicle the vehicle manufacturer shall, at the request of the vehicle owner, issue a duplicate of the certificate of conformity against a payment not exceeding the cost of issuing it. The word ‘duplicate’ shall be clearly visible on the face of any duplicate certificate.\n2.   The manufacturer shall use the template for the certificate of conformity adopted by the Commission by means of implementing acts. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 73(2). The certificate of conformity shall be designed to prevent forgery. To that end, the implementing acts shall provide that the paper used in the certificate shall be protected by several security printing features. The first such implementing acts shall be adopted by 31 December 2014.\n3.   The certificate of conformity shall be drawn up in at least one of the official languages of the Union. Any Member State may request the certificate of conformity to be translated into its own official language or languages.\n4.   The person(s) authorised to sign certificates of conformity shall be in the manufacturer’s organisation and shall be duly authorised by the management to fully engage the legal responsibility of the manufacturer with respect to the design and the construction or to the conformity of the production of the vehicle.\n5.   The certificate of conformity shall be completed in its entirety and shall not contain restrictions as regards the use of the vehicle other than those provided for in this Regulation or any of the delegated acts adopted pursuant to this Regulation.\n6.   In the case of an incomplete or completed vehicle, the manufacturer shall fill in only those items of the certificate of conformity which have been added or changed at the current stage of approval and, if applicable, shall attach to the certificate all certificates of conformity delivered at the previous stages.\n7.   The certificate of conformity shall, for vehicles approved in accordance with Article 40(2), display in its title the phrase ‘For complete/completed vehicles, type-approved in application of Article 40(4) of Regulation (EU) No 168/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 January 2013 on the approval and market surveillance of two- or three-wheel vehicles and quadricycles (provisional approval)’.\n8.   The certificate of conformity, as set out in the implementing acts referred to in paragraph 2, shall, for vehicles type-approved in accordance with Article 42, display in its title the phrase ‘For complete/completed vehicles type-approved in small series’, and in close proximity thereto the year of production followed by a sequential number, between 1 and the limit indicated in the table in Annex III, denoting, in respect of each year of production, the position of that vehicle within the production allocated for that year.\n9.   Without prejudice to paragraph 1, the manufacturer may transmit the certificate of conformity by electronic means to the registration authority of any Member State.\nArticle 39\nStatutory plate with the appropriate marking of vehicles and type-approval mark of components or separate technical units\n1.   The manufacturer of a vehicle shall affix to each vehicle manufactured in conformity with the approved type a statutory plate with the appropriate marking required by the relevant implementing act adopted pursuant to paragraph 3.\n2.   The manufacturer of a component or separate technical unit, whether or not it is part of a system, shall affix to each component or separate technical unit manufactured in conformity with the approved type the type-approval mark required by the relevant implementing act adopted pursuant to this Regulation or the relevant UNECE regulation.\nWhere no such type-approval mark is required, the manufacturer shall affix at least the trade name or trade mark of the manufacturer, the type number or an identification number.\n3.   The statutory plate and EU type-approval mark shall be in accordance with the model set out by the Commission by means of implementing acts. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 73(2). The first such implementing acts shall be adopted by 31 December 2014.\nCHAPTER IX\nEXEMPTIONS FOR NEW TECHNOLOGIES OR NEW CONCEPTS\nArticle 40\nExemptions for new technologies or new concepts\n1.   The manufacturer may apply for an EU type-approval in respect of a type of vehicle, system, component or separate technical unit that incorporates new technologies or concepts which are incompatible with one or more acts listed in Annex II.\n2.   The approval authority shall grant the EU type-approval referred to in paragraph 1 where all of the following conditions are met:\n(a)\nthe application states the reasons why the technologies or concepts in question make the system, component or separate technical unit incompatible with one or more acts listed in Annex II;\n(b)\nthe application describes the safety and environmental implications of the new technology and the measures taken in order to ensure at least an equivalent level of safety and environmental protection as that provided by the requirements from which exemption is sought;\n(c)\ntest descriptions and results are presented which prove that the condition in point (b) is met.\n3.   The granting of such an EU type-approval exempting new technologies or new concepts shall be subject to authorisation by the Commission. That authorisation shall be given by means of an implementing act. That implementing act shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 73(2).\n4.   Pending the decision on authorisation by the Commission, the approval authority may already issue the EU type-approval, but it shall be provisional, valid only in the territory of that Member State, in respect of a type of vehicle covered by the exemption sought. The approval authority shall inform the Commission and the other Member States thereof without delay by means of a file containing the information referred to in paragraph 2.\nThe provisional nature and the limited territorial validity shall be apparent from the heading of the type-approval certificate and the heading of the certificate of conformity. The Commission may adopt implementing acts in order to provide for harmonised templates for the type-approval certificate and the certificate of conformity for the purposes of this paragraph. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 73(2).\n5.   Other approval authorities may decide to accept in writing the provisional approval referred to in paragraph 4 within their territory.\n6.   Where appropriate, the authorisation by the Commission referred to in paragraph 3 shall also specify whether it is subject to any restrictions. In all cases, the type-approval shall be valid for at least 36 months.\n7.   If the Commission decides to refuse authorisation, the approval authority shall immediately give notice to the holder of the provisional type-approval referred to in paragraph 4 that the provisional approval will be revoked six months after the date of the Commission’s refusal.\nHowever, vehicles manufactured in conformity with the provisional approval before it ceases to be valid may be placed on the market, registered or entered into service in any Member State that accepted the provisional approval.\nArticle 41\nSubsequent adaptation of delegated and implementing acts\n1.   Where the Commission authorises the granting of an exemption pursuant to Article 40, it shall immediately take the necessary steps to adapt the delegated or implementing acts concerned to technological developments.\nWhere the exemption under Article 40 relates to a UNECE regulation, the Commission shall propose an amendment to the relevant UNECE regulation in accordance with the procedure applicable under the Revised 1958 Agreement.\n2.   As soon as the relevant acts have been amended, any restriction in the Commission decision authorising the exemption shall be lifted.\nIf the necessary steps to adapt the delegated or implementing acts have not been taken, the Commission may, at the request of the Member State which granted the approval, authorise, by means of a decision in the form of an implementing act adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 73(2), the Member State to extend the type-approval.\nCHAPTER X\nVEHICLES PRODUCED IN SMALL SERIES\nArticle 42\nNational type-approval of small series\n1.   The manufacturer may apply for a national type-approval of small series of a type of vehicle within the quantitative annual limits set out in Annex III. These limits shall apply to the making available on the market, registration or entry into service of vehicles of the approved type on the market of each Member State in a given year.\n2.   For the type of vehicles referred to in paragraph 1, Member States may waive one or more of the substantive requirements laid down in one or more of the delegated acts listed in Annex II, provided that they lay down relevant alternative requirements.\n‘Alternative requirements’ means administrative provisions and technical requirements which aim to ensure a level of functional safety, environmental protection and occupational safety which is equivalent to the greatest extent practicable to the level provided for by one or more of the delegated acts listed in Annex II.\nFor the type of vehicles referred to in paragraph 1, Member States may waive one or more of the administrative provisions of this Regulation or of the implementing acts adopted pursuant to this Regulation.\nA Member State shall only waive the provisions referred to in this paragraph if it has reasonable grounds for doing so.\n3.   For the national type-approval of vehicles under this Article, systems, components or separate technical units which are type-approved in accordance with the acts listed in Annex II shall be accepted.\n4.   The type-approval certificate for vehicles type-approved in accordance with this Article shall be drafted in accordance with the template referred to in Article 30(2), but shall not bear the heading ‘EU vehicle type-approval certificate’ and shall specify the content of the waivers granted pursuant to paragraph 2. Type-approval certificates shall be numbered in accordance with the harmonised system referred to in Article 29(4).\n5.   The type-approval certificate shall specify the nature of the waivers granted pursuant to the first and third subparagraphs of paragraph 2.\n6.   The validity of a national type-approval of small series shall be restricted to the territory of the Member State whose approval authority granted the approval.\n7.   However, at the request of the manufacturer, a copy of the type-approval certificate and its attachments shall be sent by registered mail or by electronic mail to the approval authorities of the Member States designated by the manufacturer.\n8.   Within three months of receipt of the request referred to in paragraph 7, the approval authorities of the Member States designated by the manufacturer shall decide whether or not they accept the type-approval. They shall formally communicate their decision to the approval authority which granted the national type-approval of small series.\n9.   The approval authorities of the Member States shall accept the national type-approval unless they have reasonable grounds to believe that the national technical requirements in accordance with which the vehicle was approved are not equivalent to their own.\n10.   At the request of an applicant who wishes to place on the market or register a vehicle with national type-approval of small series in another Member State, the approval authority that granted the national type-approval of small series shall provide the national authority of the other Member State with a copy of the type-approval certificate including the information package. Paragraphs 8 and 9 shall apply.\nCHAPTER XI\nMAKING AVAILABLE ON THE MARKET, REGISTRATION OR ENTRY INTO SERVICE\nArticle 43\nMaking available on the market, registration or entry into service of vehicles\nWithout prejudice to Articles 46 and 47, vehicles for which EU whole-vehicle type-approval is mandatory or for which the manufacturer has obtained such type-approval under this Regulation shall only be made available on the market, registered or enter into service if they are accompanied by a valid certificate of conformity issued in accordance with Article 38.\nWhere such vehicles are incomplete, making available on the market or entry into service of such vehicles is permitted, but the authorities responsible for vehicle registration of the Member States may refuse to allow the registration and use on the road of such vehicles.\nArticle 44\nMaking available on the market, registration or entry into service of end-of-series vehicles\n1.   Subject to the end-of-series limits and time limit specified in paragraphs 2 and 4, vehicles conforming to a type of vehicle whose EU type-approval has become invalid pursuant to Article 37 may be made available on the market, registered or entered into service.\nThe first subparagraph shall apply only to vehicles within the territory of the Union which were covered by a valid EU type-approval at the time of their production, but which had neither been made available on the market, registered nor entered into service before that EU type-approval lost its validity.\n2.   Paragraph 1 shall apply, in the case of complete vehicles, for a period of 24 months from the date on which the EU type-approval became invalid and, in the case of completed vehicles, for a period of 30 months from that date.\n3.   A manufacturer who wishes to benefit from paragraph 1 shall submit a request to the national authority of each Member State where the vehicles in question are to be made available on the market, registered or entered into service. That request shall specify any technical or economic reasons preventing those vehicles from complying with the new type-approval requirements.\nThe national authority concerned shall decide, within three months of receiving the request, whether and in what number to permit the registration of those vehicles within their territory.\n4.   The amount of end-of-series vehicles shall not exceed 10 % of the number of vehicles registered in the two preceding years or 100 vehicles per Member State, whichever is higher.\n5.   A special entry qualifying the vehicles as ‘end-of-series’ shall be made on the certificate of conformity of the vehicles put into service under this procedure.\n6.   Member States shall ensure that the number of vehicles to be made available on the market, registered or entered into service under the procedure set out in this Article is effectively monitored.\n7.   This Article shall apply only to discontinuation due to termination of validity of the type-approval in the case referred to in point (a) of Article 37(2).\nArticle 45\nMaking available on the market or entry into service of components and separate technical units\n1.   Components or separate technical units may only be made available on the market or entered into service if they comply with the requirements of the relevant acts listed in Annex II and are properly marked in accordance with Article 39.\n2.   Paragraph 1 shall not apply in the case of components or separate technical units which are specifically constructed or designed for new vehicles not covered by this Regulation.\n3.   By way of derogation from paragraph 1, Member States may permit the making available on the market or entry into service of components or separate technical units which have been exempted from one or more provisions of this Regulation under Article 40 or are intended for mounting on vehicles covered by approvals granted under Article 42 that concern the component or separate technical unit in question.\n4.   By way of derogation from paragraph 1, and unless otherwise provided for in this Regulation or in one of the delegated acts adopted pursuant to this Regulation, Member States may permit the making available on the market or entry into service of components or separate technical units which are intended for mounting on vehicles which, when made available on the market or entered into service, were not required to be type-approved by this Regulation or by Directive 2002/24/EC.\nCHAPTER XII\nSAFEGUARD CLAUSES\nArticle 46\nProcedure for dealing with vehicles, systems, components or separate technical units presenting a serious risk at national level\n1.   Where the market surveillance authorities of one Member State have taken action pursuant to Article 20 of Regulation (EC) No 765/2008, or where they have sufficient reason to believe that a vehicle, system, component or separate technical unit covered by this Regulation presents a serious risk to the health or safety of persons or to other aspects of the protection of public interests covered by this Regulation, the approval authority that granted the approval shall carry out an evaluation in relation to the vehicle, system, component or separate technical unit concerned covering all the requirements laid down in this Regulation. The relevant economic operators shall cooperate fully with the approval and/or market surveillance authorities.\nWhere, in the course of that evaluation, the approval authority that granted the approval finds that the vehicle, system, component or separate technical unit does not comply with the requirements laid down in this Regulation, it shall without delay require the relevant economic operator to take all appropriate corrective action to bring the vehicle, system, component or separate technical unit into compliance with those requirements, to withdraw the vehicle, system, component or separate technical unit from the market, or to recall it within a reasonable period, commensurate with the nature of the risk.\nArticle 21 of Regulation (EC) No 765/2008 shall apply to the measures referred to in the second subparagraph of this paragraph.\n2.   Where the approval authorities consider that non-conformity is not restricted to their national territory, they shall inform the Commission and the other Member States of the results of the evaluation and the action required of the economic operator.\n3.   The economic operator shall ensure that all appropriate corrective action is taken in respect of all non-compliant vehicles, systems, components or separate technical units that it has placed on the market, registered or is responsible for its entry into service in the Union.\n4.   Where the economic operator does not take adequate corrective action within the period referred to in the second subparagraph of paragraph 1, the national authorities shall take all appropriate measures to prohibit or restrict the making available on the market, registration or entry into service of non-compliant vehicles, systems, components or separate technical units on their national market, to withdraw them from that market or to recall them.\n5.   The national authorities shall, without delay, inform the Commission and the other Member States of the measures provided for in paragraph 4.\nThe information provided shall include all available details, in particular the data necessary for the identification of the non-compliant vehicle, system, component or separate technical unit, its origin, the nature of the non-conformity alleged and the risk involved, the nature and duration of the national measures taken, and the arguments put forward by the relevant economic operator. In particular, the approval authorities shall indicate whether the non-conformity is due to either of the following:\n(a)\nfailure of the vehicle, system, component or separate technical unit to meet requirements relating to the health or safety of persons, the protection of the environment or to other aspects of the protection of public interests covered by this Regulation;\n(b)\nshortcomings in the relevant acts listed in Annex II.\n6.   Member States shall within one month inform the Commission and the other Member States of any measures adopted and of any additional information at their disposal relating to the non-conformity of the vehicle, system, component or separate technical unit concerned, and, in the event of disagreement with the notified national measure, of their objections.\n7.   Where, within one month of receipt of the information referred to in paragraph 6 of this Article, an objection has been raised by either another Member State or the Commission in respect of a measure taken by a Member State, that measure shall be evaluated by the Commission in accordance with Article 47.\n8.   Member States shall ensure that appropriate restrictive measures are taken in respect of the vehicle, system, component or separate technical unit concerned, such as withdrawal of the vehicle, system, component or separate technical unit from their market, without delay.\nArticle 47\nUnion safeguard procedure\n1.   Where, during the procedure set out in Article 46(3) and (4), objections are raised against a measure taken by a Member State, or where the Commission considers a national measure to be contrary to the Union legislation, the Commission shall without delay evaluate the national measure after consulting Member States and the relevant economic operator or operators. On the basis of the results of that evaluation, the Commission shall decide, in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 73(2), whether the national measure is considered justified or not.\nThe Commission shall communicate its decision to all Member States and to the relevant economic operator or operators.\n2.   If the national measure is considered justified by the Commission, all Member States shall take the measures necessary to ensure that the non-compliant vehicle, system, component or separate technical unit is withdrawn from their market, and shall inform the Commission accordingly. If the national measure is considered unjustified, the Member State concerned shall withdraw or adapt the measure, in accordance with the decision referred to in paragraph 1.\n3.   Where the national measure is considered justified and is attributed to shortcomings in this Regulation or in delegated or implementing acts adopted pursuant to this Regulation, the Commission shall propose appropriate measures as follows:\n(a)\nwhere delegated or implementing acts adopted pursuant to this Regulation are concerned, the Commission shall propose the necessary amendments to the act concerned;\n(b)\nwhere UNECE regulations are concerned, the Commission shall propose the necessary draft amendments to the relevant UNECE regulations in accordance with the procedure applicable under the Revised 1958 Agreement.\nArticle 48\nCompliant vehicles, systems, components or separate technical units that present a serious risk\n1.   Where, having performed an evaluation under Article 46(1), a Member State finds that vehicles, systems, components or separate technical units, although they comply with the applicable requirements or are properly marked, present a serious risk to safety or may seriously harm the environment or public health, it shall require the relevant economic operator to take all appropriate measures to ensure that the vehicle, system, component or separate technical unit concerned, when placed on the market, registered or after its entry into service, no longer presents that risk, to withdraw the vehicle, system, component or separate technical unit from the market or to recall it within a reasonable period, commensurate with the nature of the risk. The Member State may refuse to register such vehicles until the vehicle manufacturer has taken all appropriate measures.\n2.   For a vehicle, system, component or separate technical unit as referred to in paragraph 1, the economic operator shall ensure that corrective action is taken in respect of all such vehicles, systems, components or separate technical units placed on the market, registered or entered into service in the Union.\n3.   The Member State referred to in paragraph 1 shall within one month inform the Commission and the other Member States of all available details, in particular the data necessary for the identification of the vehicle, system, component or separate technical unit concerned, the origin and the supply chain of the vehicle, system, component or separate technical unit, the nature of the risk involved and the nature and duration of the national measures taken.\n4.   The Commission shall, without delay, consult the Member States and the relevant economic operator or operators and, in particular, the approval authority that granted the type-approval, and shall evaluate the national measure taken. On the basis of that evaluation, the Commission shall decide whether the national measure referred to in paragraph 1 is considered justified or not, and where necessary, propose appropriate measures.\n5.   The Commission shall address its decision to all Member States and shall immediately communicate it to them and the relevant economic operator or operators.\nArticle 49\nVehicles, systems, components or separate technical units not in conformity with the approved type\n1.   Where new vehicles, systems, components or separate technical units accompanied by a certificate of conformity or bearing an approval mark do not conform to the approved type, the approval authority which granted the EU type-approval shall take the necessary measures, including the withdrawal of type-approval, to ensure that vehicles, systems, components or separate technical units in production are brought into conformity with the approved type.\n2.   For the purposes of paragraph 1, deviations from the particulars in the EU type-approval certificate or the information package shall be deemed to constitute failure to conform to the approved type.\n3.   If an approval authority demonstrates that new vehicles, components or separate technical units accompanied by a certificate of conformity or bearing an approval mark issued in another Member State do not conform to the approved type, it may ask the approval authority which granted the EU type-approval to verify that vehicles, systems, components or separate technical units in production continue to conform to the approved type. On receipt of such a request, the approval authority which granted the EU type-approval shall take the requisite action as soon as possible and at the latest within three months of the date of the request.\n4.   The approval authority shall request the approval authority which granted the EU type-approval for a system, component, separate technical unit or incomplete vehicle to take the necessary action to ensure that vehicles in production are brought back into conformity with the approved type in the following cases:\n(a)\nfor an EU vehicle type-approval, where the non-conformity of a vehicle is attributable exclusively to the non-conformity of a system, component or separate technical unit;\n(b)\nfor a multi-stage type-approval, where the non-conformity of a completed vehicle is attributable exclusively to the non-conformity of a system, component or separate technical unit that forms part of the incomplete vehicle or to the non-conformity of the incomplete vehicle itself.\n5.   On receipt of such a request, the approval authority concerned shall take the necessary action, if necessary in conjunction with the approval authority making the request, as soon as possible and at the latest within three months of the date of the request.\n6.   Where non-conformity is established, the approval authority of the Member State that granted the EU type-approval for the system, component or separate technical unit or for the incomplete vehicle shall take the measures set out in paragraph 1.\nThe approval authorities shall inform each other within one month of any withdrawal of EU type-approval and of the reasons therefor.\n7.   If the approval authority that granted the EU type-approval disputes the non-conformity notified to it, the Member States concerned shall endeavour to settle the dispute. The Commission shall be kept informed and, where necessary, shall hold appropriate consultations with a view to reaching a settlement.\nArticle 50\nPlacing on the market and entry into service of parts or equipment that may pose a serious risk to the correct functioning of essential systems\n1.   Parts or equipment that may pose a serious risk to the correct functioning of systems that are essential for the safety of the vehicle or for its environmental performance shall not be placed on the market, registered or enter into service and shall be prohibited, unless they have been authorised by an approval authority in accordance with Article 51(1) and (4).\n2.   In order to ensure the uniform application of paragraph 1, the Commission may adopt implementing acts to draw up a list of such parts or equipment on the basis of available information, and in particular information communicated by the Member States, regarding:\n(a)\nthe seriousness of the risk to the safety or environmental performance of vehicles fitted with the parts or equipment in question;\n(b)\nthe possible effect on consumers and after-market manufacturers of the imposition under this Article of a possible authorisation requirement for parts or equipment.\nThose implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 73(2).\n3.   Paragraph 1 shall not apply to original parts or equipment and to parts or equipment that are type-approved in accordance with any of the acts listed in Annex II, except where the approval relates to aspects other than those covered in paragraph 1.\nParagraph 1 shall not apply to parts or equipment exclusively produced for racing vehicles not intended for use on public roads. If parts or equipment included in a list established by an implementing act referred to in paragraph 2 have a dual use for racing and on the road, these parts or equipment may not be made available to the general public for use in on-road vehicles unless they comply with the requirements of this Article. Where appropriate, the Commission shall adopt provisions for identifying the parts or equipment referred to in this paragraph.\n4.   The Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 75 concerning the requirements which the parts and equipment referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article shall fulfil.\nThese requirements may be based on the acts listed in Annex II or may consist of a comparison of the parts or equipment with the environmental or safety performance of the original vehicle, or of any of its parts, as appropriate. In either case the requirements shall ensure that the parts or equipment do not impair the functioning of those systems that are essential for the safety of the vehicle or its environmental performance.\nArticle 51\nParts or equipment that may pose a serious risk to the correct functioning of essential systems — related requirements\n1.   For the purposes of Article 50(1), the manufacturer of parts or equipment shall submit to the approval authority an application accompanied by a test report drafted by a designated technical service which certifies that the parts or equipment for which authorisation is sought comply with the requirements referred to in Article 50(4). The manufacturer may submit only one application per type of part to only one approval authority.\nIf so requested by the competent authority of another Member State, the approval authority which has given the authorisation shall, within one month of receiving that request, send to the former a copy of the requested authorisation certificate together with the attachments by means of a common secure electronic exchange system. The copy may also take the form of a secure electronic file.\n2.   The application shall include details of the manufacturer of parts or equipment, the type, identification and part numbers of the parts or equipment, the vehicle manufacturer’s name, type of vehicle and, if appropriate, year of construction or any other information permitting the identification of the vehicle to which the parts or equipment are to be fitted.\nWhen the approval authority is satisfied, taking account of the test report and other evidence, that the parts or equipment in question comply with the requirements referred to in Article 50(4), it shall authorise the parts or equipment to be placed on the market and to be entered into service subject to the second subparagraph of paragraph 4 of this Article.\nThe approval authority shall issue a certificate to the manufacturer without delay.\n3.   The Commission may adopt implementing acts in order to lay down a template and numbering system for the certificate referred to in the third subparagraph of paragraph 2 of this Article. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 73(2).\n4.   The manufacturer shall inform without delay the approval authority that gave the authorisation of any change affecting the conditions under which it was issued. That approval authority shall decide whether the authorisation has to be reviewed or reissued and whether further tests are necessary.\nThe manufacturer shall be responsible for ensuring that the parts or equipment are produced and continue to be produced under the conditions under which the authorisation was issued.\n5.   Before delivering any authorisation, the approval authority shall verify the existence of satisfactory arrangements and procedures for ensuring effective control of the conformity of production.\nWhere the approval authority finds that the conditions for issuing the authorisation are no longer fulfilled, it shall request the manufacturer to take the necessary measures to ensure that the parts or equipment are brought back into conformity. If necessary, it shall withdraw the authorisation.\n6.   Approval authorities from different Member States shall bring any disagreement in relation to the authorisation referred to in the second subparagraph of paragraph 2 to the attention of the Commission. The Commission shall take the appropriate measures in order to resolve the disagreement, including, where necessary, requiring the withdrawal of the authorisation, after having consulted the approval authorities.\n7.   Until the list referred to in Article 50(2) has been established, Member States may maintain national provisions dealing with parts or equipment which may affect the correct functioning of systems essential for the safety of the vehicle or its environmental performance.\nArticle 52\nRecall of vehicles, systems, components or separate technical units\n1.   Where a manufacturer who has been granted an EU whole-vehicle type-approval is obliged, in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 765/2008, to recall vehicles placed on the market, registered or for which the manufacturer was responsible for the entry into service, because a system, component or separate technical unit fitted to the vehicle presents a serious risk to safety, public health or environmental protection, whether or not duly approved in accordance with this Regulation, or because a part not subject to any specific requirements under type-approval legislation presents a serious risk to safety, public health or environmental protection, that manufacturer shall immediately inform the approval authority that granted the vehicle approval.\n2.   Where a manufacturer of systems, components or separate technical units, who has been granted an EU type-approval is obliged, in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 765/2008, to recall systems, components or separate technical units which have been placed on the market or for which the manufacturer was responsible for the entry into service because they present a serious risk to safety, occupational safety, public health or environmental protection, whether or not duly approved in accordance with this Regulation, the manufacturer shall immediately inform the approval authority that granted the approval.\n3.   The manufacturer shall propose to the approval authority a set of appropriate remedies to neutralise the serious risk referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2. The approval authority shall communicate the proposed remedies to the approval authorities of the other Member States without delay.\nThe approval authorities shall ensure that the remedies are effectively implemented in their respective Member States.\n4.   If the remedies are considered to be insufficient or not implemented quickly enough by the approval authority concerned, it shall inform the approval authority that granted the EU type-approval without delay.\nThe approval authority that granted the EU type-approval shall then inform the manufacturer. If the manufacturer does not propose and implement effective corrective measures, the approval authority which granted the EU type-approval shall take all protective measures required, including the withdrawal of the EU type-approval. In the case of withdrawal of the EU type-approval, the approval authority shall within one month of such withdrawal notify the manufacturer, the approval authorities of the other Member States and the Commission by registered letter or equivalent electronic means.\nArticle 53\nNotification of decisions and remedies available\n1.   All decisions taken pursuant to this Regulation and all decisions refusing or withdrawing EU type-approval, refusing registration, prohibiting or restricting the placing on the market, registration or entry into service of a vehicle or requiring withdrawal of a vehicle from the market shall state in detail the reasons on which they are based.\n2.   Any such decision shall be notified to the party concerned, who shall, at the same time, be informed of the remedies available to it under the laws in force in the Member State concerned and of the time limits allowed for the exercise of such remedies.\nCHAPTER XIII\nINTERNATIONAL REGULATIONS\nArticle 54\nUNECE regulations required for EU type-approval\n1.

Once a vehicle complies with a comprehensive set of requirements, a vehicle type may be sold on the EU market.\nThe manufacturer must deliver a conformity certificate with each vehicle; this allows the owner to register the vehicle.\nFunctional safety requirements\nThe regulation lays down safety requirements such as:\nnew motorcycles of more than 125 cm3 must be equipped with an anti-lock braking system;\non a 2-wheeled motorcycle under 125 cm3, the fitting of an anti-lock brake system, a combined brake system or both is left to the manufacturer’s discretion;\nfor better visibility: from July 2014, all new types of L-category vehicles must be fitted with a mechanism that automatically turns on the lights,from 1 January 2016, all existing types of these vehicles must also comply;\nthe mandatory fitting of a differential (which allows wheels on the same axle to turn at different rates) on quads and other types of 3- and 4-wheeled L-category vehicles to ensure they can turn corners safely.\nEnvironmental performance requirements\nTo get type approval, an L-category vehicle has to comply with 8 different test types, such as for evaporative emissions (fuel vapours), pollution control devices, energy efficiency and sound.\nThe regulation sets out environmental requirements for 2 stages of emission reductions. The first stage (Euro 4) is mandatory for new types of vehicles from 1 January 2016. A second stage (Euro 5) has applied since 2020, allowing manufacturers and suppliers to plan for the medium term.\nObligations on manufacturers, their representatives, importers and distributors\nThe regulation sets out the obligations of all those involved in the supply chain:\nwhere a vehicle presents a serious risk for users or the environment, the manufacturer or other parties in the supply chain must take effective protective measures, including a recall of vehicles if necessary;\nmanufacturers must provide unrestricted access to on-board diagnostics using a standardised connector and to vehicle repair and maintenance information through websites to authorised dealers and repairers, as well as to independent operators. This does not apply to ‘small-series’ vehicles.\nDelegated and implementing acts\nThe European Commission has adopted delegated acts to supplement Regulation (EU) No 168/2013:\nDelegated Regulation (EU) No 3/2014 lays down the detailed technical requirements and test procedures regarding functional safety for the approval and market surveillance of L-category vehicles and the systems, components and separate technical units intended for such vehicles. It was amended by Delegated Regulation (EU) 2016/1824 to adapt it to technical progress.\nDelegated Regulation (EU) No 134/2014 on environmental and propulsion unit performance requirements and amending Annex V of Regulation (EU) No 168/2013. This regulation has been amended by Delegated Regulation (EU) 2016/1824 and by Delegated Regulation (EU) 2018/295. to improve the technical requirements and test procedures and adapt them to technical progress.\nThe Commission also adopted Implementing Regulation (EU) No 901/2014 on the administrative requirements for the approval and market surveillance of two- or three-wheel vehicles and quadricycles. This implementing act has since been amended by Implementing Regulation (EU) 2016/1825 and Implementing Regulation (EU) 2020/239.\nRepeal of previous legislation\nRegulation (EU) No 168/2013 repeals and replaces Directive 2002/24/EC from 1 January 2016.\nFROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?\n              \nIt has applied since 1 January 2016.\nBACKGROUND\n              \nFor more information, see:\nAutomotive industry (European Commission).\nKEY TERMS\n              \nL-category vehicles: a family of light powered vehicles such as powered cycles, 2- and 3-wheeled mopeds, motorcycles (with and without side cars), tricycles and quadricycles.\nMAIN DOCUMENT\n            \nRegulation (EU) No 168/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 January 2013 on the approval and market surveillance of two- or three-wheel vehicles and quadricycles (OJ L 60, 2.3.2013, pp. 52-128)\nSuccessive amendments to Regulation (EU) No 168/2013 have been incorporated in the original text.
