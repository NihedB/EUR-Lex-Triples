For reasons of clarity and rationality the said Directive should be consolidated.(2) The production of oil and fibre plants occupies an important place in the agriculture of the Community.(3) Satisfactory results in the cultivation of oil and fibre plants depend to a large extent on the use of appropriate seed.(4) Greater productivity will be achieved in the cultivation of oil and fibre plants within the Community if for the choice of the varieties permitted to be marketed the Member States apply uniform rules which are as strict as possible. A common catalogue of varieties of agricultural plant species is therefore provided in the Council Directive 2002/53/EC(4).(5) It is desirable to establish a uniform certification scheme for the Community based on the experience gained in the application of schemes in the Member States and those of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development. In the context of the consolidation of the internal market, the Community scheme should cover the production of seed with a view to marketing and to marketing within the Community, and should offer no possibilities for the Member States to derogate unilaterally from the scheme in a way that would hinder the free movement of seed within the Community.(6) As a general rule, seed of oil and fibre plants should be allowed to be marketed only if it has been officially examined and certified, in accordance with the rules for certification, as basic seed or certified seed. The choice of the technical terms \"basic seed\" and \"certified seed\" is based on already existing international terminology. It should be possible under specific conditions to place on the market bred seed of generations prior to basic seed and seed as grown.(7) Community rules should not apply to seed shown to be intended for export to third countries.(8) In order to improve not only the genetic quality of Community seed of oil and fibre plants but also its external characteristics, certain requirements should be laid down as to analytical purity and germination.(9) In order to ensure the identity of the seed, Community rules on packaging, sampling, sealing and marking must be established. To this end the labels should give the particulars needed both for official verification and for the information of the user and should clearly show the Community nature of the certification of the certified seed of the various categories.(10) Rules for the marketing of chemically treated seed, seeds suitable for organic growing as well as for the conservation by use in situ of varieties threatened with genetic erosion, should be introduced.(11) Derogations must be permitted under certain conditions, without prejudice to the provisions of Article 14 of the Treaty. Member States making use of the derogations must mutually assist each other as regards inspection.(12) In order to ensure that both the requirements as to the quality of the seed and the provisions for ensuring its identity are complied with during marketing, Member States must make provision for appropriate control arrangements.(13) Seed, satisfying these requirements, should, without prejudice to Article 30 of the Treaty, be subject to no marketing restrictions other than those provided for in Community rules.(14) Subject to certain conditions, seed multiplied in another country from basic seed certified in a Member State should be certified as seed multiplied in that Member State.(15) Provision should be made for authorising the marketing within the Community of seed of oil and fibre plants, which has been harvested in third countries, only if such seed affords the same assurances as seed officially certified, or officially approved as commercial seed, within the Community and complying with Community rules.(16) During periods in which there are difficulties in obtaining supplies of certified seed of the various categories, seed of an inferior quality should temporarily be permitted to be marketed, and also seeds of varieties not included either in the common catalogue or in the national catalogue of varieties.(17) In order to harmonise the technical methods of certification used in the Member States and to enable comparisons to be made between seed certified within the Community and that coming from third countries, Community comparative tests should be established in Member States to permit annual post-control of seed of the various categories of \"certified seed\".(18) It is desirable to organise temporary experiments for the purpose of seeking improved alternatives to certain provisions set out in this Directive.(19) If certain species of seed are not normally reproduced or marketed in the territory of a Member State, provision should be made for release of that Member State, under the procedure of the Standing Committee on Seeds and Propagating Material for Agriculture, Horticulture and Forestry, from the obligation to apply this Directive in respect of the species in question.(20) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Directive should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission(5).(21) This Directive must not affect the obligations of the Member States concerning the deadlines for transposition of the Directives set out in Annex VI, part B,HAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:Article 1This Directive shall apply to the production with a view to marketing, and to the marketing within the Community, of seed of oil and fibre plants intended for agricultural production but not for ornamental purposes.It shall not apply to seed of oil and fibre plants which is shown to be intended for export to third countries.Article 21.

(partim) - flax, linseedmay not be placed on the market unless it has been officially certified as \"basic seed\" or \"certified seed\".2. Member States shall provide that seed of oil and fibre plant species other than those listed in paragraph 1 may not be placed on the market unless the seed has been officially certified as \"basic seed\" or \"certified seed\", or is commercial seed.3. It may be provided, under the procedure laid down in Article 25(2), that after specified dates seed of oil and fibre plant species other than those listed in paragraph 1 may not be placed on the market unless it has been officially certified as \"basic seed\" or \"certified seed\".4. Member States shall ensure that official examinations are carried out in accordance with current international methods, in so far as such methods exist.Article 4Notwithstanding Article 3(1) and (2), Member States shall provide that:- bred seed of generations prior to basic seed, and- seed as grown, marketed for processing, provided that the identity of the seed is ensured,may be placed on the market.Article 5Member States may, by way of derogation from the provisions of Article 3:(a) authorise the official certification and marketing of basic seed which does not satisfy the conditions laid down in Annex II in respect of germination; to this end all necessary measures shall be taken to ensure that the supplier guarantees a specific germination which he shall state for marketing purposes on a special label bearing his name and address and the reference number of the seed lot;(b) in order to make seed rapidly available, notwithstanding the fact that official examination to check compliance with the conditions laid down in Annex II in respect of germination has not been concluded, authorise the official certification or approval and marketing as far as the first buyer by way of trade of seed of the categories \"basic seed\", \"certified seed\" of all categories or \"commercial seed\". Certification or approval shall be granted only on presentation of a provisional analytical report on the seed and provided that the name and address of the first recipient are given; all necessary measures shall be taken to ensure that the supplier guarantees the germination ascertained at the provisional analysis; this germination shall be stated for marketing purposes on a special label bearing the name and address of the supplier and the reference number of the lot.These provisions shall not apply to seed imported from third countries, save as otherwise provided in Article 18 in respect of multiplication outside the Community.Member States making use of the derogation provided for in either point (a) or (b) shall assist each other administratively as regards inspection.Article 61. Notwithstanding Article 3(1) and (2), Member States may authorise procedures in their own territory to place on the market:(a) small quantities of seed for scientific purposes or selection work;(b) appropriate quantities of seed for other test or trial purposes, provided it belongs to varieties for which an application for entry in the catalogue has been submitted in the Member State in question.In the case of genetically modified material, such authorisation may be granted only if all appropriate measures have been taken to avoid adverse effects on human health and the environment. For the environmental risk assessment to be carried out in this respect, the provisions of Article 7(4) of Directive 2002/53/EC shall apply accordingly.2. The purposes for which the authorisations referred to in paragraph 1(b) may be given, the provisions relating to the marking of packages, and the quantities and the conditions under which Member States may grant such authorisation, shall be determined in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 25(2).3. Authorisations granted before 14 December 1998 by Member States to producers in their own territory for the purposes set out in paragraph 1 shall remain in force pending determination of the provisions referred to in paragraph 2. Thereafter, all such authorisations shall respect the provisions established in accordance with paragraph 2.Article 7Member States may, as regards the conditions laid down in Annexes I and II, impose additional or more stringent requirements for the certification of seed and also for the examination of commercial seed which is produced in their own territory.Article 8Member States shall provide that the description of genealogical components which may be required is, if the breeder so requests, treated as confidential.Article 91. Member States shall require that, for the checking of varieties, the examination of seed for certification and the examination of commercial seed, samples are drawn under official supervision in accordance with appropriate methods.2. For the examination of seed for certification and the examination of commercial seed, samples shall be drawn from homogeneous lots; the maximum weight of a lot and the minimum weight of a sample are given in Annex III.Article 101. Member States shall require that basic seed, certified seed of all categories and commercial seed be marketed only in sufficiently homogeneous consignments and in sealed packages bearing, as prescribed in Articles 11 and 12, a sealing system and markings.2.

When a label with a string-hole is used, its attachment shall be ensured in all cases with an official seal. If, in cases under Article 5(a), the basic seed does not satisfy the conditions laid down in Annex II in respect of germination, this fact shall be stated on the label. The use of official adhesive labels shall be authorised. In accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 25(2) the indelible printing under official supervision of the information on the package according to the label's model may be authorised;(b) contain an official document, in the same colour as the label, giving at least the information required under Annex IV(A)(a)(4), (5) and (6) and in the case of commercial seed, under (b) (2), (5) and (6). This document shall be drawn up in such a manner that it cannot be confused with the official label referred to under (a). This document is not necessary if the information is printed indelibly on the package or if, in accordance with the provisions under (a), an adhesive label or a label of non-tear material is used.2. Member States may provide for exceptions to paragraph 1 in the case of small packages sealed on their own territory. Conditions relating to these exceptions may be determined in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 25(2).3. This Directive shall not affect the right of Member States to require that seed of oil and fibre plants which is shown to be intended for purposes other than agricultural production may not be placed on the market unless this fact is stated on the label.Article 13In accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 25(2), it may be provided that Member States may require that, in cases other than those provided for in this Directive, packages of basic seed, certified seed of all categories or commercial seed shall bear a supplier's label (which may either be a label separate from the official label or take the form of suppliers' information printed on the package itself).

The extent of that release shall be defined with reference to the provisions to which it applies. The duration of an experiment shall not exceed seven years.Article 17Member States shall ensure that seed which is placed on the market under the provisions of this Directive, whether mandatory or discretionary, is not subject to any marketing restrictions as regards its characteristics, examination requirements, marking and sealing other than those laid down in this or any other Directive.Article 18The conditions under which bred seed of generations prior to basic seed may be placed on the market under the first indent of Article 4, shall be as follows:(a) it must have been officially inspected by the competent certification authority in accordance with the provisions applicable to the certification of basic seed;(b) it must be packed in accordance with this Directive; and(c) the packages must bear an official label giving at least the following particulars:- certification authority and Member State or their distinguishing abbreviation,- lot reference number,- month and year of sealing, or- month and year of the last official sampling for the purposes of certification,- species, indicated at least under its botanical name, which may be given in abridged form and without the authors' names, in roman characters,- variety, indicated at least in roman characters,- the description \"pre-basic seed\",- number of generations preceding seed of the categories \"certified seed\", or \"certified seed of the first generation\".The label shall be white with a diagonal violet line.Article 191. Member States shall provide that seed of oil and fibre plants- which has been produced directly from basic seed or certified seed of the first generation officially certified either in one or more Member States or in a third country which has been granted equivalence under Article 20(b), or which has been produced directly from the crossing of basic seed officially certified in a Member State with basic seed officially certified in such a third country, and- which has been harvested in another Member State,shall, on request and without prejudice to the provisions of Directive 2002/53/EC, be officially certified as certified seed in any Member State if that seed has undergone field inspection satisfying the conditions laid down in Annex I for the relevant category and if official examination has shown that the conditions laid down in Annex II for the same category are satisfied.Where in such cases the seed has been produced directly from officially certified seed of generations prior to basic seed, Member States may also authorise official certification as basic seed, if the conditions laid down for that category are satisfied.2. Seed of oil and fibre plants which has been harvested in the Community and which is intended for certification in accordance with paragraph 1 shall:- be packed and labelled with an official label satisfying the conditions laid down in Annex V(A) and (B), in accordance with Article 11(1); and- be accompanied by an official document satisfying the conditions laid down in Annex V(C).The provisions in the first subparagraph on packing and labelling may be waived if the authorities responsible for field inspection, those drawing up the documents for the certification of seeds which have not been definitively certified and those responsible for certification are the same, or if they agree on exemption.3. Member States shall also provide that seed of oil and fibre plants- which has been produced directly from basic seed or certified seed of the first generation officially certified either in one or more Member States or in a third country which has been granted equivalence under Article 20(b), or which has been produced directly from the crossing of basic seed officially certified in a Member State with basic seed officially certified in such a third country, and- which has been harvested in a third country,shall, on request, be officially certified as certified seed in any of those Member States where the basic seed was either produced or officially certified, if the seed has undergone field inspection satisfying the conditions laid down in an equivalence decision made under Article 20(a) for the relevant category and if official examination has shown that the conditions laid down in Annex II for the same category are satisfied. Other Member States may also authorise official certification of such seed.Article 201. The Council, acting by a qualified majority on a proposal from the Commission, shall determine whether:(a) in the case provided for in Article 18, the field inspections in the third country satisfy the conditions laid down in Annex I;(b) seed of oil and fibre plants which has been harvested in a third country and affords the same assurances as regards its characteristics and the arrangements for its examination, for ensuring its identity, for marking and for control is equivalent in these respects to basic seed, certified seed, certified seed of the first, second or third generation or commercial seed harvested within the Community and complying with the provisions of this Directive.2. Paragraph 1 shall also apply in respect of any new Member State from the date of its accession to the date on which it is to bring into force the laws, regulations or administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive.Article 211. In order to remove any temporary difficulties in the general supply of basic or certified seed that occur in the Community and cannot be otherwise overcome, it may be decided in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 25(2) that Member States shall permit, for a specified period, the marketing throughout the Community in quantities necessary to resolve the supply difficulties of seed of a category subject to less stringent requirements, or of seed of a variety not included in the Common Catalogue of Varieties of Agricultural Plant Species or in the national catalogue of varieties of the Member States.2. For a category of seed of any given variety, the official label shall be that provided for the corresponding category; for seed of varieties not included in the abovementioned catalogues the official label shall be that provided for commercial seed. The label shall always state that the seed in question is of a category satisfying less stringent requirements.3. Rules for the application of paragraph 1 may be adopted in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 25(2).Article 221. Member States shall ensure that official inspections are carried out in relation to the marketing of seed of oil and fibre plants, at least by random checks, to verify compliance with the requirements of this Directive.2. Without prejudice to the free movement of seed within the Community, Member States shall take all necessary measures to ensure that they are supplied with the following particulars during the marketing of quantities exceeding two kilograms of seed imported from third countries:(a) species;(b) variety;(c) category;(d) country of production and official inspection authority;(e) country of dispatch;(f) importer;(g) quantity of seed.The manner in which these particulars are to be presented may be determined in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 25(2).Article 231. Community comparative tests shall be carried out within the Community for the post-control of samples of basic seed, with the exception of that of hybrid or synthetic varieties, and of certified seed of all categories of oil and fibre plants, taken during sampling. Satisfaction of the conditions with which the seed must comply may be checked during the post-control tests. The arrangements for holding the tests and their results shall be submitted to the Committee referred to in Article 25(1).2. These comparative tests shall be used to harmonise the technical methods of certification so as to obtain results which are equivalent. As soon as this aim is achieved, annual progress reports shall be made on these tests and sent in confidence to the Member States and to the Commission. The Commission shall, in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 25(2), set the date for the first report.3. The Commission, acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 25(2), shall make the necessary arrangements for the comparative tests to be carried out. Seed of oil and fibre plants harvested in third countries may be included in the comparative tests.Article 24Amendments to be made to the content of the Annexes in the light of the development of scientific or technical knowledge shall be adopted according to the procedure referred to in Article 25(2).Article 251.

Distinct (D): the variety is clearly distinguishable from any other variety known in the EU, and is capable of precise recognition and definition.Uniform (U): apart from very few aberrations, the plants are similar or genetically identical. andStable (S): after successive propagations, the plant remains true to the description of its essential characteristics.\nThe variety needs to be tested in the field to fulfil the criteria on DUS and must be of satisfactory value for cultivation and use.\nVariety registration is valid for 10 years but may be revoked if, on examination, the variety no longer meets these criteria. Varieties coming from other EU countries are subject to the same requirements as those applying to domestic varieties.\nEU countries must require that the acceptance of varieties be based on the results of official examinations, particularly growing trials, covering a sufficient number of characteristics for the variety to be described. The methods used for determining characteristics must be exact and reliable. To establish distinctness, the growing trials must include at least the available comparable varieties which are varieties known in the EU.\nGenetically modified varieties that have been accepted under Directive 2001/18/EC (see summary) must be indicated as such.\nFor each newly accepted variety, EU countries must send a brief description to the other EU countries and to the European Commission of the variety’s most important characteristics for use.\nFodder plant seed (Directive 66/401/EEC)\nThis directive covers various grasses, legumes, clover, vetch, swede and kale, as identified in the legislation. Seeds may not be placed on the market unless they have been officially certified or certified under official supervision as pre-basic seeds (the generation before basic seeds), basic seeds or certified seeds (see Article 2 of the directive, where these categories are defined). Some plant species can, under certain conditions, also be marketed as commercial seeds. This does not apply to fodder plant seeds intended for export to non-EU countries.\nThe seeds must conform to standards regarding identity, health and quality (germination, analytical purity and content of seeds of other plant species).\nCereal seed (Directive 66/402/EEC)\nCereal seeds may not be placed on the market unless they have been officially certified or certified under official supervision as pre-basic seeds, basic seeds or certified seeds (either first or second generation) and satisfy the other general conditions.\nSeeds must meet criteria such as identity, health and quality (minimum germination, minimum analytical purity and maximum content by number of seeds of other plant species, including red seeds of rice and the presence of fungus in samples).\nSeed of oil and fibre plants (Directive 2002/57/EC)\nThis covers seeds for agricultural production but not for ornamental purposes. Only seeds officially certified or certified under official supervision as pre-basic seeds, basic seeds, certified seeds or commercial seeds (see Article 2 of the directive, where these categories are defined) may be marketed, with the exception of turnip, colza, cannabis, caraway, cotton, safflower, sunflower, flax and linseed, which cannot be marketed as commercial seeds.\nSeeds must meet criteria such as identity, health and quality.\nSeed potatoes (Directive 2002/56/EC)\nEU countries can only market seed potatoes that fulfil the criteria in this directive. Seed potatoes are officially certified as basic seed potatoes or certified seed potatoes satisfying minimum conditions for each category (see Article 2 of the directive, where these categories are defined) during plant inspections.\nSeed potatoes on the market should:\nmeet minimum quality conditions such as freedom from blackleg and virus infection;\nbe within specific limits for certain impurities, blemishes and diseases allowed in seed potato lots, including earth and extraneous matter;\nbe within tolerance levels, such as for rot, blemishes and scab;\nnot be treated with sprout inhibitors;\nhave a minimum size such that they do not pass through a square mesh of 25 × 25 mm;\nnot vary in size, within a lot, beyond a set formula.\nThere should be no more than four generations of basic potatoes and two generations of certified seed potatoes.\nBeet (Directive 2002/54/EC)\nThis refers to sugar and fodder beet of the species Beta vulgaris L.\nBeet seeds must generally not be placed on the market unless officially certified or certified under official supervision as pre-basic seeds, basic seeds or certified seeds (see Article 2 of the directive, where these categories are defined), and must comply with rules on identity, health and quality.\nMonogerm seeds and multigerm seeds (see Article 2 of the directive, where these categories are defined) must satisfy requirements on identity, health and quality (analytical purity, minimum germination and maximum moisture content rules (for both sugar beet and fodder beet)). Monogerm seeds and precision seeds must also meet targets for the proportion of single seedlings they produce.\nMonogerm seeds and precision seeds must be labelled as such.\nRepealed legislation\nDirective 2002/53/EC repealed and codified Directive 70/457/EEC on the common catalogue of varieties of agricultural plant species.\nDirective 2002/54/EC repealed Directive 66/400/EEC on the marketing of beet seed.\nDirective 2002/56/EC repealed Directive 66/403/EEC on the marketing of seed potatoes.\nDirective 2002/57/EC repealed Directive 69/208/EEC on the marketing of seed of oil and fibre plants.\nFROM WHEN DO THE DIRECTIVES APPLY?\n              \nThey have applied since 9 August 2002, except for Directive 66/401/EEC and Directive 66/402/EEC, which have applied since 15 June 1966.\nBACKGROUND\n              \nVarious implementing acts have been adopted in respect of each of the six directives, and are listed on the European Commission page on specific legislation concerning plant reproductive material.\nFor further information see also:\nPlant reproductive material (European Commission)\nEU marketing requirements (European Commission).\nMAIN DOCUMENTS\n            \nCouncil Directive 2002/53/EC of 13 June 2002 on the common catalogue of varieties of agricultural plant species (OJ L 193, 20.7.2002, pp. 1-11)\nSuccessive amendments to Directive 2002/53/EC have been incorporated into the original text.
