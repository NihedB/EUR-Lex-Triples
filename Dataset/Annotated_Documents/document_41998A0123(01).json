Before any decision is taken on providing information, the communicating authority shall be given the opportunity of stating its position;(f) Member States shall be liable, in accordance with their own laws, regulations and procedures, for injury caused to a person through the processing of data communicated in the Member State concerned. This shall also be the case where the injury was caused by the communication of inaccurate data or the fact that the communicating authority communicated data in violation of the Convention;(g) the data communicated shall be kept for a period not exceeding that necessary for the purposes for which they were communicated.

Re Articles 1(1) and 28With reference to the exceptions to the obligation to provide assistance under Article 28 of the Convention, Italy declares that the execution of mutual assistance requests, on the basis of the Convention, concerning infringements which under Italian law are not infringements of national or community customs provisions, may - for reasons relating to the subdivision of competence among domestic authorities in prevention and prosecution of crimes - harm the public policy or other national essential interests.2. Re Articles 1(2) and 3(2)Denmark and Finland declare that they interpret the term 'judicial authorities` or 'judicial authority` in Articles 1(2) and 3(2) of the Convention in the sense of their declarations made pursuant to Article 24 of the European Convention on mutual assistance in criminal matters, signed in Strasbourg on 20 April 1959.3. Re Article 4(3) second indentDenmark declares, as far as it is concerned, that Article 4(3), second indent, covers only actions by which a person participates in the commission by a group of people, acting toward a common goal, of one or more of the infringements concerned, including situations where the person concerned does not take part in the actual commission of the offence or offences in question; such participation must be based on knowledge of the purpose and general criminal activities of the group, or on knowledge of the group's intention to commit the offence(s) in question.4. Re Article 4(3), third indentDenmark declares, as far as it is concerned, that Article 4(3), third indent, applies only to the predicate offences in respect of which at any time receiving stolen goods is punishable under Danish law, including Section 191a of the Danish criminal Code on receiving stolen drugs and Section 284 of the Criminal Code on receiving goods in connection with smuggling of a particularly aggravated nature.5. Re Article 6(4)Denmark, Finland and Sweden declare that the liaison officers referred to in Article 6(4) may also represent the interests of Norway and Iceland or vice versa. The five Nordic countries have since 1982 had an arrangement whereby the stationed liaison officers from one of the countries involved also represent the other Nordic countries. This arrangement was made in order to strengthen the fight against drug trafficking and to limit the economic burden imposed on individual countries by the stationing of the liaison officers. Denmark, Finland and Sweden attach great importance to the continuation of this arrangement, which operates well.6. Re Article 20(8)Denmark declares that it accepts the provisions of Article 20, subject to the following conditions:In case of a hot pursuit exercised by the customs authorities of another Member State at sea or through the air, such pursuit may be extended to Danish territory, including Danish territorial waters and the airspace above Danish territory and territorial waters, only if the competent Danish authorities have received prior notice thereof.7. Re Article 21(5)Denmark declares that it accepts the provisions of Article 21, subject to the following conditions:Cross-border surveillance without prior authorisation may be carried out only in accordance with Article 21(2) and (3) if there are serious grounds for believing that the persons under observation are involved in one of the infringements referred to in Article 19(2) which could give rise to extradition.8. Re Article 25(2)(i)Member States undertake to keep each other informed in the Council on measures taken to ensure that the commitments referred to in point (i) are observed.9. Declaration made pursuant to Article 26(4)At the time of the signing of this Convention, the following declared that they accepted the jurisdiction of the Court of Justice in accordance with the procedures laid down in Article 26(5):- Ireland in accordance with the procedures laid down in Article 26(5)(a),- the Federal Republic of Germany, the Hellenic Republic, the Italian Republic and the Republic of Austria in accordance with the procedures laid down in Article 26(5)(b).DECLARATION The Federal Republic of Germany, the Italian Republic and the Republic of Austria, reserve the right to make provision in their national law to the effect that, where a question relating to the interpretation of the Convention on mutual assistance and cooperation between customs administrations is raised in a case pending before a national court or tribunal against whose decision there is no judicial remedy under national law, that court or tribunal will be required to refer the matter to the Court of Justice of the European Communities.", "summary": "Close cooperation between EU customs administrations (Naples II Convention)\nClose cooperation between EU customs administrations (Naples II Convention)\nSUMMARY OF:\nConvention on mutual assistance and cooperation between customs administrations\nWHAT IS THE AIM OF THE CONVENTION?\nIt replaces and strengthens the original Naples Convention agreed in 1967.\nIt covers mutual assistance and cooperation between national authorities in prevention, investigation and prosecution of certain infringements of European Union (EU) and national customs rules.\nKEY POINTS\nEU countries’ authorities need to cooperate with each other in order to successfully tackle customs fraud and transnational trafficking, and to prosecute and punish the offenders.\nEU customs include agricultural levies, harmonised excise duties on alcohol, tobacco and mineral oil and turnover tax on imports from non-EU countries. The convention does not cover value added tax.\nThe convention applies to national customs rules including those relating to drugs, weapons and child pornography, as well as non-harmonised excise duties.\nThe convention considers ‘infringements’ in a broad sense, including attempted infringements and all forms of participation, such as instigation and being involved as an accessory, as well as association with a criminal organisation and money laundering.\nMutual assistance between customs authorities is given following a request for information, surveillance, enquiries or notification; or spontaneously, without prior request, including covert surveillance and spontaneous provision of information.\nRequests are normally exchanged between the central coordinating units appointed within each national customs administration.\nRequests are in principle made in writing, giving the reason for the request, the relevant facts and the rules and legislation involved. However, in emergency situations, oral requests are accepted but must be confirmed in writing as soon as possible.\nCustoms administrations must provide each other with the necessary staff and organisational support when cooperating on cross-border issues such as\nhot pursuit — cross-border pursuit of suspects;\ncross-border surveillance;\ncovert investigations;\njoint special investigation teams; and\ncontrolled deliveries — illicit deliveries which are not seized at the border, but are tracked to their final destination.\nCross-border cooperation focuses on illicit drugs, weapons, munitions, explosives, cultural goods, dangerous and toxic waste, nuclear materials and equipment for biological and chemical weapons.\nAdministrative cooperation in related areas\nIn addition to their cooperation under the Naples convention, EU countries’ authorities work closely on aspects as varied as excise duties, organised crime, money laundering, illicit drugs, weapons and shipments of waste. They also cooperate on ensuring there are no breaches in EU customs or agricultural legislation.\nFROM WHEN DOES THE CONVENTION APPLY?\n              \nIt has applied since 23 June 2009.\nMAIN DOCUMENTS\nCouncil Act of 18 December 1997 drawing up, on the basis of Article K3 of the Treaty on European Union, the Convention on mutual assistance and cooperation between customs administrations — Declarations (98/C 24/01) (OJ C 24, 23.1.1998, p. 1)\nConvention drawn up on the basis of Article K.3 of the Treaty on European Union, on mutual assistance and cooperation between customs administrations (OJ C 24, 23.1.1998, pp. 2–22)\nRELATED DOCUMENTS\n            \nCouncil Regulation (EC) No 515/97 of 13 March 1997 on mutual assistance between the administrative authorities of the Member States and cooperation between the latter and the Commission to ensure the correct application of the law on customs and agricultural matters (OJ L 82, 22.3.1997, pp. 1–16)\nSuccessive amendments to Regulation (EC) No 515/97 have been incorporated into the basic text.
