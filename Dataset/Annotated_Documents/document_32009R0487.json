In the interests of clarity and rationality the said Regulation should be codified.\n(2)\nCommon provisions for the application of Article 81(3) of the Treaty should be adopted by way of Regulation or Directive pursuant to Article 83 of the Treaty.

Those exemptions should be granted for a limited period during which air carriers can adapt to a more competitive environment. The Commission, in close liaison with the Member States, should be able to define precisely the scope of those exemptions and the conditions attached to them.\n(6)\nThis Regulation is without prejudice to the application of Article 86 of the Treaty,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nArticle 1\nThis Regulation shall apply to air transport.\nArticle 2\n1.

In this case there must be a transitional period to amend the agreements and concerted practices to which the earlier regulation applied before repeal or amendment.\nLimited duration\nAny such block exemption regulation is adopted for a specified period and applies retroactively to agreements, decisions and concerted practices that existed on the date on which the regulation entered into force.\nInformation and consultation\nBefore adopting a block exemption regulation, the Commission must publish a draft of the proposed regulation and invite all persons and organisations concerned to submit their comments within a reasonable deadline. The Commission must consult the Advisory Committee on Restrictive Practices and Dominant Positions in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1/2003, once before publishing a draft regulation, and again after the public consultation before adopting the regulation (see summary).\nFROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?\n              \nIt has applied since 1 July 2009. Regulation (EC) No 487/2009 codifies and repeals Regulation (EEC) No 3976/87.\nBACKGROUND\n              \nFor more information, see:\nAntitrust (European Commission)\nBlock exemption regulations (European Commission).\nKEY TERMS\n              \nConcerted practices. Practices that are anti-competitive, whether a formal agreement has been concluded between the parties or not.
