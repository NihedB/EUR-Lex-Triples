This Directive, which is the third individual directive within the meaning of Article 16 (1) of Directive 89/391/EEC, lays down minimum requirements for personal protective equipment used by workers at work.\n2.   The provisions of Directive 89/391/EEC are fully applicable to the whole scope referred to in paragraph 1, without prejudice to more restrictive and/or specific provisions contained in this Directive.\nArticle 2\nDefinition\n1.   For the purposes of this Directive, personal protective equipment shall mean all equipment designed to be worn or held by the worker to protect him against one or more hazards likely to endanger his safety and health at work, and any addition or accessory designed to meet this objective.\n2.   The definition in paragraph 1 excludes:\n(a)\nordinary working clothes and uniforms not specifically designed to protect the safety and health of the worker;\n(b)\nequipment used by emergency and rescue services;\n(c)\npersonal protective equipment worn or used by the military, the police and other public order agencies;\n(d)\npersonal protective equipment for means of road transport;\n(e)\nsports equipment;\n(f)\nself-defence or deterrent equipment;\n(g)\nportable devices for detecting and signalling risks and nuisances.\nArticle 3\nGeneral rule\nPersonal protective equipment shall be used when the risks cannot be avoided or sufficiently limited by technical means of collective protection or by measures, methods or procedures of work organization.\nSECTION II\nEMPLOYERS' OBLIGATIONS\nArticle 4\nGeneral provisions\n1.   Personal protective equipment must comply with the relevant Community provisions on design and manufacture with respect to safety and health.\nAll personal protective equipment must:\n(a)\nbe appropriate for the risks involved, without itself leading to any increased risk;\n(b)\ncorrespond to existing conditions at the workplace;\n(c)\ntake account of ergonomic requirements and the worker's state of health;\n(d)\nfit the wearer correctly after any necessary adjustment.\n2.   Where the presence of more than one risk makes it necessary for a worker to wear simultaneously more than one item of personal protective equipment, such equipment must be compatible and continue to be effective against the risk or risks in question.\n3.   The conditions of use of personal protective equipment, in particular the period for which it is worn, shall be determined on the basis of the seriousness of the risk, the frequency of exposure to the risk, the characteristics of the workstation of each worker and the performance of the personal protective equipment.\n4.   Personal protective equipment is, in principle, intended for personal use.\nIf the circumstances require personal protective equipment to be worn by more than one person, appropriate measures shall be taken to ensure that such use does not create any health or hygiene problem for the different users.\n5.   Adequate information on each item of personal protective equipment, required under paragraphs 1 and 2, shall be provided and made available within the undertaking and /or establishment.\n6.   Personal protective equipment shall be provided free of charge by the employer, who shall ensure its good working order and satisfactory hygienic condition by means of the necessary maintenance, repair and replacements.\nHowever, Member States may provide, in accordance with their national practice, that the worker be asked to contribute towards the cost of certain personal protective equipment in circumstances where use of the equipment is not exclusive to the workplace.\n7.   The employer shall first inform the worker of the risks against which the wearing of the personal protective equipment protects him.\n8.   The employer shall arrange for training and shall, if appropriate, organize demonstrations in the wearing of personal protective equipment.\n9.   Personal protective equipment may be used only for the purposes specified, except in specific and exceptional circumstances.\nIt must be used in accordance with instructions.\nSuch instructions must be understandable to the workers.\nArticle 5\nAssessment of personal protective equipment\n1.   Before choosing personal protective equipment, the employer is required to assess whether the personal protective equipment he intends to use satisfies the requirements of Article 4(1) and (2).\nThis assessment shall involve:\n(a)\nan analysis and assessment of risks which cannot be avoided by other means;\n(b)\nthe definition of the characteristics which personal protective equipment must have in order to be effective against the risks referred to in (a), taking into account any risks which this equipment itself may create;\n(c)\ncomparison of the characteristics of the personal protective equipment available with the characteristics referred to in (b).\n2.   The assessment provided for in paragraph 1 shall be reviewed if any changes are made to any of its elements.\nArticle 6 (8)\nRules for use\n1.   Without prejudice to Articles 3, 4 and 5, Member States shall ensure that general rules are established for the use of personal protective equipment and/or rules covering cases and situations where the employer must provide the personal protective equipment, taking account of Community legislation on the free movement of such equipment.\nThese rules shall indicate in particular the circumstances or the risk situations in which, without prejudice to the priority to be given to collective means of protection, the use of personal protective equipment is necessary.\nAnnexes I, II and III, which constitute a guide, contain useful information for establishing such rules.\n2.   When Member States adapt the rules referred to in paragraph 1, they shall take account of any significant changes to the risk, collective means of protection and personal protective equipment brought about by technological developments.\n3.   Member States shall consult the employers' and workers' organization on the rules referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2.\nArticle 7\nInformation for workers\nWithout prejudice to Article 10 of Directive 89/391 /EEC, workers and/or their representatives shall be informed of all measures to be taken with regard to the health and safety of workers when personal protective equipment is used by workers at work.\nArticle 8\nConsultation of workers and workers' participation\nConsultation and participation of workers and/or of their representatives shall take place in accordance with Article 11 of Directive 89/391 /EEC on the matters covered by this Directive, including the Annexes thereto.\nSECTION III\nMISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS\nArticle 9\nAdjustment of the Annexes\nAlterations of a strictly technical nature to Annexes I, II and III resulting from:\n—\nthe adoption of technical harmonization and standardization directives relating to personal protective equipment, and/or\n—\ntechnical progress and changes in international regulations and specifications or knowledge in the field of personal protective equipment,\nshall be adopted in accordance with the procedure provided for in Article 17 of Directive 89/391/EEC.\nArticle 10\nFinal provisions\n1.   Member States shall bring; into force the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive not later than 31 December 1992.
