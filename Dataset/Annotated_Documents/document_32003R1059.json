In order to function, the internal market requires statistical standards applicable to the collection, transmission and publication of national and Community statistics so that all operators in the single market can be provided with comparable statistical data. In this context, classifications are an important tool for the collection, compilation and dissemination of comparable statistics.(2) Regional statistics are a cornerstone of the European Statistical System. They are used for a wide range of purposes. For many years European regional statistics have been collected, compiled and disseminated on the basis of a common regional classification, called \"Nomenclature of territorial units for statistics\" (hereinafter referred to as NUTS). It is now appropriate to fix this regional classification in a legal framework and to institute clear rules for future amendments of this classification. The NUTS classification should not preclude the existence of other subdivisions and classifications.(3) Accordingly, all Member States' statistics transmitted to the Commission, which are broken down by territorial units, should use the NUTS classification, where applicable.(4) In its analysis and dissemination, the Commission should use the NUTS classification for all statistics classified by territorial units, where applicable.(5) Different levels are needed for regional statistics depending on the purpose of these statistics at national and European level. It is appropriate to have at least three hierarchical levels of detail in the European regional NUTS classification. Member States could have further levels of NUTS details, where they consider it necessary.(6) Information on the current territorial composition of NUTS level 3 regions is necessary for the proper administration of the NUTS classification and should therefore be transmitted regularly to the Commission.(7) Objective criteria for the definition of regions are necessary in order to ensure impartiality when regional statistics are compiled and used.(8) Users of regional statistics need stability of the nomenclature over time. The NUTS classification should hence not be amended too frequently. This Regulation will ensure a greater stability of rules over time.(9) Comparability of regional statistics requires that the regions be of a comparable size in terms of population. In order to achieve this goal, amendments of the NUTS classification should render the regional structure more homogeneous in terms of population size.(10) The actual political, administrative and institutional situation must also be respected. Non-administrative units must reflect economic, social, historical, cultural, geographical or environmental circumstances.(11) Reference should be made to the definition of the \"population\" on which the classification is based.(12) The NUTS classification is restricted to the economic territory of the Member States and does not provide complete coverage of the territory to which the Treaty establishing the European Community applies. Its use for Community purposes will therefore need to be assessed on a case-by-case basis. The economic territory of each country, as defined in Commission Decision 91/450/EEC(5),also includes extraregio territory, made up of parts of the economic territory that cannot be attached to a certain region (air-space, territorial waters and the continental shelf, territorial enclaves, in particular embassies, consulates and military bases, and deposits of oil, natural gas, etc. in international waters, outside the continental shelf, worked by resident units). The NUTS classification must also provide the possibility of statistics for this extraregio territory.(13) Amendments to the NUTS classification will require close consultations with the Member States.(14) Since the objective of the proposed action, namely the harmonisation of regional statistics, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve that objective.(15) The NUTS classification laid down in this Regulation should replace the \"Nomenclature of territorial units for statistics (NUTS)\" established to date by the Statistical Office of the European Communities in cooperation with the national statistical institutes. As a consequence, all references in Community acts to the \"Nomenclature of territorial units for statistics (NUTS)\" should now be understood as referring to the NUTS classification laid down in this Regulation.(16) Council Regulation (EC) No 322/97 of 17 February 1997 on Community Statistics(6) constitutes the reference framework for the provisions of this Regulation.(17) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Regulation should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission(7).(18) The Statistical Programme Committee established by Council Decision 89/382/EEC, Euratom(8) has been consulted in accordance with Article 3 thereof,HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:Article 1Subject matter1. The purpose of this Regulation is to establish a common statistical classification of territorial units, hereinafter referred to as \"NUTS\", in order to enable the collection, compilation and dissemination of harmonised regional statistics in the Community.2. The NUTS classification laid down in Annex I shall replace the \"Nomenclature of territorial units for statistics (NUTS)\" established by the Statistical Office of the European Communities in cooperation with the national statistical institutes of the Member States.Article 2Structure1. The NUTS classification subdivides the economic territory of the Member States, as defined in Decision 91/450/EEC, into territorial units. It ascribes to each territorial unit a specific code and name.2. The NUTS classification is hierarchical. It subdivides each Member State into NUTS level 1 territorial units, each of which is subdivided into NUTS level 2 territorial units, these in turn each being subdivided into NUTS level 3 territorial units.3. However, a particular territorial unit may be classified at several NUTS levels.4. At the same NUTS level, two different territorial units in the same Member State may not be identified by the same name. If two territorial units in different Member States have the same name, the country identifier is added to the territorial units' names.5. In each Member State, there can be further hierarchical levels of detail, decided by the Member State, whereby NUTS level 3 is subdivided. Within two years from the entry into force of this Regulation, the Commission, after consulting the Member States, shall submit a communication to the European Parliament and the Council on the appropriateness of establishing rules on a Europe-wide basis for more detailed levels in the NUTS classification.Article 3Classification criteria1. Existing administrative units within the Member States shall constitute the first criterion used for the definition of territorial units.To this end, \"administrative unit\" shall mean a geographical area with an administrative authority that has the power to take administrative or policy decisions for that area within the legal and institutional framework of the Member State.2. In order to establish the relevant NUTS level in which a given class of administrative units in a Member State is to be classified, the average size of this class of administrative units in the Member State shall lie within the following population thresholds:>TABLE>If the population of a whole Member State is below the minimum threshold for a given NUTS level, the whole Member State shall be one NUTS territorial unit for this level.3. For the purpose of this Regulation, the population of a territorial unit shall consist of those persons who have their usual place of residence in this area.4. The existing administrative units that are used for the NUTS classification are laid down in Annex II. Amendments to Annex II shall be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure referred to in Article 7(2).5. If for a given level of NUTS no administrative units of a suitable scale exist in a Member State, in accordance with the criteria referred to in paragraph 2, this NUTS level shall be constituted by aggregating an appropriate number of existing smaller contiguous administrative units. This aggregation shall take into consideration such relevant criteria as geographical, socio-economic, historical, cultural or environmental circumstances.The resulting aggregated units shall hereinafter be referred to as \"non-administrative units\". The size of the non-administrative units in a Member State for a given NUTS level shall lie within the population thresholds referred to in paragraph 2.In accordance with the regulatory procedure referred to in Article 7(2), individual non-administrative units may however deviate from these thresholds because of particular geographical, socio-economic, historical, cultural or environmental circumstances, especially in the islands and the outermost regions.Article 4Components of NUTS1. Within six months after the entry into force of this Regulation, the Commission shall publish the components of each NUTS level 3 territorial unit in terms of the smaller administrative units as laid down in Annex III, as transmitted to it by the Member States.Amendments to Annex III shall be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure referred to in Article 7(2).2. Within the first six months of each year, Member States shall transmit to the Commission all changes of the components for the previous year that may affect the NUTS level 3 boundaries and in so doing shall respect the electronic data format requested by the Commission.Article 5Amendments to NUTS1. The Member States shall inform the Commission of:(a) all changes that have occurred in administrative units, in so far as they may affect the NUTS classification, as laid down in Annex I, or the contents of Annexes II and III;(b) all other changes at the national level that may affect the NUTS classification, in accordance with the classification criteria laid down in Article 3.2. Changes to NUTS level 3 boundaries due to changes of smaller administrative units as laid down in Annex III:(a) shall not be considered as amendments of NUTS if they involve a population transfer equal to or less than one percent of the NUTS 3 territorial units concerned;(b) shall be considered as amendments of NUTS, in accordance with paragraph 3 of this Article, if they involve a population transfer of more than one percent of the NUTS 3 territorial units concerned.3. Amendments to the NUTS for the non-administrative units in a Member State, as referred to in Article 3(5), may be made if, at the NUTS level in question, the amendment reduces the standard deviation of the size in terms of population of all EU territorial units.4. Amendments to the NUTS classification shall be adopted in the second half of the calendar year in accordance with the regulatory procedure referred to in Article 7(2), not more frequently than every three years, on the basis of the criteria laid down in Article 3. Nevertheless, in the case of a substantial reorganisation of the relevant administrative structure of a Member State, the amendments to the NUTS classification may be adopted at intervals of less than three years.The Commission implementing measures referred to in the first subparagraph shall enter into force, with regard to the transmission of the data to the Commission, on 1 January of the second year after their adoption.5. When an amendment is made to the NUTS classification, the Member State concerned shall transmit to the Commission the time series for the new regional breakdown, to replace data already transmitted. The list of the time series and their length will be specified in accordance with the regulatory procedure referred to in Article 7(2) taking into account the feasibility of providing them. These time series are to be supplied within two years of the amendment to the NUTS classification.Article 6ManagementThe Commission shall take the necessary measures to ensure the consistent management of the NUTS classification. In particular, such measures may include:(a) drafting and updating of explanatory notes on NUTS;(b) examination of problems arising from the implementation of NUTS in the Member States' classifications of territorial units.Article 7Procedure1. The Commission shall be assisted by the Statistical Programme Committee, established by Article 1 of Decision 89/382/EEC, Euratom (hereinafter referred to as the Committee).2. Where reference is made to this paragraph, Articles 5 and 7 of Decision 1999/468/EC shall apply, having regard to the provisions of Article 8 thereof.The period laid down in Article 5(6) of Decision 1999/468/EC shall be set at three months.3. The Committee shall adopt its rules of procedure.Article 8ReportingThree years after the entry into force of this Regulation, the Commission shall submit a report on its implementation to the European Parliament and the Council.Article 9Entry into forceThis Regulation shall enter into force on the 20th day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.Done at Brussels, 26 May 2003.For the European ParliamentThe PresidentP.

This is to ensure that data refer to the same regional unit for a certain period of time. This is important especially for statistical time series.\nIt has been amended several times, including by: Regulations (EC) No 1888/2005, (EC) No 176/2008 and (EU) No 517/2013 to take account of the accession of new EU Member States;Regulations (EC) No 105/2007, (EU) No 31/2011, (EU) No 1319/2013, (EU) No 868/2014, (EU) 2016/2066 and 2019/1755 which amend the annexes to take account of amendments to the classification;amending Regulation (EU) 2017/2391 introducing legal status to territorial typologies linked to the NUTS classification — see below.\nKEY POINTS\nThe NUTS hierarchy\nFor each Member State, there is a three-level hierarchy of regional subdivisions which are based on minimum and maximum population thresholds, as shown below.\nNUTS 1. Major socioeconomic regions, e.g. German Länder, Belgian Gewesten/Régions, Polish or Romanian macroregions.\nNUTS 2. Basic regions for the application of regional policies, e.g. Belgian or Dutch provinces, Austrian Bundesländer, Czech regions (oblasti).\nNUTS 3. Small regions for specific diagnoses, e.g. French départements, Bulgarian provinces (oblasti), Italian provinces.\nThe third level is a subdivision of the second level, the second level is a subdivision of the first level and the first level is a subdivision of the countries. NUTS does not cover the local (municipality) level. Where the population of a Member State as a whole is below the minimum threshold for a given NUTS level, the country itself constitutes a NUTS territorial unit of that level.\nClassification criteria\nThe existing administrative units in the Member States have to be taken into account in NUTS. The NUTS level to which an existing administrative level corresponds is determined on the basis of the average population size of its administrative units as follows:\nLevel\nMinimum population\nMaximum population\nNUTS 1\n3 million\n7 million\nNUTS 2\n800,000\n3 million\nNUTS 3\n150,000\n800,000\nIf, for a given level in the classification, there is no existing administrative level of an adequate size in a Member State, that level is to be established by aggregating an adequate number of smaller neighbouring administrative units. The resulting aggregated units form a ‘non-administrative level’ at which each non-administrative unit has to respect the population thresholds shown above. Deviations occur under particular geographical, socioeconomic, historical, cultural or environmental circumstances, especially in the islands and the outermost regions.\nTerritorial typologies (Tercet)\nAmending Regulation (EU) 2017/2391 establishes a legal recognition of territorial typologies for the purpose of EU statistics. This makes it possible for thematic statistics regulations and policy initiatives to refer to these typologies for the purposes of collecting EU statistics and/or to target specific territories such as cities, urban, rural or coastal areas and regions in policy.\nThe regulation covers existing territorial typologies based on either NUTS level 3 (e.g. urban-rural typology, metropolitan regions) or the local administrative units (e.g. degree of urbanisation, cities, coastal areas). The regulation also covers the 1 km2 grid level required to calculate the typologies, which are based on population distribution and density in the grid cells. It also lays down the conditions for the adoption of delegated acts by the European Commission, where appropriate.\nThe current NUTS classification, valid from 1 January 2021, lists 92 regions at NUTS 1 level, 242 regions at NUTS 2 level and 1,166 regions at NUTS 3 level.\nUnder the implementing act, Regulation (EC) No 11/2008, when an amendment is made to the NUTS classification, the Member State concerned must send to the Commission the time series for the new regional classification to replace data already sent.\nFROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?\n              \nIt has applied since 11 July 2003.\nBACKGROUND\nSince the 1970s, to produce regional statistics and assess levels of eligibility for EU Structural Funds on the basis of objective, quantitative criteria, the EU has developed the NUTS classification as a single, coherent system for dividing up its territory geographically.\nAll Member States have their own systems of government and administrative structure, with some more centralised than others. They also vary enormously in terms of population, surface area and levels of development. NUTS has been developed by Eurostat specifically with this diversity of circumstances in mind.\nFor more information, see: NUTS — Nomenclature of territorial units for statistics (Eurostat).\nMAIN DOCUMENT\n            \nRegulation (EC) No 1059/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 May 2003 on the establishment of a common classification of territorial units for statistics (NUTS) (OJ L 154, 21.6.2003, pp. 1-41)\nSuccessive amendments to Regulation (EC) No 1059/2003 have been incorporated in the original text.
