{"celex_id": "32009L0041", "reference": "21.5.2009\nEN\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\nL 125/75\nDIRECTIVE 2009/41/EC OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL\nof 6 May 2009\non the contained use of genetically modified micro-organisms\n(Recast)\n(Text with EEA relevance)\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 175(1) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the Commission,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee (1),\nHaving consulted the Committee of the Regions,\nActing in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty (2),\nWhereas:\n(1)\nCouncil Directive 90/219/EEC of 23 April 1990 on the contained use of genetically modified micro-organisms (3) has been substantially amended several times (4). Since further amendments are to be made, it should be recast in the interests of clarity.\n(2)\nUnder the Treaty, action by the Community relating to the environment must be based on the principle that preventive action is to be taken and must have as its objective, among other things, the preservation, protection and improvement of the environment and the protection of human health.\n(3)\nMeasures concerning the evaluation and best use of biotechnology with regard to the environment are a priority area on which Community action should concentrate.\n(4)\nThe development of biotechnology is such as to contribute to the economic expansion of the Member States. This involves the use of genetically modified micro-organisms (GMMs) in operations of various types and scales.\n(5)\nThe contained use of GMMs should be such as to limit their possible negative consequences for human health and the environment, due attention being given to the prevention of accidents and the control of waste.\n(6)\nGMMs which are disposed of without appropriate provisions for specific containment measures to limit their contact with the general population and the environment do not fall within the scope of this Directive. Other Community legislation such as Directive 2001/18/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 March 2001 on the deliberate release into the environment of genetically modified organisms (5) may apply.\n(7)\nMicro-organisms, if released into the environment in one Member State in the course of their contained use, may reproduce and spread, crossing national frontiers and thereby affecting other Member States.\n(8)\nIn order to bring about the safe development of biotechnology throughout the Community, it is necessary to establish common measures for the evaluation and reduction of the potential risks arising in the course of all operations involving the contained use of GMMs and to set appropriate conditions of use.\n(9)\nThe precise nature and scale of risks associated with the contained use of GMMs are not yet fully known and the risk involved must be assessed on a case-by-case basis. In order to evaluate the risk to human health and the environment, it is necessary to lay down requirements for risk assessment.\n(10)\nContained uses of GMMs should be classified in relation to the risks they present to human health and the environment. Such classification should be in line with international practice and based on an assessment of the risk.\n(11)\nIn order to ensure a high level of protection, the containment and other protective measures applied to a contained use must correspond to the classification of the contained use. Where there is any uncertainty, the appropriate containment and other protective measures for the higher classification should be applied until less stringent measures are justified by appropriate data.\n(12)\nFor all activities involving GMMs the principles of good microbiological practice and good occupational safety and hygiene should apply in accordance with relevant Community legislation.\n(13)\nAppropriate containment measures should be applied at the various stages of an operation to control emissions and the disposal of material from contained uses of GMMs, and to prevent accidents.\n(14)\nAny person, before undertaking for the first time the contained use of a GMM in a particular installation, should forward a notification to the competent authority so that the authority may satisfy itself that the proposed installation is appropriate for the purposes of carrying out the activity in a manner that does not present a hazard to human health and the environment.\n(15)\nIt is also necessary to establish appropriate procedures for the case-by-case notification of specific operations involving the contained use of GMMs, taking account of the degree of risk involved.\n(16)\nIn the case of operations involving high risk, the consent of the competent authority should be given.\n(17)\nThe containment and other protective measures applied to contained uses should be reviewed periodically.\n(18)\nIt may be considered appropriate to consult the public on the contained use of GMMs.\n(19)\nPeople employed in contained uses should be consulted in accordance with the requirements of relevant Community legislation, in particular Directive 2000/54/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 September 2000 on the protection of workers from risks related to exposure to biological agents at work (seventh individual Directive within the meaning of Article 16(1) of Directive 89/391/EEC) (6).\n(20)\nAppropriate measures should be taken to inform any person liable to be affected by an accident on all matters relating to safety.\n(21)\nEmergency plans should be established to deal effectively with accidents.\n(22)\nIf an accident occurs, the user should immediately inform the competent authority and communicate the information necessary for assessing the impact of that accident and for taking the appropriate action.\n(23)\nIt is appropriate for the Commission, in consultation with the Member States, to establish a procedure for the exchange of information on accidents and for the Commission to set up a register of such accidents.\n(24)\nThe contained use of GMMs throughout the Community should be monitored, and to this end Member States should supply certain information to the Commission.\n(25)\nIn order to be considered safe for human health and the environment, GMMs should meet the list of criteria as defined in Annex II, Part B. To take account of the pace at which biotechnology is advancing, the nature of the criteria to be developed and the limited scope of that list, it is appropriate for the Council to revise those criteria, which should, where necessary, be supplemented by guidance notes to facilitate their application.\n(26)\nThe measures necessary for the implementation of this Directive should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission (7).\n(27)\nIn particular, the Commission should be empowered to adopt the amendments necessary to adapt Annexes II, III, IV and V to technical progress, and to adapt Annex II, Part C. Since those measures are of general scope and are designed to amend non-essential elements of this Directive, they must be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny provided for in Article 5a of Decision 1999/468/EC.\n(28)\nThe new elements introduced into this Directive concern only the committee procedures. They therefore do not need to be transposed by the Member States.\n(29)\nThis Directive should be without prejudice to the obligations of the Member States relating to the time limits for transposition into national law of the Directives set out in Annex VI, Part B,\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:\nArticle 1\nThis Directive lays down common measures for the contained use of genetically modified micro-organisms with a view to protecting human health and the environment.\nArticle 2\nFor the purposes of this Directive the following definitions shall apply:\n(a)\n‘micro-organism’ means any microbiological entity, cellular or non-cellular, capable of replication or of transferring genetic material, including viruses, viroids, and animal and plant cells in culture;\n(b)\n‘genetically modified micro-organism’ (GMM) means a micro-organism in which the genetic material has been altered in a way that does not occur naturally by mating and/or natural recombination; within the terms of this definition:\n(i)\ngenetic modification occurs at least through the use of the techniques listed in Annex I, Part A;\n(ii)\nthe techniques listed in Annex I, Part B, are not considered to result in genetic modification;\n(c)\n‘contained use’ means any activity in which micro-organisms are genetically modified or in which such GMMs are cultured, stored, transported, destroyed, disposed of or used in any other way, and for which specific containment measures are used to limit their contact with, and to provide a high level of safety for, the general population and the environment;\n(d)\n‘accident’ means any incident involving a significant and unintended release of GMMs in the course of their contained use which could present an immediate or delayed hazard to human health or the environment;\n(e)\n‘user’ means any natural or legal person responsible for the contained use of GMMs;\n(f)\n‘notification’ means the presentation of the requisite information to the competent authorities of a Member State.\nArticle 3\n1.   Without prejudice to Article 4(1), this Directive shall not apply:\n(a)\nwhere genetic modification is obtained through the use of the techniques/methods listed in Annex II, Part A; or\n(b)\nfor contained uses involving only types of GMMs meeting the criteria listed in Annex II, Part B which establish their safety for human health and the environment. These types of GMMs shall be listed in Annex II, Part C.\n2.   Article 4(3) and (6) and Articles 5 to 11 shall not apply to the transport of GMMs by road, rail, inland waterway, sea or air.\n3.   This Directive shall not apply to the storage, culture, transport, destruction, disposal or use of GMMs which have been placed on the market in accordance with Directive 2001/18/EC or pursuant to other Community legislation which provides for a specific environmental risk assessment similar to that laid down in that Directive, provided that the contained use is in accordance with the conditions, if any, of the consent for placing on the market.\nArticle 4\n1.   Member States shall ensure that all appropriate measures are taken to avoid adverse effects on human health and the environment which might arise from the contained use of GMMs.\n2.   To that end, the user shall carry out an assessment of the contained uses as regards the risks to human health and the environment that those contained uses may pose, using as a minimum the elements of assessment and the procedure set out in Annex III, Sections A and B.\n3.   The assessment referred to in paragraph 2 shall result in the final classification of the contained uses in four classes applying the procedure set out in Annex III, which will result in the assignment of containment levels in accordance with Article 5:\nClass 1\n:\nactivities of no or negligible risk, that is to say activities for which level 1 containment is appropriate to protect human health and the environment.\nClass 2\n:\nactivities of low risk, that is to say activities for which level 2 containment is appropriate to protect human health and the environment.\nClass 3\n:\nactivities of moderate risk, that is to say activities for which level 3 containment is appropriate to protect human health and the environment.\nClass 4\n:\nactivities of high risk, that is to say activities for which level 4 containment is appropriate to protect human health and the environment.\n4.   Where there is doubt as to which class is appropriate for the proposed contained use, the more stringent protective measures shall be applied unless, by agreement with the competent authority, there is sufficient evidence to justify the application of less stringent measures.\n5.   The assessment referred to in paragraph 2 shall especially take into account the question of disposal of waste and effluents. Where appropriate, the safety measures needed in order to protect human health and the environment shall be implemented.\n6.   A record of the assessment referred to in paragraph 2 shall be kept by the user and made available in an appropriate form to the competent authority as part of the notification pursuant to Articles 6, 8 and 9 or on request.\nArticle 5\n1.   Save to the extent that point 2 of Annex IV allows other measures to be applied, the user shall apply the general principles and the appropriate containment and other protective measures set out in Annex IV corresponding to the class of the contained use, so as to keep workplace and environmental exposure to any GMMs to the lowest reasonably practicable level, and so that a high level of safety is ensured.\n2.   The assessment referred to in Article 4(2) and the containment and other protective measures applied shall be reviewed periodically, and forthwith if:\n(a)\nthe containment measures applied are no longer adequate or the class assigned to the contained uses is no longer correct; or\n(b)\nthere is reason to suspect that the assessment is no longer appropriate judged in the light of new scientific or technical knowledge.\nArticle 6\nWhen premises are to be used for the first time for contained uses, the user shall be required, before commencing such use, to submit to the competent authorities a notification containing at least the information listed in Annex V, Part A.\nArticle 7\nFollowing the notification referred to in Article 6, subsequent class 1 contained use may proceed without further notification. Users of GMMs in class 1 contained uses shall be required to keep the record of each assessment referred to in Article 4(6), which shall be made available to the competent authority on request.\nArticle 8\n1.   For first and subsequent class 2 contained uses to be carried out in premises notified in accordance with Article 6, a notification containing the information listed in Annex V, Part B shall be submitted.\n2.   If the premises have been the subject of a previous notification to carry out class 2 or a higher class of contained uses and any associated consent requirements have been satisfied, the class 2 contained use may proceed immediately following the new notification.\nHowever, the applicant may himself request from the competent authority a decision on the grant of a formal authorisation. The decision must be made within a maximum of 45 days from the notification.\n3.   If the premises have not been the subject of a previous notification to carry out class 2 or a higher class of contained uses, the class 2 contained use may, in the absence of any indication to the contrary from the competent authority, proceed 45 days after submission of the notification referred to in paragraph 1, or earlier with the agreement of the competent authority.\nArticle 9\n1.   For first and subsequent class 3 or class 4 contained uses to be carried out in premises notified in accordance with Article 6, a notification containing the information listed in Annex V, Part C shall be submitted.\n2.   A class 3 or higher class of contained use may not proceed without the prior consent of the competent authority, which shall communicate its decision in writing:\n(a)\nat the latest 45 days after submission of the new notification, in the case of premises which have been the subject of a previous notification to carry out class 3 or a higher class of contained uses and where any associated consent requirements have been satisfied for the same or a higher class than the contained use with which it is intended to proceed;\n(b)\nat the latest 90 days after submission of the notification, in other cases.\nArticle 10\n1.   Member States shall designate the authority or authorities competent to implement the measures which they adopt in application of this Directive and to receive and acknowledge the notifications referred to in Articles 6, 8 and 9.\n2.   The competent authorities shall examine the conformity of the notifications with the requirements of this Directive, the accuracy and completeness of the information given, the correctness of the assessment referred to in Article 4(2) and the class of contained uses and, where appropriate, the suitability of the containment and other protective measures, the waste management, and emergency response measures.\n3.   If necessary, the competent authority may:\n(a)\nask the user to provide further information or to modify the conditions of the proposed contained use or to amend the class assigned to the contained use(s). In this case the competent authority may require that the contained use, if proposed, should not begin, or, if in progress, should be suspended or terminated, until the competent authority has given its approval on the basis of the further information obtained or of the modified conditions of the contained use;\n(b)\nlimit the time for which the contained use should be permitted or subject it to certain specific conditions.\n4.   For the purpose of calculating the periods referred to in Articles 8 and 9, any period of time during which the competent authority:\n(a)\nis awaiting any further information which it may have requested from the notifier in accordance with point (a) of paragraph 3; or\n(b)\nis carrying out a public inquiry or consultation in accordance with Article 12;\nshall not be taken into account.\nArticle 11\n1.   If the user becomes aware of relevant new information or modifies the contained use in a way which could have significant consequences in terms of the risks posed by it, the competent authority shall be informed as soon as possible and the notification pursuant to Articles 6, 8 and 9 shall be modified.\n2.   If information subsequently becomes available to the competent authority which could have significant consequences in terms of the risks posed by the contained use, the competent authority may require the user to modify the conditions of, or suspend or terminate, the contained use.\nArticle 12\nWhere a Member State considers it appropriate, it may provide that the public is to be consulted on aspects of the proposed contained use, without prejudice to Article 18.\nArticle 13\n1.   The competent authorities shall ensure that before a contained use commences:\n(a)\nan emergency plan is drawn up for contained uses where failure of the containment measures could lead to serious danger, whether immediate or delayed, to humans outside the premises and/or to the environment, except where such an emergency plan has been drawn up under other Community legislation;\n(b)\ninformation on such emergency plans, including the relevant safety measures to be applied, is supplied in an appropriate manner, and without their having to request it, to bodies and authorities liable to be affected by the accident. The information shall be updated at appropriate intervals. It shall also be made publicly available.\n2.   The Member States concerned shall at the same time make available to other Member States concerned, as a basis for all necessary consultation within the framework of their bilateral relations, the same information as that which is disseminated to their nationals.\nArticle 14\n1.   Member States shall take the necessary measures to ensure that, in the event of an accident, the user is required immediately to inform the competent authority specified in Article 10 and to provide the following information:\n(a)\nthe circumstances of the accident;\n(b)\nthe identity and quantities of the GMMs concerned;\n(c)\nany information necessary to assess the effects of the accident on the health of the general population and the environment;\n(d)\nthe measures taken.\n2.   Where information is given pursuant to paragraph 1, the Member States shall be required to:\n(a)\nensure that any measures necessary are taken, and immediately alert any Member States which could be affected by the accident;\n(b)\ncollect, where possible, the information necessary for a full analysis of the accident and, where appropriate, make recommendations to avoid similar accidents in the future and to limit the effects thereof.\nArticle 15\n1.   Member States shall be required to:\n(a)\nconsult with other Member States likely to be affected in the event of an accident on the proposed implementation of emergency plans;\n(b)\ninform the Commission as soon as possible of any accident within the scope of this Directive, giving details of the circumstances of the accident, the identity and quantities of the GMMs concerned, the response measures taken and their effectiveness and an analysis of the accident, including recommendations designed to limit its effects and to avoid similar accidents in the future.\n2.   The Commission, in consultation with the Member States, shall establish a procedure for the exchange of information pursuant to paragraph 1. It shall also set up and keep at the disposal of the Member States a register of accidents within the scope of this Directive, including an analysis of the causes of the accidents, experience gained and measures taken to avoid similar accidents in the future.\nArticle 16\nMember States shall ensure that the competent authority organises inspections and other control measures to ensure that users comply with this Directive.\nArticle 17\n1.   Member States shall send to the Commission, at the end of each year, a summary report on class 3 and class 4 contained uses notified during that year pursuant to Article 9, including the description, purpose and risks of the contained use(s).\n2.   Every three years, and for the first time on 5 June 2003, Member States shall send the Commission a summary report on their experience with this Directive.\n3.   Every three years, and for the first time on 5 June 2004, the Commission shall publish a summary based on the reports referred to in paragraph 2.\n4.   The Commission may publish general statistical information on the implementation of this Directive and related matters, as long as it contains no information likely to cause harm to the competitive position of a user.\nArticle 18\n1.   Where its disclosure affects one or more of the items mentioned in Article 4(2) of Directive 2003/4/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 28 January 2003 on public access to environmental information (8), the notifier may indicate the information in the notifications submitted pursuant to this Directive that should be treated as confidential. Verifiable justification must be given in such cases.\nThe competent authority shall decide, after consultation with the notifier, which information will be kept confidential and shall inform the notifier of its decision.\n2.   In no case may the following information, when submitted pursuant to Articles 6, 8 or 9, be kept confidential:\n(a)\nthe general characteristics of the GMMs, the name and address of the notifier, and the location of use;\n(b)\nthe class of contained use and the containment measures;\n(c)\nthe evaluation of foreseeable effects, in particular any harmful effects on human health and the environment.\n3.   The Commission and the competent authorities shall not divulge to third parties any information deemed to be confidential according to the second subparagraph of paragraph 1 and notified or otherwise provided pursuant to this Directive, and shall protect intellectual property rights relating to the data received.\n4.   If, for whatever reasons, the notifier withdraws the notification, the competent authority must respect the confidentiality of the information supplied.\nArticle 19\nThe measures designed to amend non-essential elements of this Directive relating to adapting Annexes II, III, IV and V to technical progress, and to adapting Annex II, Part C, shall be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny referred to in Article 20(2).\nArticle 20\n1.   The Commission shall be assisted by a committee.\n2.   Where reference is made to this paragraph, Article 5a(1) to (4) and Article 7 of Decision 1999/468/EC shall apply, having regard to the provisions of Article 8 thereof.\n3.

Technical guidance notes may be developed in accordance with the regulatory procedure referred to in Article 20(3) in order to facilitate the implementation and explanation of this Annex.\n1.   Introduction\nTypes of GMMs listed in Part C in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny referred to in Article 20(2) are excluded from the scope of this Directive. GMMs will be added to the list on a case-by-case basis and exclusion will relate only to each clearly identified GMM. This exclusion applies only when the GMM is used under conditions of contained use as defined in point (c) of Article 2. It does not apply to the deliberate release of GMMs. For a GMM to be listed in Part C, it must be proved that it meets the criteria given below.\n2.   General criteria\n2.1.   Strain verification/authentication\nIdentity of the strain must be precisely established. Modification must be known and verified.\n2.2.   Documented and established evidence of safety\nDocumented evidence of the safety of the organism must be provided.\n2.3.   Genetic stability\nWhere any instability could adversely affect safety, evidence of stability is required.\n3.   Specific criteria\n3.1.   Non-pathogenic\nThe GMM should not be capable of causing disease or harm to a healthy human, plant or animal. Since pathogenicity includes both toxigenicity and allergenicity, the GMM should therefore be:\n3.1.1.   Non-toxigenic\nThe GMM should not produce increased toxigenicity as a result of the genetic modification nor be noted for its toxigenic properties.\n3.1.2.   Non-allergenic\nThe GMM should not produce increased allergenicity as a result of the genetic modification nor be a noted allergen, having, for example, allergenicity comparable in particular with that of the micro-organisms identified in Directive 2000/54/EC.\n3.2.   No harmful adventitious agents\nThe GMM should not harbour known harmful adventitious agents such as other micro-organisms, active or latent, existing alongside or inside the GMM, that could cause harm to human health and the environment.\n3.3.   Transfer of genetic material\nThe modified genetic material must not give rise to harm if transferred; nor should it be self-transmissible or transferable at a frequency greater than other genes of the recipient or parental micro-organism.\n3.4.   Safety for the environment in the event of a significant and unintended release\nGMMs must not produce adverse effects on the environment, immediate or delayed, should any incident involving a significant and unintended release occur.\nGMMs that do not meet the above criteria may not be included in Part C.\nPART C\nTypes of GMMs which meet the criteria listed in Part B:\n… (to be completed in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny referred to in Article 20(2))\nANNEX III\nPrinciples to be followed for the assessment referred to in Article 4(2)\nThis Annex describes in general terms the elements to be considered and the procedure to be followed to perform the assessment referred to in Article 4(2). Technical guidance notes (1) may be developed in accordance with the regulatory procedure referred to in Article 20(3) in order to facilitate the implementation and explanation of this Annex, in particular as regards Section B.\nA.   Elements of assessment\n1.\nThe following should be considered as potentially harmful effects:\n—\ndisease to humans, including allergenic or toxic effects,\n—\ndisease to animals or plants,\n—\ndeleterious effects due to the impossibility of treating a disease or providing an effective prophylaxis,\n—\ndeleterious effects due to establishment or dissemination in the environment,\n—\ndeleterious effects due to the natural transfer of inserted genetic material to other organisms.\n2.\nThe assessment referred to in Article 4(2) should be based on the following:\n(a)\nthe identification of any potentially harmful effects, in particular those associated with:\n(i)\nthe recipient micro-organism;\n(ii)\nthe genetic material inserted (originating from the donor organism);\n(iii)\nthe vector;\n(iv)\nthe donor micro-organism (as long as the donor micro-organism is used during the operation);\n(v)\nthe resulting GMM;\n(b)\nthe characteristics of the activity;\n(c)\nthe severity of the potentially harmful effects;\n(d)\nthe likelihood of the potentially harmful effects being realised.\nB.   Procedure\n3.\nThe first stage in the assessment process should be to identify the harmful properties of the recipient and, where appropriate, the donor micro-organism, and any harmful properties associated with the vector or inserted material, including any alteration in the recipient’s existing properties.\n4.\nIn general, only GMMs which show the following characteristics would be considered appropriate for inclusion in class 1 as defined in Article 4(3):\n(i)\nthe recipient or parental micro-organism is unlikely to cause disease to humans, animals or plants (2);\n(ii)\nthe nature of the vector and the insert is such that they do not endow the GMM with a phenotype likely to cause disease to humans, animals or plants (2), or likely to have deleterious effects on the environment;\n(iii)\nthe GMM is unlikely to cause disease to humans, animals or plants (2) and is unlikely to have deleterious effects on the environment.\n5.\nIn order to obtain the necessary information to implement this process the user may firstly take into account relevant Community legislation (in particular Directive 2000/54/EC). International or national classification schemes (e.g. World Health Organisation, National Institutes of Health) and their revisions due to new scientific knowledge and technical progress may also be considered.\nThese schemes concern natural micro-organisms and as such are usually based on the ability of micro-organisms to cause disease to humans, animals or plants and on the severity and transmissibility of the disease likely to be caused. Directive 2000/54/EC classifies micro-organisms, as biological agents, into four classes of risk on the basis of potential effects on a healthy human adult. These classes of risk can be used as guidance for the purposes of categorisation of the contained use activities in the four classes of risk referred to in Article 4(3). The user may also take into consideration classification schemes referring to plant and animal pathogens (which are usually established on a national basis). The abovementioned classification schemes give only a provisional indication of the risk class of the activity and the corresponding set of containment and control measures.\n6.\nThe hazard identification process carried out in accordance with points 3 to 5 should lead to the identification of the level of risk associated with the GMM.\n7.\nSelection of the containment and other protective measures should then be made on the basis of the level of risk associated with the GMMs together with consideration of:\n(i)\nthe characteristics of the environment likely to be exposed (e.g. whether in the environment likely to be exposed to the GMMs there are known biota which can be adversely affected by the micro-organisms used in the contained use activity);\n(ii)\nthe characteristics of the activity (e.g. its scale and/or nature);\n(iii)\nany non-standard operations (e.g. the inoculation of animals with GMMs; use of equipment likely to generate aerosols).\nConsideration of items (i) to (iii) for the particular activity may increase, reduce or leave unaltered the level of risk associated with the GMM as identified under point 6.\n8.\nThe analysis carried out as described above will finally lead to the assignment of the activity to one of the classes described in Article 4(3).\n9.\nThe final classification of the contained use should be confirmed by reviewing the completed assessment referred to in Article 4(2).\n(1)  See Commission Decision 2000/608/EC of 27 September 2000 concerning the guidance notes for risk assessment outlined in Annex III to Directive 90/219/EEC on the contained use of genetically modified micro-organisms (OJ L 258, 12.10.2000, p. 43).\n(2)  This would only apply to animals and plants in the environment likely to be exposed.\nANNEX IV\nCONTAINMENT AND OTHER PROTECTIVE MEASURES\nGeneral principles\n1.\nThese tables present the normal minimum requirements and measures necessary for each level of containment.\nContainment is also achieved through the use of good work practices, training, containment equipment and special installation design. For all activities involving GMMs the principles of good microbiological practice and the following principles of good occupational safety and hygiene shall apply:\n(i)\nto keep workplace and environmental exposure to any GMM to the lowest practicable level;\n(ii)\nto exercise engineering control measures at source and to supplement these with appropriate personal protective clothing and equipment when necessary;\n(iii)\nto test adequately and maintain control measures and equipment;\n(iv)\nto test, when necessary, for the presence of viable process organisms outside the primary physical containment;\n(v)\nto provide appropriate training of personnel;\n(vi)\nto establish biological safety committees or subcommittees, if required;\n(vii)\nto formulate and implement local codes of practice for the safety of personnel, as required;\n(viii)\nwhere appropriate, to display biohazard signs;\n(ix)\nto provide washing and decontamination facilities for personnel;\n(x)\nto keep adequate records;\n(xi)\nto prohibit eating, drinking, smoking, applying cosmetics or the storing of food for human consumption in the work area;\n(xii)\nto prohibit mouth pipetting;\n(xiii)\nto provide written standard operating procedures where appropriate to ensure safety;\n(xiv)\nto have effective disinfectants and specified disinfection procedures available in case of spillage of GMMs;\n(xv)\nto provide safe storage for contaminated laboratory equipment and materials, when appropriate.\n2.\nThe titles of the tables are indicative:\nTable I A presents minimum requirements for laboratory activities.\nTable I B presents additions to and modifications of Table I A for glasshouse/growth-room activities involving GMMs.\nTable I C presents additions to and modifications of Table I A for activities with animals involving GMMs.\nTable II presents minimum requirements for activities other than laboratory activities.\nIn some particular cases, it might be necessary to apply a combination of measures, from Table I A and Table II, of the same level.\nIn some cases users may, with the agreement of the competent authority, not apply a specification under a particular containment level or combine specifications from two different levels.\nIn these tables ‘optional’ means that the user may apply these measures on a case-by-case basis, subject to the assessment referred to in Article 4(2).\n3.\nIn implementing this Annex, Member States may in addition incorporate in the following tables the general principles set out in points 1 and 2, with a view to

microorganisms\nSUMMARY OF:\nDirective 2009/41/EC on the contained use of genetically modified microorganisms\nWHAT IS THE AIM OF THE DIRECTIVE?\n              \nIt lays down rules for the contained use* of genetically modified microorganisms (GMMs)* in order to protect human health and the environment in the EU.\nKEY POINTS\nClassifications and notifications\nUsers of GMMs must assess the contained uses regarding the risk to human health and the environment. The assessment results in one of the following classes.\nClass 1: for activities with no or negligible risk.\nClass 2: for activities with low risk.\nClass 3: for activities with moderate risk.\nClass 4: for activities with high risk.\nWhen a contained use of a GMM is to be carried out for the first time, the user must submit a notification containing information (listed in Annex V of the directive) to the competent authority of their EU country. This is to satisfy them that the proposed installation is appropriate for the purposes of the activity so that there is no risk to human health and the environment.\nFollowing the notification to the competent authorities, class 1 contained use may proceed without further notification.\nClass 2 contained use can proceed immediately after notification provided the premises were the subject of previous notification to carry out class 2 or higher. However, if this is not the case and in the absence of a refusal from the competent authority, class 2 contained use may proceed 45 days after the submission of the notification (or earlier with the agreement of the authority).\nA class 3 or 4 contained use may not proceed without the prior consent of the competent authority, which must communicate its decision in writing.\nAccidents\n*\nBefore a contained use begins, EU countries must ensure that:\nin order to react in the case of an accident, an emergency plan is drawn up for cases where failure of the containment measures could lead to serious danger; and\npersons at risk of being affected by an accident are informed of all aspects related to their safety.\nShould an accident occur, the respective EU country must ensure that the GMM user informs the competent authorities and communicates the information necessary for assessing the situation and taking action.\nFROM WHEN DOES THE DIRECTIVE APPLY?\n              \nIt applies from 10 June 2009.\nBACKGROUND\n              \nThis directive repeals and consolidates Directive 90/219/EEC and its successive amendments into a single act.\nIt lays down minimal standards applicable to the contained use of GMMs. EU countries are permitted to take stronger measures.\n* KEY TERMS\n              \nContained use: Any activity in which microorganisms are genetically modified, cultured, stored, transported, destroyed, disposed of or used in any other way and for which containment/safety measures are used to limit their contact with the general population and the environment.\nGMMs: Micro-organisms, such as bacteria, viruses or fungi, that have had their genetic material altered in a way that does not occur naturally by mating and/or natural recombination.\nAccidents: In the context of this directive, these refer to any incident involving a significant and unintended release of GMMs in the course of their contained use that could be hazardous to human health or the environment.\nMAIN DOCUMENT\n            \nDirective 2009/41/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 May 2009 on the contained use of genetically modified micro-organisms (Recast) (OJ L 125, 21.5.2009, pp. 75-97)\nlast update 07.07.2016", "tags": ["environmental impact", "public health", "environmental risk prevention", "microorganism", "genetically modified organism", "exchange of information"], "subjects": ["Approximation of laws", "Internal market - Principles", "Research and technological development", "Environment"], "split": "train", "reference_annotations": {}, "summary_annotations": {}}
