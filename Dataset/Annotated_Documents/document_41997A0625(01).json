For the purposes of this Convention, the deliberate action of whosoever promises or gives, directly or through an intermediary, an advantage of any kind whatsoever to an official for himself or for a third party for him to act or refrain from acting in accordance with his duty or in the exercise of his functions in breach of his official duties shall constitute active corruption.2. Each Member State shall take the necessary measures to ensure that conduct of the type referred to in paragraph 1 is made a criminal offence.Article 4 Assimilation1. Each Member State shall take the necessary measures to ensure that in its criminal law the descriptions of the offences referred to in Articles 2 and 3 committed by or against its Government Ministers, elected members of its parliamentary chambers, the members of its highest Courts or the members of its Court of Auditors in the exercise of their functions apply similarly in cases where such offences are committed by or against Members of the Commission of the European Communities, the European Parliament, the Court of Justice and the Court of Auditors of the European Communites respectively in the exercise of their duties.2. Where a Member State has enacted special legislation concerning acts or omissions for which Government Ministers are responsible by reason of their special political position in that Member State, paragraph 1 may not apply to such legislation, provided that the Member State ensures that Members of the Commission of the European Communities are also covered by the criminal legislation implementing Articles 2 and 3.3. Paragraphs 1 and 2 shall be without prejudice to the provisions applicable in each Member State concerning criminal proceedings and the determination of the competent court.4. This Convention shall apply in full accordance with the relevant provisions of the Treaties establishing the European Communities, the Protocol on the Privileges and Immunities of the European Communities, the Statutes of the Court of Justice and the texts adopted for the purpose of their implementation, as regards the withdrawal of immunity.Article 5 Penalties1.

Paragraph 1 shall be without prejudice to the exercise of disciplinary powers by the competent authorities against national officials or Community officials. In determining the penalty to be imposed, the national criminal courts may, in accordance with the principles of their national law, take into account any disciplinary penalty already imposed on the same person for the same conduct.Article 6 Criminal liability of heads of businessesEach Member State shall take the necessary measures to allow heads of businesses or any persons having power to take decisions or exercise control within a business to be declared criminally liable in accordance with the principles defined by its national law in cases of corruption, as referred to in Article 3, by a person under their authority acting on behalf of the business.Article 7 Jurisdiction1. Each Member State shall take the measures necessary to establish its jurisdiction over the offences it has established in accordance with the obligations arising out of Articles 2, 3 and 4 where:(a) the offence is committed in whole or in part within its territory;(b) the offender is one of its nationals or one of its officials;(c) the offence is committed against one of the persons referred to in Article 1 or a member of one of the European Community institutions referred to in Article 4 (1) who is at the same time one of its nationals;(d) the offender is a Community official working for a European Community institution or a body set up in accordance with the Treaties establishing the European Communities which has its headquarters in the Member State in question.2. Each Member State may declare, when giving the notification provided for in Article 13 (2), that it will not apply or will apply only in specific cases or conditions one or more of the jurisdiction rules laid down in paragraph 1 (b), (c) and (d).Article 8 Extradition and prosecution1. Any Member State which, under its law, does not extradite its own nationals shall take the necessary measures to establish its jurisdiction over the offences it has established in accordance with the obligations arising out of Articles 2, 3 and 4, when committed by its own nationals outside its territory.2. Each Member State shall, when one of its nationals is alleged to have committed in another Member State an offence established in accordance with the obligations arising out of Articles 2, 3 and 4 and it does not extradite that person to that other Member State solely on the ground of his nationality, submit the case to its competent authorities for the purpose of prosecution if appropriate.

If any procedure in connection with an offence established in accordance with the obligations arising out of Articles 2, 3 and 4 concerns at least two Member States, those States shall cooperate effectively in the investigation, the prosecution and in carrying out the punishment imposed by means, for example, of mutual legal assistance, extradition, transfer of proceedings or enforcement of sentences passed in another Member State.2. Where more than one Member State has jurisdiction and has the possibility of viable prosecution of an offence based on the same facts, the Member States involved shall cooperate in deciding which shall prosecute the offender or offenders with a view to centralizing the prosecution in a single Member States where possible.Article 10 Ne bis in idem1. Member States shall apply, in their national criminal laws, the ne bis in idem rule, under which a person whose trial has been finally disposed of in a Member State may not be prosecuted in another Member State in respect of the same facts, provided that if a penalty was imposed, it has been enforced, is actually in the process of being enforced or can no longer be enforced under the laws of the sentencing State.2. A Member State may, when giving the notification referred to in Article 13 (2), declare that it shall not be bound by paragraph 1 of this Article in one or more of the following cases:(a) if the facts which were the subject of the judgment rendered abroad took place in its own territory either in whole or in part; in the latter case this exception shall not apply if those facts took place partly in the territory of the Member State where the judgment was rendered;(b) if the facts which where the subject of the judgment rendered abroad constitute an offence directed against the security or other equally essential interests of that Member State;(c) if the facts which were the subject of the judgment rendered abroad were committed by an official of that Member State contrary to the duties of his office.3. If a further prosecution is brought in a Member State against a person whose trial, in respect of the same facts, has been finally disposed of in another Member State, any period of deprivation of liberty served in the latter Member State arising from those facts shall be deducted from any sanction imposed. To the extent permitted by national law, sanctions not involving deprivation of liberty shall also be taken into account insofar as they have been enforced.4. The exceptions which may be the subject of a declaration under paragraph 2 shall not apply if the Member State concerned in respect of the same facts requested the other Member State to bring the prosecution or granted extradition of the person concerned.5. Relevant bilateral or multilateral agreements concluded between Member States and relevant declarations shall remain unaffected by this Article.Article 11 Internal provisionsNo provision in this Convention shall prevent Member States from adopting internal legal provisions which go beyond the obligations deriving from this Convention.Article 12 Court of Justice1.

If no solution has been found within six months, the matter may be referred to the Court of Justice of the European Communities by one of the parties to the dispute.2. Any dispute between one or more Member States and the Commission of the European Communities concerning Article 1, with the exception of point (c), or Articles 2, 3 and 4, insofar as it concerns a question of Community law or the Communities' financial interests, or involves members of officials of Community institutions of bodies set up in accordance with the Treaties establishing the European Communities, which it has proved impossible to settle through negotiation, may be submitted to the Court of Justice by one of the parties to the dispute.3. Any court in a Member State may ask the Court of Justice to give a preliminary ruling on a matter concerning the interpretation of Articles 1 to 4 and 12 to 16 raised in a case pending before it and involving members or officials of Community institutions or bodies set up in accordance with the Treaties establishing the European Communities, acting in the exercise of their functions, if it considers that a decision on that matter is necessary to enable it to give judgment.4. The competence of the Court of Justice provided for in paragraph 3 shall be subject to its acceptance by the Member State concerned in a declaration to that effect made at the time of the notification referred to in Article 13 (2) or at any subsequent time.5. A Member State making a declaration under paragraph 4 may restrict the possibility of asking the Court of Justice to give a preliminary ruling to those of its courts against the decisions of which there is no judicial remedy under national law.6. The Statute of the Court of Justice of the European Community and its Rules of Procedure shall apply. In accordance with those Statutes, any Member State, or the Commission, whether or not it has made a declaration pursuant to paragraph 4, shall be entitled to submit statements of case or written observations to the Court of Justice in cases which arise under paragraph 3.Article 13 Entry into force1.

This Convention shall become applicable in respect of the Member State that makes such a declaration on the first day of the month following the expiry of a period of ninety days after the date of deposit of its declaration.5. A Member State that has not made any declaration as referred to in paragraph 4 may apply this Convention with respect to the other contracting Member States on the basis of bilateral agreements.Article 14 Accession of new Member States1.

Both participating in and instigating either of these forms of corruption are covered by the convention.\nSanctions must be effective, proportionate and dissuasive. In addition, EU countries must allow heads of businesses, or any persons having power to take decisions or exercise control within a business, to be declared criminally liable in cases of active corruption by a person under their authority acting on behalf of the business.\nEach EU country must set up its jurisdiction over offences, in accordance with the obligations arising out of this convention, when: the offence is committed in whole or in part within its territory;the offender is one of its nationals or one of its officials;the offence is committed against EU or national officials, or against a member of the EU institutions, who is also one of its nationals;the offender is an EU official working for an EU institution, agency or body that has its headquarters in the EU country in question.\nIf any procedure in connection with an offence in accordance with the obligations arising out of the convention concerns at least 2 EU countries, those countries must cooperate in the investigation and prosecution, and in carrying out the punishment imposed.\nEU countries must apply the principle that no legal action can be carried out twice for the same offence (also known as the ne bis in idem principle), but exceptions to this principle are possible.\nEU countries may adopt internal legal arrangements which go beyond the obligations set out in the convention.\nIn the event of a dispute between EU countries over the interpretation or application of the convention, and in the absence of a mutual resolution, the case must be examined by the Council as set out in Title IV of the Treaty on European Union. If the Council has not found a solution within 6 months, 1 of the parties to the dispute may refer the matter to the Court of Justice of the European Union. This court also has jurisdiction in disputes between an EU country and the European Commission.\nDATE OF ENTRY INTO FORCE\n              \nThe convention entered into force on 28 September 2005 and all EU countries have acceded to it.\nBACKGROUND\n              \nCriminalising active and passive corruption has been covered by a number of international and European instruments over the past 2 decades.\nInternational level\nCriminalisation of active and passive corruption is regulated by the United Nations Convention against Corruption (UNCAC), which is an international treaty of universal scope. It entered into force on 14 December 2005. By December 2014, all EU countries had ratified the UNCAC and the EU itself became a contracting party in 2008 (Decision 2008/801/EC).\nThe Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions (in force since 1999) establishes legally binding standards to criminalise bribery of foreign public officials in international business transactions and provides for a host of related measures that make this effective. It focuses on the ‘supply side’ of international corruption.\nEuropean level\nThe Criminal Law Convention on Corruption of the Council of Europe (in force since 2002) is also an ambitious instrument aiming at the coordinated criminalisation of corrupt practices. It also provides for complementary criminal law measures and for improved international cooperation in the prosecution of corruption offences.\nNote: Although most individual EU countries are parties to these to these latter conventions (the Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions and the Criminal Law Convention on Corruption), the EU itself is not a party.\nFor more information, see:\nCorruption (European Commission).\nKEY TERMS\n              \nPublic official: any European or national official, including any national official of another EU country.\nEuropean official: any person who is an official or other contracted employee within the meaning of the Staff Regulations of Officials of the EU, as well as any person seconded to the EU by the EU countries or by any public or private body who carries out functions equivalent to those performed by EU officials or other servants.\nNational official: official or public officer as defined by the national law of the EU country in which the person in question performs that function for the purposes of application of the criminal law of that EU country.\nActive corruption: the deliberate action of a person who promises or gives, directly or through an intermediary, an advantage of any kind whatsoever to an official, for himself (or herself) or for a third party, for him (or her) to act or refrain from acting in accordance with his (or her) duty or in the exercise of his (or her) functions in breach of his (or her) official duties.\nPassive corruption: the deliberate action of an official, who, directly or through an intermediary, requests or receives advantages of any kind whatsoever, for himself (or herself) or for a third party, or accepts a promise of such an advantage, to act or refrain from acting in accordance with his (or her) duty or in the exercise of his (or her) functions in breach of his (or her) official duties.\nMAIN DOCUMENTS\n
