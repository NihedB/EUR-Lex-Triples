This Directive shall apply to the labelling of the materials used in the main components of  footwear for sale to the consumer. For the purposes of this Directive, 'footwear' shall mean all articles with applied soles designed  to protect or cover the foot, including parts marketed separately as referred to in Annex I. A non-exhaustive list of the products covered by the Directive appears in Annex II. The following shall be excluded from the Directive: - second-hand, worn footwear, - protective footwear covered by Directive 89/686/EEC (5), - footwear covered by Directive 76/769/EEC (6), - toy footwear. 2. Information on the composition of footwear shall be conveyed by means of labelling as specified  in Article 4. (i) The labelling shall convey information relating to the three parts of the footwear as defined  in Annex I, namely: (a) the upper; (b) the lining and sock; and (c) the outersole. (ii) The composition of the footwear shall be indicated as specified in Article 4 on the basis  either of pictograms or of written indications for specific materials, as stipulated in Annex I. (iii) In the case of the upper, classification of the materials shall be determined on the basis of  the provisions contained in Article 4 (1) and in Annex I, no account being taken of accessories or  reinforcements such as ankle patches, edging, ornamentation, buckles, tabs, eyelet stays or similar  attachments. (iv) In the case of the outersole, classification shall be based on the volume of the materials  contained therein, in accordance with Article 4. Article 2 1. Member States shall take all necessary measures to ensure that all footwear placed on the market  meets the labelling requirements of this Directive without prejudice to other relevant Community  provisions. 2. Where footwear not in conformity with the provisions regarding labelling requirements is placed  on the market, the competent Member State shall take appropriate action as specified in its  national legislation. Article 3 Without prejudice to other relevant Community provisions, Member States shall not prohibit or  impede the placing on the market of footwear which complies with the labelling requirements of this  Directive, by the application of unharmonized national provisions governing the labelling of  certain types of footwear or of footwear in general. Article 4 1. The labelling shall provide information on the material, determined in accordance with Annex I,  which constitutes at least 80 % of the surface area of the upper, and the lining and sock, of the  footwear, and at least 80 % of the volume of the outersole. If no one material accounts for at  least 80 %, information should be given on the two main materials used in the composition of the  footwear. 2. The information shall be conveyed on the footwear. The manufacturer or his authorized agent  established in the Community may choose either pictograms or written indications in at least the  language or languages which may be determined by the Member State of consumption in accordance with  the Treaty, as defined and illustrated in Annex I. Member States, in their national provisions  shall ensure that consumers are adequately informed of the meaning of these pictograms, while  ensuring that such provisions do not create trade barriers. 3. For the purpose of this Directive, labelling shall involve affixing the required information to  at least one article of footwear in each pair. This may be done by printing, sticking, embossing or  using an attached label. 4. The labelling must be visible, securely attached and accessible and the dimensions of the  pictograms must be sufficiently large to make it easy to understand the information contained  therein. It must not be possible for the labelling to mislead the consumer. 5. The manufacturer or his authorized agent established in the Community shall be responsible for  supplying the label and for the accuracy of the information contained therein. If neither the  manufacturer nor his authorized agent is established in the Community, this obligation shall fall  on the person responsible for first placing the footwear on the Community market. The retailer  shall remain responsible for ensuring that the footwear sold by him bears the appropriate labelling  prescribed by this Directive. Article 5 Additional textual information, affixed, should the need arise, to the labelling may accompany the  information required under this Directive. However, Member States may not prohibit or impede the  placing on the market of footwear conforming to the requirements of this Directive, in accordance  with Article 3. Article 6 1. Member States shall adopt and publish the laws, regulations and administrative provisions  necessary to comply with this Directive by 23 September 1995 at the latest. They shall forthwith  inform the Commission thereof. 2. Member States shall apply the measures referred to in paragraph 1 from 23 March 1995. Stock  invoiced or delivered to the retailer before that date shall not be subject to the said measures  until 23 September 1997. 3. When Member States adopt these measures, they shall contain a reference to this Directive or be  accompanied by such reference on the occasion of their official publication. The methods of making  such a reference shall be laid down by the Member States. 4. The Commission shall submit to the Council, three years after this Directive has been brought  into application, an assessment report taking into consideration any difficulties which may have  been encountered by operators where implementing the provisions of this Directive and shall  present, should the need arise, appropriate proposals for review.

Definition and corresponding pictograms of the materials The pictograms concerning the  materials should appear on the label beside the pictograms relating to the 3 parts of the footwear  as specified in Article 4 and in part 1 of this Annex. Pictogram Written indications (a) (i) Leather A general term for hide or skin with its original fibrous structure more or less intact, tanned to  be rot-proof. The hair or wool may or may not have been removed. Leather is also made from a hide  or skin which has been split into layers or segmented either before or after tanning. However, if  the tanned hide or skin is disintegrated mechanically and/or chemically into fibrous particles,  small pieces or powders and then, with or without the combination of a binding agent, is made into  sheets or other forms, such sheets or forms are not leather. If the leather has a surface coating,  however applied, or a glued-on finish, such surface layers must not be thicker than 0,15 mm. Thus,  all leathers are covered without prejudice to other legal obligations, e.g. the Washington  Convention. Should the term 'full grain leather' be used in the optional additional textual information  referred to in Article 5, it will apply to a leather bearing the original grain surface as exposed  by removal of the epidermis and with none of the surface removed by buffing, snuffing or  splitting. >REFERENCE TO A GRAPHIC>F Cuir D Leder IT Cuoio NL Leder EN Leather DK Laeder GR AEAAÑÌÁ ES Cuero P Couros e peles curtidas Pictograms Written indications (a) (ii) Coated Leather leather where the surface coating applied to the leather does not exceed one third of the total  thickness of the product but is in excess of 0,15 mm. >REFERENCE TO A GRAPHIC>F Cuir enduit D Beschichtetes Leder IT Cuoio rivestito NL Gecoat leder EN Coated leather DK Overtrukket laeder GR AAÐAAÍAEAAAEÕÌAAÍÏ AEAAÑÌÁ ES Cuero untado P Couro revestido (b) Natural textile materials and synthetic or non-woven textile materials 'Textiles' shall mean all products covered by Directive 71/307/EEC and amendments thereof. >REFERENCE TO A GRAPHIC>F Textile D Textil IT Tessili NL Textiel EN Textile DK Tekstil-materialer GR ÕOEÁÓÌÁ ES Textil P Téxteis (c) All other materials >REFERENCE TO A GRAPHIC>F Autres matériaux D Sonstiges Material IT Altre materie NL Overige materialen EN Other materials DK Andre materialer GR ÁËËÁ ÕËÉÊÁ ES Otros materiales P Outros materiais  ANNEX II EXAMPLES OF FOOTWEAR COVERED BY THIS DIRECTIVE 'Footwear' may range from  sandals with uppers consisting simply of adjustable laces or ribbons to thigh boots the uppers of  which cover the leg and thigh.

It also helps to protect the industry from unfair competition and enhances the operation of the internal market in the European Union (EU).\nACT\n                  \nDirective 94/11/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 March 1994 on the approximation of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States relating to labelling of the materials used in the main components of footwear for sale to the consumer\nSUMMARY\nWHAT DOES THIS DIRECTIVE DO?\n                     \nIt lays down the rules for the labelling of footwear:\nthe content and form of the label;\nresponsibility for the labelling.\nKEY POINTS\nOnly materials covering 80 % or more of the surface areas of the upper, the lining and the sock of the footwear, as well as 80 % or more of the volume of the outer sole, need to be labelled. Where no single material accounts for at least 80 %, a label with information on the two main materials must be provided.\nThe labelling needs to provide information on the three components of the footwear:\nthe upper;\nthe lining and sock;\nthe outer sole.\nThe label may either be written or in the form of a pictogram.\nThe label must be visible, securely attached and accessible.\nThe label should be:\nprinted or embossed on the footwear; or\nattached to the footwear by means of, for example, an adhesive label; or\naffixed by means of, for example, a fastener or string.\nThe label must appear on at least one of the two items comprising the pair of shoes, boots, etc.\nEU manufacturers are responsible for supplying the label and for its accuracy or, where the footwear is imported, the person who first places it on the EU market assumes this responsibility. Retailers remain responsible for ensuring that the footwear they sell bears the appropriate labelling.\nThe annexes specify:\ndefinitions (an upper, a sole, etc.) and corresponding pictograms or written indications concerning the parts of the footwear to be identified (Annex I);\nexamples of the footwear covered by the directive are contained in Annex II. It does not, for example, cover footwear used by individuals for health and safety purposes in the workplace, which falls under EU rules on personal protective equipment.\nA voluntary EU eco-label also exists for footwear. This label helps consumers identify footwear whose life-cycle (production, use and disposal) has a low environmental impact.\nREFERENCES\nAct\nEntry into force\nDeadline for transposition in the Member States\nOfficial Journal\nDirective 94/11/EC\n9.5.1994\n23.9.1995\nOJ L 100, 19.4.1994, pp. 37-41\nAmending act(s)\nEntry into force\nDeadline for transposition in the Member States\nOfficial Journal\nDirective 2006/96/EC\n1.1.2007\n1.1.2007\nOJ L 363, 20.12.2006, pp. 81-106\nDirective 2013/15/EU\n1.7.2013\n1.7.2013\nOJ L 158, 10.6.2013, pp. 172-183\nSuccessive amendments to Directive 94/11/EC have been incorporated into the basic text.
