Since the Lisbon European Council (23-24 March 2000), which set the strategic goal of creating a competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy and specific objectives relating to ICT and education, several initiatives have been taken: the 2001 employment guidelines, the resolution relating to educational multimedia software, the communication on eLearning and the eLearning action plan. More recently, the Stockholm Council (23-24 March 2001) reaffirmed that improving basic skills, particularly IT skills, is a top priority for the EU.\nRELATED ACTS\nDecision No 2318/2003/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 5 December 2003 adopting a multiannual programme (2004 to 2006) for the effective integration of information and communication technologies (ICT) in education and training systems in Europe (eLearning Programme) [Official Journal L 345 of 31.12.2003].\nlast update 16.08.2010", "tags": ["vocational training", "teaching curriculum", "information technology", "Internet", "multimedia", "continuing education"], "subjects": ["Technology", "Education, vocational training and youth"], "split": "train", "reference_annotations": {}, "summary_annotations": {}}
