An offence shall be an extraditable offence if it is punishable under the laws of the requesting and requested States by deprivation of liberty for a maximum period of more than one year or by a more severe penalty. An offence shall also be an extraditable offence if it consists of an attempt or conspiracy to commit, or participation in the commission of, an extraditable offence. Where the request is for enforcement of the sentence of a person convicted of an extraditable offence, the deprivation of liberty remaining to be served must be at least four months.2. If extradition is granted for an extraditable offence, it shall also be granted for any other offence specified in the request if the latter offence is punishable by one year's deprivation of liberty or less, provided that all other requirements for extradition are met.3. For the purposes of this Article, an offence shall be considered an extraditable offence:(a) regardless of whether the laws in the requesting and requested States place the offence within the same category of offences or describe the offence by the same terminology;(b) regardless of whether the offence is one for which United States federal law requires the showing of such matters as interstate transportation, or use of the mails or of other facilities affecting interstate or foreign commerce, such matters being merely for the purpose of establishing jurisdiction in a United States federal court; and(c) in criminal cases relating to taxes, customs duties, currency control and the import or export of commodities, regardless of whether the laws of the requesting and requested States provide for the same kinds of taxes, customs duties, or controls on currency or on the import or export of the same kinds of commodities.4. If the offence has been committed outside the territory of the requesting State, extradition shall be granted, subject to the other applicable requirements for extradition, if the laws of the requested State provide for the punishment of an offence committed outside its territory in similar circumstances. If the laws of the requested State do not provide for the punishment of an offence committed outside its territory in similar circumstances, the executive authority of the requested State, at its discretion, may grant extradition provided that all other applicable requirements for extradition are met.Article 5Transmission and authentication of documents1. Requests for extradition and supporting documents shall be transmitted through the diplomatic channel, which shall include transmission as provided for in Article 7.2. Documents that bear the certificate or seal of the Ministry of Justice, or Ministry or Department responsible for foreign affairs, of the requesting State shall be admissible in extradition proceedings in the requested State without further certification, authentication, or other legalisation.Article 6Transmission of requests for provisional arrestRequests for provisional arrest may be made directly between the Ministries of Justice of the requesting and requested States, as an alternative to the diplomatic channel. The facilities of the International Criminal Police Organisation (Interpol) may also be used to transmit such a request.Article 7Transmission of documents following provisional arrest1. If the person whose extradition is sought is held under provisional arrest by the requested State, the requesting State may satisfy its obligation to transmit its request for extradition and supporting documents through the diplomatic channel pursuant to Article 5(1), by submitting the request and documents to the Embassy of the requested State located in the requesting State. In that case, the date of receipt of such request by the Embassy shall be considered to be the date of receipt by the requested State for purposes of applying the time limit that must be met under the applicable extradition treaty to enable the person's continued detention.2. Where a Member State on the date of signature of this Agreement, due to the established jurisprudence of its domestic legal system applicable at such date, cannot apply the measures referred to in paragraph 1, this Article shall not apply to it, until such time as that Member State and the United States of America, by exchange of diplomatic note, agree otherwise.Article 8Supplemental information1. The requested State may require the requesting State to furnish additional information within such reasonable length of time as it specifies, if it considers that the information furnished in support of the request for extradition is not sufficient to fulfil the requirements of the applicable extradition treaty.2. Such supplementary information may be requested and furnished directly between the Ministries of Justice of the States concerned.Article 9Temporary surrender1. If a request for extradition is granted in the case of a person who is being proceeded against or is serving a sentence in the requested State, the requested State may temporarily surrender the person sought to the requesting State for the purpose of prosecution.2. The person so surrendered shall be kept in custody in the requesting State and shall be returned to the requested State at the conclusion of the proceedings against that person, in accordance with the conditions to be determined by mutual agreement of the requesting and requested States. The time spent in custody in the territory of the requesting State pending prosecution in that State may be deducted from the time remaining to be served in the requested State.Article 10Requests for extradition or surrender made by several States1. If the requested State receives requests from the requesting State and from any other State or States for the extradition of the same person, either for the same offence or for different offences, the executive authority of the requested State shall determine to which State, if any, it will surrender the person.2. If a requested Member State receives an extradition request from the United States of America and a request for surrender pursuant to the European arrest warrant for the same person, either for the same offence or for different offences, the competent authority of the requested Member State shall determine to which State, if any, it will surrender the person. For this purpose, the competent authority shall be the requested Member State's executive authority if, under the bilateral extradition treaty in force between the United States and the Member State, decisions on competing requests are made by that authority; if not so provided in the bilateral extradition treaty, the competent authority shall be designated by the Member State concerned pursuant to Article 19.3. In making its decision under paragraphs 1 and 2, the requested State shall consider all of the relevant factors, including, but not limited to, factors already set forth in the applicable extradition treaty, and, where not already so set forth, the following:(a) whether the requests were made pursuant to a treaty;(b) the places where each of the offences was committed;(c) the respective interests of the requesting States;(d) the seriousness of the offences;(e) the nationality of the victim;(f) the possibility of any subsequent extradition between the requesting States; and(g) the chronological order in which the requests were received from the requesting States.Article 11Simplified extradition proceduresIf the person sought consents to be surrendered to the requesting State, the requested State may, in accordance with the principles and procedures provided for under its legal system, surrender the person as expeditiously as possible without further proceedings. The consent of the person sought may include agreement to waiver of protection of the rule of specialty.Article 12Transit1. A Member State may authorise transportation through its territory of a person surrendered to the United States of America by a third State, or by the United States of America to a third State. The United States of America may authorise transportation through its territory of a person surrendered to a Member State by a third State, or by a Member State to a third State.2. A request for transit shall be made through the diplomatic channel or directly between the United States Department of Justice and the Ministry of Justice of the Member State concerned. The facilities of Interpol may also be used to transmit such a request. The request shall contain a description of the person being transported and a brief statement of the facts of the case. A person in transit shall be detained in custody during the period of transit.3. Authorisation is not required when air transportation is used and no landing is scheduled on the territory of the transit State. If an unscheduled landing does occur, the State in which the unscheduled landing occurs may require a request for transit pursuant to paragraph 2. All measures necessary to prevent the person from absconding shall be taken until transit is effected, as long as the request for transit is received within 96 hours of the unscheduled landing.Article 13Capital punishmentWhere the offence for which extradition is sought is punishable by death under the laws in the requesting State and not punishable by death under the laws in the requested State, the requested State may grant extradition on the condition that the death penalty shall not be imposed on the person sought, or if for procedural reasons such condition cannot be complied with by the requesting State, on condition that the death penalty if imposed shall not be carried out. If the requesting State accepts extradition subject to conditions pursuant to this Article, it shall comply with the conditions. If the requesting State does not accept the conditions, the request for extradition may be denied.Article 14Sensitive information in a requestWhere the requesting State contemplates the submission of particularly sensitive information in support of its request for extradition, it may consult the requested State to determine the extent to which the information can be protected by the requested State. If the requested State cannot protect the information in the manner sought by the requesting State, the requesting State shall determine whether the information shall nonetheless be submitted.Article 15ConsultationsThe Contracting Parties shall, as appropriate, consult to enable the most effective use to be made of this Agreement, including to facilitate the resolution of any dispute regarding the interpretation or application of this Agreement.Article 16Temporal application1. This Agreement shall apply to offences committed before as well as after it enters into force.2. This Agreement shall apply to requests for extradition made after its entry into force. Nevertheless, Articles 4 and 9 shall apply to requests pending in a requested State at the time this Agreement enters into force.Article 17Non-derogation1. This Agreement is without prejudice to the invocation by the requested State of grounds for refusal relating to a matter not governed by this Agreement that is available pursuant to a bilateral extradition treaty in force between a Member State and the United States of America.2. Where the constitutional principles of, or final judicial decisions binding upon, the requested State may pose an impediment to fulfilment of its obligation to extradite, and resolution of the matter is not provided for in this Agreement or the applicable bilateral treaty, consultations shall take place between the requested and requesting States.Article 18Future bilateral extradition treaties with Member StatesThis Agreement shall not preclude the conclusion, after its entry into force, of bilateral Agreements between a Member State and the United States of America consistent with this Agreement.Article 19Designation and notificationThe European Union shall notify the United States of America of any designation pursuant to Article 2(3) and Article 10(2), prior to the exchange of written instruments described in Article 3(2) between the Member States and the United States of America.Article 20Territorial application1. This Agreement shall apply:(a) to the United States of America;(b) in relation to the European Union to:- Member States,- territories for whose external relations a Member State has responsibility, or countries that are not Member States for whom a Member State has other duties with respect to external relations, where agreed upon by exchange of diplomatic note between the Contracting Parties, duly confirmed by the relevant Member State.2. The application of this Agreement to any territory or country in respect of which extension has been made in accordance with subparagraph (b) of paragraph 1 may be terminated by either Contracting Party giving six months' written notice to the other Contracting Party through the diplomatic channel, where duly confirmed between the relevant Member State and the United States of America.Article 21ReviewThe Contracting Parties agree to carry out a common review of this Agreement as necessary, and in any event no later than five years after its entry into force.

This Agreement shall enter into force on the first day following the third month after the date on which the Contracting Parties have exchanged instruments indicating that they have completed their internal procedures for this purpose. These instruments shall also indicate that the steps specified in Article 3(2) have been completed.2. Either Contracting Party may terminate this Agreement at any time by giving written notice to the other Party, and such termination shall be effective six months after the date of such notice.In witness whereof the undersigned Plenipotentiaries have signed this AgreementDone at Washington DC on the twenty-fifth day of June in the year two thousand and three in duplicate in the Danish, Dutch, English, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Italian, Portuguese, Spanish and Swedish languages, each text being equally authentic.Por la Unión Europea/For Den Europæiske Union/Für die Europäische Union/Για την Ευρωπαϊκή Ένωση/For the European Union/Pour l'Union européenne/Per l'Unione europea/Voor de Europese Unie/Pela União Europeia/Euroopan unionin puolesta/På Europeiska unionens vägnar>PIC FILE= \"L_2003181EN.003201.TIF\">Por los Estados Unidos de América/For Amerikas Forenede Stater/Für die Vereinigten Staaten von Amerika/Για τις Ηνωμένες Πολιτείες της Αμερικής/For the United States of America/Pour les États-Unis d'Amérique/Per gli Stati Uniti d'America/Voor de Verenigde Staten van Amerika/Pelos Estados Unidos da América/Amerikan yhdysvaltojen puolesta/På Amerikas förenta staters vägnar>PIC FILE= \"L_2003181EN.003202.TIF\">Explanatory Note on the Agreement on Extradition between the European Union and the United States of AmericaThis Explanatory Note reflects understandings regarding the application of certain provisions of the Agreement on Extradition between the European Union and the United States of America (hereinafter \"the Agreement\") agreed between the Contracting Parties.On Article 10Article 10 is not intended to affect the obligations of States Parties to the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, nor to affect the rights of the United States of America as a non-Party with regard to the International Criminal Court.On Article 18Article 18 provides that the Agreement shall not preclude the conclusion, after its entry into force, of bilateral agreements on extradition between a Member State and the United States of America consistent with the Agreement.Should any measures set forth in the Agreement create an operational difficulty for either one or more Member States or the United States of America, such difficulty should in the first place be resolved, if possible, through consultations between the Member State or Member States concerned and the United States of America, or, if appropriate, through the consultation procedures set out in this Agreement. Where it is not possible to address such operational difficulty through consultations alone, it would be consistent with the Agreement for future bilateral agreements between the Member State or Member States and the United States of America to provide an operationally feasible alternative mechanism that would satisfy the objectives of the specific provision with respect to which the difficulty has arisen.", "summary": "Agreement with the United States on extradition\nAgreement with the United States on extradition\nSUMMARY OF:\nAgreement on extradition between the European Union and the USA\nDecision 2009/820/CFSP on the conclusion of the Agreements on extradition and on mutual legal assistance between the EU and the USA\nDecision 2003/516/EC on the signing of the Agreements on extradition and mutual legal assistance in criminal matters between the EU and the USA\nWHAT IS THE AIM OF THE AGREEMENT AND OF THE DECISION?\n              \nThe agreement lays down the conditions relating to the extradition of offenders between the EU and the US with a view to improving cooperation within their applicable extradition relations.\nThe decision concludes on behalf of the EU the agreement with the US on extradition.\nKEY POINTS\n              \nThe agreement supplements the bilateral extradition treaties between EU countries and the US and enhances cooperation in the context of applicable extradition relations.\nExtraditable offencesExtraditable offences consist of:\noffences that are punishable by deprivation of liberty for a maximum period (more than 1 year) or by a more severe penalty under the laws of both the requesting and requested country;\nan attempt to commit or participation in the commission of such an offence.\nIf the requested country grants extradition for an extraditable offence, it must also grant extradition for any other offence included in the request, provided that the other offence is punishable by deprivation of liberty for up to one year and that all the other requirements for extradition are fulfilled.\nExtradition requests\nThe requesting country transmits its requests for extradition and any supporting documents via the diplomatic channel. These documents need not be authenticated further if they bear the certificate or seal of the requesting country’s Ministry of Justice or Ministry or Department responsible for foreign affairs.\nThe requesting country may transmit requests for provisional arrest via the Ministries of Justice, instead of using the diplomatic channel. These requests may also be transmitted via the International Criminal Police Organization (Interpol). When the requesting country seeking the extradition of a person who already is under provisional arrest in the requested country, it may submit its request directly to the requested country’s embassy located on its territory.\nIf the requested country deems the information provided in the request for extradition is insufficient for carrying it out, it may require the requesting country to submit additional information. Requests for and transmissions of additional information may be done directly between the Ministries of Justice.\nExtradition procedures\nThe requested country may temporarily surrender a person who is being proceeded against or who is serving a sentence to the requesting country for prosecution.\nWhen several countries request the extradition of the same person for the same or different offences, the requested country’s executive authority decides to which country that person will be surrendered. Similarly, if the US submits an extradition request for a person whose surrender has also been requested pursuant to the European arrest warrant (EAW) for the same or different offences, the requested EU country’s competent authority decides to which country the person will be surrendered.\nHowever, when the extradition request from the US is addressed to an EU country which has rules in place granting its own nationals protection against extradition and the request concerns a national of another EU country, the executing judicial authority must inform the EU country of which the citizen in question is a national, and, where applicable, surrender the person to that country pursuant to its EAW, in accordance with the judgment of the Court of Justice in Case C-182/15 Petruhhin.\nArticle 18 TFEU and Article 21 TFEU must be interpreted as meaning that, when an EU country to which an EU citizen, a national of another EU country, has moved receives an extradition request from a non-EU country with which the first EU country has concluded an extradition agreement, it must inform the EU country of which the citizen in question is a national and, should that country so request, surrender that citizen to it, in accordance with Council Framework Decision 2002/584/JHA provided that that EU country has jurisdiction, pursuant to its national law, to prosecute that person for offences committed outside its national territory.\nWhere an EU country receives a request from a non-EU country seeking the extradition of a national of another EU country, that first EU country must verify that the extradition will not prejudice the rights referred to in Article 19 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. Consequently, the Court of Justice clarified in its judgment in Case C-191/16 Pisciotti: ‘In a case in which an EU citizen who has been the subject of a request for extradition to the US under the agreement on extradition between the EU and the US has been arrested in an EU country other than the country of which he is a national, for the purposes of potentially acceding to that request, Articles 18 and 21 TFEU must be interpreted as not precluding the requested EU country from drawing a distinction, on the basis of a rule of constitutional law, between its nationals and the nationals of other EU countries and from granting that extradition whilst not permitting extradition of its own nationals, provided that the requested EU country has already put the competent authorities of the EU country of which the citizen is a national in a position to seek the surrender of that citizen pursuant to a EAW and the latter EU country has not taken any action in that regard.’\nMoreover, the Court of Justice held in its judgment in Case C-247/17 Raugevicius: ‘Articles 18 and 21 TFEU must be interpreted as meaning that, where an extradition request has been made by a non-EU country for an EU citizen who has exercised his right to free movement, not for the purpose of prosecution, but for the purpose of enforcing a custodial sentence, the requested EU country, whose national law prohibits the extradition of its own nationals out of the EU for the purpose of enforcing a sentence and makes provision for the possibility that such a sentence pronounced abroad may be served on its territory, is required to ensure that that EU citizen, provided that he resides permanently in its territory, receives the same treatment as that accorded to its own nationals in relation to extradition.’\nThe requested country may use simplified extradition procedures, that is surrender a person without delay and further proceedings, when the person concerned consents to being surrendered.\nEU countries and the US may allow for the transit through their territories of a person surrendered to or by one or the other and a third country. Requests for transit may be made via the diplomatic channel, directly between the US Department of Justice and the EU country’s Ministry of Justice or via Interpol. No authorisation is needed for air transportation, provided that no landing is scheduled onto the territory of the transit country. In the case of an unscheduled landing, the country in question may require a request for transit.\nThe requested country may grant extradition for an offence that is punishable by death under the laws of the requesting country but not under its own laws on condition that: the death penalty will not be imposed;if the death penalty is imposed, it will not be carried out.\nDecision 2009/933/CFSP extends the territorial scope of the agreement on extradition between the EU and the US to the Netherlands Antilles and Aruba.\nDATE OF ENTRY INTO FORCE\n              \nThe agreement entered into force on 1 February 2010.\nBACKGROUND\n              \nFor more information, see:\nMutual legal assistance and extradition (European Commission).\nMAIN DOCUMENTS\n            \nAgreement on extradition between the European Union and the United States of America (OJ L 181, 19.7.2003, pp. 27-33)\nCouncil Decision 2009/820/CFSP of 23 October 2009 on the conclusion on behalf of the European Union of the Agreement on extradition between the European Union and the United States of America and the Agreement on mutual legal assistance between the European Union and the United States of America (OJ L 291, 7.11.2009, pp. 40-41)\nCouncil Decision 2003/516/EC of 6 June 2003 concerning the signature of the Agreements between the European Union and the United States of America on extradition and mutual legal assistance in criminal matters (OJ L 181, 19.7.2003, pp. 25-26)\nRELATED DOCUMENTS\n            \nCouncil Decision 2009/933/CFSP of 30 November 2009 on the extension, on behalf of the European Union, of the territorial scope of the Agreement on extradition between the European Union and the United States of America (OJ L 325, 11.12.2009, pp. 4-5)\nInformation concerning the date of entry into force of the Agreements on Extradition and on Mutual Legal Assistance between the European Union and the United States of America (OJ L 323, 10.12.2009, p. 11)\nCouncil Framework Decision 2002/584/JHA of 13 June 2002 on the European arrest warrant and the surrender procedures between Member States — Statements made by certain Member States on the adoption of the Framework Decision (OJ L 190, 18.7.2002, pp. 1-20)\nSuccessive amendments to Decision 2002/584/JHA have been incorporated into the original text.
