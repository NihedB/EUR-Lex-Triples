In the selection of safeguard measures, priority must be given to those which least disturb the functioning of the arrangements established in this Agreement. Safeguard measures applied in accordance with Article XIX GATT 1994 and the WTO Agreement on Safeguards shall preserve the level/margin of preference granted under this Agreement.(b) Where exceptional and critical circumstances requiring immediate action make prior information or examination, as the case may be, impossible, the Party concerned may, in the situations specified in this Article, apply forthwith provisional measures necessary to deal with the situation and shall inform the other Party immediately thereof.The safeguard measures shall be notified immediately to the Stabilisation and Association Council and shall be the subject of periodic consultations within that body, particularly with a view to establishing a timetable for their abolition as soon as circumstances permit.6.

In the selection of measures, priority must be given to those which least disturb the functioning of the arrangements in this Agreement. Such measures shall not be applied in a manner which would constitute a means of arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination where the same conditions prevail, or a disguised restriction on trade and shall be eliminated when the conditions no longer justify their maintenance.3. Before taking the measures provided for in paragraph 1 or, as soon as possible in cases to which paragraph 4 applies, the Community or Serbia, shall supply the Stabilisation and Association Council with all relevant information, with a view to seeking a solution acceptable to the Parties. The Parties within the Stabilisation and Association Council may agree on any means needed to put an end to the difficulties. If no agreement is reached within 30 days of the matter being referred to the Stabilisation and Association Council, the exporting Party may apply measures under this Article on the exportation of the product concerned.4.

Such prohibitions or restrictions shall not, however, constitute a means of arbitrary discrimination or a disguised restriction on trade between the Parties.Article 46Failure to provide administrative cooperation1. The Parties agree that administrative cooperation is essential for the implementation and the control of the preferential treatment granted under this Title and underline their commitment to combat irregularities and fraud in customs and related matters.2. Where a Party has made a finding, on the basis of objective information, of a failure to provide administrative cooperation and/or of irregularities or fraud under this Title, the Party concerned may temporarily suspend the relevant preferential treatment of the product(s) concerned in accordance with this Article.3. For the purpose of this Article a failure to provide administrative cooperation shall mean, inter alia:(a) a repeated failure to respect the obligations to verify the originating status of the product(s) concerned;(b) a repeated refusal or undue delay in carrying out and/or communicating the results of subsequent verification of the proof of origin;(c) a repeated refusal or undue delay in obtaining authorisation to conduct administrative cooperation missions to verify the authenticity of documents or accuracy of information relevant to the granting of the preferential treatment in question.For the purpose of this Article a finding of irregularities or fraud may be made, inter alia, where there is a rapid increase, without satisfactory explanation, in imports of goods exceeding the usual level of production and export capacity of the other Party, which is linked to objective information concerning irregularities or fraud.4. The application of a temporary suspension shall be subject to the following conditions:(a) the Party which has made a finding, on the basis of objective information, of a failure to provide administrative cooperation and/or of irregularities or fraud shall without undue delay notify the Stabilisation and Association Committee of its finding together with the objective information and enter into consultations within the Stabilisation and Association Committee, on the basis of all relevant information and objective findings, with a view to reaching a solution acceptable to both Parties.(b) Where the Parties have entered into consultations within the Stabilisation and Association Committee as above and have failed to agree on an acceptable solution within three months following the notification, the Party concerned may temporarily suspend the relevant preferential treatment of the product(s) concerned.

They shall not exceed a period of six months, which may be renewed. Temporary suspensions shall be notified immediately after their adoption to the Stabilisation and Association Committee. They shall be subject to periodic consultations within the Stabilisation and Association Committee in particular with a view to their termination as soon as the conditions for their application no longer prevail.5. At the same time as the notification to the Stabilisation and Association Committee under paragraph 4(a) of this Article, the Party concerned should publish a notice to importers in its Official Journal. The notice to importers should indicate for the product concerned that there is a finding, on the basis of objective information, of a failure to provide administrative cooperation and/or of irregularities or fraud.Article 47In case of error by the competent authorities in the proper management of the preferential system at export, and in particular in the application of the provisions of Protocol 3 to the present Agreement where this error leads to consequences in terms of import duties, the Contracting Party facing such consequences may request the Stabilisation and Association Council to examine the possibilities of adopting all appropriate measures with a view to resolving the situation.Article 48The application of this Agreement shall be without prejudice to the application of the provisions of Community law to the Canary Islands.TITLE VMOVEMENT OF WORKERS, ESTABLISHMENT, SUPPLY OF SERVICES, MOVEMENT OF CAPITALCHAPTER IMovement of workersArticle 491.

It may take all necessary measures to that end.Article 581. A Community company established in the territory of Serbia or a Serbian company established in the Community shall be entitled to employ, or have employed by one of its subsidiaries or branches, in accordance with the legislation in force in the host territory of establishment, in the territory of the Republic of Serbia and the Community respectively, employees who are nationals of the Member States or nationals from Serbia respectively, provided that such employees are key personnel as defined in paragraph 2 and that they are employed exclusively by companies, subsidiaries or branches. The residence and work permits of such employees shall cover only the period of such employment.2. Key personnel of the abovementioned companies herein referred to as \"organisations\" are \"intra-corporate transferees\" as defined in point (c) of this paragraph in the following categories, provided that the organisation is a legal person and that the persons concerned have been employed by it or have been partners in it (other than as majority shareholders), for at least one year immediately preceding such movement:(a) Persons working in a senior position with an organisation, who primarily direct the management of the establishment, receiving general supervision or direction principally from the board of directors or stockholders of the business or their equivalent including:(i) directing the establishment of a department or sub-division of the establishment;(ii) supervising and controlling the work of other supervisory, professional or managerial employees;(iii) having the authority personally to recruit and dismiss or recommend recruiting, dismissing or other personnel actions;(b) Persons working within an organisation who possess uncommon knowledge essential to the establishment’s service, research equipment, techniques or management.

The Community and Serbia undertake, in accordance with the following provisions, to take the necessary steps to allow progressively the supply of services by Community companies, Serbian companies or by Community nationals or nationals of Serbia which are established in the territory of a Party other than that of the person for whom the services are intended.2. In step with the liberalisation process mentioned in paragraph 1, the Parties shall permit the temporary movement of natural persons providing the service or who are employed by the service provider as key personnel as defined in Article 58, including natural persons who are representatives of a Community or Serbian company or national and are seeking temporary entry for the purpose of negotiating for the sale of services or entering into agreements to sell services for that service provider, where those representatives will not be engaged in making direct sales to the general public or in supplying services themselves.3. After four years, the Stabilisation and Association Council shall take the measures necessary to progressively implement the provisions of paragraph 1. Account shall be taken of the progress achieved by the Parties in the approximation of their laws.Article 601. The Parties shall not take any measures or actions which render the conditions for the supply of services by Community and Serbia nationals or companies which are established in a Party other than that of the person for whom the services are intended significantly more restrictive as compared to the situation existing on the day preceding the day of entry into force of this Agreement.2. If one Party is of the view that measures introduced by the other Party since the entry into force of this Agreement result in a situation which is significantly more restrictive in respect of supply of services as compared with the situation existing at the date of entry into force of this Agreement, such first Party may request the other Party to enter into consultations.Article 61With regard to supply of transport services between the Community and Serbia, the following provisions shall apply:1. With regard to land transport, Protocol 4 lays down the rules applicable to the relationship between the Parties in order to ensure, particularly, unrestricted road transit traffic across Serbia and the Community as a whole, the effective application of the principle of non discrimination and progressive harmonisation of the transport legislation of Serbia with that of the Community.2. With regard to international maritime transport, the Parties undertake to apply effectively the principle of unrestricted access to the international maritime markets and trades on a commercial basis, and to respect international and European obligations in the field of safety, security and environmental standards.The Parties affirm their commitment to a freely competitive environment as an essential feature of international maritime transport.3. In applying the principles of paragraph 2, the Parties shall:(a) not introduce cargo-sharing clauses in future bilateral Agreements with third countries;(b) abolish, upon the entry into force of this Agreement, all unilateral measures and administrative, technical and other obstacles that could have restrictive or discriminatory effects on the free supply of services in international maritime transport;(c) Each Party shall grant, inter alia, no less favourable treatment for the ships operated by nationals or companies of the other Party than that accorded to a Party’s own ships with regard to access to ports open to international trade, the use of infrastructure and auxiliary maritime services of the ports, as well as related fees and charges, customs facilities and the assignment of berths and facilities for loading and unloading.4. With a view to ensuring a coordinated development and progressive liberalisation of transport between the Parties adapted to their reciprocal commercial needs, the conditions of mutual market access in air transport shall be dealt with by the ECAA.5. Prior to the conclusion of the ECAA, the Parties shall not take any measures or actions which are more restrictive or discriminatory as compared with the situation existing prior to the entry into force of this Agreement.6. Serbia shall adapt its legislation, including administrative, technical and other rules, to that of the Community existing at any time in the field of air, maritime, inland waterway and land transport insofar as it serves liberalisation purposes and mutual access to markets of the Parties and facilitates the movement of passengers and of goods.7. In step with the common progress in the achievement of the objectives of this Chapter, the Stabilisation and Association Council shall examine ways of creating the conditions necessary for improving freedom to provide air, land and inland waterway transport services.CHAPTER IVCurrent payments and movement of capitalArticle 62The Parties undertake to authorise, in freely convertible currency, in accordance with the provisions of Article VIII of the Articles of the Agreement of the International Monetary Fund, any payments and transfers on the current account of balance of payments between the Community and Serbia.Article 631.

With regard to transactions on the capital and financial account of balance of payments, from the entry into force of this Agreement, the Parties shall ensure the free movement of capital relating to credits related to commercial transactions or to the provision of services in which a resident of one of the Parties is participating, and to financial loans and credits, with maturity longer than a year.3. As from the entry into force of this Agreement, Serbia shall authorise, by making full and expedient use of its existing procedures, the acquisition of real estate in Serbia by nationals of Member States of the European Union. Within four years from the entry into force of this Agreement, Serbia shall progressively adjust its legislation concerning the acquisition of real estate in its territory by nationals of the Member States of the European Union to ensure the same treatment as compared to its own nationals.4. The Community and Serbia shall also ensure, as from four years after the entry into force of this Agreement, free movement of capital relating to portfolio investment and financial loans and credits with maturity shorter than a year.5. Without prejudice to paragraph 1, the Parties shall not introduce any new restrictions on the movement of capital and current payments between residents of the Community and Serbia and shall not make the existing arrangements more restrictive.6.

Nothing in the above provisions shall be taken to limit the rights of economic operators of the Parties from benefiting from any more favourable treatment that may be provided for in any existing bilateral or multilateral Agreement involving Parties to this Agreement.8.

The provisions of this Title shall be applied subject to limitations justified on grounds of public policy, public security or public health.2. They shall not apply to activities that in the territory of any of the Parties are connected, even occasionally, with the exercise of official authority.Article 66For the purpose of this Title, nothing in this Agreement shall prevent the Parties from applying their laws and regulations regarding entry and stay, employment, working conditions, establishment of natural persons and supply of services, notably insofar as the granting, renewal or refusal of a residence permit is concerned, provided that, in so doing, they do not apply them in such a manner as to nullify or impair the benefits accruing to any Party under the terms of a specific provision of this Agreement. This provision shall be without prejudice to the application of Article 65.Article 67Companies which are controlled and exclusively owned jointly by Serbian companies, or nationals of Serbia and Community companies or nationals shall also be covered by the provisions of this Title.Article 681.

None of the provisions of this Title shall be construed to prevent the adoption or enforcement by the Parties of any measure aimed at preventing the avoidance or evasion of taxes pursuant to the tax provisions of Agreements to avoid double taxation and other tax arrangements or domestic fiscal legislation.3. None of the provisions of this Title shall be construed to prevent Member States or Serbia from applying the relevant provisions of their fiscal legislation, from distinguishing between taxpayers who are not in identical situations, in particular as regards their place of residence.Article 691. The Parties shall endeavour wherever possible to avoid the imposition of restrictive measures, including measures relating to imports, for balance of payments purposes. A Party adopting such measures shall present as soon as possible to the other Party a timetable for their removal.2. Where one or more Member States or Serbia is in serious balance of payments difficulties, or under imminent threat thereof, the Community and Serbia may, in accordance with the conditions established under the WTO Agreement, adopt restrictive measures, including measures relating to imports, which shall be of limited duration and may not go beyond what is strictly necessary to remedy the balance of payments situation. The Community and Serbia shall inform the other Party forthwith.3. Any restrictive measures shall not apply to transfers related to investment and in particular to the repatriation of amounts invested or reinvested or any kind of revenues stemming therefrom.Article 70The provisions of this Title shall be progressively adjusted, notably in the light of requirements arising from Article V of the GATS.Article 71The provisions of this Agreement shall not prejudice the application by any Party of any measure necessary to prevent the circumvention of its measures concerning third-country access to its market through the provisions of this Agreement.TITLE VIAPPROXIMATION OF LAWS, LAW ENFORCEMENT AND COMPETITION RULESArticle 721. The Parties recognise the importance of the approximation of the existing legislation in Serbia to that of the Community and of its effective implementation. Serbia shall endeavour to ensure that its existing laws and future legislation will be gradually made compatible with the Community acquis. Serbia shall ensure that existing and future legislation will be properly implemented and enforced.2. This approximation shall start on the date of signing of this Agreement, and shall gradually extend to all the elements of the Community acquis referred to in this Agreement by the end of the transitional period defined in Article 8 of this Agreement.3. Approximation will, at an early stage, focus on fundamental elements of the Internal Market acquis, Justice, Freedom and Security as well as on other trade-related areas. At a further stage, Serbia shall focus on the remaining parts of the acquis.Approximation shall be carried out on the basis of a programme to be agreed between the European Commission and Serbia.4. Serbia shall also define, in agreement with the European Commission, the detailed arrangements for the monitoring of the implementation of approximation of legislation and law enforcement actions to be taken.Article 73Competition and other economic provisions1. The following are incompatible with the proper functioning of this Agreement, insofar as they may affect trade between the Community and Serbia:(i) all Agreements between undertakings, decisions by associations of undertakings and concerted practices between undertakings which have as their object or effect the prevention, restriction or distortion of competition;(ii) abuse by one or more undertakings of a dominant position in the territories of the Community or Serbia as a whole or in a substantial part thereof;(iii) any State aid which distorts or threatens to distort competition by favouring certain undertakings or certain products.2. Any practices contrary to this Article shall be assessed on the basis of criteria arising from the application of the competition rules applicable in the Community, in particular from Articles 81, 82, 86 and 87 of the EC Treaty and interpretative instruments adopted by the Community institutions.3. The Parties shall ensure that an operationally independent authority is entrusted with the powers necessary for the full application of paragraph 1(i) and (ii) of this Article, regarding private and public undertakings and undertakings to which special rights have been granted.4. Serbia shall establish an operationally independent authority which is entrusted with the powers necessary for the full application of paragraph 1(iii) within one year from the date of entry into force of this Agreement. This authority shall have, inter alia, the powers to authorise State aid schemes and individual aid grants in conformity with paragraph 2, as well as the powers to order the recovery of State aid that has been unlawfully granted.5. The Community on one side and Serbia on the other side shall ensure transparency in the area of State aid, inter alia, by providing to the other Parties a regular annual report, or equivalent, following the methodology and the presentation of the Community survey on State aid. Upon request by one Party, the other Party shall provide information on particular individual cases of public aid.6. Serbia shall establish a comprehensive inventory of aid schemes instituted before the establishment of the authority referred to in paragraph 4 and shall align such aid schemes with the criteria referred to in paragraph 2 within a period of no more than 4 years from the entry into force of this Agreement.7. (a) For the purposes of applying the provisions of paragraph 1(iii), the Parties recognise that during the first five years after the entry into force of this Agreement, any public aid granted by Serbia shall be assessed taking into account the fact that Serbia shall be regarded as an area identical to those areas of the Community described in Article 87(3)(a) of the EC Treaty.(b) Within four years from the entry into force of this Agreement, Serbia shall submit to the European Commission its GDP per capita figures harmonised at NUTS II level. The authority referred to in paragraph 4 and the European Commission shall then jointly evaluate the eligibility of the regions of Serbia as well as the maximum aid intensities in relation thereto in order to draw up the regional aid map on the basis of the relevant Community guidelines.8. As appropriate, Protocol 5 establishes the rules on state aid in the steel industry. This Protocol establishes the rules applicable in the event restructuring aid is granted to the steel industry. It would stress the exceptional character of such aid and the fact that the aid would be limited in time and would be linked to capacity reductions within the framework of feasibility programmes.9.

If traditional expressions listed in Appendix 2 are homonymous, protection shall be granted to each expression provided it has been used in good faith and does not mislead consumers as to the actual origin of the wine. The Parties shall mutually decide the practical conditions of use under which the homonymous traditional expressions will be differentiated from each other, taking into account the need to ensure equitable treatment of the producers concerned and that consumers are not mislead.5.

For the purpose of implementing this Agreement, the following products shall be considered as originating in the Community:(a) products wholly obtained in the Community within the meaning of Article 5;(b) products obtained in the Community incorporating materials which have not been wholly obtained there, provided that such materials have undergone sufficient working or processing in the Community within the meaning of Article 6.2. For the purpose of implementing this Agreement, the following products shall be considered as originating in Serbia:(a) products wholly obtained in Serbia within the meaning of Article 5;(b) products obtained in Serbia incorporating materials which have not been wholly obtained there, provided that such materials have undergone sufficient working or processing in Serbia within the meaning of Article 6.Article 3Cumulation in the Community1. Without prejudice to the provisions of Article 2(1), products shall be considered as originating in the Community if such products are obtained there, incorporating materials originating in Serbia, in the Community or in any country or territory participating in the European Union’s Stabilisation and Association process [1], or incorporating the materials originating in Turkey to which the Decision 1/95/EC of the EC-Turkey Association Council of 22 December 1995 [2] applies, provided that the working or processing carried out in the Community goes beyond the operations referred to in Article 7. It shall not be necessary that such materials have undergone sufficient working or processing.2. Where the working or processing carried out in the Community does not go beyond the operations referred to in Article 7, the product obtained shall be considered as originating in the Community only where the value added there is greater than the value of the materials used originating in any one of the other countries or territories referred to in paragraph 1. If this is not so, the product obtained shall be considered as originating in the country which accounts for the highest value of originating materials used in the manufacture in the Community.3. Products, originating in one of the countries or territories referred to in paragraph 1, which do not undergo any working or processing in the Community, retain their origin if exported into one of these countries or territories.4. The cumulation provided for in this Article may be applied only provided that:(a) a preferential trade Agreement in accordance with Article XXIV of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) is applicable between the countries or territories involved in the acquisition of the originating status and the country of destination;(b) materials and products have acquired originating status by the application of rules of origin identical to those given in this Protocol;and(c) notices indicating the fulfilment of the necessary requirements to apply cumulation have been published in the Official Journal of the European Union (C series) and in Serbia according to its own procedures.The cumulation provided for in this Article shall apply from the date indicated in the notice published in the Official Journal of the European Union (C series).The Community shall provide Serbia, through the European Commission with details of the Agreements and their corresponding rules of origin, which are applied with the other countries or territories referred to in paragraph 1.The products in Annex V shall be excluded from the cumulation provided for in this Article.Article 4Cumulation in Serbia1. Without prejudice to the provisions of Article 2(2), products shall be considered as originating in Serbia if such products are obtained there, incorporating materials originating in the Community, Serbia or in any country or territory participating in the European Union’s Stabilisation and Association Process [1] or incorporating the materials originating in Turkey to which the Decision 1/95/EC of the EC-Turkey Association Council of 22 December 1995 [2] applies, provided that the working or processing carried out in Serbia goes beyond the operations referred to in Article 7. It shall not be necessary that such materials have undergone sufficient working or processing.2. Where the working or processing carried out in Serbia does not go beyond the operations referred to in Article 7, the product obtained shall be considered as originating in Serbia only where the value added there is greater than the value of the materials used originating in any one of the other countries or territories referred to in paragraph 1. If this is not so, the product obtained shall be considered as originating in the country which accounts for the highest value of originating materials used in the manufacture in Serbia.3. Products, originating in one of the countries or territories referred to in paragraph 1, which do not undergo any working or processing in Serbia, retain their origin if exported into one of these countries or territories.4. The cumulation provided for in this Article may be applied only provided that:(a) a preferential trade Agreement in accordance with Article XXIV of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) is applicable between the countries or territories involved in the acquisition of the originating status and the country of destination;(b) materials and products have acquired originating status by the application of rules of origin identical to those given in this Protocol;and(c) notices indicating the fulfilment of the necessary requirements to apply cumulation have been published in the Official Journal of the European Union (C series) and in Serbia according to its own procedures.The cumulation provided for in this Article shall apply from the date indicated in the notice published in the Official Journal of the European Union (C series).Serbia shall provide the Community, through the European Commission, with details of the Agreements, including their dates of entry into force, and their corresponding rules of origin, which are applied with the other countries or territories referred to in paragraph 1.The products in Annex V shall be excluded from the cumulation provided for in this Article.Article 5Wholly obtained products1. The following shall be considered as wholly obtained in the Community or in Serbia:(a) mineral products extracted from their soil or from their seabed;(b) vegetable products harvested there;(c) live animals born and raised there;(d) products from live animals raised there;(e) products obtained by hunting or fishing conducted there;(f) products of sea fishing and other products taken from the sea outside the territorial waters of the Community or of Serbia by their vessels;(g) products made aboard their factory ships exclusively from products referred to in (f);(h) used articles collected there fit only for the recovery of raw materials, including used tyres fit only for retreading or for use as waste;(i) waste and scrap resulting from manufacturing operations conducted there;(j) products extracted from marine soil or subsoil outside their territorial waters provided that they have sole rights to work that soil or subsoil;(k) goods produced there exclusively from the products specified in points (a) to (j).2.

For the purposes of Article 2, products which are not wholly obtained are considered to be sufficiently worked or processed when the conditions set out in the list in Annex II are fulfilled.The conditions referred to above indicate, for all products covered by this Agreement, the working or processing which must be carried out on non-originating materials used in manufacturing and apply only in relation to such materials. It follows that if a product which has acquired originating status by fulfilling the conditions set out in the list is used in the manufacture of another product, the conditions applicable to the product in which it is incorporated do not apply to it, and no account shall be taken of the non-originating materials which may have been used in its manufacture.2. Notwithstanding paragraph 1, non-originating materials which, according to the conditions set out in the list, should not be used in the manufacture of a product may nevertheless be used, provided that:(a) their total value does not exceed 10 % of the ex-works price of the product;(b) any of the percentages given in the list for the maximum value of non-originating materials are not exceeded through the application of this paragraph.This paragraph shall not apply to products falling within Chapters 50 to 63 of the Harmonised System.3. Paragraphs 1 and 2 shall apply subject to the provisions of Article 7.Article 7Insufficient working or processing1. Without prejudice to paragraph 2 of this Article, the following operations shall be considered as insufficient working or processing to confer the status of originating products, whether or not the requirements of Article 6 are satisfied:(a) preserving operations to ensure that the products remain in good condition during transport and storage;(b) breaking-up and assembly of packages;(c) washing, cleaning; removal of dust, oxide, oil, paint or other coverings;(d) ironing or pressing of textiles;(e) simple painting and polishing operations;(f) husking, partial or total bleaching, polishing, and glazing of cereals and rice;(g) operations to colour sugar or form sugar lumps;(h) peeling, stoning and shelling, of fruits, nuts and vegetables;(i) sharpening, simple grinding or simple cutting;(j) sifting, screening, sorting, classifying, grading, matching; (including the making-up of sets of articles);(k) simple placing in bottles, cans, flasks, bags, cases, boxes, fixing on cards or boards and all other simple packaging operations;(l) affixing or printing marks, labels, logos and other like distinguishing signs on products or their packaging;(m) simple mixing of products, whether or not of different kinds; mixing of sugar with any other material;(n) simple assembly of parts of articles to constitute a complete article or disassembly of products into parts;(o) a combination of two or more operations specified in points (a) to (n);(p) slaughter of animals.2. All operations carried out either in the Community or in Serbia on a given product shall be considered together when determining whether the working or processing undergone by that product is to be regarded as insufficient within the meaning of paragraph 1.Article 8Unit of qualification1. The unit of qualification for the application of the provisions of this Protocol shall be the particular product which is considered as the basic unit when determining classification using the nomenclature of the Harmonised System.It follows that:(a) when a product composed of a group or assembly of articles is classified under the terms of the Harmonised System in a single heading, the whole constitutes the unit of qualification;(b) when a consignment consists of a number of identical products classified under the same heading of the Harmonised System, each product must be taken individually when applying the provisions of this Protocol.2. Where, under General Rule 5 of the Harmonised System, packaging is included with the product for classification purposes, it shall be included for the purposes of determining origin.Article 9Accessories, spare parts and toolsAccessories, spare parts and tools dispatched with a piece of equipment, machine, apparatus or vehicle, which are part of the normal equipment and included in the price thereof or which are not separately invoiced, shall be regarded as one with the piece of equipment, machine, apparatus or vehicle in question.Article 10SetsSets, as defined in General Rule 3 of the Harmonised System, shall be regarded as originating when all component products are originating. Nevertheless, when a set is composed of originating and non-originating products, the set as a whole shall be regarded as originating, provided that the value of the non-originating products does not exceed 15 per cent of the ex-works price of the set.Article 11Neutral elementsIn order to determine whether a product originates, it shall not be necessary to determine the origin of the following which might be used in its manufacture:(a) energy and fuel;(b) plant and equipment;(c) machines and tools;(d) goods which do not enter and which are not intended to enter into the final composition of the product.TITLE IIITERRITORIAL REQUIREMENTSArticle 12Principle of territoriality1. Except as provided for in Articles 3 and 4 and paragraph 3 of this Article, the conditions for acquiring originating status set out in Title II must be fulfilled without interruption in the Community or in Serbia.2. Except as provided for in Articles 3 and 4, where originating goods exported from the Community or from Serbia to another country return, they must be considered as non-originating, unless it can be demonstrated to the satisfaction of the customs authorities that:(a) the returning goods are the same as those exported;and(b) they have not undergone any operation beyond that necessary to preserve them in good condition while in that country or while being exported.3. The acquisition of originating status in accordance with the conditions set out in Title II shall not be affected by working or processing done outside the Community or Serbia on materials exported from the Community or from Serbia and subsequently re-imported there, provided:(a) the said materials are wholly obtained in the Community or in Serbia or have undergone working or processing beyond the operations referred to in Article 7 prior to being exported;and(b) it can be demonstrated to the satisfaction of the customs authorities that:(i) the re-imported goods have been obtained by working or processing the exported materials;and(ii) the total added value acquired outside the Community or Serbia by applying the provisions of this Article does not exceed 10 % of the ex-works price of the end product for which originating status is claimed.4. For the purposes of paragraph 3, the conditions for acquiring originating status set out in Title II shall not apply to working or processing done outside the Community or Serbia, but where, in the list in Annex II, a rule setting a maximum value for all the non-originating materials incorporated is applied in determining the originating status of the end product, the total value of the non-originating materials incorporated in the territory of the party concerned, taken together with the total added value acquired outside the Community or Serbia by applying the provisions of this Article, shall not exceed the stated percentage.5. For the purposes of applying the provisions of paragraphs 3 and 4, \"total added value\" shall be taken to mean all costs arising outside the Community or Serbia, including the value of the materials incorporated there.6. The provisions of paragraphs 3 and 4 shall not apply to products which do not fulfil the conditions set out in the list in Annex II or which can be considered sufficiently worked or processed only if the general tolerance fixed in Article 6(2) is applied.7. The provisions of paragraphs 3 and 4 shall not apply to products of Chapters 50 to63 of the Harmonised System.8. Any working or processing of the kind covered by the provisions of this Article and done outside the Community or Serbia shall be done under the outward processing arrangements, or similar arrangements.Article 13Direct transport1.

For this purpose, the exporter or his authorised representative shall fill out both the movement certificate EUR.1 and the application form, specimens of which appear in Annex III. These forms shall be completed in one of the languages in which this Agreement is drawn up and in accordance with the provisions of the domestic law of the exporting country. If they are hand-written, they shall be completed in ink in printed characters. The description of the products must be given in the box reserved for this purpose without leaving any blank lines. Where the box is not completely filled, a horizontal line must be drawn below the last line of the description, the empty space being crossed through.3. The exporter applying for the issue of a movement certificate EUR.1 shall be prepared to submit at any time, at the request of the customs authorities of the exporting country where the movement certificate EUR.1 is issued, all appropriate documents proving the originating status of the products concerned as well as the fulfilment of the other requirements of this Protocol.4. A movement certificate EUR.1 shall be issued by the customs authorities of a Member State of the Community or of Serbia if the products concerned can be considered as products originating in the Community, Serbia or in one of the other countries or territories referred to in Articles 3 and 4 and fulfil the other requirements of this Protocol.5. The customs authorities issuing movement certificates EUR.1 shall take any steps necessary to verify the originating status of the products and the fulfilment of the other requirements of this Protocol. For this purpose, they shall have the right to call for any evidence and to carry out any inspection of the exporter’s accounts or any other check considered appropriate. They shall also ensure that the forms referred to in paragraph 2 are duly completed. In particular, they shall check whether the space reserved for the description of the products has been completed in such a manner as to exclude all possibility of fraudulent additions.6. The date of issue of the movement certificate EUR.1 shall be indicated in Box 11 of the certificate.7. A movement certificate EUR.1 shall be issued by the customs authorities and made available to the exporter as soon as actual exportation has been effected or ensured.Article 18Movement certificates EUR.1 issued retrospectively1.

The replacement movement certificate(s) EUR.1 shall be issued by the customs office under whose control the products are placed.Article 21Accounting segregation1. Where considerable cost or material difficulties arise in keeping separate stocks of originating and non-originating materials which are identical and interchangeable, the customs authorities may, at the written request of those concerned, authorise the so-called \"accounting segregation\" method to be used for managing such stocks.2. This method must be able to ensure that, for a specific reference-period, the number of products obtained which could be considered as \"originating\" is the same as that which would have been obtained if there had been physical segregation of the stocks.3. The customs authorities may grant such authorisation, subject to any conditions deemed appropriate.4. This method is recorded and applied on the basis of the general accounting principles applicable in the country where the product was manufactured.5. The beneficiary of this facilitation may issue or apply for proofs of origin, as the case may be, for the quantity of products which may be considered as originating. At the request of the customs authorities, the beneficiary shall provide a statement of how the quantities have been managed.6. The customs authorities shall monitor the use made of the authorisation and may withdraw it at any time whenever the beneficiary makes improper use of the authorisation in any manner whatsoever or fails to fulfil any of the other conditions laid down in this Protocol.Article 22Conditions for making out an invoice declaration1.

If the declaration is hand-written, it shall be written in ink in printed characters.5. Invoice declarations shall bear the original signature of the exporter in manuscript. However, an approved exporter within the meaning of Article 23 shall not be required to sign such declarations provided that he gives the customs authorities of the exporting country a written undertaking that he accepts full responsibility for any invoice declaration which identifies him as if it had been signed in manuscript by him.6. An invoice declaration may be made out by the exporter when the products to which it relates are exported, or after exportation on condition that it is presented in the importing country no longer than two years after the importation of the products to which it relates.Article 23Approved exporter1. The customs authorities of the exporting country may authorise any exporter, hereinafter referred to as \"approved exporter\", who makes frequent shipments of products under this Agreement to make out invoice declarations irrespective of the value of the products concerned.

A proof of origin shall be valid for four months from the date of issue in the exporting country, and must be submitted within the said period to the customs authorities of the importing country.2. Proofs of origin which are submitted to the customs authorities of the importing country after the final date for presentation specified in paragraph 1 may be accepted for the purpose of applying preferential treatment, where the failure to submit these documents by the final date set is due to exceptional circumstances.3. In other cases of belated presentation, the customs authorities of the importing country may accept the proofs of origin where the products have been submitted before the said final date.Article 25Submission of proof of originProofs of origin shall be submitted to the customs authorities of the importing country in accordance with the procedures applicable in that country. The said authorities may require a translation of a proof of origin and may also require the import declaration to be accompanied by a statement from the importer to the effect that the products meet the conditions required for the implementation of this Agreement.Article 26Importation by instalmentsWhere, at the request of the importer and on the conditions laid down by the customs authorities of the importing country, dismantled or non-assembled products within the meaning of General Rule 2(a) of the Harmonised System falling within Sections XVI and XVII or headings 7308 and 9406 of the Harmonised System are imported by instalments, a single proof of origin for such products shall be submitted to the customs authorities upon importation of the first instalment.Article 27Exemptions from proof of origin1.

In the case of products sent by post, this declaration can be made on the customs declaration CN22/CN23 or on a sheet of paper annexed to that document.2. Imports which are occasional and consist solely of products for the personal use of the recipients or travellers or their families shall not be considered as imports by way of trade if it is evident from the nature and quantity of the products that no commercial purpose is in view.3. Furthermore, the total value of these products shall not exceed EUR 500 in the case of small packages or EUR 1200 in the case of products forming part of travellers’ personal luggage.Article 28Supporting documents+The documents referred to in Articles 17(3) and 22(3) used for the purpose of proving that products covered by a movement certificate EUR.1 or an invoice declaration can be considered as products originating in the Community, in Serbia or in one of the other countries or territories referred to in Articles 3 and 4 and fulfil the other requirements of this Protocol may consist, inter alia, of the following:(a) direct evidence of the processes carried out by the exporter or supplier to obtain the goods concerned, contained for example in his accounts or internal book-keeping;(b) documents proving the originating status of materials used, issued or made out in the Community or in Serbia where these documents are used in accordance with domestic law;(c) documents proving the working or processing of materials in the Community or in Serbia, issued or made out in the Community or in Serbia, where these documents are used in accordance with domestic law;(d) movement certificates EUR.1 or invoice declarations proving the originating status of materials used, issued or made out in the Community or in Serbia in accordance with this Protocol, or in one of the other countries or territories referred to in Articles 3 and 4, in accordance with rules of origin which are identical to the rules in this Protocol;(e) appropriate evidence concerning working or processing undergone outside the Community or Serbia by application of Article 12, proving that the requirements of that Article have been satisfied.Article 29Preservation of proof of origin and supporting documents1.

The discovery of slight discrepancies between the statements made in the proof of origin and those made in the documents submitted to the customs office for the purpose of carrying out the formalities for importing the products shall not ipso facto render the proof of origin null and void if it is duly established that this document does correspond to the products submitted.2. Obvious formal errors such as typing errors on a proof of origin should not cause this document to be rejected if these errors are not such as to create doubts concerning the correctness of the statements made in the document.Article 31Amounts expressed in euro1. For the application of the provisions of Article 22(1)(b) and Article 27(3) in cases where products are invoiced in a currency other than euro, amounts in the national currencies of the Member States of the Community, of Serbia and of the other countries or territories referred to in Articles 3 and 4 equivalent to the amounts expressed in euro shall be fixed annually by each of the countries concerned.2. A consignment shall benefit from the provisions of Article 22(1)(b) or Article 27(3) by reference to the currency in which the invoice is drawn up, according to the amount fixed by the country concerned.3. The amounts to be used in any given national currency shall be the equivalent in that currency of the amounts expressed in euro as at the first working day of October. The amounts shall be communicated to the European Commission by 15 October and shall apply from 1 January the following year. The European Commission shall notify all countries concerned of the relevant amounts.4. A country may round up or down the amount resulting from the conversion into its national currency of an amount expressed in euro. The rounded-off amount may not differ from the amount resulting from the conversion by more than 5 %. A country may retain unchanged its national currency equivalent of an amount expressed in euro if, at the time of the annual adjustment provided for in paragraph 3, the conversion of that amount, prior to any rounding-off, results in an increase of less than 15 % in the national currency equivalent. The national currency equivalent may be retained unchanged if the conversion would result in a decrease in that equivalent value.5. The amounts expressed in euro shall be reviewed by the Stabilisation and Association Committee at the request of the Community or of Serbia. When carrying out this review, the Stabilisation and Association Committee shall consider the desirability of preserving the effects of the limits concerned in real terms. For this purpose, it may decide to modify the amounts expressed in euro.TITLE VIARRANGEMENTS FOR ADMINISTRATIVE COOPERATIONArticle 32Mutual assistance1. The customs authorities of the Member States of the Community and of Serbia shall provide each other, through the European Commission, with specimen impressions of stamps used in their customs offices for the issue of movement certificates EUR.1 and with the addresses of the customs authorities responsible for verifying those certificates and invoice declarations.2. In order to ensure the proper application of this Protocol, the Community and Serbia shall assist each other, through the competent customs administrations, in checking the authenticity of the movement certificates EUR.1 or the invoice declarations and the correctness of the information given in these documents.Article 33Verification of proofs of origin1. Subsequent verifications of proofs of origin shall be carried out at random or whenever the customs authorities of the importing country have reasonable doubts as to the authenticity of such documents, the originating status of the products concerned or the fulfilment of the other requirements of this Protocol.2. For the purposes of implementing the provisions of paragraph 1, the customs authorities of the importing country shall return the movement certificate EUR.1 and the invoice, if it has been submitted, the invoice declaration, or a copy of these documents, to the customs authorities of the exporting country giving, where appropriate, the reasons for the enquiry. Any documents and information obtained suggesting that the information given on the proof of origin is incorrect shall be forwarded in support of the request for verification.3. The verification shall be carried out by the customs authorities of the exporting country. For this purpose, they shall have the right to call for any evidence and to carry out any inspection of the exporter’s accounts or any other check considered appropriate.4. If the customs authorities of the importing country decide to suspend the granting of preferential treatment to the products concerned while awaiting the results of the verification, release of the products shall be offered to the importer subject to any precautionary measures judged necessary.5. The customs authorities requesting the verification shall be informed of the results of this verification as soon as possible. These results must indicate clearly whether the documents are authentic and whether the products concerned can be considered as products originating in the Community, in Serbia or in one of the other countries or territories referred to in Articles 3 and 4 and fulfil the other requirements of this Protocol.6. If in cases of reasonable doubt there is no reply within 10 months of the date of the verification request or if the reply does not contain sufficient information to determine the authenticity of the document in question or the real origin of the products, the requesting customs authorities shall, except in exceptional circumstances, refuse entitlement to the preferences.Article 34Dispute settlementWhere disputes arise in relation to the verification procedures of Article 33 which cannot be settled between the customs authorities requesting a verification and the customs authorities responsible for carrying out this verification or where they raise a question as to the interpretation of this Protocol, they shall be submitted to the Stabilisation and Association Committee.In all cases the settlement of disputes between the importer and the customs authorities of the importing country shall be under the legislation of the said country.Article 35PenaltiesPenalties shall be imposed on any person who draws up, or causes to be drawn up, a document which contains incorrect information for the purpose of obtaining a preferential treatment for products.Article 36Free zones1. The Community and Serbia shall take all necessary steps to ensure that products traded under cover of a proof of origin which in the course of transport use a free zone situated in their territory, are not substituted by other goods and do not undergo handling other than normal operations designed to prevent their deterioration.2. By means of an exemption to the provisions contained in paragraph 1, when products originating in the Community or in Serbia are imported into a free zone under cover of a proof of origin and undergo treatment or processing, the authorities concerned shall issue a new movement certificate EUR.1 at the exporter’s request, if the treatment or processing undergone is in conformity with the provisions of this Protocol.TITLE VIICEUTA AND MELILLAArticle 37Application of this Protocol1. The term \"Community\" used in Article 2 does not cover Ceuta or Melilla.2. Products originating in Serbia, when imported into Ceuta and Melilla, shall enjoy in all respects the same customs regime as that which is applied to products originating in the customs territory of the Community under Protocol 2 of the Act of Accession of the Kingdom of Spain and the Portuguese Republic to the European Communities. Serbia shall grant to imports of products covered by this Agreement and originating in Ceuta and Melilla the same customs regime as that which is granted to products imported from and originating in the Community.3. For the purpose of the application of paragraph 2 concerning products originating in Ceuta and Melilla, this Protocol shall apply mutatis mutandis subject to the special conditions set out in Article 38.Article 38Special conditions1. Providing they have been transported directly in accordance with the provisions of Article 13, the following shall be considered as:1.1. products originating in Ceuta and Melilla:(a) products wholly obtained in Ceuta and Melilla;(b) products obtained in Ceuta and Melilla in the manufacture of which products other than those referred to in point (a) are used, provided that:(i) the said products have undergone sufficient working or processing within the meaning of Article 6;or that(ii) those products are originating in Serbia or in the Community, provided that they have been submitted to working or processing which goes beyond the operations referred to in Article 7;1.2. products originating in Serbia:(a) products wholly obtained in Serbia;(b) products obtained in Serbia, in the manufacture of which products other than those referred to in point (a) are used, provided that:(i) the said products have undergone sufficient working or processing within the meaning of Article 6;or that(ii) those products are originating in Ceuta and Melilla or in the Community, provided that they have been submitted to working or processing which goes beyond the operations referred to in Article 7.2. Ceuta and Melilla shall be considered as a single territory.3. The exporter or his authorised representative shall enter \"Serbia\" and \"Ceuta and Melilla\" in Box 2 of movement certificates EUR. 1 or on invoice declarations. n addition, in the case of products originating in Ceuta and Melilla, this shall be indicated in Box 4 of movement certificates EUR.1 or on invoice declarations.4. The Spanish customs authorities shall be responsible for the application of this Protocol in Ceuta and Melilla.TITLE VIIIFINAL PROVISIONSArticle 39Amendments to this ProtocolThe Stabilisation and Association Council may decide to amend the provisions of this Protocol.[1] As defined in the Conclusions of the General Affairs Council in April 1997 and Commission Communication of May 1999 on the establishment of the Stabilisation and Association process with Western Balkan countries.[2] Decision 1/95/EC of the EC-Turkey Association Council of 22 December 1995 applies to products other than agricultural products as defined in the Agreement establishing an Association between the European Economic Community and Turkey and other than coal and steel products as defined in the Agreement between the European Coal and Steel Community and the Republic of Turkey on trade in products covered by the treaty establishing the European Coal and Steel Community.--------------------------------------------------ANNEX I TO PROTOCOL 3INTRODUCTORY NOTES TO THE LIST IN ANNEX IINote 1The list sets out the conditions required for all products to be considered as sufficiently worked or processed within the meaning of Article 6 of Protocol 3.Note 22.1. The first two columns in the list describe the product obtained. The first column gives the heading number or chapter number used in the Harmonised System and the second column gives the description of goods used in that system for that heading or chapter. For each entry in the first two columns, a rule is specified in column 3 or 4. Where, in some cases, the entry in the first column is preceded by an \"ex\", this signifies that the rules in column 3 or 4 apply only to the part of that heading as described in column 2.2.2. Where several heading numbers are grouped together in column 1 or a chapter number is given and the description of products in column 2 is therefore given in general terms, the adjacent rules in column 3 or 4 apply to all products which, under the Harmonised System, are classified in headings of the chapter or in any of the headings grouped together in column 1.2.3. Where there are different rules in the list applying to different products within a heading, each indent contains the description of that part of the heading covered by the adjacent rules in column 3 or 4.2.4. Where, for an entry in the first two columns, a rule is specified in both columns 3 and 4, the exporter may opt, as an alternative, to apply either the rule set out in column 3 or that set out in column 4. If no origin rule is given in column 4, the rule set out in column 3 is to be applied.Note 33.1. The provisions of Article 6 of Protocol 3, concerning products having acquired originating status which are used in the manufacture of other products, shall apply, regardless of whether this status has been acquired inside the factory where these products are used or in another factory in a contracting party.Example:An engine of heading 8407, for which the rule states that the value of the non-originating materials which may be incorporated may not exceed 40 per cent of the ex-works price, is made from \"other alloy steel roughly shaped by forging\" of heading ex7224.If this forging has been forged in the Community from a non-originating ingot, it has already acquired originating status by virtue of the rule for heading ex7224 in the list. The forging can then count as originating in the value-calculation for the engine, regardless of whether it was produced in the same factory or in another factory in the Community. The value of the non-originating ingot is thus not taken into account when adding up the value of the non-originating materials used.3.2. The rule in the list represents the minimum amount of working or processing required, and the carrying-out of more working or processing also confers originating status; conversely, the carrying-out of less working or processing cannot confer originating status. Thus, if a rule provides that non-originating material, at a certain level of manufacture, may be used, the use of such material at an earlier stage of manufacture is allowed, and the use of such material at a later stage is not.3.3. Without prejudice to Note 3.2, where a rule uses the expression \"Manufacture from materials of any heading\", then materials of any heading(s) (even materials of the same description and heading as the product) may be used, subject, however, to any specific limitations which may also be contained in the rule.However, the expression \"Manufacture from materials of any heading, including other materials of heading …\" or \"Manufacture from materials of any heading, including other materials of the same heading as the product\" means that materials of any heading(s) may be used, except those of the same description as the product as given in column 2 of the list.3.4. When a rule in the list specifies that a product may be manufactured from more than one material, this means that one or more materials may be used. It does not require that all be used.Example:The rule for fabrics of headings 5208 to 5212 provides that natural fibres may be used and that chemical materials, among other materials, may also be used. This does not mean that both have to be used; it is possible to use one or the other, or both.3.5. Where a rule in the list specifies that a product must be manufactured from a particular material, the condition obviously does not prevent the use of other materials which, because of their inherent nature, cannot satisfy the rule. (See also Note 6.2 below in relation to textiles).Example:The rule for prepared foods of heading 1904, which specifically excludes the use of cereals and their derivatives, does not prevent the use of mineral salts, chemicals and other additives which are not products from cereals.However, this does not apply to products which, although they cannot be manufactured from the particular materials specified in the list, can be produced from a material of the same nature at an earlier stage of manufacture.Example:In the case of an article of apparel of ex Chapter 62 made from non-woven materials, if the use of only non-originating yarn is allowed for this class of article, it is not possible to start from non-woven cloth – even if non-woven cloths cannot normally be made from yarn. In such cases, the starting material would normally be at the stage before yarn – that is, the fibre stage.3.6. Where, in a rule in the list, two percentages are given for the maximum value of non-originating materials that can be used, then these percentages may not be added together. In other words, the maximum value of all the non-originating materials used may never exceed the higher of the percentages given. Furthermore, the individual percentages must not be exceeded, in relation to the particular materials to which they apply.Note 44.1. The term \"natural fibres\" is used in the list to refer to fibres other than artificial or synthetic fibres. It is restricted to the stages before spinning takes place, including waste, and, unless otherwise specified, includes fibres which have been carded, combed or otherwise processed, but not spun.4.2. The term \"natural fibres\" includes horsehair of heading 0503, silk of headings 5002 and 5003, as well as wool-fibres and fine or coarse animal hair of headings 5101 to 5105, cotton fibres of headings 5201 to 5203, and other vegetable fibres of headings 5301 to 5305.4.3. The terms \"textile pulp\", \"chemical materials\" and \"paper-making materials\" are used in the list to describe the materials, not classified in Chapters 50 to 63, which can be used to manufacture artificial, synthetic or paper fibres or yarns.4.4. The term \"man-made staple fibres\" is used in the list to refer to synthetic or artificial filament tow, staple fibres or waste, of headings 5501 to 5507.Note 55.1. Where, for a given product in the list, reference is made to this Note, the conditions set out in column 3 shall not be applied to any basic textile materials used in the manufacture of this product and which, taken together, represent 10 % or less of the total weight of all the basic textile materials used. (See also Notes 5.3 and 5.4 below.)5.2. However, the tolerance mentioned in Note 5.1 may be applied only to mixed products which have been made from two or more basic textile materials.The following are the basic textile materials:- silk,- wool,- coarse animal hair,- fine animal hair,- horsehair,- cotton,- paper-making materials and paper,- flax,- true hemp,- jute and other textile bast fibres,- sisal and other textile fibres of the genus Agave,- coconut, abaca, ramie and other vegetable textile fibres,- synthetic man-made filaments,- artificial man-made filaments,- current-conducting filaments,- synthetic man-made staple fibres of polypropylene,- synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyester,- synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyamide,- synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyacrylonitrile,- synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyimide,- synthetic man-made staple fibres of polytetrafluoroethylene,- synthetic man-made staple fibres of poly(phenylene sulphide),- synthetic man-made staple fibres of poly(vinyl chloride),- other synthetic man-made staple fibres,- artificial man-made staple fibres of viscose,- other artificial man-made staple fibres,- yarn made of polyurethane segmented with flexible segments of polyether, whether or not gimped,- yarn made of polyurethane segmented with flexible segments of polyester, whether or not gimped,- products of heading 5605 (metallised yarn) incorporating strip consisting of a core of aluminium foil or of a core of plastic film whether or not coated with aluminium powder, of a width not exceeding 5 mm, sandwiched by means of a transparent or coloured adhesive between two layers of plastic film,- other products of heading 5605.Example:A yarn, of heading 5205, made from cotton fibres of heading 5203 and synthetic staple fibres of heading 5506, is a mixed yarn. Therefore, non-originating synthetic staple fibres which do not satisfy the origin-rules (which require manufacture from chemical materials or textile pulp) may be used, provided that their total weight does not exceed 10 % of the weight of the yarn.Example:A woollen fabric, of heading 5112, made from woollen yarn of heading 5107 and synthetic yarn of staple fibres of heading 5509, is a mixed fabric. Therefore, synthetic yarn which does not satisfy the origin-rules (which require manufacture from chemical materials or textile pulp), or woollen yarn which does not satisfy the origin-rules (which require manufacture from natural fibres, not carded or combed or otherwise prepared for spinning), or a combination of the two, may be used, provided that their total weight does not exceed 10 % of the weight of the fabric.Example:Tufted textile fabric, of heading 5802, made from cotton yarn of heading 5205 and cotton fabric of heading 5210, is a only mixed product if the cotton fabric is itself a mixed fabric made from yarns classified in two separate headings, or if the cotton yarns used are themselves mixtures.Example:If the tufted textile fabric concerned had been made from cotton yarn of heading 5205 and synthetic fabric of heading 5407, then, obviously, the yarns used are two separate basic textile materials and the tufted textile fabric is, accordingly, a mixed product.5.3. In the case of products incorporating \"yarn made of polyurethane segmented with flexible segments of polyether, whether or not gimped\", this tolerance is 20 % in respect of this yarn.5.4. In the case of products incorporating \"strip consisting of a core of aluminium foil or of a core of plastic film whether or not coated with aluminium powder, of a width not exceeding 5 mm, sandwiched by means of a transparent or coloured adhesive between two layers of plastic film\", this tolerance is 30 % in respect of this strip.Note 66.1. Where, in the list, reference is made to this Note, textile materials (with the exception of linings and interlinings), which do not satisfy the rule set out in the list in column 3 for the made-up product concerned, may be used, provided that they are classified in a heading other than that of the product and that their value does not exceed 8 % of the ex-works price of the product.6.2. Without prejudice to Note 6.3, materials, which are not classified within Chapters 50 to 63, may be used freely in the manufacture of textile products, whether or not they contain textiles.Example:If a rule in the list provides that, for a particular textile item (such as trousers), yarn must be used, this does not prevent the use of metal items, such as buttons, because buttons are not classified within Chapters 50 to 63. For the same reason, it does not prevent the use of slide-fasteners, even though slide-fasteners normally contain textiles.6.3. Where a percentage-rule applies, the value of materials which are not classified within Chapters 50 to 63 must be taken into account when calculating the value of the non-originating materials incorporated.Note 77.1. For the purposes of headings ex2707, 2713 to 2715, ex2901, ex2902 and ex3403, the \"specific processes\" are the following:(a) vacuum-distillation;(b) redistillation by a very thorough fractionation-process;(c) cracking;(d) reforming;(e) extraction by means of selective solvents;(f) the process comprising all of the following operations: processing with concentrated sulphuric acid, oleum or sulphuric anhydride; neutralisation with alkaline agents; decolourisation and purification with naturally-active earth, activated earth, activated charcoal or bauxite;(g) polymerisation;(h) alkylation;(i) isomerisation.7.2. For the purposes of headings 2710, 2711 and 2712, the \"specific processes\" are the following:(a) vacuum-distillation;(b) redistillation by a very thorough fractionation-process;(c) cracking;(d) reforming;(e) extraction by means of selective solvents;(f) the process comprising all of the following operations: processing with concentrated sulphuric acid, oleum or sulphuric anhydride; neutralisation with alkaline agents; decolourisation and purification with naturally-active earth, activated earth, activated charcoal or bauxite;(g) polymerisation;(h) alkylation;(i) isomerisation;(j) in respect of heavy oils of heading ex2710 only, desulphurisation with hydrogen, resulting in a reduction of at least 85 % of the sulphur-content of the products processed (ASTM D 1266-59 T method);(k) in respect of products of heading 2710 only, deparaffining by a process other than filtering;(l) in respect of heavy oils of heading ex2710 only, treatment with hydrogen, at a pressure of more than 20 bar and a temperature of more than 250 °C, with the use of a catalyst, other than to effect desulphurisation, when the hydrogen constitutes an active element in a chemical reaction. The further treatment, with hydrogen, of lubricating oils of heading ex2710 (e.g. hydrofinishing or decolourisation), in order, more especially, to improve colour or stability shall not, however, be deemed to be a specific process;(m) in respect of fuel oils of heading ex2710 only, atmospheric distillation, on condition that less than 30 % of these products distils, by volume, including losses, at 300 °C, by the ASTM D 86 method;(n) in respect of heavy oils other than gas oils and fuel oils of heading ex2710 only, treatment by means of a high-frequency electrical brush-discharge;(o) in respect of crude products (other than petroleum jelly, ozokerite, lignite wax or peat wax, paraffin wax containing by weight less than 0,75 % of oil) of heading ex2712 only, de-oiling by fractional crystallisation.7.3. For the purposes of headings ex2707, 2713 to 2715, ex2901, ex2902 and ex3403, simple operations, such as cleaning, decanting, desalting, water-separation, filtering, colouring, marking, obtaining a sulphur-content as a result of mixing products with different sulphur-contents, or any combination of these operations or like operations, do not confer origin.--------------------------------------------------ANNEX II TO PROTOCOL 3LIST OF WORKING OR PROCESSING REQUIRED TO BE CARRIED OUT ON NON-ORIGINATING MATERIALS IN ORDER THAT THE PRODUCT MANUFACTURED CAN OBTAIN ORIGINATING STATUSThe products mentioned in this list may not be all covered by this Agreement.

With regard to mutual access to transport markets, the Parties agree, initially and without prejudice to paragraph 2, to maintain the regime resulting from bilateral Agreements or other existing international bilateral instruments concluded between each Member State of the Community and Serbia or, where there are no such Agreements or instruments, arising from the de facto situation in 1991.However, whilst awaiting the conclusion of Agreements between the Community and Serbia on access to the road transport market, as provided for in Article 12, and on road taxation, as provided for in Article 13(2), Serbia shall cooperate with the Member States of the Community to amend these bilateral Agreements to adapt them to this Protocol.2. The Parties hereby agree to grant unrestricted access to Community transit traffic through Serbia and to Serbian transit traffic through the Community with effect from the date of entry into force of this Agreement.3. If, as a result of the rights granted under paragraph 2, transit traffic by Community hauliers increases to such a degree as to cause or threaten to cause serious harm to road infrastructure and/or traffic fluidity on the axes mentioned in Article 5, and under the same circumstances problems arise on Community territory close to the borders of Serbia, the matter shall be submitted to the Stabilisation and Association Council in accordance with Article 121 of this Agreement. The Parties may propose exceptional temporary, non-discriminatory measures as are necessary to limit or mitigate such harm.4. If the Community establishes rules aiming to reduce pollution caused by heavy goods vehicles registered in the European Union and to improve traffic safety, a similar regime shall apply to heavy goods vehicles registered in Serbia that wish to circulate through the Community territory.

The Parties accept that the taxation of road vehicles, tolls and other charges on either side must be non-discriminatory.2. The Parties shall enter into negotiations with a view to reaching an agreement on road taxation, as soon as possible, on the basis of the rules adopted by the Community on this matter. The purpose of this Agreement shall be, in particular, to ensure the free flow of trans-frontier traffic, to progressively eliminate differences between the road taxation systems applied by the Parties and to eliminate distortions of competition arising from such differences.3. Pending the conclusion of the negotiations mentioned in paragraph 2 of this Article, the Parties will eliminate discrimination between hauliers of the Community and Serbia when levying taxes and charges on the circulation and/or possession of heavy goods vehicles as well as taxes or charges levied on transport operations in the territory of the Parties. Serbia undertakes to notify the European Commission, if so requested, the amount of taxes, tolls and charges which they apply, as well as the methods of calculating them.4. Until the conclusion of the Agreement mentioned in paragraph 2 and in Article 12 any change proposed after the entry into force of this Agreement to fiscal charges, tolls or other charges, including the systems for their collection which may be applied to Community traffic in transit through Serbia will be subject to a prior consultation procedure.Article 14Weights and dimensions1. Serbia accepts that road vehicles complying with Community standards on weights and dimensions may circulate freely and without hindrance in this respect on the routes covered by Article 5. During six months after the entry into force of this Agreement, road vehicles which do not comply with existing standards of Serbia may be subject to a special non-discriminatory charge which reflects the damage caused by additional axle weight.2. Serbia will endeavour to harmonise their existing regulations and standards for road construction with the legislation prevailing in the Community by the end of the fifth year after the entry into force of this Agreement and will make major efforts for improvement of the existing routes covered by Article 5 to those new regulations and standards within the proposed time, in accordance with their financial possibilities.Article 15Environment1. In order to protect the environment, the Parties shall endeavour to introduce standards on gaseous and particulate emissions and noise levels for heavy goods vehicles, which ensure a high level of protection.2. In order to provide the industry with clear information and to encourage coordinated research, programming and production, exceptional national standards in this field shall be avoided.3.

For the purpose of introducing new standards, the Parties shall work together to achieve the abovementioned objectives.Article 16Social aspects1. Serbia shall harmonise their legislations on the training of road haulage personnel, particularly with respect to the carriage of dangerous goods, to the Community standards.2. Serbia as a contracting party to the European Agreement concerning the work of crews of vehicles engaged in international road transport (ERTA), and the Community will coordinate to the maximum extent possible their policies concerning driving time, interruptions and rest periods for drivers and crew composition, in respect of the future development of the social legislation in this area.3. The Parties shall cooperate with regard to implementation and enforcement of the social legislation in the field of road transport.4. The Parties shall ensure the equivalence of their respective laws on the admission to the occupation of road haulage operator, with a view to their mutual recognition.Article 17Provisions relating to traffic1.

In general, the Parties shall encourage the introduction, development and coordination of a road traffic information system.3. They shall endeavour to harmonise their legislation on the carriage of perishable goods, live animals and dangerous substances.4. The Parties shall also endeavour to harmonise the technical assistance to be provided to drivers, the dissemination of essential information on traffic and other matters of concern to tourists, and emergency services including ambulance services.Article 18Road Safety1. Serbia shall harmonise their legislation on road safety, particularly with regard to the transport of dangerous goods, to that of the Community by the end of the third year after the entry into force of this Agreement.2. Serbia as a contracting Party of the European Agreement concerning the International Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Road (ADR) and the Community will coordinate to the maximum extent possible their policies concerning the carriage of dangerous goods.3. The Parties shall cooperate with regard to implementation and enforcement of road safety legislation, particularly on driving licences and measures to reduce road accidents.SIMPLIFICATION OF FORMALITIESArticle 19Simplification of formalities1. The Parties agree to simplify the flow of goods by rail and road, whether bilateral or in transit.2. The Parties agree to begin negotiations with a view to concluding an Agreement on the facilitation of controls and formalities relating to the carriage of goods.3. The Parties agree, to the extent necessary, to take joint action on, and to encourage, the adoption of further simplification measures.FINAL PROVISIONSArticle 20Widening of the scopeIf one of the Parties concludes, on the basis of experience in the application of this Protocol, that other measures which do not fall within the scope of this Protocol are in the interest of a coordinated European transport policy and, in particular, may help to solve the problem of transit traffic, it shall make suggestions in this respect to the other Party.Article 21Implementation1. Cooperation between the Parties shall be carried out within the framework of a special Subcommittee to be created in accordance with Article 123 of this Agreement.2.

The Parties recognise the need that Serbia addresses promptly any structural weaknesses of its steel sector to ensure the global competitiveness of its industry.2. Further to the disciplines stipulated by paragraph 1(iii) of Article 73 of this Agreement, the assessment of the compatibility of State aid to the steel industry as defined in Annex I of the Guidelines on national regional aid for 2007–13 shall be made on the basis of the criteria arising from the application of Article 87 of the EC Treaty to the steel sector, including secondary legislation.3. For the purposes of applying the provisions of paragraph 1(iii) of Article 73 of this Agreement with regard to the steel industry, the Community recognises that, during five years after the entry into force of this Agreement, Serbia may exceptionally grant State aid for restructuring purposes to steel producing firms in difficulties, provided that:(a) it leads to the long-term viability of the benefiting firms under normal market conditions at the end of the restructuring period; and(b) the amount and intensity of such aid are strictly limited to what is absolutely necessary in order to restore such viability, and aid is where appropriate progressively reduced;(c) Serbia presents restructuring programmes that are linked to a global rationalisation which includes the closing of inefficient capacity. Every steel producing firm benefiting from restructuring aid shall, as far as possible, provide for compensatory measures balancing the distortion of competition caused by the aid.4. Serbia shall submit to the European Commission for assessment a National Restructuring Programme and individual business plans for each of the companies benefiting from restructuring aid which demonstrate that the above conditions are fulfilled.The individual business plans shall have been assessed and agreed by the State aid monitoring authority of Serbia in view of their compliance with paragraph 3 of this Protocol.The European Commission shall confirm that the National Restructuring Programme is in compliance with the requirements of paragraph 3.5. The European Commission shall monitor the implementation of the plans, in close cooperation with the competent national authorities, in particular the State aid monitoring authority of Serbia.If the monitoring indicates that aid to the beneficiaries which is not approved in the National Restructuring Programme or any restructuring aid to steel firms not identified in the National Restructuring Programme has been granted from the date of signature of this Agreement onwards, the State aid monitoring authority of Serbia shall ensure that any such aid is reimbursed.6. Upon request, the Community shall provide Serbia with technical support for the preparation of the National Restructuring Programme and the individual business plans.7. Each Party shall ensure full transparency with respect to State aid. In particular, as regards State aid granted to steel production in Serbia and the implementation of the restructuring programme and the business plans, a full and continuous exchange of information shall take place.8. The Stabilisation and Association Council shall monitor the implementation of the requirements set out in paragraphs 1 to 4 above. To this effect, the Stabilisation and Association Council may draft implementing rules.9. If one of the Parties considers that a particular practice of the other Party is incompatible with the terms of this Protocol, and if that practice causes or threatens to cause prejudice to the interests of the first Party or material injury to its domestic industry, this Party may take appropriate measures after consultation within the Subcommittee dealing with competition matters or after thirty working days following referral for such consultation.--------------------------------------------------PROTOCOL 6on Mutual administrative assistance in customs mattersArticle 1DefinitionsFor the purposes of this Protocol:(a) \"customs legislation\" shall mean any legal or regulatory provisions applicable in the territories of the Parties, governing the import, export and transit of goods and their placing under any other customs regime or procedure, including measures of prohibition, restriction and control;(b) \"applicant authority\" shall mean a competent administrative authority which has been designated by a Contracting Party for this purpose and which makes a request for assistance on the basis of this Protocol;(c) \"requested authority\" shall mean a competent administrative authority which has been designated by a Contracting Party for this purpose and which receives a request for assistance on the basis of this Protocol;(d) \"personal data\" shall mean all information relating to an identified or identifiable individual;(e) \"operation in breach of customs legislation\" shall mean any violation or attempted violation of customs legislation.Article 2Scope1.

The ruling shall set out the findings of fact, the applicability of the relevant provisions of this Agreement and the basic rationale behind any findings and conclusions that it makes. The ruling may contain recommendations on the measures to be adopted for compliance with it.4. The complaining Party may withdraw its complaint by written notification to the chairperson of the arbitration panel, the Party complained against and the Stabilisation and Association Committee, at any time before the ruling is notified to the Parties and the Stabilisation and Association Committee. Such withdrawal is without prejudice to the complaining Party’s right to introduce a new complaint regarding the same measure at a later point in time.5. The arbitration panel shall, at the request of both Parties, suspend its work at any time for a period not exceeding 12 months. Once the period of 12 months has been exceeded, the authority for the establishment of the panel will lapse, without prejudice to the right of the complaining Party to request at a later stage the establishment of a panel on the same measure.Section IIComplianceArticle 6Compliance with the arbitration panel rulingEach Party shall take any measure necessary to comply with the arbitration panel ruling, and the Parties will endeavour to agree on the reasonable period of time to comply with the ruling.Article 7Reasonable period of time for compliance1. No later than 30 days after the notification of the arbitration panel ruling to the Parties, the Party complained against shall notify the complaining Party of the time it will require for compliance (hereinafter referred to as \"reasonable period of time\"). Both parties shall endeavour to agree on the reasonable period of time.2. If there is disagreement between the Parties on the reasonable period of time to comply with the arbitration panel ruling, the complaining Party may request the Stabilisation and Association Committee, within 20 days of the notification made under paragraph 1, to reconvene the original arbitration panel to determine the length of the reasonable period of time. The arbitration panel shall notify its ruling within 20 days from the date of the submission of the request.3. In the event of the original panel, or some of its members, being unable to reconvene, the procedures set out in Article 4 shall apply. The time limit for notifying the ruling remains 20 days from the date of the panel’s establishment.Article 8Review of any measure taken to comply with the arbitration panel ruling1.

In the event of the original arbitration panel, or some of its members, being unable to reconvene, the procedures laid down in Article 4 shall apply.

If no agreement on compensation is reached within 30 days of the end of the reasonable period of time, or of the arbitration panel ruling under Article 8 that a measure taken to comply is not in conformity with this Agreement, the complaining Party shall be entitled, upon notification to the other Party and to the Stabilisation and Association Committee, to suspend the application of benefits granted under the provisions referred to in Article 2 of this Protocol at a level equivalent to the adverse economic impact caused by the violation. The complaining Party may implement the suspension 10 days after the date of the notification, unless the Party complained against has requested arbitration under paragraph 3.3. If the Party complained against considers that the level of suspension is not equivalent to the adverse economic impact caused by the violation, it may request in writing to the chairperson of the original arbitration panel before the expiry of the ten day period referred to in paragraph 2 for the reconvening of the original arbitration panel. The arbitration panel shall notify its ruling on the level of the suspension of benefits to the Parties and to the Stabilisation and Association Committee within 30 days of the date of the submission of the request. Benefits shall not be suspended until the arbitration panel has issued its ruling, and any suspension shall be consistent with the ruling of the arbitration panel.4. The suspension of benefits shall be temporary and shall be applied only until any measure found to violate this Agreement has been withdrawn or amended so as to bring it into conformity with this Agreement, or until the Parties have agreed to settle the dispute.Article 10Review of any measure taken to comply after the suspension of benefits1. The Party complained against shall notify the other Party and the Stabilisation and Association Committee of any measure it has taken to comply with the ruling of the arbitration panel and of its request for an end to the suspension of benefits applied by the complaining Party.2. If the Parties do not reach an agreement on the compatibility of the notified measure with this Agreement within 30 days of the date of the submission of the notification, the complaining Party may request in writing to the chairperson of the original arbitration panel to rule on the matter. Such request shall be notified simultaneously to the other Party and to the Stabilisation and Association Committee. The arbitration panel ruling shall be notified within 45 days of the date of the submission of the request. If the arbitration panel rules that any measure taken to comply is not in conformity with this Agreement, the arbitration panel will determine whether the complaining party can continue the suspension of benefits at the original or at a different level. If the arbitration panel rules that any measure taken to comply is in conformity with this Agreement, the suspension of benefits shall be terminated.3. In the event of the original arbitration panel, or some of its members, being unable to reconvene, the procedures laid down in Article 4 shall apply. The period for notifying the ruling remains 45 days from the date of the panel’s establishment.Section IIICommon provisionsArticle 11Open HearingsThe meetings of the arbitration panel shall be open to the public under the conditions laid down in the Rules of Procedure referred to in Article 18, unless the arbitration panel decides otherwise on its own motion or at the request of the Parties.Article 12Information and technical adviceAt the request of a Party, or upon its own initiative, the panel may seek information from any source it deems appropriate for the panel proceeding.

Member States, of the one part, and the Republic of Serbia, of the other part, consider that the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction (hereinafter referred to as \"WMD\") and their means of delivery, both at state and non-state actors level, represents one of the most serious threats to international peace, stability and security as confirmed by United Nations Security Council adopted Resolution 1540(2004). Non-proliferation of WMD is therefore a joint concern for the European Communities and their Member States and Serbia.The fight against the proliferation of WMD and their means of delivery also constitutes a fundamental element for the European Union when it considers the decision of entering into an agreement with a third country. This is why the Council decided on 17 November 2003 that a non-proliferation clause should be inserted in the new Agreements with third countries and agreed on a text of standard clause (see Council document 14997/03). Such a clause has since been inserted in the European Union’s agreements with nearly one hundred countries.The European Union and the Republic of Serbia, as responsible members of the international community, reaffirm their full commitment to the principle of non-proliferation of the WMD and their means of delivery and to the full implementation of their international obligations arising out of international instruments to which they adhere.It is in this spirit and in line with the above stated general EU policy and Serbian commitment to the principle of non-proliferation of the weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery, both Parties agreed to include, in Article 3 of this Agreement, the standard clause on WMD as set out by the Council of the European Union.Joint declaration on Article 32The purpose of measures defined in Article 32 is to monitor the trade of products with high content of sugar that could be used for further processing and to prevent the possible distortion in patterns of trade of sugar and products not having characteristics essentially different to the characteristics of sugar.That Article should be interpreted in such a manner that does not disturb or disturbs to the least possible scale the trade in products intended for final consumption.Joint Declaration on Article 75The Parties agree that for the purpose of this Agreement, intellectual and industrial property includes in particular copyright, including the copyright in computer programmes, and neighbouring rights, the rights relating to databases, patents including supplementary protection certificates, industrial designs, trademarks and service marks, topographies of integrated circuits, geographical indications, including appellation of origins, and plant variety rights.The protection of commercial property rights includes in particular the protection against unfair competition as referred to in Article 10bis of the Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property and the protection of undisclosed information as referred to in Article 39 of the Agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS Agreement).The Parties further agree that the level of protection referred to in Article 75, paragraph 3, shall include the availability of the measures, procedures and remedies provided for in Directive 2004/48/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on the enforcement of intellectual property rights [1].Declaration by the Community and its Member StatesConsidering that exceptional trade measures are granted by the Community to countries participating or linked to the EU Stabilisation and Association process including Serbia on the basis of Regulation (EC) No 2007/2000, the Community and its Member States declare:- that, in application of Article 35 of this Agreement, those of the unilateral autonomous trade measures which are more favourable shall apply in addition to the contractual trade concessions offered by the Community in this Agreement as long as Council Regulation (EC) No 2007/2000 of 18 September 2000 introducing exceptional trade measures for countries and territories participating in or linked to the European Union’s Stabilisation and Association process [2], applies,- that, in particular, for the products covered by Chapters 7 and 8 of the Combined Nomenclature, for which the Common Customs Tariff provides for the application of ad valorem customs duties and a specific customs duty, the reduction shall apply also to the specific customs duty in derogation from the relevant provision of Article 26 paragraph 2.[1] OJ L 157, 30.4.2004, p. 45.

It will promote in particular:\nfull integration of Serbia into the community of democratic nations and gradual harmonisation (rapprochement) with the EU;\nan increasing convergence of positions of the parties on international issues, including common foreign and security policy issues;\nregional cooperation and the development of good neighbourly relations;\ncommon views on security and stability in Europe, including cooperation in the areas covered by the common foreign and security policy of the EU.\n3.Regional cooperation\nSerbia is required to:\nactively promote regional cooperation;\nstart negotiations with the countries which have already signed an SAA with the EU with a view to concluding bilateral agreements on regional cooperation;\npursue regional cooperation with other countries concerned by the stabilisation and association process (SAP) in some or all the fields of cooperation covered by this agreement;\nfoster cooperation and conclude cooperation agreements with any EU candidate country not involved in the SAP. It must also start negotiations with Turkey with a view to concluding an agreement establishing a free trade area.\nThe EU may support projects having a regional or cross-border dimension through its technical assistance programmes.\n4.Free movement of goods\nThe 2 parties are committed to gradually establishing a bilateral free trade area over a period lasting a maximum of 6 years.\nThe SAA sets out a process for reducing and removing customs tariffs and quotas on goods from both the EU and Serbia.\n5.Movement of workers, establishment, supply of services and movement of capital\nSerbian nationals working legally in an EU country must be free of any form of discrimination compared to nationals of the country concerned. Serbia must grant the same treatment to EU workers.\nRules must be established to coordinate the social security system for workers with Serbian nationality legally employed in the territory of an EU country, and for the members of their families legally resident there. Serbia must grant similar treatment to EU workers.\nCompanies (as well as subsidiaries and branches) setting up operations on the territory of the other party must be granted no less favourable treatment than companies based in that territory.\nBoth parties must take steps which progressively allow their companies or nationals to supply services in the territory of the other party.\nAny payments and transfers on the current account of balance of payments between the EU and Serbia must be permitted in a freely convertible currency.\n6.Alignment of the laws of the country to those of the EU\nSerbia agrees to ensure that its existing laws and future legislation will gradually be made compatible with the EU acquis and that such laws will be properly implemented and enforced.\nBoth sides are bound by competition rules, based on EU law, relating to actions that may affect trade between the two parties.\n7.Justice, freedom and security\nCooperation focuses on a number of specific areas, including:\nconsolidating the rule of law and reinforcing institutions at all levels in the areas of administration in general and in particular in law enforcement and the administration of justice, fighting corruption;\nvisas, border management, asylum and migration;\npreventing and controlling illegal migration, readmission;\npreventing money laundering and the financing of terrorism;\ncooperating on illicit drugs;\npreventing and combating organised crime and terrorism and other illegal activities.\n8.Cooperation policies\nThe EU and Serbia agree to establish close cooperation on a wide range of policy areas, such as economic and trade policy, industrial cooperation, education and training to help the development and growth potential of Serbia. This cooperation will strengthen existing economic links to the benefit of both parties.\n9.Financial cooperation\nTo help achieve the objectives of this agreement, Serbia may receive financial assistance from the EU in the form of grants and loans, including loans from the European Investment Bank.\nEU financial assistance is conditional on further progress in satisfying the Copenhagen criteria.\n10.Supervision\nThe SAA establishes a stabilisation and association council to supervise the application and implementation of the SAA.\nFROM WHEN DO THE DECISION AND THE AGREEMENT APPLY?\n              \nThe decision has applied since 22 July 2013 and the agreement since 1 September 2013.\nBACKGROUND\n              \nFor further information:\nSerbia (European Commission)\nWestern Balkans (European External Action Service)\nOverview — Instrument for Pre-accession Assistance (European Commission)\nEU enlargement package 2018 (European Commission).\nMAIN DOCUMENTS\n            \nStabilisation and Association Agreement between the European Communities and their Member States of the one part, and the Republic of Serbia, of the other part (OJ L 278, 18.10.2013, pp. 16-473)\nSuccessive amendments to the agreement have been incorporated in the original act.
