These instruments are intended to enhance the security of ships used in international trade and associated port facilities; they comprise mandatory provisions, the scope of some of which in the Community should be clarified, and recommendations, some of which should be made mandatory within the Community.(5) Without prejudice to the rules of the Member States in the field of national security and measures which might be taken on the basis of Title VI of the Treaty on European Union, the security objective described in recital 2 should be achieved by adopting appropriate measures in the field of maritime transport policy establishing joint standards for the interpretation, implementation and monitoring within the Community of the provisions adopted by the Diplomatic Conference of the IMO on 12 December 2002. Implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission to adopt detailed implementing provisions.(6) This Regulation respects the fundamental rights and observes the principles recognised in particular by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union.(7) Security should be enhanced not only for ships used in international shipping and the port facilities which serve them, but also for ships operating domestic services within the Community and their port facilities, in particular passenger ships, on account of the number of human lives which such trade puts at risk.(8) Part B of the ISPS Code comprises a number of recommendations which should be made mandatory within the Community in order to make uniform progress towards achievement of the security objective described in recital 2.(9) In order to contribute to the recognised and necessary objective of promoting intra-Community short-sea traffic, the Member States should be asked to conclude, in the light of regulation 11 of the special measures to enhance maritime security of the SOLAS Convention, the agreements on security arrangements for scheduled maritime traffic within the Community on fixed routes using dedicated port facilities, without this compromising the general standard of security sought.(10) Permanently applying all the security rules provided for in this Regulation to port facilities situated in ports which only occasionally serve international shipping might be disproportionate. The Member States should determine, on the basis of the security assessments which they are to conduct, which ports are concerned and which alternative measures provide an adequate level of protection.(11) Member States should vigorously monitor compliance with the security rules by ships intending to enter a Community port, whatever their origin. The Member State concerned should appoint a \"competent authority for maritime security\" responsible for coordinating, implementing and monitoring the application of the security measures laid down in this Regulation as they apply to ships and port facilities. This authority should require each ship intending to enter the port to provide in advance information concerning its international ship security certificate and the levels of safety at which it operates and has previously operated, and any other practical information concerning security.(12) Member States should be permitted to grant exemptions from the systematic requirement to provide the information referred to in recital (11) in the case of intra-Community or domestic scheduled shipping services, provided the companies operating such services are able to provide such information at any time on request by the competent authorities of the Member States.(13) Security checks in the port may be carried out by the competent authorities for maritime security of the Member States, but also, as regards the international ship security certificate, by inspectors acting in the framework of port State control, as provided for in Council Directive 95/21/EC of 19 June 1995 concerning the enforcement, in respect of shipping using Community ports and sailing in the waters under the jurisdiction of the Member States, of international standards for ship safety, pollution prevention and shipboard living and working conditions (port State control)(3). Where different authorities are concerned, provision must therefore be made for them to complement each other.(14) In view of the number of parties involved in the implementation of security measures, each Member State should appoint a single competent authority responsible for coordinating and monitoring the application of shipping security measures at national level. Member States should put in place the necessary resources and draw up a national plan for the implementation of this Regulation in order to achieve the security objective described in recital 2, in particular by establishing a timetable for the early implementation of certain measures in accordance with the terms of Resolution 6 adopted by the Diplomatic Conference of the IMO on 12 December 2002. The effectiveness of the checks on the implementation of each national system should be the subject of inspections supervised by the Commission.(15) The effective and standard application of measures under this policy raises important questions in relation to its funding. Funding certain additional security measures ought not to give rise to distortions of competition. To this end, the Commission should immediately undertake a study (intended to address in particular the way financing is shared between the public authorities and the operators, without prejudice to the distribution of competences between the Member States and the European Community) and to submit the results and, if appropriate, any proposals to the European Parliament and the Council.(16) The measures needed to implement this Regulation should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission(4). A procedure should be defined for the adaptation of this Regulation in the light of experience, to make mandatory further provisions of Part B of the ISPS Code not initially made mandatory by this Regulation.(17) Since the objectives of this Regulation, namely the introduction and implementation of appropriate measures in the field of maritime transport policy, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore, by reason of the European scale of this Regulation, be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives,HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:Article 1Objectives1.

In respect of domestic shipping, Member States shall apply, by 1 July 2005, the special measures to enhance maritime security of the SOLAS Convention and Part A of the ISPS Code to Class A passenger ships within the meaning of Article 4 of Council Directive 98/18/EC of 17 March 1998 on safety rules and standards for passenger ships(5) operating domestic services and to their companies, as defined in regulation IX-1 of the SOLAS Convention, and to the port facilities serving them.3. Member States shall, after a mandatory security risk assessment, decide the extent to which they will apply, by 1 July 2007, the provisions of this Regulation to different categories of ships operating domestic services other than those referred to in paragraph 2, their companies and the port facilities serving them. The overall level of security should not be compromised by such a decision.Member States shall notify the Commission of such decisions when they are adopted, as well as of the periodic review, which must take place at intervals of no more than five years.4. When implementing the provisions required pursuant to paragraphs 1, 2 and 3, Member States shall take fully into account the guidelines contained in Part B of the ISPS Code.5.

Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs 2 and 3, Member States shall ensure, when ship security plans and port facility security plans are approved, that such plans contain appropriate provisions to ensure that the security of ships to which this Regulation applies is not compromised by any ship or port interface or ship-to-ship activity with any ships not subject to this Regulation.Article 4Communication of information1. Each Member State shall communicate to the IMO, the Commission and the other Member States the information required pursuant to regulation 13 (Communication of information) of the special measures to enhance maritime security of the SOLAS Convention.2. Each Member State shall communicate to the Commission and the other Member States the contact details of the contact officials referred to in paragraph 4.16 of Part B of the ISPS Code and the information provided for in paragraph 4.41 of Part B of the ISPS Code when a ship is expelled from or refused entry to a Community port.3. Each Member State shall draw up the list of port facilities concerned on the basis of the port facility security assessments carried out, and establish the scope of the measures taken to apply the provisions of paragraph 2 of regulation 2 (extent of application to port facilities which occasionally serve international voyages) of the special measures to enhance maritime security of the SOLAS Convention.Each Member State shall communicate the said list to the other Member States and to the Commission by 1 July 2004 at the latest. The Commission and any Member State concerned shall also be given sufficient details of the measures taken.Article 5Alternative security agreements or equivalent security arrangements1. For the purposes of this Regulation, regulation 11 (Alternative security agreements) of the special measures to enhance maritime security of the SOLAS Convention may also apply to scheduled intra-Community shipping operating on fixed routes and using associated port facilities.2. To that end, Member States may conclude among themselves, each acting on its own behalf, the bilateral or multilateral agreements provided for in the said SOLAS regulation. Member States may, in particular, consider such agreements in order to promote intra-Community short sea shipping.The Member States concerned shall notify the agreements to the Commission and provide sufficient details of the measures to allow the Commission to consider whether the agreements compromise the level of security of other ships or port facilities not covered by the agreements. The details of the measures directly linked to national security, if any, may be omitted from the notification to the Commission.The Commission shall examine whether the agreements guarantee an adequate level of protection, in particular as regards the requirements of paragraph 2 of the abovementioned SOLAS regulation 11, and whether they conform with Community law and are in accordance with the proper functioning of the internal market. If the agreements do not meet these criteria, the Commission shall within four months adopt a decision in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 11(3); in such cases, the Member States concerned shall revoke or adapt the agreements accordingly.3. The periodic review of such agreements provided for in paragraph 4 of regulation 11 of the special measures to enhance maritime security must take place at intervals of no more than five years.4. Member States may adopt, for domestic shipping and the port facilities as referred to in Articles 3(2) and 3(3) of this Regulation, equivalent security arrangements as provided for in regulation 12 (equivalent security arrangements) of the special measures to enhance maritime security of the SOLAS Convention, provided such security arrangements are as least as effective as those prescribed in Chapter XI-2 of the SOLAS Convention and the relevant mandatory provisions of the ISPS Code.The Member State concerned shall communicate to the Commission sufficient details of such arrangements when they are adopted, and the outcome of periodic reviews thereof, at the latest five years after they were adopted or last reviewed.The conditions of application of such arrangements shall be subject to the Commission inspections provided for in Article 9(4), (5) and (6) of this Regulation under the procedures defined therein.Article 6Provision of security information prior to entry into a port of a Member State1. When a ship which is subject to the requirements of the special measures to enhance maritime security of the SOLAS Convention and of the ISPS Code or of Article 3 of this Regulation announces its intention to enter a port of a Member State, the competent authority for maritime security of that Member State shall require that the information referred to in paragraph 2.1 of regulation 9 (Ships intending to enter a port of another Contracting Government) of the special measures to enhance maritime security of the SOLAS Convention be provided. The said authority shall analyse, as far as necessary, the information provided and, where necessary, apply the procedure provided for in paragraph 2 of that SOLAS regulation.2. The information referred to in paragraph 1 shall be provided:(a) at least 24 hours in advance; or(b) at the latest, at the time the ship leaves the previous port, if the voyage time is less than 24 hours; or(c) if the port of call is not known or if it is changed during the voyage, as soon as the port of call becomes known.3. A report shall be kept of the procedure followed in respect of each ship subject to a security incident, as defined in paragraph 1.13 of regulation 1 (definitions) of the special measures to enhance maritime security of the SOLAS Convention.Article 7Exemptions from the provision of security information prior to entry into a port1. Member States may exempt scheduled services performed between port facilities located on their territory from the requirement laid down in Article 6 where the following conditions are met:(a) the company operating the scheduled services referred to above keeps and updates a list of the ships concerned and sends it to the competent authority for maritime security for the port concerned,(b) for each voyage performed, the information referred to in paragraph 2.1 of regulation 9 of the special measures to enhance maritime security of the SOLAS Convention is kept available for the competent authority for maritime security upon request. The company must establish an internal system to ensure that, upon request 24 hours a day and without delay, the said information can be sent to the competent authority for maritime security.2. When an international scheduled service is operated between two or more Member States, any of the Member States involved may request of the other Member States that an exemption be granted to that service, in accordance with the conditions laid down in paragraph 1.3. Member States shall periodically check that the conditions laid down in paragraphs 1 and 2 are being met. Where at least one of these conditions is no longer being met, Member States shall immediately withdraw the privilege of the exemption from the company concerned.4. Member States shall draw up a list of companies and ships granted exemption under this Article, and shall update that list. They shall communicate the list and updates thereof to the Commission and any Member State concerned.5. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2, a Member State may, on security grounds and on a case-by-case basis, request the provision of the information referred to in paragraph 2.1 of regulation 9 of the special measures to enhance maritime security of the SOLAS Convention prior to entry into a port.Article 8Security checks in Member State ports1. Certificate verification, as defined in paragraph 1.1 of regulation 9 (Control of ships in port) of the special measures to enhance maritime security of the SOLAS Convention, shall be carried out in the port either by the competent authority for maritime security defined in Article 2(7) of this Regulation or by the inspectors defined in Article 2(5) of Directive 95/21/EC.2. Where the officer conducting the certificate verification referred to in paragraph 1 has clear grounds for believing that the ship is not in compliance with the requirements of the special measures to enhance maritime security of the SOLAS Convention and of the ISPS Code, but does not belong to an authority which in that Member State is responsible for carrying out the measures provided for in paragraphs 1.2 and 1.3 of regulation 9 of the special measures to enhance maritime security of the SOLAS Convention, s/he shall immediately refer the matter to the said authority.Article 9Implementation and conformity checking1. Member States shall carry out the administrative and control tasks required pursuant to the provisions of the special measures to enhance maritime security of the SOLAS Convention and of the ISPS Code. They shall ensure that all necessary means are allocated and effectively provided for the implementation of the provisions of this Regulation.2. Member States shall designate a focal point for maritime security by 1 July 2004.3. Each Member State shall adopt a national programme for the implementation of this Regulation.4. Six months after the date of application of the relevant measures referred to in Article 3, the Commission, in cooperation with the focal point referred to in paragraph 2, shall start a series of inspections, including inspections of a suitable sample of port facilities and relevant companies, to monitor the application by Member States of this Regulation. These inspections shall take account of the data supplied by the focal point referred to in paragraph 2, including monitoring reports. The procedures for conducting such inspections shall be adopted in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 11(2).5. The officials mandated by the Commission to conduct such inspections in accordance with paragraph 4 shall exercise their powers upon production of an authorisation in writing issued by the Commission and specifying the subject-matter, the purpose of the inspection and the date on which it is to begin. The Commission shall in good time before inspections inform the Member States concerned by the inspections.The Member State concerned shall submit to such inspections and shall ensure that bodies or persons concerned also submit to those inspections.6. The Commission shall communicate the inspection reports to the Member State concerned, which shall indicate sufficient details of the measures taken to remedy any shortcomings within three months of receipt of the report. The report and the list of measures taken shall be communicated to the Committee referred to in Article 11(1).Article 10Integration of amendments to international instruments1. The applicable international instruments referred to in Article 2, which are applied in accordance with Article 3(1), shall be those which have entered into force, including the most recent amendments thereto, with the exception of the amendments excluded from the scope of this Regulation resulting from the conformity checking procedure established by paragraph 5.2. The integration of amendments to the international instruments referred to in Article 2 in respect of ships operating domestic services and the port facilities serving them to which this Regulation applies, in so far as they constitute a technical update of the provisions of the SOLAS Convention and the ISPS Code, shall be decided in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 11(2). The procedure for checking conformity established by paragraph 5 shall not apply in these cases.3. In accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 11(2), provisions may be adopted in order to define harmonised procedures for the application of the mandatory provisions of the ISPS Code, without broadening the scope of this Regulation.4. For the purposes of this Regulation and with a view to reducing the risks of conflict between Community maritime legislation and international instruments, Member States and the Commission shall cooperate, through coordination meetings and/or any other appropriate means, in order to define, as appropriate, a common position or approach in the competent international fora.5. A procedure for checking conformity is hereby established in order to exclude from the scope of this Regulation any amendment to an international instrument only if, on the basis of an evaluation by the Commission, there is a manifest risk that such an amendment will lower the standard of maritime security or be incompatible with Community legislation.The procedure for checking conformity may be used solely to make amendments to this Regulation in the fields expressly covered by the procedure referred to in Article 11(2) and strictly within the framework of exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission.6. In the circumstances referred to in paragraph 5, the procedure for checking conformity shall be initiated by the Commission, which, where appropriate, may act at the request of a Member State.The Commission shall submit to the Committee set up in Article 11(1), without delay, after the adoption of an amendment to an international instrument, a proposal for measures with the aim of excluding the amendment in question from this Regulation.The procedure for checking conformity, including, if applicable, the procedures set up in Article 5(6) of Decision 1999/468/EC, shall be completed at least one month before the expiration of the period established internationally for the tacit acceptance of the amendment concerned or the envisaged date for the entry into force of said amendment.7. In the event of a risk as referred to in the first subparagraph of paragraph 5, Member States shall refrain, during the course of the procedure for checking conformity, from taking any initiative intended to integrate the amendment in national legislation or to apply the amendment to the international instrument concerned.8. All relevant amendments to international instruments that are integrated in Community maritime legislation, in accordance with paragraphs 5 and 6, shall be published, for information purposes, in the Official Journal of the European Union.Article 11Committee procedure1. The Commission shall be assisted by a Committee.2. Where reference is made to this paragraph, Articles 5 and 7 of Decision 1999/468/EC shall apply, having regard to the provisions of Article 8 thereof.The period laid down in Article 5(6) of Decision 1999/468/EC shall be set at one month.3. Where reference is made to this paragraph, Articles 6 and 7 of Decision 1999/468/EC shall apply having regard to the provisions of Article 8 thereof.The periods laid down in Article 6(b) and (c) respectively of Decision 1999/468/EC shall be set at one month.4. The Committee shall adopt its Rules of Procedure.Article 12ConfidentialityIn applying this Regulation, the Commission shall take, in accordance with the provisions of Commission Decision 2001/844/EC, ECSC, Euratom of 29 November 2001 amending its internal Rules of Procedure(6), appropriate measures to protect information subject to the requirement of confidentiality to which it has access or which is communicated to it by Member States.The Member States shall take equivalent measures in accordance with relevant national legislation.Any personnel carrying out security inspections, or handling confidential information related to this Regulation, must have an appropriate level of security vetting by the Member State of the nationality of the personnel concerned.Article 13Dissemination of information1. Without prejudice to the public right of access to documents as laid down in Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 30 May 2001 regarding public access to European Parliament, Council and Commission documents(7), the inspection reports and the answers of the Member States referred to in Articles 4(3), 5(2), 5(4) and 9(6) shall be secret and shall not be published. They shall only be available to the relevant authorities, which shall communicate them only to interested parties on a need-to-know basis, in accordance with applicable national rules for dissemination of sensitive information.2. Member States shall, as far as possible and in accordance with applicable national law, treat as confidential information arising from inspection reports and answers of Member States when it relates to other Member States3. Unless it is clear that the inspection reports and answers shall or shall not be disclosed, Member States or the Commission shall consult with the Member State concerned.Article 14SanctionsMember States shall ensure that effective, proportionate and dissuasive sanctions for breaching the provisions of this Regulation are introduced.Article 15Entry into forceThis Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.It shall apply from 1 July 2004, apart from the provisions of Articles 3(2) and (3), and 9(4), which shall enter into force on and apply from the dates specified therein.This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.Done at Strasbourg, 31 March 2004.For the European ParliamentThe PresidentP.

This includes denial of access to persons (except those identified as duly authorised by a Contracting Government) or their effects and refusal to load cargo, including containers or other closed cargo transport units.2 If, in the professional judgement of the master, a conflict between any safety and security requirements applicable to the ship arises during its operations, the master shall give effect to those requirements necessary to maintain the safety of the ship. In such cases, the master may implement temporary security measures and shall forthwith inform the Administration and, if appropriate, the Contracting Government in whose port the ship is operating or intends to enter. Any such temporary security measures under this regulation shall, to the highest possible degree, be commensurate with the prevailing security level. When such cases are identified, the Administration shall ensure that such conflicts are resolved and that the possibility of recurrence is minimised.Regulation 9 Control and compliance measures1 Control of ships in port1.1 For the purpose of this chapter, every ship to which this chapter applies is subject to control when in a port of another Contracting Government by officers duly authorised by that Government, who may be the same as those carrying out the functions of regulation I/19. Such control shall be limited to verifying that there is onboard a valid International Ship Security Certificate or a valid Interim International Ship Security Certificate issued under the provisions of part A of the ISPS Code (Certificate), which if valid shall be accepted, unless there are clear grounds for believing that the ship is not in compliance with the requirements of this chapter or part A of the ISPS Code.1.2 When there are such clear grounds, or when no valid Certificate is produced when required, the officers duly authorised by the Contracting Government shall impose any one or more control measures in relation to that ship as provided in paragraph 1.3. Any such measures imposed must be proportionate, taking into account the guidance given in part B of the ISPS Code.1.3 Such control measures are as follows: inspection of the ship, delaying the ship, detention of the ship, restriction of operations including movement within the port, or expulsion of the ship from port. Such control measures may additionally or alternatively include other lesser administrative or corrective measures.2 Ships intending to enter a port of another Contracting Government2.1 For the purpose of this chapter, a Contracting Government may require that ships intending to enter its ports provide the following information to officers duly authorised by that Government to ensure compliance with this chapter prior to entry into port with the aim of avoiding the need to impose control measures or steps:.1 that the ship possesses a valid Certificate and the name of its issuing authority;.2 the security level at which the ship is currently operating;.3 the security level at which the ship operated in any previous port where it has conducted a ship/port interface within the timeframe specified in paragraph 2.3;.4 any special or additional security measures that were taken by the ship in any previous port where it has conducted a ship/port interface within the timeframe specified in paragraph 2.3;.5 that the appropriate ship security procedures were maintained during any ship to ship activity within the timeframe specified in paragraph 2.3; or.6 other practical security related information (but not details of the ship security plan), taking into account the guidance given in part B of the ISPS Code.If requested by the Contracting Government, the ship or the Company shall provide confirmation, acceptable to that Contracting Government, of the information required above.2.2 Every ship to which this chapter applies intending to enter the port of another Contracting Government shall provide the information described in paragraph 2.1 on the request of the officers duly authorised by that Government. The master may decline to provide such information on the understanding that failure to do so may result in denial of entry into port.2.3 The ship shall keep records of the information referred to in paragraph 2.1 for the last 10 calls at port facilities.2.4 If, after receipt of the information described in paragraph 2.1, officers duly authorised by the Contracting Government of the port in which the ship intends to enter have clear grounds for believing that the ship is in non-compliance with the requirements of this chapter or part A of the ISPS Code, such officers shall attempt to establish communication with and between the ship and the Administration in order to rectify the non-compliance. If such communication does not result in rectification, or if such officers have clear grounds otherwise for believing that the ship is in non-compliance with the requirements of this chapter or part A of the ISPS Code, such officers may take steps in relation to that ship as provided in paragraph 2.5. Any such steps taken must be proportionate, taking into account the guidance given in part B of the ISPS Code.2.5 Such steps are as follows:.1 a requirement for the rectification of the non-compliance;.2 a requirement that the ship proceed to a location specified in the territorial sea or internal waters of that Contracting Government;.3 inspection of the ship, if the ship is in the territorial sea of the Contracting Government the port of which the ship intends to enter; or.4 denial of entry into port.Prior to initiating any such steps, the ship shall be informed by the Contracting Government of its intentions. Upon this information the master may withdraw the intention to enter that port. In such cases, this regulation shall not apply.3. Additional provisions3.1 In the event:.1 of the imposition of a control measure, other than a lesser administrative or corrective measure, referred to in paragraph 1.3; or.2 any of the steps referred to in paragraph 2.5 are taken, an officer duly authorised by the Contracting Government shall forthwith inform in writing the Administration specifying which control measures have been imposed or steps taken and the reasons thereof. The Contracting Government imposing the control measures or steps shall also notify the recognised security organisation, which issued the Certificate relating to the ship concerned and the Organisation when any such control measures have been imposed or steps taken.3.2 When entry into port is denied or the ship is expelled from port, the authorities of the port State should communicate the appropriate facts to the authorities of the State of the next appropriate ports of call, when known, and any other appropriate coastal States, taking into account guidelines to be developed by the Organisation. Confidentiality and security of such notification shall be ensured.3.3. Denial of entry into port, pursuant to paragraphs 2.4 and 2.5, or expulsion from port, pursuant to paragraphs 1.1 to 1.3, shall only be imposed where the officers duly authorised by the Contracting Government have clear grounds to believe that the ship poses an immediate threat to the security or safety of persons, or of ships or other property and there are no other appropriate means for removing that threat.3.4 The control measures referred to in paragraph 1.3 and the steps referred to in paragraph 2.5 shall only be imposed, pursuant to this regulation, until the non-compliance giving rise to the control measures or steps has been corrected to the satisfaction of the Contracting Government, taking into account actions proposed by the ship or the Administration, if any.3.5 When Contracting Governments exercise control under paragraph 1 or take steps under paragraph 2:.1 all possible efforts shall be made to avoid a ship being unduly detained or delayed. If a ship is thereby unduly detained, or delayed, it shall be entitled to compensation for any loss or damage suffered; and.2 necessary access to the ship shall not be prevented for emergency or humanitarian reasons and for security purposes.Regulation 10 Requirements for port facilities1 Port facilities shall comply with the relevant requirements of this chapter and part A of the ISPS Code, taking into account the guidance given in part B of the ISPS Code.2 Contracting Governments with a port facility or port facilities within their territory, to which this regulation applies, shall ensure that:.1 port facility security assessments are carried out, reviewed and approved in accordance with the provisions of part A of the ISPS Code; and.2 port facility security plans are developed, reviewed, approved and implemented in accordance with the provisions of part A of the ISPS Code.3. Contracting Governments shall designate and communicate the measures required to be addressed in a port facility security plan for the various security levels, including when the submission of a Declaration of Security will be required.Regulation 11 Alternative security agreements1 Contracting Governments may, when implementing this chapter and part A of the ISPS Code, conclude in writing bilateral or multilateral agreements with other Contracting Governments on alternative security arrangements covering short international voyages on fixed routes between port facilities located within their territories.2 Any such agreement shall not compromise the level of security of other ships or of port facilities not covered by the agreement.3 No ship covered by such an agreement shall conduct any ship-to-ship activities with any ship not covered by the agreement.4 Such agreements shall be reviewed periodically, taking into account the experience gained as well as any changes in the particular circumstances or the assessed threats to the security of the ships, the port facilities or the routes covered by the agreement.Regulation 12 Equivalent security arrangements1 An Administration may allow a particular ship or a group of ships entitled to fly its flag to implement other security measures equivalent to those prescribed in this chapter or in part A of the ISPS Code, provided such security measures are at least as effective as those prescribed in this chapter or part A of the ISPS Code. The Administration, which allows such security measures, shall communicate to the Organisation particulars thereof.2 When implementing this chapter and part A of the ISPS Code, a Contracting Government may allow a particular port facility or a group of port facilities located within its territory, other than those covered by an agreement concluded under regulation 11, to implement security measures equivalent to those prescribed in this chapter or in Part A of the ISPS Code, provided such security measures are at least as effective as those prescribed in this chapter or part A of the ISPS Code. The Contracting Government, which allows such security measures, shall communicate to the Organisation particulars thereof.Regulation 13 Communication of information1 Contracting Governments shall, not later than 1 July 2004, communicate to the Organisation and shall make available for the information of Companies and ships:.1 the names and contact details of their national authority or authorities responsible for ship and port facility security;.2 the locations within their territory covered by the approved port facility security plans;.3 the names and contact details of those who have been designated to be available at all times to receive and act upon the ship-to-shore security alerts, referred to in regulation 6.2.1;.4 the names and contact details of those who have been designated to be available at all times to receive and act upon any communications from Contracting Governments exercising control and compliance measures, referred to in regulation 9.3.1; and.5 the names and contact details of those who have been designated to be available at all times to provide advice or assistance to ships and to whom ships can report any security concerns, referred to in regulation 7.2; and thereafter update such information as and when changes relating thereto occur. The Organisation shall circulate such particulars to other Contracting Governments for the information of their officers.2 Contracting Governments shall, not later than 1 July 2004, communicate to the Organisation the names and contact details of any recognised security organisations authorised to act on their behalf together with details of the specific responsibility and conditions of authority delegated to such organisations.

The Diplomatic Conference on Maritime Security held in London in December 2002 adopted new provisions in the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea, 1974 and this Code to enhance maritime security. These new requirements form the international framework through which ships and port facilities can cooperate to detect and deter acts which threaten security in the maritime transport sector.2. Following the tragic events of 11th September 2001, the twenty-second session of the Assembly of the International Maritime Organisation ('the Organisation'), in November 2001, unanimously agreed to the development of new measures relating to the security of ships and of port facilities for adoption by a Conference of Contracting Governments to the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea, 1974 (known as the Diplomatic Conference on Maritime Security) in December 2002. Preparation for the Diplomatic Conference was entrusted to the Organisation's Maritime Safety Committee (MSC) on the basis of submissions made by Member States, intergovernmental organisations and non-governmental organisations in consultative status with the Organisation.3. The MSC, at its first extraordinary session, held also in November 2001, in order to accelerate the development and the adoption of the appropriate security measures, established an MSC Intersessional Working Group on Maritime Security. The first meeting of the MSC Intersessional Working Group on Maritime Security was held in February 2002 and the outcome of its discussions was reported to, and considered by, the seventy-fifth session of the MSC in May 2002, when an ad hoc Working Group was established to further develop the proposals made. The seventy-fifth session of the MSC considered the report of that Working Group and recommended that work should be taken forward through a further MSC Intersessional Working Group, which was held in September 2002. The seventy-sixth session of the MSC considered the outcome of the September 2002 session of the MSC Intersessional Working Group and the further work undertaken by the MSC Working Group held in conjunction with the Committee's seventy-sixth session in December 2002, immediately prior to the Diplomatic Conference, and agreed the final version of the proposed texts to be considered by the Diplomatic Conference.4. The Diplomatic Conference (9 to 13 December 2002) also adopted amendments to the existing provisions of the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea, 1974 (SOLAS 74) accelerating the implementation of the requirement to fit Automatic Identification Systems and adopted new regulations in chapter XI-1 of SOLAS 74 covering marking of the Ship Identification Number and the carriage of a Continuous Synopsis Record. The Diplomatic Conference also adopted a number of Conference resolutions, including those covering implementation and revision of this Code, technical cooperation, and cooperative work with the International Labour Organisation and World Customs Organisation. It was recognised that review and amendment of certain of the new provisions regarding maritime security may be required on completion of the work of these two Organisations.5. The provisions of chapter XI-2 of SOLAS 74 and this Code apply to ships and to port facilities. The extension of SOLAS 74 to cover port facilities was agreed on the basis that SOLAS 74 offered the speediest means of ensuring the necessary security measures entered into force and given effect quickly. However, it was further agreed that the provisions relating to port facilities should relate solely to the ship/port interface. The wider issue of the security of port areas will be the subject of further joint work between the International Maritime Organisation and the International Labour Organisation. It was also agreed that the provisions should not extend to the actual response to attacks or to any necessary clear-up activities after such an attack.6. In drafting the provision, care has been taken to ensure compatibility with the provisions of the International Convention on Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping for Seafarers, 1978, as amended, the International Safety Management (ISM) Code and the harmonised system of survey and certification.7. The provisions represent a significant change in the approach of the international maritime industries to the issue of security in the maritime transport sector. It is recognised that they may place a significant additional burden on certain Contracting Governments. The importance of technical cooperation to assist Contracting Governments implement the provisions is fully recognised.8. Implementation of the provisions will require continuing effective cooperation and understanding between all those involved with, or using, ships and port facilities, including ship's personnel, port personnel, passengers, cargo interests, ship and port management and those in National and Local Authorities with security responsibilities. Existing practices and procedures will have to be reviewed and changed if they do not provide an adequate level of security. In the interests of enhanced maritime security, additional responsibilities will have to be carried by the shipping and port industries and by National and Local Authorities.9. The guidance given in part B of this Code should be taken into account when implementing the security provisions set out in chapter XI-2 of SOLAS 74 and in part A of this Code. However, it is recognised that the extent to which the guidance applies may vary depending on the nature of the port facility and of the ship, its trade and/or cargo.10. Nothing in this Code shall be interpreted or applied in a manner inconsistent with the proper respect of fundamental rights and freedoms as set out in international instruments, particularly those relating to maritime workers and refugees, including the International Labour Organisation Declaration of Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work as well as international standards concerning maritime and port workers.11. Recognising that the Convention on the Facilitation of Maritime Traffic, 1965, as amended, provides that foreign crew members shall be allowed ashore by the public authorities while the ship on which they arrive is in port, provided that the formalities on arrival of the ship have been fulfilled and the public authorities have no reason to refuse permission to come ashore for reasons of public health, public safety or public order, Contracting Governments, when approving ship and port facility security plans, should pay due cognisance to the fact that ship's personnel live and work on the vessel and need shore leave and access to shore-based seafarer welfare facilities, including medical care.PART AMANDATORY REQUIREMENTS REGARDING THE PROVISIONS OF CHAPTER XI-2 OF THE ANNEX TO THE INTERNATIONAL CONVENTION FOR THE SAFETY OF LIFE AT SEA, 1974, AS AMENDED1 GENERAL1.1 IntroductionThis part of the International Code for the Security of Ships and of Port Facilities contains mandatory provisions to which reference is made in chapter XI-2 of the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea, 1974, as amended.1.2 ObjectivesThe objectives of this Code are:.1 to establish an international framework involving cooperation between Contracting Governments, Government agencies, local administrations and the shipping and port industries to detect security threats and take preventive measures against security incidents affecting ships or port facilities used in international trade;.2 to establish the respective roles and responsibilities of the Contracting Governments, Government agencies, local administrations and the shipping and port industries, at the national and international level, for ensuring maritime security;.3 to ensure the early and efficient collection and exchange of security-related information;.4 to provide a methodology for security assessments so as to have in place plans and procedures to react to changing security levels; and.5 to ensure confidence that adequate and proportionate maritime security measures are in place.1.3 Functional requirementsIn order to achieve its objectives, this Code embodies a number of functional requirements.

No Certificate shall be extended for a period longer than three months, and the ship to which an extension is granted shall not, on its arrival in the port in which it is to be verified, be entitled by virtue of such extension to leave that port without having a new Certificate. When the renewal verification is completed, the new Certificate shall be valid to a date not exceeding five years from the expiry date of the existing Certificate before the extension was granted.19.3.6 A Certificate issued to a ship engaged on short voyages which has not been extended under the foregoing provisions of this section may be extended by the Administration for a period of grace of up to one month from the date of expiry stated on it. When the renewal verification is completed, the new Certificate shall be valid to a date not exceeding five years from the date of expiry of the existing Certificate before the extension was granted.19.3.7 If an intermediate verification is completed before the period specified in section 19.1.1, then:.1 the expiry date shown on the Certificate shall be amended by endorsement to a date which shall not be more than three years later than the date on which the intermediate verification was completed;.2 the expiry date may remain unchanged provided one or more additional verifications are carried out so that the maximum intervals between the verifications prescribed by section 19.1.1 are not exceeded.19.3.8 A Certificate issued under section 19.2 shall cease to be valid in any of the following cases:.1 if the relevant verifications are not completed within the periods specified under section 19.1.1;.2 if the Certificate is not endorsed in accordance with section 19.1.1.3 and 19.3.7.1, if applicable;.3 when a Company assumes the responsibility for the operation of a ship not previously operated by that Company; and.4 upon transfer of the ship to the flag of another State.19.3.9 In the case of:.1 a transfer of a ship to the flag of another Contracting Government, the Contracting Government whose flag the ship was formerly entitled to fly shall, as soon as possible, transmit to the receiving Administration copies of, or all information relating to, the International Ship Security Certificate carried by the ship before the transfer and copies of available verification reports, or.2 a Company that assumes responsibility for the operation of a ship not previously operated by that Company, the previous Company shall, as soon as possible, transmit to the receiving Company copies of any information related to the International Ship Security Certificate or to facilitate the verifications described in section 19.4.2.19.4 Interim certification19.4.1 The Certificates specified in section 19.2 shall be issued only when the Administration issuing the Certificate is fully satisfied that the ship complies with the requirements of section 19.1. However, after 1 July 2004, for the purposes of:.1 a ship without a Certificate, on delivery or prior to its entry or re-entry into service;.2 transfer of a ship from the flag of a Contracting Government to the flag of another Contracting Government;.3 transfer of a ship to the flag of a Contracting Government from a State which is not a Contracting Government; or.4 a Company assuming the responsibility for the operation of a ship not previously operated by that Companyuntil the Certificate referred to in section 19.2 is issued, the Administration may cause an Interim International Ship Security Certificate to be issued, in a form corresponding to the model given in the appendix to this Part of the Code.19.4.2 An Interim International Ship Security Certificate shall only be issued when the Administration or recognised security organisation, on behalf of the Administration, has verified that:.1 the ship security assessment required by this Part of the Code has been completed;.2 a copy of the ship security plan meeting the requirements of chapter XI-2 and part A of this Code is provided on board, has been submitted for review and approval, and is being implemented on the ship;.3 the ship is provided with a ship security alert system meeting the requirements of regulation XI-2/6, if required;.4 the company security officer:.1 has ensured:.1 the review of the ship security plan for compliance with this Part of the Code;.2 that the plan has been submitted for approval; and.3 that the plan is being implemented on the ship; and.2 has established the necessary arrangements, including arrangements for drills, exercises and internal audits, through which the company security officer is satisfied that the ship will successfully complete the required verification in accordance with section 19.1.1.1, within 6 months;.5 arrangements have been made for carrying out the required verifications under section 19.1.1.1;.6 the master, the ship security officer and other ship's personnel with specific security duties are familiar with their duties and responsibilities as specified in this Part of the Code; and with the relevant provisions of the ship security plan placed on board; and have been provided such information in the working language of the ship's personnel or languages understood by them; and.7 the ship security officer meets the requirements of this Part of the Code.19.4.3 An Interim International Ship Security Certificate may be issued by the Administration or by a recognised security organisation authorised to act on its behalf.19.4.4 An Interim International Ship Security Certificate shall be valid for 6 months, or until the Certificate required by section 19.2 is issued, whichever comes first, and may not be extended.19.4.5 No Contracting Government shall cause a subsequent, consecutive Interim International Ship Security Certificate to be issued to a ship if, in the judgement of the Administration or the recognised security organisation, one of the purposes of the ship or a Company in requesting such certificate is to avoid full compliance with chapter XI-2 and this Part of the Code beyond the period of the initial Interim Certificate as specified in section 19.4.4.19.4.6 For the purposes of regulation XI-2/9, Contracting Governments may, prior to accepting an Interim International Ship Security Certificate as a valid Certificate, ensure that the requirements of sections 19.4.2.4 to 19.4.2.6 have been met.Appendix to Part AAppendix 1>PIC FILE= \"L_2004129EN.004102.TIF\">>PIC FILE= \"L_2004129EN.004201.TIF\">>PIC FILE= \"L_2004129EN.004301.TIF\">>PIC FILE= \"L_2004129EN.004401.TIF\">Appendix 2>PIC FILE= \"L_2004129EN.004502.TIF\">\"ANNEX III\"PART BGUIDANCE REGARDING THE PROVISIONS OF CHAPTER XI-2 OF THE ANNEX TO THE INTERNATIONAL CONVENTION FOR THE SAFETY OF LIFE AT SEA, 1974 AS AMENDED AND PART A OF THIS CODE1. INTRODUCTIONGeneral1.1 The preamble of this Code indicates that chapter XI-2 and part A of this Code establish the new international framework of measures to enhance maritime security and through which ships and port facilities can cooperate to detect and deter acts which threaten security in the maritime transport sector.1.2 This introduction outlines, in a concise manner, the processes envisaged in establishing and implementing the measures and arrangements needed to achieve and maintain compliance with the provisions of chapter XI-2 and of part A of this Code and identifies the main elements on which guidance is offered. The guidance is provided in paragraphs 2 through to 19. It also sets down essential considerations which should be taken into account when considering the application of the guidance relating to ships and port facilities.1.3 If the reader's interest relates to ships alone, it is strongly recommended that this Part of the Code is still read as a whole, particularly the paragraphs relating to port facilities. The same applies to those whose primary interest is port facilities; they should also read the paragraphs relating to ships.1.4 The guidance provided in the following paragraphs relates primarily to protection of the ship when it is at a port facility. There could, however, be situations when a ship may pose a threat to the port facility, e.g. because, once within the port facility, it could be used as a base from which to launch an attack. When considering the appropriate security measures to respond to ship-based security threats, those completing the port facility security assessment or preparing the port facility security plan should consider making appropriate adaptations to the guidance offered in the following paragraphs.1.5 The reader is advised that nothing in this Part of the Code should be read or interpreted in conflict with any of the provisions of either chapter XI-2 or part A of this Code and that the aforesaid provisions always prevail and override any unintended inconsistency which may have been inadvertently expressed in this Part of the Code. The guidance provided in this Part of the Code should always be read, interpreted and applied in a manner which is consistent with the aims, objectives and principles established in chapter XI-2 and part A of this Code.Responsibilities of Contracting Governments1.6 Contracting Governments have, under the provisions of chapter XI-2 and part A of this Code, various responsibilities, which, amongst others, include:- setting the applicable security level;- approving the ship security plan (SSP) and relevant amendments to a previously approved plan;- verifying the compliance of ships with the provisions of chapter XI-2 and part A of this Code and issuing to ships the International Ship Security Certificate;- determining which of the port facilities located within their territory are required to designate a port facility security officer (PFSO) who will be responsible for the preparation of the port facility security plan;- ensuring completion and approval of the port facility security assessment (PFSA) and of any subsequent amendments to a previously approved assessment;- approving the port facility security plan (PFSP) and any subsequent amendments to a previously approved plan;- exercising control and compliance measures;- testing approved plans; and- communicating information to the International Maritime Organisation and to the shipping and port industries.1.7 Contracting Governments can designate, or establish, Designated Authorities within Government to undertake, with respect to port facilities, their security duties under chapter XI-2 and part A of this Code and allow recognised security organisations to carry out certain work with respect to port facilities, but the final decision on the acceptance and approval of this work should be given by the Contracting Government or the Designated Authority. Administrations may also delegate the undertaking of certain security duties, relating to ships, to recognised security organisations. The following duties or activities cannot be delegated to a recognised security organisation:- setting of the applicable security level;- determining which of the port facilities located within the territory of a Contracting Government are required to designate a PFSO and to prepare a PFSP;- approving a PFSA or any subsequent amendments to a previously approved assessment;- approving a PFSP or any subsequent amendments to a previously approved plan;- exercising control and compliance measures; and- establishing the requirements for a Declaration of Security.Setting the security level1.8 The setting of the security level applying at any particular time is the responsibility of Contracting Governments and can apply to ships and port facilities. Part A of this Code defines three security levels for international use. These are:- Security level 1, normal; the level at which ships and port facilities normally operate;- Security level 2, heightened; the level applying for as long as there is a heightened risk of a security incident; and- Security level 3, exceptional; the level applying for the period of time when there is the probable or imminent risk of a security incident.The Company and the ship1.9 Any Company operating ships to which chapter XI-2 and part A of this Code apply has to designate a CSO for the Company and a SSO for each of its ships. The duties, responsibilities and training requirements of these officers and requirements for drills and exercises are defined in part A of this Code.1.10 The company security officer's responsibilities include, in brief amongst others, ensuring that a ship security assessment (SSA) is properly carried out, that a SSP is prepared and submitted for approval by, or on behalf of, the Administration and thereafter is placed on board each ship to which part A of this Code applies and in respect of which that person has been appointed as the CSO.1.11 The SSP should indicate the operational and physical security measures the ship itself should take to ensure it always operates at security level 1. The plan should also indicate the additional, or intensified, security measures the ship itself can take to move to and operate at security level 2 when instructed to do so. Furthermore, the plan should indicate the possible preparatory actions the ship could take to allow prompt response to the instructions that may be issued to the ship by those responding at security level 3 to a security incident or threat thereof.1.12 The ships to which the requirements of chapter XI-2 and part A of this Code apply are required to have, and operated in accordance with, a SSP approved by, or on behalf of, the Administration. The CSO and the SSO should monitor the continuing relevance and effectiveness of the plan, including the undertaking of internal audits. Amendments to any of the elements of an approved plan, for which the Administration has determined that approval is required, have to be submitted for review and approval before their incorporation into the approved plan and their implementation by the ship.1.13 The ship has to carry an International Ship Security Certificate indicating that it complies with the requirements of chapter XI-2 and part A of this Code. Part A of this Code includes provisions relating to the verification and certification of the ship's compliance with the requirements on an initial, renewal and intermediate verification basis.1.14 When a ship is at a port or is proceeding to a port of a Contracting Government, the Contracting Government has the right, under the provisions of regulation XI-2/9, to exercise various control and compliance measures with respect to that ship. The ship is subject to port State control inspections but such inspections will not normally extend to examination of the SSP itself except in specific circumstances. The ship may also be subject to additional control measures if the Contracting Government exercising the control and compliance measures has reason to believe that the security of the ship has, or the port facilities it has served have, been compromised.1.15 The ship is also required to have on board information, to be made available to Contracting Governments upon request, indicating who is responsible for deciding the employment of the ship's personnel and for deciding various aspects relating to the employment of the ship.The port facility1.16 Each Contracting Government has to ensure completion of a PFSA for each of the port facilities, located within its territory, serving ships engaged on international voyages. The Contracting Government, a Designated Authority or a recognised security organisation may carry out this assessment. The completed PFSA has to be approved by the Contracting Government or the Designated Authority concerned. This approval cannot be delegated. Port facility security assessments should be periodically reviewed.1.17 The PFSA is fundamentally a risk analysis of all aspects of a port facility's operation in order to determine which part(s) of it are more susceptible, and/or more likely, to be the subject of attack. Security risk is a function of the threat of an attack coupled with the vulnerability of the target and the consequences of an attack.The assessment must include the following components:- determination of the perceived threat to port installations and infrastructure;- identification of the potential vulnerabilities; and- calculation of the consequences of incidents.On completion of the analysis, it will be possible to produce an overall assessment of the level of risk. The PFSA will help determine which port facilities are required to appoint a PFSO and prepare a PFSP.1.18 The port facilities which have to comply with the requirements of chapter XI-2 and part A of this Code are required to designate a PFSO. The duties, responsibilities and training requirements of these officers and requirements for drills and exercises are defined in part A of this Code.1.19 The PFSP should indicate the operational and physical security measures the port facility should take to ensure that it always operates at security level 1. The plan should also indicate the additional, or intensified, security measures the port facility can take to move to and operate at security level 2 when instructed to do so. Furthermore, the plan should indicate the possible preparatory actions the port facility could take to allow prompt response to the instructions that may be issued by those responding at security level 3 to a security incident or threat thereof.1.20 The port facilities which have to comply with the requirements of chapter XI-2 and part A of this Code are required to have, and operate in accordance with, a PFSP approved by the Contracting Government or by the Designated Authority concerned. The PFSO should implement its provisions and monitor the continuing effectiveness and relevance of the plan, including commissioning internal audits of the application of the plan. Amendments to any of the elements of an approved plan, for which the Contracting Government or the Designated Authority concerned has determined that approval is required, have to be submitted for review and approval before their incorporation into the approved plan and their implementation at the port facility. The Contracting Government or the Designated Authority concerned may test the effectiveness of the plan. The PFSA covering the port facility or on which the development of the plan has been based should be regularly reviewed. All these activities may lead to amendment of the approved plan. Any amendments to specified elements of an approved plan will have to be submitted for approval by the Contracting Government or by the Designated Authority concerned.1.21 Ships using port facilities may be subject to the port State control inspections and additional control measures outlined in regulation XI-2/9. The relevant authorities may request the provision of information regarding the ship, its cargo, passengers and ship's personnel prior to the ship's entry into port. There may be circumstances in which entry into port could be denied.Information and communication1.22 Chapter XI-2 and part A of this Code require Contracting Governments to provide certain information to the International Maritime Organisation and for information to be made available to allow effective communication between Contracting Governments and between company security officers/ship security officers and the port facility security officers.2. DEFINITIONS2.1 No guidance is provided with respect to the definitions set out in chapter XI-2 or part A of this Code.2.2 For the purpose of this Part of the Code:.1 'section' means a section of part A of the Code and is indicated as 'section A/&lt; followed by the number of the section &gt;';.2 'paragraph' means a paragraph of this Part of the Code and is indicated as 'paragraph &lt; followed by the number of the paragraph  &gt;'; and.3 'Contracting Government', when used in paragraphs 14 to 18, means the 'Contracting Government within whose territory the port facility is located' and includes a reference to the Designated Authority.3. APPLICATIONGeneral3.1 The guidance given in this Part of the Code should be taken into account when implementing the requirements of chapter XI-2 and part A of this Code.3.2 However, it should be recognised that the extent to which the guidance on ships applies will depend on the type of ship, its cargoes and/or passengers, its trading pattern and the characteristics of the port facilities visited by the ship.3.3 Similarly, in relation to the guidance on port facilities, the extent to which this guidance applies will depend on the port facilities, the types of ships using the port facility, the types of cargo and/or passengers and the trading patterns of visiting ships.3.4 The provisions of chapter XI-2 and part A of this Code are not intended to apply to port facilities designed and used primarily for military purposes.4. RESPONSIBILITIES OF CONTRACTING GOVERNMENTSSecurity of assessments and plans4.1 Contracting Governments should ensure that appropriate measures are in place to avoid unauthorised disclosure of, or access to, security-sensitive material relating to ship security assessments (SSAs), ship security plans (SSPs), port facility security assessments (PFSAs) and port facility security plans (PFSPs), and to individual assessments or plans.Designated Authorities4.2 Contracting Governments may identify a Designated Authority within Government to undertake their security duties relating to port facilities as set out in chapter XI-2 or part A of this Code.Recognised security organisations4.3 Contracting Governments may authorise a recognised security organisation (RSO) to undertake certain security-related activities, including:.1 approval of ship security plans, or amendments thereto, on behalf of the Administration;.2 verification and certification of compliance of ships with the requirements of chapter XI-2 and part A of this Code on behalf of the Administration; and.3 conducting port facility security assessments required by the Contracting Government.4.4 An RSO may also advise or provide assistance to Companies or port facilities on security matters, including ship security assessments, ship security plans, port facility security assessments and port facility security plans. This can include completion of a SSA or SSP or PFSA or PFSP. If an RSO has done so in respect of a SSA or SSP, that RSO should not be authorised to approve that SSP.4.5 When authorising an RSO, Contracting Governments should give consideration to the competency of such an organisation. An RSO should be able to demonstrate:.1 expertise in relevant aspects of security;.2 appropriate knowledge of ship and port operations, including knowledge of ship design and construction if providing services in respect of ships and of port design and construction if providing services in respect of port facilities;.3 their capability to assess the likely security risks that could occur during ship and port facility operations, including the ship/port interface, and how to minimise such risks;.4 their ability to maintain and improve the expertise of their personnel;.5 their ability to monitor the continuing trustworthiness of their personnel;.6 their ability to maintain appropriate measures to avoid unauthorised disclosure of, or access to, security-sensitive material;.7 their knowledge of the requirements of chapter XI-2 and part A of this Code and relevant national and international legislation and security requirements;.8 their knowledge of current security threats and patterns;.9 their knowledge of recognition and detection of weapons, dangerous substances and devices;.10 their knowledge of recognition, on a non-discriminatory basis, of characteristics and behavioural patterns of persons who are likely to threaten security;.11 their knowledge of techniques used to circumvent security measures; and.12 their knowledge of security and surveillance equipment and systems and their operational limitations.When delegating specific duties to a RSO, Contracting Governments, including Administrations, should ensure that the RSO has the competencies needed to undertake the task.4.6 A recognised organisation, as referred to in regulation I/6 and fulfilling the requirements of regulation XI-1/1, may be appointed as a RSO provided it has the appropriate security-related expertise listed in paragraph 4.5.4.7 A port or harbour Authority or port facility operator may be appointed as a RSO provided it has the appropriate security-related expertise listed in paragraph 4.5.Setting the security level4.8 In setting the security level, Contracting Governments should take account of general and specific threat information. Contracting Governments should set the security level applying to ships or port facilities at one of three levels:- Security level 1, normal; the level at which the ship or port facility normally operates;- Security level 2, heightened; the level applying for as long as there is a heightened risk of a security incident; and- Security level 3, exceptional; the level applying for the period of time when there is the probable or imminent risk of a security incident.4.9 Setting security level 3 should be an exceptional measure applying only when there is credible information that a security incident is probable or imminent. Security level 3 should only be set for the duration of the identified security threat or actual security incident. While the security levels may change from security level 1, through security level 2 to security level 3, it is also possible that the security levels will change directly from security level 1 to security level 3.4.10 At all times the master of a ship has the ultimate responsibility for the safety and security of the ship. Even at security level 3 a master may seek clarification or amendment of instructions issued by those responding to a security incident, or threat thereof, if there are reasons to believe that compliance with any instruction may imperil the safety of the ship.4.11 The CSO or the SSO should liaise at the earliest opportunity with the PFSO of the port facility the ship is intended to visit to establish the security level applying for that ship at the port facility. Having established contact with a ship, the PFSO should advise the ship of any subsequent change in the port facility's security level and should provide the ship with any relevant security information.4.12 While there may be circumstances when an individual ship may be operating at a higher security level than the port facility it is visiting, there will be no circumstances when a ship can have a lower security level than the port facility it is visiting. If a ship has a higher security level than the port facility it intends to use, the CSO or SSO should advise the PFSO without delay. The PFSO should undertake an assessment of the particular situation in consultation with the CSO or SSO and agree on appropriate security measures with the ship, which may include completion and signing of a Declaration of Security.4.13 Contracting Governments should consider how information on changes in security levels should be promulgated rapidly. Administrations may wish to use NAVTEX messages or Notices to Mariners as the method for notifying such changes in security levels to the ship and to CSO and SSO. Or, they may wish to consider other methods of communication that provide equivalent or better speed and coverage. Contracting Governments should establish means of notifying PFSOs of changes in security levels. Contracting Governments should compile and maintain the contact details for a list of those who need to be informed of changes in security levels. Whereas the security level need not be regarded as being particularly sensitive, the underlying threat information may be highly sensitive. Contracting Governments should give careful consideration to the type and detail of the information conveyed and the method by which it is conveyed to SSOs, CSOs and PFSOs.Contact points and information on port facility security plans4.14 Where a port facility has a PFSP, that fact has to be communicated to the Organisation and that information must also be made available to CSOs and SSOs. No further details of the PFSP have to be published other than that it is in place. Contracting Governments should consider establishing either central or regional points of contact, or other means of providing up-to-date information on the locations where PFSPs are in place, together with contact details for the relevant PFSO. The existence of such contact points should be publicised. They could also provide information on the recognised security organisations appointed to act on behalf of the Contracting Government, together with details of the specific responsibility and conditions of authority delegated to such recognised security organisations.4.15 In the case of a port that does not have a PFSP (and therefore does not have a PFSO), the central or regional point of contact should be able to identify a suitably qualified person ashore who can arrange for appropriate security measures to be in place, if needed, for the duration of the ship's visit.4.16 Contracting Governments should also provide the contact details of Government officers to whom an SSO, a CSO and a PFSO can report security concerns. These Government officers should assess such reports before taking appropriate action. Such reported concerns may have a bearing on the security measures falling under the jurisdiction of another Contracting Government. In that case, the Contracting Governments should consider contacting their counterpart in the other Contracting Government to discuss whether remedial action is appropriate. For this purpose, the contact details of the Government officers should be communicated to the International Maritime Organisation.4.17 Contracting Governments should also make the information indicated in paragraphs 4.14 to 4.16 available to other Contracting Governments on request.Identification documents4.18 Contracting Governments are encouraged to issue appropriate identification documents to Government officials entitled to board ships or enter port facilities when performing their official duties and to establish procedures whereby the authenticity of such documents might be verified.Fixed and floating platforms and mobile offshore drilling units on location4.19 Contracting Governments should consider establishing appropriate security measures for fixed and floating platforms and mobile offshore drilling units on location to allow interaction with ships which are required to comply with the provisions of chapter XI-2 and part A of this Code.Ships which are not required to comply with part A of this Code4.20 Contracting Governments should consider establishing appropriate security measures to enhance the security of ships to which chapter XI-2 and part A of this Code do not apply and to ensure that any security provisions applying to such ships allow interaction with ships to which part A of this Code applies.Threats to ships and other incidents at sea4.21 Contracting Governments should provide general guidance on the measures considered appropriate to reduce the security risk to ships flying their flag when at sea. They should provide specific advice on the action to be taken in accordance with security levels 1 to 3, if:.1 there is a change in the security level applying to the ship while it is at sea, e.g. because of the geographical area in which it is operating or relating to the ship itself; and.2 there is a security incident or threat thereof involving the ship while at sea.Contracting Governments should establish the best methods and procedures for these purposes. In the case of an imminent attack, the ship should seek to establish direct communication with those responsible in the flag State for responding to security incidents.4.22 Contracting Governments should also establish a point of contact for advice on security for any ship:.1 entitled to fly their flag; or.2 operating in their territorial sea or having communicated an intention to enter their territorial sea.4.23 Contracting Governments should offer advice to ships operating in their territorial sea or having communicated an intention to enter their territorial sea, which could include advice:.1 to alter or delay their intended passage;.2 to navigate on a particular course or proceed to a specific location;.3 on the availability of any personnel or equipment that could be placed on the ship;.4 to coordinate the passage, arrival into port or departure from port, to allow escort by patrol craft or aircraft (fixed-wing or helicopter).Contracting Governments should remind ships operating in their territorial sea, or having communicated an intention to enter their territorial sea, of any temporary restricted areas that they have published.4.24 Contracting Governments should recommend that ships operating in their territorial sea, or having communicated an intention to enter their territorial sea, implement expeditiously, for the ship's protection and for the protection of other ships in the vicinity, any security measure the Contracting Government may have advised.4.25 The plans prepared by the Contracting Governments for the purposes given in paragraph 4.22 should include information on an appropriate point of contact, available on a 24-hour basis, within the Contracting Government including the Administration. These plans should also include information on the circumstances in which the Administration considers assistance should be sought from nearby coastal States, and a procedure for liaison between PFSOs and SSOs.Alternative security agreements4.26 Contracting Governments, in considering how to implement chapter XI-2 and part A of this Code, may conclude one or more agreements with one or more Contracting Governments. The scope of an agreement is limited to short international voyages on fixed routes between port facilities in the territory of the parties to the agreement. When concluding an agreement, and thereafter, the Contracting Governments should consult other Contracting Governments and Administrations with an interest in the effects of the agreement. Ships flying the flag of a State that is not party to the agreement should only be allowed to operate on the fixed routes covered by the agreement if their Administration agrees that the ship should comply with the provisions of the agreement and requires the ship to do so. In no case can such an agreement compromise the level of security of other ships and port facilities not covered by it, and specifically, all ships covered by such an agreement may not conduct ship-to-ship activities with ships not so covered. Any operational interface undertaken by ships covered by the agreement should be covered by it. The operation of each agreement must be continually monitored and amended when the need arises and in any event should be reviewed every 5 years.Equivalent arrangements for port facilities4.27 For certain specific port facilities with limited or special operations but with more than occasional traffic, it may be appropriate to ensure compliance by security measures equivalent to those prescribed in chapter XI-2 and in part A of this Code. This can, in particular, be the case for terminals such as those attached to factories, or quaysides with no frequent operations.Manning level4.28 In establishing the minimum safe manning of a ship, the Administration should take into account that the minimum safe manning provisions established by regulation V/14 only address the safe navigation of the ship. The Administration should also take into account any additional workload which may result from the implementation of the SSP and ensure that the ship is sufficiently and effectively manned. In doing so, the Administration should verify that ships are able to implement the hours of rest and other measures to address fatigue which have been promulgated by national law, in the context of all shipboard duties assigned to the various shipboard personnel.Control and compliance measuresGeneral4.29 Regulation XI-2/9 describes the control and compliance measures applicable to ships under chapter XI-2. It is divided into three distinct sections; control of ships already in a port, control of ships intending to enter a port of another Contracting Government, and additional provisions applicable to both situations.4.30 Regulation XI-2/9.1, Control of ships in port, implements a system for the control of ships while in the port of a foreign country where duly authorised officers of the Contracting Government ('duly authorised officers') have the right to go on board the ship to verify that the required certificates are in proper order. Then, if there are clear grounds to believe the ship does not comply, control measures such as additional inspections or detention may be taken. This reflects current control systems. Regulation XI-2/9.1 builds on such systems and allows for additional measures (including expulsion of a ship from a port to be taken as a control measure) when duly authorised officers have clear grounds for believing that a ship is in non-compliance with the requirements of chapter XI-2 or part A of this Code. Regulation XI-2/9.3 describes the safeguards that promote fair and proportionate implementation of these additional measures.4.31 Regulation XI-2/9.2 applies control measures to ensure compliance to ships intending to enter a port of another Contracting Government and introduces an entirely different concept of control within chapter XI-2, applying to security only. Under this regulation, measures may be implemented prior to the ship entering port, to better ensure security. Just as in regulation XI-2/9.1, this additional control system is based on the concept of clear grounds for believing the ship does not comply with chapter XI-2 or part A of this Code, and includes significant safeguards in regulations XI-2/9.2.2 and XI-2/9.2.5 as well as in regulation XI-2/9.3.4.32 Clear grounds that the ship is not in compliance means evidence or reliable information that the ship does not correspond with the requirements of chapter XI-2 or part A of this Code, taking into account the guidance given in this Part of the Code. Such evidence or reliable information may arise from the duly authorised officer's professional judgement or observations gained while verifying the ship's International Ship Security Certificate or Interim International Ship Security Certificate issued in accordance with part A of this Code ('Certificate') or from other sources. Even if a valid Certificate is on board the ship, the duly authorised officers may still have clear grounds for believing that the ship is not in compliance based on their professional judgement.4.33 Examples of possible clear grounds under regulations XI-2/9.1 and XI-2/9.2 may include, when relevant:.1 evidence from a review of the certificate that it is not valid or it has expired;.2 evidence or reliable information that serious deficiencies exist in the security equipment, documentation or arrangements required by chapter XI-2 and part A of this Code;.3 receipt of a report or complaint which, in the professional judgement of the duly authorised officer, contains reliable information clearly indicating that the ship does not comply with the requirements of chapter XI-2 or part A of this Code;.4 evidence or observation gained by a duly authorised officer using professional judgement that the master or ship's personnel is not familiar with essential shipboard security procedures or cannot carry out drills related to the security of the ship or that such procedures or drills have not been carried out;.5 evidence or observation gained by a duly authorised officer using professional judgement that key members of ship's personnel are not able to establish proper communication with any other key members of ship's personnel with security responsibilities on board the ship;.6 evidence or reliable information that the ship has embarked persons or loaded stores or goods at a port facility or from another ship where either the port facility or the other ship is in violation of chapter XI-2 or part A of this Code, and the ship in question has not completed a Declaration of Security, nor taken appropriate, special or additional security measures or has not maintained appropriate ship security procedures;.7 evidence or reliable information that the ship has embarked persons or loaded stores or goods at a port facility or from another source (e.g., another ship or helicopter transfer) where either the port facility or the other source is not required to comply with chapter XI-2 or part A of this Code, and the ship has not taken appropriate, special or additional security measures or has not maintained appropriate security procedures; and.8 the ship holding a subsequent, consecutively issued Interim International Ship Security Certificate as described in section A/19.4, and, in the professional judgement of an officer duly authorised, one of the purposes of the ship or a Company in requesting such a Certificate is to avoid full compliance with chapter XI-2 and part A of this Code beyond the period of the initial Interim Certificate as described in section A/19.4.4.4.34 The international law implications of regulation XI-2/9 are particularly relevant, and the regulation should be implemented with regulation XI-2/2.4 in mind, as the potential exists for situations where either measures will be taken which fall outside the scope of chapter XI-2, or where rights of affected ships, outside chapter XI-2, should be considered. Thus, regulation XI-2/9 does not prejudice the Contracting Government from taking measures having a basis in, and consistent with, international law to ensure the safety or security of persons, ships, port facilities and other property in cases where the ship, although in compliance with chapter XI-2 and part A of this Code, is still considered to present a security risk.4.35 When a Contracting Government imposes control measures on a ship, the Administration should, without delay, be contacted with sufficient information to enable the Administration to fully liaise with the Contracting Government.Control of ships in port4.36 Where the non-compliance is either a defective item of equipment or faulty documentation leading to the ship's detention and the non-compliance cannot be remedied in the port of inspection, the Contracting Government may allow the ship to sail to another port provided that any conditions agreed between the port States and the Administration or master are met.Ships intending to enter the port of another Contracting Government4.37 Regulation XI-2/9.2.1 lists the information Contracting Governments may require from a ship as a condition of entry into port. One item of information listed is confirmation of any special or additional measures taken by the ship during its last 10 calls at a port facility. Examples could include:.1 records of the measures taken while visiting a port facility located in the territory of a State which is not a Contracting Government, especially those measures that would normally have been provided by port facilities located in the territories of Contracting Governments; and.2 any Declarations of Security that were entered into with port facilities or other ships.4.38 Another item of information listed, that may be required as a condition of entry into port, is confirmation that appropriate ship security procedures were maintained during ship-to-ship activity conducted within the period of the last 10 calls at a port facility. It would not normally be required to include records of transfers of pilots or of customs, immigration or security officials nor bunkering, lightering, loading of supplies and unloading of waste by ship within port facilities as these would normally fall within the auspices of the PFSP. Examples of information that might be given include:.1 records of the measures taken while engaged in a ship-to-ship activity with a ship flying the flag of a State which is not a Contracting Government, especially those measures that would normally have been provided by ships flying the flag of Contracting Governments;.2 records of the measures taken while engaged in a ship-to-ship activity with a ship that is flying the flag of a Contracting Government but is not required to comply with the provisions of chapter XI-2 and part A of this Code, such as a copy of any security certificate issued to that ship under other provisions; and.3 in the event that persons or goods rescued at sea are on board, all known information about such persons or goods, including their identities when known and the results of any checks run on behalf of the ship to establish the security status of those rescued. It is not the intention of chapter XI-2 or part A of this Code to delay or prevent the delivery of those in distress at sea to a place of safety. It is the sole intention of chapter XI-2 and part A of this Code to provide States with enough appropriate information to maintain their security integrity.4.39 Examples of other practical security-related information that may be required as a condition of entry into port in order to assist with ensuring the safety and security of persons, port facilities, ships and other property include:.1 information contained in the Continuous Synopsis Record;.2 location of the ship at the time the report is made;.3 expected time of arrival of the ship in port;.4 crew list;.5 general description of cargo aboard the ship;.6 passenger list; and.7 information required to be carried under regulation XI-2/5.4.40 Regulation XI-2/9.2.5 allows the master of a ship, upon being informed that the coastal or port State will implement control measures under regulation XI-2/9.2, to withdraw the intention for the ship to enter port. If the master withdraws that intention, regulation XI-2/9 no longer applies, and any other steps that are taken must be based on, and consistent with, international law.Additional provisions4.41 In all cases where a ship is denied entry or is expelled from a port, all known facts should be communicated to the authorities of relevant States. This communication should consist of the following, when known:.1 name of ship, its flag, the Ship Identification Number, call sign, ship type and cargo;.2 reason for denying entry or for expulsion from port or port areas;.3 if relevant, the nature of any security non-compliance;.4 if relevant, details of any attempts made to rectify any non-compliance, including any conditions imposed on the ship for the voyage;.5 past port(s) of call and next declared port of call;.6 time of departure and likely estimated time of arrival at those ports;.7 any instructions given to the ship, e.g., reporting on its route;.8 available information on the security level at which the ship is currently operating;.9 information regarding any communications the port State has had with the Administration;.10 contact point within the port State making the report for the purpose of obtaining further information;.11 crew list; and.12 any other relevant information.4.42 Relevant States to contact should include those along the ship's intended passage to its next port, particularly if the ship intends to enter the territorial sea of that coastal State. Other relevant States could include previous ports of call, so that further information might be obtained and security issues relating to the previous ports resolved.4.43 In exercising control and compliance measures, the duly authorised officers should ensure that any measures or steps imposed are proportionate. Such measures or steps should be reasonable and of the minimum severity and duration necessary to rectify or mitigate the non-compliance.4.44 The word 'delay' in regulation XI-2/9.3.5.1 also refers to situations where, pursuant to actions taken under this regulation, the ship is unduly denied entry into port or the ship is unduly expelled from port.Non-Party ships and ships below Convention size4.45 With respect to ships flying the flag of a State which is not a Contracting Government to the Convention and not a Party to the 1988 SOLAS Protocol(1), Contracting Governments should not give more favourable treatment to such ships. Accordingly, the requirements of regulation XI-2/9 and the guidance provided in this Part of the Code should be applied to those ships.4.46 Ships below Convention size are subject to measures by which States maintain security. Such measures should be taken with due regard to the requirements in chapter XI-2 and the guidance provided in this Part of the Code.5. DECLARATION OF SECURITYGeneral5.1 A Declaration of Security (DoS) should be completed when the Contracting Government of the port facility deems it to be necessary or when a ship deems it necessary.5.1.1 The need for a DoS may be indicated by the results of the port facility security assessment (PFSA) and the reasons and circumstances in which a DoS is required should be set out in the port facility security plan (PFSP).5.1.2 The need for a DoS may be indicated by an Administration for ships entitled to fly its flag or as a result of a ship security assessment (SSA) and should be set out in the ship security plan (SSP).5.2 It is likely that a DoS will be requested at higher security levels, when a ship has a higher security level than the port facility, or another ship with which it interfaces, and for ship/port interface or ship-to-ship activities that pose a higher risk to persons, property or the environment for reasons specific to that ship, including its cargo or passengers or the circumstances at the port facility or a combination of these factors.5.2.1 In the case that a ship or an Administration, on behalf of ships entitled to fly its flag, requests completion of a DoS, the port facility security officer (PFSO) or ship security officer (SSO) should acknowledge the request and discuss appropriate security measures.5.3 A PFSO may also initiate a DoS prior to ship/port interfaces that are identified in the approved PFSA as being of particular concern. Examples may include embarking or disembarking passengers and the transfer, loading or unloading of dangerous goods or hazardous substances. The PFSA may also identify facilities at or near highly populated areas or economically significant operations that warrant a DoS.5.4 The main purpose of a DoS is to ensure agreement is reached between the ship and the port facility or with other ships with which it interfaces as to the respective security measures each will undertake in accordance with the provisions of their respective approved security plans.5.4.1 The agreed DoS should be signed and dated by both the port facility and the ship(s), as applicable, to indicate compliance with chapter XI-2 and part A of this Code and should include its duration, the relevant security level or levels and the relevant contact details.5.4.2 A change in the security level may require that a new or revised DoS be completed.5.5 The DoS should be completed in English, French or Spanish or in a language common to both the port facility and the ship or the ships, as applicable.5.6 A model DoS is included in appendix 1 to this Part of the Code. This model is for a DoS between a ship and a port facility. If the DoS is to cover two ships this model should be appropriately adjusted.6. OBLIGATIONS OF THE COMPANYGeneral6.1 Regulation XI-2/5 requires the Company to provide the master of the ship with information to meet the requirements of the Company under the provisions of this regulation. This information should include items such as:.1 parties responsible for appointing shipboard personnel, such as ship management companies, manning agents, contractors, concessionaries (for example, retail sales outlets, casinos, etc.);.2 parties responsible for deciding the employment of the ship, including time or bareboat charterer(s) or any other entity acting in such capacity; and.3 in cases when the ship is employed under the terms of a charter party, the contact details of those parties, including time or voyage charterers.6.2 In accordance with regulation XI-2/5, the Company is obliged to update and keep this information current as and when changes occur.6.3 This information should be in English, French or Spanish language.6.4 With respect to ships constructed before 1 July 2004, this information should reflect the actual condition on that date.6.5 With respect to ships constructed on or after 1 July 2004 and for ships constructed before 1 July 2004 which were out of service on 1 July 2004, the information should be provided as from the date of entry of the ship into service and should reflect the actual condition on that date.6.6 After 1 July 2004, when a ship is withdrawn from service, the information should be provided as from the date of re-entry of the ship into service and should reflect the actual condition on that date.6.7 Previously provided information that does not relate to the actual condition on that date need not be retained on board.6.8 When the responsibility for the operation of the ship is assumed by another Company, the information relating to the Company which operated the ship is not required to be left on board.In addition, other relevant guidance is provided under sections 8, 9 and 13.7. SHIP SECURITYRelevant guidance is provided under sections 8, 9 and 13.8. SHIP SECURITY ASSESSMENTSecurity assessment8.1 The company security officer (CSO) is responsible for ensuring that a ship security assessment (SSA) is carried out for each of the ships in the Company's fleet which is required to comply with the provisions of chapter XI-2 and part A of this Code for which the CSO is responsible. While the CSO need not necessarily personally undertake all the duties associated with the post, the ultimate responsibility for ensuring that they are properly performed remains with the individual CSO.8.2 Prior to commencing the SSA, the CSO should ensure that advantage is taken of information available on the assessment of threat for the ports at which the ship will call or at which passengers embark or disembark and about the port facilities and their protective measures. The CSO should study previous reports on similar security needs. Where feasible, the CSO should meet with appropriate persons on the ship and in the port facilities to discuss the purpose and methodology of the assessment. The CSO should follow any specific guidance offered by the Contracting Governments.8.3 A SSA should address the following elements on board or within the ship:.1 physical security;.2 structural integrity;.3 personnel protection systems;.4 procedural policies;.5 radio and telecommunication systems, including computer systems and networks; and.6 other areas that may, if damaged or used for illicit observation, pose a risk to persons, property, or operations on board the ship or within a port facility.8.4 Those involved in conducting a SSA should be able to draw upon expert assistance in relation to:.1 knowledge of current security threats and patterns;.2 recognition and detection of weapons, dangerous substances and devices;.3 recognition, on a non-discriminatory basis, of characteristics and behavioural patterns of persons who are likely to threaten security;.4 techniques used to circumvent security measures;.5 methods used to cause a security incident;.6 effects of explosives on ship's structures and equipment;.7 ship security;.8 ship/port interface business practices;.9 contingency planning, emergency preparedness and response;.10 physical security;.11 radio and telecommunications systems, including computer systems and networks;.12 marine engineering; and.13 ship and port operations.8.5 The CSO should obtain and record the information required to conduct an assessment, including:.1 the general layout of the ship;.2 the location of areas which should have restricted access, such as navigation bridge, machinery spaces of category A and other control stations as defined in chapter II-2, etc.;.3 the location and function of each actual or potential access point to the ship;.4 changes in the tide which may have an impact on the vulnerability or security of the ship;.5 the cargo spaces and stowage arrangements;.6 the locations where the ship's stores and essential maintenance equipment is stored;.7 the locations where unaccompanied baggage is stored;.8 the emergency and stand-by equipment available to maintain essential services;.9 the number of ship's personnel, any existing security duties and any existing training requirement practises of the Company;.10 existing security and safety equipment for the protection of passengers and ship's personnel;.11 escape and evacuation routes and assembly stations which have to be maintained to ensure the orderly and safe emergency evacuation of the ship;.12 existing agreements with private security companies providing ship/water-side security services; and.13 existing security measures and procedures in effect, including inspection and, control procedures, identification systems, surveillance and monitoring equipment, personnel identification documents and communication, alarms, lighting, access control and other appropriate systems.8.6 The SSA should examine each identified point of access, including open weather decks, and evaluate its potential for use by individuals who might seek to breach security. This includes points of access available to individuals having legitimate access as well as those who seek to obtain unauthorised entry.8.7 The SSA should consider the continuing relevance of the existing security measures and guidance, procedures and operations, under both routine and emergency conditions, and should determine security guidance including:.1 the restricted areas;.2 the response procedures to fire or other emergency conditions;.3 the level of supervision of the ship's personnel, passengers, visitors, vendors, repair technicians, dock workers, etc.;.4 the frequency and effectiveness of security patrols;.5 the access control systems, including identification systems;.6 the security communications systems and procedures;.7 the security doors, barriers and lighting; and.8 the security and surveillance equipment and systems, if any.8.8 The SSA should consider the persons, activities, services and operations that it is important to protect. This includes:.1 the ship's personnel;.2 passengers, visitors, vendors, repair technicians, port facility personnel, etc.;.3 the capacity to maintain safe navigation and emergency response;.4 the cargo, particularly dangerous goods or hazardous substances;.5 the ship's stores;.6 the ship security communication equipment and systems, if any; and.7 the ship's security surveillance equipment and systems, if any.8.9 The SSA should consider all possible threats, which may include the following types of security incidents:.1 damage to, or destruction of, the ship or of a port facility, e.g. by explosive devices, arson, sabotage or vandalism;.2 hijacking or seizure of the ship or of persons on board;.3 tampering with cargo, essential ship equipment or systems or ship's stores;.4 unauthorised access or use, including presence of stowaways;.5 smuggling weapons or equipment, including weapons of mass destruction;.6 use of the ship to carry those intending to cause a security incident and/or their equipment;.7 use of the ship itself as a weapon or as a means to cause damage or destruction;.8 attacks from seaward whilst at berth or at anchor; and.9 attacks whilst at sea.8.10 The SSA should take into account all possible vulnerabilities, which may include:.1 conflicts between safety and security measures;.2 conflicts between shipboard duties and security assignments;.3 watchkeeping duties, number of ship's personnel, particularly with implications on crew fatigue, alertness and performance;.4 any identified security training deficiencies; and.5 any security equipment and systems, including communication systems.8.11 The CSO and ship security officer (SSO) should always have regard to the effect that security measures may have on ship's personnel who will remain on the ship for long periods. When developing security measures, particular consideration should be given to the convenience, comfort and personal privacy of the ship's personnel and their ability to maintain their effectiveness over long periods.8.12 Upon completion of the SSA, a report shall be prepared, consisting of a summary of how the assessment was conducted, a description of each vulnerability found during the assessment and a description of countermeasures that could be used to address each vulnerability. The report shall be protected from unauthorised access or disclosure.8.13 If the SSA has not been carried out by the Company, the report of the SSA should be reviewed and accepted by the CSO.On-scene security survey8.14 The on-scene security survey is an integral part of any SSA. The on-scene security survey should examine and evaluate existing shipboard protective measures, procedures and operations for:.1 ensuring the performance of all ship security duties;.2 monitoring restricted areas to ensure that only authorised persons have access;.3 controlling access to the ship, including any identification systems;.4 monitoring of deck areas and areas surrounding the ship;.5 controlling the embarkation of persons and their effects (accompanied and unaccompanied baggage and ship's personnel personal effects);.6 supervising the handling of cargo and the delivery of ship's stores; and.7 ensuring that ship security communication, information, and equipment are readily available.9. SHIP SECURITY PLANGeneral9.1 The company security officer (CSO) has the responsibility of ensuring that a ship security plan (SSP) is prepared and submitted for approval. The content of each individual SSP should vary depending on the particular ship it covers. The ship security assessment (SSA) will have identified the particular features of the ship and the potential threats and vulnerabilities. The preparation of the SSP will require these features to be addressed in detail. Administrations may prepare advice on the preparation and content of a SSP.9.2 All SSPs should:.1 detail the organisational structure of security for the ship;.2 detail the ship's relationships with the Company, port facilities, other ships and relevant authorities with security responsibility;.3 detail the communication systems to allow effective continuous communication within the ship and between the ship and others, including port facilities;.4 detail the basic security measures for security level 1, both operational and physical, that will always be in place;.5 detail the additional security measures that will allow the ship to progress without delay to security level 2 and, when necessary, to security level 3;.6 provide for regular review, or audit, of the SSP and for its amendment in response to experience or changing circumstances; and.7 detail reporting procedures to the appropriate Contracting Government's contact points.9.3 Preparation of an effective SSP should rest on a thorough assessment of all issues that relate to the security of the ship, including, in particular, a thorough appreciation of the physical and operational characteristics, including the voyage pattern, of the individual ship.9.4 All SSPs should be approved by, or on behalf of, the Administration. If an Administration uses a recognised security organisation (RSO) to review or approve the SSP, that RSO should not be associated with any other RSO that prepared, or assisted in the preparation of, the plan.9.5 CSOs and SSOs should develop procedures to:.1 assess the continuing effectiveness of the SSP; and.2 prepare amendments of the plan subsequent to its approval.9.6 The security measures included in the SSP should be in place when the initial verification for compliance with the requirements of chapter XI-2 and part A of this Code will be carried out. Otherwise the process of issue to the ship of the required International Ship Security Certificate cannot be carried out. If there is any subsequent failure of security equipment or systems, or suspension of a security measure for whatever reason, equivalent temporary security measures should be adopted, notified to, and agreed by the Administration.Organisation and performance of ship security duties9.7 In addition to the guidance given in paragraph 9.2, the SSP should establish the following, which relate to all security levels:.1 the duties and responsibilities of all shipboard personnel with a security role;.2 the procedures or safeguards necessary to allow such continuous communications to be maintained at all times;.3 the procedures needed to assess the continuing effectiveness of security procedures and any security and surveillance equipment and systems, including procedures for identifying and responding to equipment or systems failure or malfunction;.4 the procedures and practices to protect security-sensitive information held in paper or electronic format;.5 the type and maintenance requirements of security and surveillance equipment and systems, if any;.6 the procedures to ensure the timely submission, and assessment, of reports relating to possible breaches of security or security concerns; and.7 procedures to establish, maintain and update an inventory of any dangerous goods or hazardous substances carried on board, including their location.9.8 The remainder of section 9 addresses specifically the security measures that could be taken at each security level covering:.1 access to the ship by ship's personnel, passengers, visitors, etc.;.2 restricted areas on the ship;.3 handling of cargo;.4 delivery of ship's stores;.5 handling unaccompanied baggage; and.6 monitoring the security of the ship.Access to the ship9.9 The SSP should establish the security measures covering all means of access to the ship identified in the SSA. This should include any:.1 access ladders;.2 access gangways;.3 access ramps;.4 access doors, sidescuttles, windows and ports;.5 mooring lines and anchor chains; and.6 cranes and hoisting gear.9.10 For each of these the SSP should identify the appropriate locations where access restrictions or prohibitions should be applied for each of the security levels. For each security level the SSP should establish the type of restriction or prohibition to be applied and the means of enforcing them.9.11 The SSP should establish for each security level the means of identification required to allow access to the ship and for individuals to remain on the ship without challenge. This may involve developing an appropriate identification system allowing for permanent and temporary identifications, for ship's personnel and visitors respectively. Any ship identification system should, when it is practicable to do so, be coordinated with that applying to the port facility. Passengers should be able to prove their identity by boarding passes, tickets, etc., but should not be permitted access to restricted areas unless supervised. The SSP should establish provisions to ensure that the identification systems are regularly updated, and that abuse of procedures should be subject to disciplinary action.9.12 Those unwilling or unable to establish their identity and/or to confirm the purpose of their visit when requested to do so should be denied access to the ship and their attempt to obtain access should be reported, as appropriate, to the SSO, the CSO, the port facility security officer (PFSO) and to the national or local authorities with security responsibilities.9.13 The SSP should establish the frequency of application of any access controls, particularly if they are to be applied on a random, or occasional, basis.Security level 19.14 At security level 1, the SSP should establish the security measures to control access to the ship, where the following may be applied:.1 checking the identity of all persons seeking to board the ship and confirming their reasons for doing so by checking, for example, joining instructions, passenger tickets, boarding passes, work orders, etc.;.2 in liaison with the port facility, the ship should ensure that designated secure areas are established in which inspections and searching of persons, baggage (including carry-on items), personal effects, vehicles and their contents can take place;.3 in liaison with the port facility, the ship should ensure that vehicles destined to be loaded on board car carriers, ro-ro and other passenger ships are subjected to search prior to loading, in accordance with the frequency required in the SSP;.4 segregating checked persons and their personal effects from unchecked persons and their personal effects;.5 segregating embarking from disembarking passengers;.6 identifying access points that should be secured or attended to prevent unauthorised access;.7 securing, by locking or other means, access to unattended spaces adjoining areas to which passengers and visitors have access; and.8 providing security briefings to all ship personnel on possible threats, the procedures for reporting suspicious persons, objects or activities and the need for vigilance.9.15 At security level 1, all those seeking to board a ship should be liable to search. The frequency of such searches, including random searches, should be specified in the approved SSP and should be specifically approved by the Administration. Such searches may best be undertaken by the port facility in close cooperation with the ship and in close proximity to it. Unless there are clear security grounds for doing so, members of the ship's personnel should not be required to search their colleagues or their personal effects. Any such search shall be undertaken in a manner which fully takes into account the human rights of the individual and preserves their basic human dignity.Security level 29.16 At security level 2, the SSP should establish the security measures to be applied to protect against a heightened risk of a security incident to ensure higher vigilance and tighter control, which may include:.1 assigning additional personnel to patrol deck areas during silent hours to deter unauthorised access;.2 limiting the number of access points to the ship, identifying those to be closed and the means of adequately securing them;.3 deterring waterside access to the ship, including, for example, in liaison with the port facility, provision of boat patrols;.4 establishing a restricted area on the shore side of the ship, in close cooperation with the port facility;.5 increasing the frequency and detail of searches of persons, personal effects, and vehicles being embarked or loaded onto the ship;.6 escorting visitors on the ship;.7 providing additional specific security briefings to all ship personnel on any identified threats, re-emphasising the procedures for reporting suspicious persons, objects, or activities and stressing the need for increased vigilance; and.8 carrying out a full or partial search of the ship.Security level 39.17 At security level 3, the ship should comply with the instructions issued by those responding to the security incident or threat thereof. The SSP should detail the security measures which could be taken by the ship, in close cooperation with those responding and the port facility, which may include:.1 limiting access to a single, controlled, access point;.2 granting access only to those responding to the security incident or threat thereof;.3 directing persons on board;.4 suspension of embarkation or disembarkation;.5 suspension of cargo handling operations, deliveries, etc.;.6 evacuation of the ship;.7 movement of the ship; and.8 preparing for a full or partial search of the ship.Restricted areas on the ship9.18 The SSP should identify the restricted areas to be established on the ship, specify their extent, times of application, the security measures to be taken to control access to them and those to be taken to control activities within them. The purposes of restricted areas are to:.1 prevent unauthorised access;.2 protect passengers, ship's personnel, and personnel from port facilities or other agencies authorised to be on board the ship;.3 protect security-sensitive areas within the ship; and.4 protect cargo and ship's stores from tampering.9.19 The SSP should ensure that there are clearly established policies and practices to control access to all restricted areas.9.20 The SSP should provide that all restricted areas should be clearly marked, indicating that access to the area is restricted and that unauthorised presence within the area constitutes a breach of security.9.21 Restricted areas may include:.1 navigation bridge, machinery spaces of category A and other control stations as defined in chapter II-2;.2 spaces containing security and surveillance equipment and systems and their controls and lighting system controls;.3 ventilation and air-conditioning systems and other similar spaces;.4 spaces with access to potable water tanks, pumps, or manifolds;.5 spaces containing dangerous goods or hazardous substances;.6 spaces containing cargo pumps and their controls;.7 cargo spaces and spaces containing ship's stores;.8 crew accommodation; and.9 any other areas as determined by the CSO, through the SSA, to which access must be restricted to maintain the security of the ship.Security level 19.22 At security level 1, the SSP should establish the security measures to be applied to restricted areas, which may include:.1 locking or securing access points;.2 using surveillance equipment to monitor the areas;.3 using guards or patrols; and.4 using automatic intrusion-detection devices to alert the ship's personnel of unauthorised access.Security level 29.23 At security level 2, the frequency and intensity of the monitoring of, and control of access to, restricted areas should be increased to ensure that only authorised persons have access. The SSP should establish the additional security measures to be applied, which may include:.1 establishing restricted areas adjacent to access points;.2 continuously monitoring surveillance equipment; and.3 dedicating additional personnel to guard and patrol restricted areas.Security level 39.24 At security level 3, the ship should comply with the instructions issued by those responding to the security incident or threat thereof. The SSP should detail the security measures which could be taken by the ship, in close cooperation with those responding and the port facility, which may include:.1 setting up of additional restricted areas on the ship in proximity to the security incident, or the believed location of the security threat, to which access is denied; and.2 searching of restricted areas as part of a search of the ship.Handling of cargo9.25 The security measures relating to cargo handling should:.1 prevent tampering; and.2 prevent cargo that is not meant for carriage from being accepted and stored on board the ship.9.26 The security measures, some of which may have to be applied in liaison with the port facility, should include inventory control procedures at access points to the ship. Once on board the ship, cargo should be capable of being identified as having been approved for loading onto the ship. In addition, security measures should be developed to ensure that cargo, once on board, is not tampered with.Security level 19.27 At security level 1, the SSP should establish the security measures to be applied during cargo handling, which may include:.1 routine checking of cargo, cargo transport units and cargo spaces prior to, and during, cargo handling operations;.2 checks to ensure that cargo being loaded matches the cargo documentation;.3 ensuring, in liaison with the port facility, that vehicles to be loaded on board car-carriers, ro-ro and passenger ships are subjected to search prior to loading, in accordance with the frequency required in the SSP; and.4 checking of seals or other methods used to prevent tampering.9.28 Checking of cargo may be accomplished by the following means:.1 visual and physical examination; and.2 using scanning/detection equipment, mechanical devices, or dogs.9.29 When there are regular or repeated cargo movements, the CSO or SSO may, in consultation with the port facility, agree arrangements with shippers or others responsible for such cargo covering off-site checking, sealing, scheduling, supporting documentation, etc. Such arrangements should be communicated to and agreed with the PFSO concerned.Security level 29.30 At security level 2, the SSP should establish the additional security measures to be applied during cargo handling, which may include:.1 detailed checking of cargo, cargo transport units and cargo spaces;.2 intensified checks to ensure that only the intended cargo is loaded;.3 intensified searching of vehicles to be loaded on car carriers, ro-ro and passenger ships; and.4 increased frequency and detail in checking of seals or other methods used to prevent tampering.9.31 Detailed checking of cargo may be accomplished by the following means:.1 increasing the frequency and detail of visual and physical examination;.2 increasing the frequency of the use of scanning/detection equipment, mechanical devices, or dogs; and.3 coordinating enhanced security measures with the shipper or other responsible party in accordance with an established agreement and procedures.Security level 39.32 At security level 3, the ship should comply with the instructions issued by those responding to the security incident or threat thereof. The SSP should detail the security measures which could be taken by the ship, in close cooperation with those responding and the port facility, which may include:.1 suspending the loading or unloading of cargo; and.2 verifying the inventory of dangerous goods and hazardous substances carried on board, if any, and their location.Delivery of ship's stores9.33 The security measures relating to the delivery of ship's stores should:.1 ensure checking of ship's stores and package integrity;.2 prevent ship's stores from being accepted without inspection;.3 prevent tampering; and.4 prevent ship's stores from being accepted unless ordered.9.34 For ships regularly using the port facility, it may be appropriate to establish procedures involving the ship, its suppliers and the port facility covering notification and timing of deliveries and their documentation. There should always be some way of confirming that stores presented for delivery are accompanied by evidence that they have been ordered by the ship.Security level 19.35 At security level 1, the SSP should establish the security measures to be applied during delivery of ship's stores, which may include:.1 checking to ensure stores match the order prior to being loaded on board; and.2 ensuring immediate secure stowage of ship's stores.Security level 29.36 At security level 2, the SSP should establish the additional security measures to be applied during delivery of ship's stores by exercising checks prior to receiving stores on board and intensifying inspections.Security level 39.37 At security level 3, the ship should comply with the instructions issued by those responding to the security incident or threat thereof. The SSP should detail the security measures which could be taken by the ship, in close cooperation with those responding and the port facility, which may include:.1 subjecting ship's stores to more extensive checking;.2 preparation for restriction or suspension of handling of ship's stores; and.3 refusal to accept ship's stores on board the ship.Handling unaccompanied baggage9.38 The SSP should establish the security measures to be applied to ensure that unaccompanied baggage (i.e. any baggage, including personal effects, which is not with the passenger or member of ship's personnel at the point of inspection or search) is identified and subjected to appropriate screening, including searching, before it is accepted on board the ship. It is not envisaged that such baggage will be subjected to screening by both the ship and the port facility, and in cases where both are suitably equipped, the responsibility for screening should rest with the port facility. Close cooperation with the port facility is essential and steps should be taken to ensure that unaccompanied baggage is handled securely after screening.Security level 19.39 At security level 1, the SSP should establish the security measures to be applied when handling unaccompanied baggage to ensure that unaccompanied baggage is screened or searched up to and including 100 percent, which may include use of x-ray screening.Security level 29.40 At security level 2, the SSP should establish the additional security measures to be applied when handling unaccompanied baggage, which should include 100 percent x-ray screening of all unaccompanied baggage.Security level 39.41 At security level 3, the ship should comply with the instructions issued by those responding to the security incident or threat thereof. The SSP should detail the security measures which could be taken by the ship, in close cooperation with those responding and the port facility, which may include:.1 subjecting such baggage to more extensive screening, for example x-raying it from at least two different angles;.2 preparation for restriction or suspension of handling of unaccompanied baggage; and.3 refusal to accept unaccompanied baggage on board the ship.Monitoring the security of the ship9.42 The ship should have the capability to monitor the ship, the restricted areas on board and areas surrounding the ship. Such monitoring capabilities may include use of:.1 lighting;.2 watchkeepers, security guards and deck watches, including patrols; and.3 automatic intrusion-detection devices and surveillance equipment.9.43 When used, automatic intrusion-detection devices should activate an audible and/or visual alarm at a location that is continuously attended or monitored.9.44 The SSP should establish the procedures and equipment needed at each security level and the means of ensuring that monitoring equipment will be able to perform continually, including consideration of the possible effects of weather conditions or of power disruptions.Security level 19.45 At security level 1, the SSP should establish the security measures to be applied, which may be a combination of lighting, watchkeepers, security guards or use of security and surveillance equipment to allow ship's security personnel to observe the ship in general, and barriers and restricted areas in particular.9.46 The ship's deck and access points to the ship should be illuminated during hours of darkness and periods of low visibility while conducting ship/port interface activities or at a port facility or anchorage when necessary. While under way, when necessary, ships should use the maximum lighting available consistent with safe navigation, having regard to the provisions of the International Regulations for the Prevention of Collisions at Sea in force. The following should be considered when establishing the appropriate level and location of lighting:.1 the ship's personnel should be able to detect activities beyond the ship, on both the shore side and the water side;.2 coverage should include the area on and around the ship;.3 coverage should facilitate personnel identification at access points; and.4 coverage may be provided through coordination with the port facility.Security level 29.47 At security level 2, the SSP should establish the additional security measures to be applied to enhance the monitoring and surveillance capabilities, which may include:.1 increasing the frequency and detail of security patrols;.2 increasing the coverage and intensity of lighting or the use of security and surveillance equipment;.3 assigning additional personnel as security look-outs; and.4 ensuring coordination with water-side boat patrols, and foot or vehicle patrols on the shore side, when provided.9.48 Additional lighting may be necessary to protect against a heightened risk of a security incident. When necessary, the additional lighting requirements may be accomplished by coordinating with the port facility to provide additional shoreside lighting.Security level 39.49 At security level 3, the ship should comply with the instructions issued by those responding to the security incident or threat thereof. The SSP should detail the security measures which could be taken by the ship, in close cooperation with those responding and the port facility, which may include:.1 switching on of all lighting on, or illuminating the vicinity of, the ship;.2 switching on of all on-board surveillance equipment capable of recording activities on, or in the vicinity of, the ship;.3 maximising the length of time such surveillance equipment can continue to record;.4 preparation for underwater inspection of the hull of the ship; and.5 initiation of measures, including the slow revolution of the ship's propellers, if practicable, to deter underwater access to the hull of the ship.Differing security levels9.50 The SSP should establish details of the procedures and security measures the ship could adopt if the ship is at a higher security level than that applying to a port facility.Activities not covered by the Code9.51 The SSP should establish details of the procedures and security measures the ship should apply when:.1 it is at a port of a State which is not a Contracting Government;.2 it is interfacing with a ship to which this Code does not apply;.3 it is interfacing with fixed or floating platforms or a mobile drilling unit on location; or.4 it is interfacing with a port or port facility which is not required to comply with chapter XI-2 and part A of this Code.Declarations of Security9.52 The SSP should detail how requests for Declarations of Security from a port facility will be handled and the circumstances under which the ship itself should request a DoS.Audit and review9.53 The SSP should establish how the CSO and the SSO intend to audit the continued effectiveness of the SSP and the procedure to be followed to review, update or amend the SSP.10. RECORDSGeneral10.1 Records should be available to duly authorised officers of Contracting Governments to verify that the provisions of ship security plans are being implemented.10.2 Records may be kept in any format but should be protected from unauthorised access or disclosure.11. COMPANY SECURITY OFFICERRelevant guidance is provided under sections 8, 9 and 13.12. SHIP SECURITY OFFICERRelevant guidance is provided under sections 8, 9 and 13.13. TRAINING, DRILLS AND EXERCISES ON SHIP SECURITYTraining13.1 The company security officer (CSO) and appropriate shore-based Company personnel, and the ship security officer (SSO), should have knowledge of, and receive training, in some or all of the following, as appropriate:.1 security administration;.2 relevant international conventions, codes and recommendations;.3 relevant Government legislation and regulations;.4 responsibilities and functions of other security organisations;.5 methodology of ship security assessment;.6 methods of ship security surveys and inspections;.7 ship and port operations and conditions;.8 ship and port facility security measures;.9 emergency preparedness and response and contingency planning;.10 instruction techniques for security training and education, including security measures and procedures;.11 handling sensitive security-related information and security-related communications;.12 knowledge of current security threats and patterns;.13 recognition and detection of weapons, dangerous substances and devices;.14 recognition, on a non-discriminatory basis, of characteristics and behavioural patterns of persons who are likely to threaten security;.15 techniques used to circumvent security measures;.16 security equipment and systems and their operational limitations;.17 methods of conducting audits, inspection, control and monitoring;.18 methods of physical searches and non-intrusive inspections;.19 security drills and exercises, including drills and exercises with port facilities; and.20 assessment of security drills and exercises.13.2 In addition, the SSO should have adequate knowledge of, and receive training in, some or all of the following, as appropriate:.1 the layout of the ship;.2 the ship security plan and related procedures (including scenario-based training on how to respond);.3 crowd management and control techniques;.4 operations of security equipment and systems; and.5 testing, calibration and at-sea maintenance of security equipment and systems.13.3 Shipboard personnel having specific security duties should have sufficient knowledge and ability to perform their assigned duties, including, as appropriate:.1 knowledge of current security threats and patterns;.2 recognition and detection of weapons, dangerous substances and devices;.3 recognition of characteristics and behavioural patterns of persons who are likely to threaten security;.4 techniques used to circumvent security measures;.5 crowd management and control techniques;.6 security-related communications;.7 knowledge of the emergency procedures and contingency plans;.8 operations of security equipment and systems;.9 testing, calibration and at-sea maintenance of security equipment and systems;.10 inspection, control, and monitoring techniques; and.11 methods of physical searches of persons, personal effects, baggage, cargo, and ship's stores.13.4 All other shipboard personnel should have sufficient knowledge of and be familiar with relevant provisions of the ship security plan (SSP), including:.1 the meaning and the consequential requirements of the different security levels;.2 knowledge of the emergency procedures and contingency plans;.3 recognition and detection of weapons, dangerous substances and devices;.4 recognition, on a non-discriminatory basis, of characteristics and behavioural patterns of persons who are likely to threaten security; and.5 techniques used to circumvent security measures.Drills and exercises13.5 The objective of drills and exercises is to ensure that shipboard personnel are proficient in all assigned security duties at all security levels and the identification of any security-related deficiencies which need to be addressed.13.6 To ensure the effective implementation of the provisions of the ship security plan, drills should be conducted at least once every three months. In addition, in cases where more than 25 percent of the ship's personnel has been changed, at any one time, with personnel that has not previously participated in any drill on that ship within the last 3 months, a drill should be conducted within one week of the change. These drills should test individual elements of the plan such as those security threats listed in paragraph 8.9.13.7 13.7 Various types of exercises, which may include participation of company security officers, port facility security officers, relevant authorities of Contracting Governments as well as ship security officers, if available, should be carried out at least once each calendar year with no more than 18 months between the exercises. These exercises should test communications, coordination, resource availability, and response. These exercises may be:.1 full-scale or live;.2 tabletop simulation or seminar; or.3 combined with other exercises held, such as search and rescue or emergency response exercises.13.8 Company participation in an exercise with another Contracting Government should be recognised by the Administration.14. PORT FACILITY SECURITYRelevant guidance is provided under sections 15, 16 and 18.15. PORT FACILITY SECURITY ASSESSMENTGeneral15.1 The port facility security assessment (PFSA) may be conducted by a recognised security organisation (RSO). However, approval of a completed PFSA should only be given by the relevant Contracting Government.15.2 If a Contracting Government uses a RSO to review or verify compliance of the PFSA, the RSO should not be associated with any other RSO that prepared or assisted in the preparation of that assessment.15.3 A PFSA should address the following elements within a port facility:.1 physical security;.2 structural integrity;.3 personnel protection systems;.4 procedural policies;.5 radio and telecommunication systems, including computer systems and networks;.6 relevant transportation infrastructure;.7 utilities; and.8 other areas that may, if damaged or used for illicit observation, pose a risk to persons, property, or operations within the port facility.15.4 Those involved in a PFSA should be able to draw upon expert assistance in relation to:.1 knowledge of current security threats and patterns;.2 recognition and detection of weapons, dangerous substances and devices;.3 recognition, on a non-discriminatory basis, of characteristics and behavioural patterns of persons who are likely to threaten security;.4 techniques used to circumvent security measures;.5 methods used to cause a security incident;.6 effects of explosives on structures and port facility services;.7 port facility security;.8 port business practices;.9 contingency planning, emergency preparedness and response;.10 physical security measures, e.g. fences;.11 radio and telecommunications systems, including computer systems and networks;.12 transport and civil engineering; and.13 ship and port operations.Identification and evaluation of important assets and infrastructure it is important to protect15.5 The identification and evaluation of important assets and infrastructure is a process through which the relative importance of structures and installations to the functioning of the port facility can be established. This identification and evaluation process is important because it provides a basis for focusing mitigation strategies on those assets and structures which it is more important to protect from a security incident. This process should take into account potential loss of life, the economic significance of the port, symbolic value, and the presence of Government installations.15.6 Identification and evaluation of assets and infrastructure should be used to prioritise their relative importance for protection. The primary concern should be avoidance of death or injury. It is also important to consider whether the port facility, structure or installation can continue to function without the asset, and the extent to which rapid re-establishment of normal functioning is possible.15.7 Assets and infrastructure that should be considered important to protect may include:.1 accesses, entrances, approaches, and anchorages, manoeuvring and berthing areas;.2 cargo facilities, terminals, storage areas, and cargo handling equipment;.3 systems such as electrical distribution systems, radio and telecommunication systems and computer systems and networks;.4 port vessel traffic management systems and aids to navigation;.5 power plants, cargo transfer piping, and water supplies;.6 bridges, railways, roads;.7 port service vessels, including pilot boats, tugs, lighters, etc.;.8 security and surveillance equipment and systems; and.9 the waters adjacent to the port facility.15.8 The clear identification of assets and infrastructure is essential to the evaluation of the port facility's security requirements, the prioritisation of protective measures, and decisions concerning the allocation of resources to better protect the port facility. The process may involve consultation with the relevant authorities relating to structures adjacent to the port facility which could cause damage within the facility or be used for the purpose of causing damage to the facility or for illicit observation of the facility or for diverting attention.Identification of the possible threats to the assets and infrastructure and the likelihood of their occurrence, in order to establish and prioritise security measures15.9 Possible acts that could threaten the security of assets and infrastructure, and the methods of carrying out those acts, should be identified to evaluate the vulnerability of a given asset or location to a security incident, and to establish and prioritise security requirements to enable planning and resource allocations. Identification and evaluation of each potential act and its method should be based on various factors, including threat assessments by Government agencies. By identifying and assessing threats, those conducting the assessment do not have to rely on worst-case scenarios to guide planning and resource allocations.15.10 The PFSA should include an assessment undertaken in consultation with the relevant national security organisations to determine:.1 any particular aspects of the port facility, including the vessel traffic using the facility, which make it likely to be the target of an attack;.2 the likely consequences in terms of loss of life, damage to property and economic disruption, including disruption to transport systems, of an attack on, or at, the port facility;.3 the capability and intent of those likely to mount such an attack; and.4 the possible type, or types, of attack,producing an overall assessment of the level of risk against which security measures have to be developed.15.11 The PFSA should consider all possible threats, which may include the following types of security incidents:.1 damage to, or destruction of, the port facility or of the ship, e.g. by explosive devices, arson, sabotage or vandalism;.2 hijacking or seizure of the ship or of persons on board;.3 tampering with cargo, essential ship equipment or systems or ship's stores;.4 unauthorised access or use, including presence of stowaways;.5 smuggling weapons or equipment, including weapons of mass destruction;.6 use of the ship to carry those intending to cause a security incident and their equipment;.7 use of the ship itself as a weapon or as a means to cause damage or destruction;.8 blockage of port entrances, locks, approaches, etc.; and.9 nuclear, biological and chemical attack.15.12 The process should involve consultation with the relevant authorities relating to structures adjacent to the port facility which could cause damage within the facility or be used for the purpose of causing damage to the facility or for illicit observation of the facility or for diverting attention.Identification, selection, and prioritisation of countermeasures and procedural changes and their level of effectiveness in reducing vulnerability15.13 The identification and prioritisation of countermeasures is designed to ensure that the most effective security measures are employed to reduce the vulnerability of a port facility or ship/port interface to the possible threats.15.14 Security measures should be selected on the basis of factors such as whether they reduce the probability of an attack and should be evaluated using information that includes:.1 security surveys, inspections and audits;.2 consultation with port facility owners and operators, and owners/operators of adjacent structures if appropriate;.3 historical information on security incidents; and.4 operations within the port facility.Identification of vulnerabilities15.15 Identification of vulnerabilities in physical structures, personnel protection systems, processes, or other areas that may lead to a security incident can be used to establish options to eliminate or mitigate those vulnerabilities. For example, an analysis might reveal vulnerabilities in a port facility's security systems or unprotected infrastructure such as water supplies, bridges, etc. that could be resolved through physical measures, e.g. permanent barriers, alarms, surveillance equipment, etc.15.16 Identification of vulnerabilities should include consideration of:.1 water-side and shore-side access to the port facility and ships berthing at the facility;.2 structural integrity of the piers, facilities, and associated structures;.3 existing security measures and procedures, including identification systems;.4 existing security measures and procedures relating to port services and utilities;.5 measures to protect radio and telecommunication equipment, port services and utilities, including computer systems and networks;.6 adjacent areas that may be exploited during, or for, an attack;.7 existing agreements with private security companies providing water-side/shore-side security services;.8 any conflicting policies between safety and security measures and procedures;.9 any conflicting port facility and security duty assignments;.10 any enforcement and personnel constraints;.11 any deficiencies identified during training and drills; and.12 any deficiencies identified during daily operation, following incidents or alerts, the report of security concerns, the exercise of control measures, audits, etc.16. PORT FACILITY SECURITY PLANGeneral16.1 Preparation of the port facility security plan (PFSP) is the responsibility of the port facility security officer (PFSO). While the PFSO need not necessarily personally undertake all the duties associated with the post, the ultimate responsibility for ensuring that they are properly performed remains with the individual PFSO.16.2 The content of each individual PFSP should vary depending on the particular circumstances of the port facility, or facilities, it covers. The port facility security assessment (PFSA) will have identified the particular features of the port facility, and of the potential security risks, that have led to the need to appoint a PFSO and to prepare a PFSP. The preparation of the PFSP will require these features, and other local or national security considerations, to be addressed in the PFSP and for appropriate security measures to be established so as to minimise the likelihood of a breach of security and the consequences of potential risks. Contracting Governments may prepare advice on the preparation and content of a PFSP.16.3 All PFSPs should:.1 detail the security organisation of the port facility;.2 detail the organisation's links with other relevant authorities and the necessary communication systems to allow the effective continuous operation of the organisation and its links with others, including ships in port;.3 detail the basic security level 1 measures, both operational and physical, that will be in place;.4 detail the additional security measures that will allow the port facility to progress without delay to security level 2 and, when necessary, to security level 3;.5 provide for regular review, or audit, of the PFSP and for its amendment in response to experience or changing circumstances; and.6 detail reporting procedures to the appropriate Contracting Government's contact points.16.4 Preparation of an effective PFSP will rest on a thorough assessment of all issues that relate to the security of the port facility, including, in particular, a thorough appreciation of the physical and operational characteristics of the individual port facility.16.5 Contracting Governments should approve the PFSPs of the port facilities under their jurisdiction. Contracting Governments should develop procedures to assess the continuing effectiveness of each PFSP and may require amendment of the PFSP prior to its initial approval or subsequent to its approval. The PFSP should make provision for the retention of records of security incidents and threats, reviews, audits, training, drills and exercises as evidence of compliance with those requirements.16.6 The security measures included in the PFSP should be in place within a reasonable period of the PFSP's approval and the PFSP should establish when each measure will be in place. If there is likely to be any delay in their provision, this should be discussed with the Contracting Government responsible for approval of the PFSP and satisfactory alternative temporary security measures that provide an equivalent level of security should be agreed to cover any interim period.16.7 The use of firearms on or near ships and in port facilities may pose particular and significant safety risks, in particular in connection with certain dangerous or hazardous substances, and should be considered very carefully. In the event that a Contracting Government decides that it is necessary to use armed personnel in these areas, that Contracting Government should ensure that these personnel are duly authorised and trained in the use of their weapons and that they are aware of the specific risks to safety that are present in these areas. If a Contracting Government authorises the use of firearms they should issue specific safety guidelines on their use. The PFSP should contain specific guidance on this matter, in particular with regard its application to ships carrying dangerous goods or hazardous substances.Organisation and performance of port facility security duties16.8 In addition to the guidance given under paragraph 16.3, the PFSP should establish the following, which relate to all security levels:.1 the role and structure of the port facility security organisation;.2 the duties, responsibilities and training requirements of all port facility personnel with a security role and the performance measures needed to allow their individual effectiveness to be assessed;.3 the port facility security organisation's links with other national or local authorities with security responsibilities;.4 the communication systems provided to allow effective and continuous communication between port facility security personnel, ships in port and, when appropriate, with national or local authorities with security responsibilities;.5 the procedures or safeguards necessary to allow such continuous communications to be maintained at all times;.6 the procedures and practices to protect security-sensitive information held in paper or electronic format;.7 the procedures to assess the continuing effectiveness of security measures, procedures and equipment, including identification of, and response to, equipment failure or malfunction;.8 the procedures to allow the submission, and assessment, of reports relating to possible breaches of security or security concerns;.9 procedures relating to cargo handling;.10 procedures covering the delivery of ship's stores;.11 the procedures to maintain, and update, records of dangerous goods and hazardous substances and their location within the port facility;.12 the means of alerting and obtaining the services of waterside patrols and specialist search teams, including bomb searches and underwater searches;.13 the procedures for assisting ship security officers in confirming the identity of those seeking to board the ship when requested; and.14 the procedures for facilitating shore leave for ship's personnel or personnel changes, as well as access of visitors to the ship, including representatives of seafarers' welfare and labour organisations.16.9 The remainder of section 16 addresses specifically the security measures that could be taken at each security level covering:.1 access to the port facility;.2 restricted areas within the port facility;.3 handling of cargo;.4 delivery of ship's stores;.5 handling unaccompanied baggage; and.6 monitoring the security of the port facility.Access to the port facility16.10 The PFSP should establish the security measures covering all means of access to the port facility identified in the PFSA.16.11 For each of these the PFSP should identify the appropriate locations where access restrictions or prohibitions should be applied for each of the security levels. For each security level the PFSP should specify the type of restriction or prohibition to be applied and the means of enforcing them.16.12 The PFSP should establish for each security level the means of identification required to allow access to the port facility and for individuals to remain within the port facility without challenge. This may involve developing an appropriate identification system, allowing for permanent and temporary identifications, for port facility personnel and for visitors respectively. Any port facility identification system should, when it is practicable to do so, be coordinated with that applying to ships that regularly use the port facility. Passengers should be able to prove their identity by boarding passes, tickets, etc., but should not be permitted access to restricted areas unless supervised. The PFSP should establish provisions to ensure that the identification systems are regularly updated, and that abuse of procedures should be subject to disciplinary action.16.13 Those unwilling or unable to establish their identity and/or to confirm the purpose of their visit when requested to do so should be denied access to the port facility and their attempt to obtain access should be reported to the PFSO and to the national or local authorities with security responsibilities.16.14 The PFSP should identify the locations where persons, personal effects, and vehicle searches are to be undertaken. Such locations should be covered to facilitate continuous operation, regardless of prevailing weather conditions, in accordance with the frequency laid down in the PFSP. Once subjected to search, persons, personal effects and vehicles should proceed directly to the restricted holding, embarkation or car loading areas.16.15 The PFSP should establish separate locations for checked and unchecked persons and their effects and if possible separate areas for embarking/disembarking passengers, ship's personnel and their effects to ensure that unchecked persons are not able to come in contact with checked persons.16.16 The PFSP should establish the frequency of application of any access controls, particularly if they are to be applied on a random, or occasional, basis.Security level 116.17 At security level 1, the PFSP should establish the control points where the following security measures may be applied:.1 restricted areas, which should be bounded by fencing or other barriers to a standard which should be approved by the Contracting Government;.2 checking identity of all persons seeking entry to the port facility in connection with a ship, including passengers, ship's personnel and visitors, and confirming their reasons for doing so by checking, for example, joining instructions, passenger tickets, boarding passes, work orders, etc.;.3 checking vehicles used by those seeking entry to the port facility in connection with a ship;.4 verification of the identity of port facility personnel and those employed within the port facility and their vehicles;.5 restricting access to exclude those not employed by the port facility or working within it, if they are unable to establish their identity;.6 undertaking searches of persons, personal effects, vehicles and their contents; and.7 identification of any access points not in regular use, which should be permanently closed and locked.16.18 At security level 1, all those seeking access to the port facility should be liable to search. The frequency of such searches, including random searches, should be specified in the approved PFSP and should be specifically approved by the Contracting Government. Unless there are clear security grounds for doing so, members of the ship's personnel should not be required to search their colleagues or their personal effects. Any such search shall be undertaken in a manner which fully takes into account the human rights of the individual and preserves their basic human dignity.Security level 216.19 At security level 2, the PFSP should establish the additional security measures to be applied, which may include:.1 assigning additional personnel to guard access points and patrol perimeter barriers;.2 limiting the number of access points to the port facility, and identifying those to be closed and the means of adequately securing them;.3 providing for means of impeding movement through the remaining access points, e.g. security barriers;.4 increasing the frequency of searches of persons, personal effects, and vehicles;.5 denying access to visitors who are unable to provide a verifiable justification for seeking access to the port facility; and.6 using patrol vessels to enhance water-side security.Security level 316.20 At security level 3, the port facility should comply with instructions issued by those responding to the security incident or threat thereof. The PFSP should detail the security measures which could be taken by the port facility, in close cooperation with those responding and the ships at the port facility, which may include:.1 suspension of access to all, or part, of the port facility;.2 granting access only to those responding to the security incident or threat thereof;.3 suspension of pedestrian or vehicular movement within all, or part, of the port facility;.4 increased security patrols within the port facility, if appropriate;.5 suspension of port operations within all, or part, of the port facility;.6 direction of vessel movements relating to all, or part, of the port facility; and.7 evacuation of all, or part, of the port facility.Restricted areas within the port facility16.21 The PFSP should identify the restricted areas to be established within the port facility and specify their extent, times of application, the security measures to be taken to control access to them and those to be taken to control activities within them. This should also include, in appropriate circumstances, measures to ensure that temporary restricted areas are security swept both before and after that area is established.

For the main domestic passenger ships, the deadline is 1 July 2005.\nBy 1 July 2007, all EU countries, after conducting a mandatory security risk assessment, must decide the extent to which they apply the measures to other categories of domestic shipping.\nEach EU country informs the IMO, the European Commission and other EU countries of the measures it has taken. These include details of contact focal points for maritime security designated by each EU country.\nShips covered by the special measures and intending to enter an EU port must provide security information to the relevant national authorities: at least 24 hours in advance; orat the latest when it leaves its previous port if the journey time is less than 24 hours; oras soon as its port of call is known, if this was unknown when it departed.\nScheduled shipping services that are sailing between ports on their own territory or between 2 EU countries may be exempt from providing pre-arrival information, so long as they do so if requested by the authorities.\nNational authorities maintain a list of companies and ships benefitting from the exemption and update it regularly.\nBy 1 July 2004, EU countries had to designate a focal point for maritime security.\nRepercussions of the COVID-19 pandemic\nBecause the ongoing public health crisis makes it difficult for EU countries’ national authorities to conduct the maritime security inspections and surveys with a view to renewing certain documents in the field of maritime security, Regulation (EU) 2020/698 extends the time limits for reviewing security assessments and security plans for port facilities and ports to enable EU countries and the shipping industry to take a flexible and pragmatic approach, and to keep essential supply chains open, while not compromising security.\nRegulation (EU) 2020/698 allows some flexibility for maritime security drills and exercises, which the EU legal acts in the field of maritime security, such as Directive 2005/65/EC (see summary), require to be carried out within certain time frames.\nFROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?\n              \nIt has applied since 1 July 2004.\nBACKGROUND\n              \nFor more information, see:\nMaritime security (European Commission).\nKEY TERMS\n              \nMaritime security: a combination of preventive measures to protect shipping and port facilities against threats of intentional unlawful acts.\nMAIN DOCUMENT\n            \nRegulation (EC) No 725/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 31 March 2004 on enhancing ship and port facility security (OJ L 129, 29.4.2004, pp. 6-91)\nSuccessive amendments to Regulation (EC) No 725/2004 have been incorporated in to the original document.
