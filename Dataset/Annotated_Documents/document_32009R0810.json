{"celex_id": "32009R0810", "reference": "15.9.2009\nEN\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\nL 243/1\nREGULATION (EC) No 810/2009 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL\nof 13 July 2009\nestablishing a Community Code on Visas\n(Visa Code)\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 62(2)(a) and (b)(ii) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the Commission,\nActing in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty (1),\nWhereas:\n(1)\nIn accordance with Article 61 of the Treaty, the creation of an area in which persons may move freely should be accompanied by measures with respect to external border controls, asylum and immigration.\n(2)\nPursuant to Article 62(2) of the Treaty, measures on the crossing of the external borders of the Member States shall establish rules on visas for intended stays of no more than three months, including the procedures and conditions for issuing visas by Member States.\n(3)\nAs regards visa policy, the establishment of a ‘common corpus’ of legislation, particularly via the consolidation and development of the acquis (the relevant provisions of the Convention implementing the Schengen Agreement of 14 June 1985 (2) and the Common Consular Instructions (3), is one of the fundamental components of ‘further development of the common visa policy as part of a multi-layer system aimed at facilitating legitimate travel and tackling illegal immigration through further harmonisation of national legislation and handling practices at local consular missions’, as defined in the Hague Programme: strengthening freedom, security and justice in the European Union (4).\n(4)\nMember States should be present or represented for visa purposes in all third countries whose nationals are subject to visa requirements. Member States lacking their own consulate in a given third country or in a certain part of a given third country should endeavour to conclude representation arrangements in order to avoid a disproportionate effort on the part of visa applicants to have access to consulates.\n(5)\nIt is necessary to set out rules on the transit through international areas of airports in order to combat illegal immigration. Thus nationals from a common list of third countries should be required to hold airport transit visas. Nevertheless, in urgent cases of mass influx of illegal immigrants, Member States should be allowed to impose such a requirement on nationals of third countries other than those listed in the common list. Member States’ individual decisions should be reviewed on an annual basis.\n(6)\nThe reception arrangements for applicants should be made with due respect for human dignity. Processing of visa applications should be conducted in a professional and respectful manner and be proportionate to the objectives pursued.\n(7)\nMember States should ensure that the quality of the service offered to the public is of a high standard and follows good administrative practices. They should allocate appropriate numbers of trained staff as well as sufficient resources in order to facilitate as much as possible the visa application process. Member States should ensure that a ‘one-stop’ principle is applied to all applicants.\n(8)\nProvided that certain conditions are fulfilled, multiple-entry visas should be issued in order to lessen the administrative burden of Member States’ consulates and to facilitate smooth travel for frequent or regular travellers. Applicants known to the consulate for their integrity and reliability should as far as possible benefit from a simplified procedure.\n(9)\nBecause of the registration of biometric identifiers in the Visa Information System (VIS) as established by Regulation (EC) No 767/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 9 July 2008 concerning Visa Information System (VIS) and the exchange of data between Member States on short-stay visas (VIS Regulation) (5), the appearance of the applicant in person — at least for the first application — should be one of the basic requirements for the application for a visa.\n(10)\nIn order to facilitate the visa application procedure of any subsequent application, it should be possible to copy fingerprints from the first entry into the VIS within a period of 59 months. Once this period of time has elapsed, the fingerprints should be collected again.\n(11)\nAny document, data or biometric identifier received by a Member State in the course of the visa application process shall be considered a consular document under the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations of 24 April 1963 and shall be treated in an appropriate manner.\n(12)\nDirective 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data (6) applies to the Member States with regard to the processing of personal data pursuant to this Regulation.\n(13)\nIn order to facilitate the procedure, several forms of cooperation should be envisaged, such as limited representation, co-location, common application centres, recourse to honorary consuls and cooperation with external service providers, taking into account in particular data protection requirements set out in Directive 95/46/EC. Member States should, in accordance with the conditions laid down in this Regulation, determine the type of organisational structure which they will use in each third country.\n(14)\nIt is necessary to make provision for situations in which a Member State decides to cooperate with an external service provider for the collection of applications. Such a decision may be taken if, in particular circumstances or for reasons relating to the local situation, cooperation with other Member States in the form of representation, limited representation, co-location or a Common Application Centre proves not to be appropriate for the Member State concerned. Such arrangements should be established in compliance with the general principles for issuing visas and with the data protection requirements set out in Directive 95/46/EC. In addition, the need to avoid visa shopping should be taken into consideration when establishing and implementing such arrangements.\n(15)\nWhere a Member State has decided to cooperate with an external service provider, it should maintain the possibility for all applicants to lodge applications directly at its diplomatic missions or consular posts.\n(16)\nA Member State should cooperate with an external service provider on the basis of a legal instrument which should contain provisions on its exact responsibilities, on direct and total access to its premises, information for applicants, confidentiality and on the circumstances, conditions and procedures for suspending or terminating the cooperation.\n(17)\nThis Regulation, by allowing Member States to cooperate with external service providers for the collection of applications while establishing the ‘one-stop’ principle for the lodging of applications, creates a derogation from the general rule that an applicant must appear in person at a diplomatic mission or consular post. This is without prejudice to the possibility of calling the applicant for a personal interview.\n(18)\nLocal Schengen cooperation is crucial for the harmonised application of the common visa policy and for proper assessment of migratory and/or security risks. Given the differences in local circumstances, the operational application of particular legislative provisions should be assessed among Member States’ diplomatic missions and consular posts in individual locations in order to ensure a harmonised application of the legislative provisions to prevent visa shopping and different treatment of visa applicants.\n(19)\nStatistical data are an important means of monitoring migratory movements and can serve as an efficient management tool. Therefore, such data should be compiled regularly in a common format.\n(20)\nThe measures necessary for the implementation of this Regulation should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission (7).\n(21)\nIn particular, the Commission should be empowered to adopt amendments to the Annexes to this Regulation. Since those measures are of general scope and are designed to amend non-essential elements of this Regulation, inter alia, by supplementing it with new non-essential elements, they must be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny provided for in Article 5a of Decision 1999/468/EC.\n(22)\nIn order to ensure the harmonised application of this Regulation at operational level, instructions should be drawn up on the practice and procedures to be followed by Member States when processing visa applications.\n(23)\nA common Schengen visa Internet site is to be established to improve the visibility and a uniform image of the common visa policy. Such a site will serve as a means to provide the general public with all relevant information in relation to the application for a visa.\n(24)\nAppropriate measures should be adopted for the monitoring and evaluation of this Regulation.\n(25)\nThe VIS Regulation and Regulation (EC) No 562/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 March 2006 establishing a Community Code on the rules governing the movement of persons across borders (Schengen Borders Code) (8) should be amended in order to take account of the provisions of this Regulation.\n(26)\nBilateral agreements concluded between the Community and third countries aiming at facilitating the processing of applications for visas may derogate from the provisions of this Regulation.\n(27)\nWhen a Member State hosts the Olympic Games and the Paralympic Games, a particular scheme facilitating the issuing of visas to members of the Olympic family should apply.\n(28)\nSince the objective of this Regulation, namely the establishment of the procedures and conditions for issuing visas for transit through or intended stays in the territory of the Member States not exceeding three months in any six-month period, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve that objective.\n(29)\nThis Regulation respects fundamental rights and observes the principles recognised in particular by the Council of Europe’s Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms and by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union.\n(30)\nThe conditions governing entry into the territory of the Member States or the issue of visas do not affect the rules currently governing recognition of the validity of travel documents.\n(31)\nIn accordance with Articles 1 and 2 of the Protocol on the Position of Denmark annexed to the Treaty on European Union and to the Treaty establishing the European Community, Denmark does not take part in the adoption of this Regulation and is not bound by it, or subject to its application. Given that this Regulation builds on the Schengen acquis under the provisions of Title IV of Part Three of the Treaty establishing the European Community, Denmark shall, in accordance with Article 5 of that Protocol, decide within a period of six months after the date of adoption of this Regulation whether it will implement it in its national law.\n(32)\nAs regards Iceland and Norway, this Regulation constitutes a development of provisions of the Schengen acquis within the meaning of the Agreement concluded between the Council of the European Union and the Republic of Iceland and the Kingdom of Norway concerning the association of those two States with the implementation, application and development of the Schengen acquis\n (9) which fall within the area referred to in Article 1, point B of Council Decision 1999/437/EC (10) on certain arrangements for the application of that Agreement.\n(33)\nAn arrangement should be made to allow representatives of Iceland and Norway to be associated with the work of committees assisting the Commission in the exercise of its implementing powers under this Regulation. Such an arrangement has been contemplated in the Exchange of Letters between the Council of the European Union and Iceland and Norway concerning committees which assist the European Commission in the exercise of its executive powers (11), annexed to the abovementioned Agreement. The Commission has submitted to the Council a draft recommendation with a view to negotiating this arrangement.\n(34)\nAs regards Switzerland, this Regulation constitutes a development of the provisions of the Schengen acquis within the meaning of the Agreement between the European Union, the European Community and the Swiss Confederation on the Swiss Confederation’s association with the implementation, application and development of the Schengen acquis\n (12), which fall within the area referred to in Article 1, point B, of Decision 1999/437/EC read in conjunction with Article 3 of Council Decision 2008/146/EC (13) on the conclusion of that Agreement.\n(35)\nAs regards Liechtenstein, this Regulation constitutes a development of provisions of the Schengen acquis within the meaning of the Protocol signed between the European Union, the European Community, the Swiss Confederation and the Principality of Liechtenstein on the accession of the Principality of Liechtenstein to the Agreement concluded between the European Union, the European Community and the Swiss Confederation on the Swiss Confederation’s association with the implementation, application and development of the Schengen acquis, which fall within the area referred to in Article 1, point B, of Decision 1999/437/EC read in conjunction with Article 3 of Council Decision 2008/261/EC (14) on the signing of that Protocol.\n(36)\nThis Regulation constitutes a development of the provisions of the Schengen acquis in which the United Kingdom does not take part, in accordance with Council Decision 2000/365/EC of 29 May 2000 concerning the request of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland to take part in some of the provisions of the Schengen acquis\n (15). The United Kingdom is therefore not taking part in its adoption and is not bound by it or subject to its application.\n(37)\nThis Regulation constitutes a development of the provisions of the Schengen acquis in which Ireland does not take part, in accordance with Council Decision 2002/192/EC of 28 February 2002 concerning Ireland’s request to take part in some of the provisions of the Schengen acquis\n (16). Ireland is therefore not taking part in the adoption of the Regulation and is not bound by it or subject to its application.\n(38)\nThis Regulation, with the exception of Article 3, constitutes provisions building on the Schengen acquis or otherwise relating to it within the meaning of Article 3(2) of the 2003 Act of Accession and within the meaning of Article 4(2) of the 2005 Act of Accession,\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nTITLE I\nGENERAL PROVISIONS\nArticle 1\nObjective and scope\n1.

When assessing whether the insurance cover is adequate, consulates shall ascertain whether claims against the insurance company would be recoverable in a Member State.\n6.   The insurance requirement may be considered to have been met where it is established that an adequate level of insurance may be presumed in the light of the applicant’s professional situation.

In individual cases, the amount of the visa fee to be charged may be waived or reduced when to do so serves to promote cultural or sporting interests as well as interests in the field of foreign policy, development policy and other areas of vital public interest or for humanitarian reasons.\n7.   The visa fee shall be charged in euro, in the national currency of the third country or in the currency usually used in the third country where the application is lodged, and shall not be refundable except in the cases referred to in Articles 18(2) and 19(3).\nWhen charged in a currency other than euro, the amount of the visa fee charged in that currency shall be determined and regularly reviewed in application of the euro foreign exchange reference rate set by the European Central Bank.

The consulate shall, where applicable, verify the length of previous and intended stays in order to verify that the applicant has not exceeded the maximum duration of authorised stay in the territory of the Member States, irrespective of possible stays authorised under a national long-stay visa or a residence permit issued by another Member State.\n5.   The means of subsistence for the intended stay shall be assessed in accordance with the duration and the purpose of the stay and by reference to average prices in the Member State(s) concerned for board and lodging in budget accommodation, multiplied by the number of days stayed, on the basis of the reference amounts set by the Member States in accordance with Article 34(1)(c) of the Schengen Borders Code.

The absence of a reply within this deadline shall mean that they have no grounds for objecting to the issuing of the visa.\n3.   Member States shall notify the Commission of the introduction or withdrawal of the requirement of prior consultation before it becomes applicable. This information shall also be given within local Schengen cooperation in the jurisdiction concerned.\n4.   The Commission shall inform Member States of such notifications.\n5.

TO’ heading:\nThis heading indicates the period of the visa holder’s stay as authorised by the visa.\nThe date from which the visa holder may enter the territory for which the visa is valid is written as below, following the word ‘FROM’:\n—\nthe day is written using two digits, the first of which is a zero if the day in question is a single digit,\n—\nhorizontal dash,\n—\nthe month is written using two digits, the first of which is a zero if the month in question is a single digit,\n—\nhorizontal dash,\n—\nthe year is written using two digits, which correspond with the last two digits of the year.\nFor example: 05-12-07 = 5 December 2007.\nThe date of the last day of the period of the visa holder’s authorised stay is entered after the word ‘TO’ and is written in the same way as the first date. The visa holder must have left the territory for which the visa is valid by midnight on that date.\n3.   ‘NUMBER OF ENTRIES’ heading:\nThis heading shows the number of times the visa holder may enter the territory for which the visa is valid, i.e. it refers to the number of periods of stay which may be spread over the entire period of validity, see 4.\nThe number of entries may be one, two or more. This number is written to the right-hand side of the preprinted part, using ‘01’, ‘02’ or the abbreviation ‘MULT’, where the visa authorises more than two entries.\nWhen a multiple airport transit visa is issued pursuant to Article 26(3) of this Regulation, the visa’s validity is calculated as follows: first date of departure plus six months.\nThe visa is no longer valid when the total number of exits made by the visa holder equals the number of authorised entries, even if the visa holder has not used up the number of days authorised by the visa.\n4.   ‘DURATION OF VISIT ...

The seal of the issuing authorities shall be affixed to the visa sticker.\nANNEX IX\nPART 1\nRules for issuing visas at the border to seafarers in transit subject to visa requirements\nThese rules relate to the exchange of information between the competent authorities of the Member States with respect to seafarers in transit subject to visa requirements. Insofar as a visa is issued at the border on the basis of the information that has been exchanged, the responsibility lies with the Member State issuing the visa.\nFor the purposes of these rules:\n‘Member State port’: means a port constituting an external border of a Member State;\n‘Member State airport’: means an airport constituting an external border of a Member State.\nI.   Signing on a vessel berthed or expected at a Member State port (entry into the territory of the Member States)\n—\nthe shipping company or its agent shall inform the competent authorities at the Member State port where the ship is berthed or expected that seafarers subject to visa requirements are due to enter via a Member State airport, land or sea border. The shipping company or its agent shall sign a guarantee in respect of those seafarers that all expenses for the stay and, if necessary, for the repatriation of the seafarers will be covered by the shipping company,\n—\nthose competent authorities shall verify as soon as possible whether the information provided by the shipping company or its agent is correct and shall examine whether the other conditions for entry into the territory of the Member States have been satisfied. The travel route within the territory of the Member States shall also be verified e.g. by reference to the (airline) tickets,\n—\nwhen seafarers are due to enter via a Member State airport, the competent authorities at the Member State port shall inform the competent authorities at the Member State airport of entry, by means of a duly completed form for seafarers in transit who are subject to visa requirements (as set out in Part 2), sent by fax, electronic mail or other means, of the results of the verification and shall indicate whether a visa may in principle be issued at the border. When seafarers are due to enter via a land or a sea border, the competent authorities at the border post via which the seafarer concerned enters the territory of the Member States shall be informed by the same procedure,\n—\nwhere the verification of the available data is positive and the outcome is clearly consistent with the seafarer’s declaration or documents, the competent authorities at the Member State airport of entry or exit may issue a visa at the border the authorised stay of which shall correspond to what is necessary for the purpose of the transit. Furthermore, in such cases the seafarer’s travel document shall be stamped with a Member State entry or exit stamp and given to the seafarer concerned.\nII.   Leaving service from a vessel that has entered a Member State port (exit from the territory of the Member States)\n—\nthe shipping company or its agent shall inform the competent authorities at that Member State port of entry of seafarers subject to visa requirements who are due to leave their service and exit from the Member States territory via a Member State airport, land or sea border. The shipping company or its agent shall sign a guarantee in respect of those seafarers that all expenses for the stay and, if necessary, for the repatriation costs of the seafarers will be covered by the shipping company,\n—\nthe competent authorities shall verify as soon as possible whether the information provided by the shipping company or its agent is correct and shall examine whether the other conditions for entry into the territory of the Member States have been satisfied. The travel route within the territory of the Member States shall also be verified e.g. by reference to the (airline) tickets,\n—\nwhere the verification of the available data is positive, the competent authorities may issue a visa the authorised stay of which shall correspond to what is necessary for the purpose of the transit.\nIII.   Transferring from a vessel that entered a Member State port to another vessel\n—\nthe shipping company or its agent shall inform the competent authorities at that Member State port of entry of seafarers subject to visa requirements who are due to leave their service and exit from the territory of the Member States via another Member State port. The shipping company or its agent shall sign a guarantee in respect of those seafarers that all expenses for the stay and, if necessary, for the repatriation of the seafarers will be covered by the shipping company,\n—\nthe competent authorities shall verify as soon as possible whether the information provided by the shipping company or its agent is correct and shall examine whether the other conditions for entry into the territory of the Member States have been satisfied. The competent authorities at the Member State port from which the seafarers will leave the territory of the Member States by ship shall be contacted for the examination. A check shall be carried out to establish whether the ship they are joining is berthed or expected there. The travel route within the territory of the Member States shall also be verified,\n—\nwhere the verification of the available data is positive, the competent authorities may issue a visa the authorised stay of which shall correspond to what is necessary for the purpose of the transit.\nPART 2\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION OF FORM\nPoints 1-4: the identity of the seafarer\n(1)\nA.\nSurname(s)\nB.\nForename(s)\nC.\nNationality\nD.\nRank/Grade\n(2)\nA.\nPlace of birth\nB.\nDate of birth\n(3)\nA.\nPassport number\nB.\nDate of issue\nC.\nPeriod of validity\n(4)\nA.\nSeaman’s book number\nB.\nDate of issue\nC.\nPeriod of validity\nAs to points 3 and 4: depending on the nationality of the seafarer and the Member State being entered, a travel document or a seaman’s book may be used for identification purposes.\nPoints 5-8: the shipping agent and the vessel concerned\n(5)\nName of shipping agent (the individual or corporation that represents the ship owner on the spot in all matters relating to the ship owner’s duties in fitting out the vessel) under 5A and telephone number (and other contact details as fax number, electronic mail address) under 5B\n(6)\nA.\nName of vessel\nB.\nIMO-number (this number consists of 7 numbers and is also known as ‘Lloyds-number’)\nC.\nFlag (under which the merchant vessel is sailing)\n(7)\nA.\nDate of arrival of vessel\nB.\nOrigin (port) of vessel\nLetter ‘A’ refers to the vessel’s date of arrival in the port where the seafarer is to sign on\n(8)\nA.\nDate of departure of vessel\nB.\nDestination of vessel (next port)\nAs to points 7A and 8A: indications regarding the length of time for which the seafarer may travel in order to sign on.\nIt should be remembered that the route followed is very much subject to unexpected interferences and external factors such as storms, breakdowns, etc.\nPoints 9-12: purpose of the seafarer’s journey and his destination\n(9)\nThe ‘final destination’ is the end of the seafarer’s journey.

THE REGULATION?\nIt sets out procedures and conditions for issuing short-stay visas for visits to the Schengen area of no more than 90 days in any 180-day period.\nIt also sets out rules on airport transit visas.\nKEY POINTS\nProcedures and conditions for issuing visas\nThe European Union (EU) Member State that is the sole or main destination of the visit is responsible for examining the visa application. If the main destination cannot be determined, it becomes the responsibility of the country of first entry into the Schengen area.\nApplications\nA visa application may be submitted by the applicant, an accredited commercial intermediary or a professional, cultural, sports or educational association or institution on behalf of its members.\nApplications must generally be submitted within 6 months to 15 days of the intended visit (9 months for seafarers).\nA uniform visa (valid for the whole Schengen area) may be for multiple entries with a maximum validity of 5 years.\nA visa with limited territorial validity (limited to particular Member States) may exceptionally be issued in cases where the applicant does not fulfil all the entry conditions, on humanitarian grounds, for reasons of national interest, because of international obligations, or in situations where other Schengen countries consulted object to the issuing of a visa.\nAdmissibility\nAfter verifying whether the application is admissible (i.e. submitted following the rules), the competent authority must:\ncreate an entry in the Visa Information System (VIS) under Regulation (EC) No 767/2008;\ncarry out a further examination of the application to check that the applicant: fulfils the entry conditions as set out in Regulation (EU) 2016/399 setting out the Schengen Borders Code (see summary),does not pose a risk of illegal immigration or a threat to the security of the country, andintends to leave before the visa expires.\nUnder amending Regulation (EU) 2021/1134, background checks on applicants would be reinforced before a decision is taken on granting a visa. Rules and procedures for searches in sensitive and non-sensitive EU databases containing security and migration information are set out. Once in effect, Member States would be required to collect biometric identifiers of the applicant comprising a facial image and 10 fingerprints (for storage in the VIS) and, at the time of submission of the first application and subsequently at least every 59 months thereafter, the applicant must appear in person.\nIf the application is inadmissible, the authority would have to:\nreturn the application form and supporting documents without having examined them further;\ndestroy any biometric data collected; and\nreimburse the visa fee.\nAirport transit visas\nNationals of non-EU countries listed in Annex IV need an airport transit visa to pass through the international transit areas of airports in the Schengen area. In urgent cases of mass influx of illegal immigrants, any Member State may extend this requirement to nationals of other non-EU countries.\nWhen applying for an airport transit visa, the applicant must present proof of the points of departure and destination, coherence of the itinerary and proof of the onward journey to the final destination.\nMultiple-entry visas\nMultiple-entry visas with long validity may be issued for one, two or multiple entries. The Visa Code sets out rules on the issuing of multiple entry visas with a progressively longer length of validity:\n1 year, if the applicant has used three visas within the previous 2 years;\n2 years, if the applicant has already used a 1-year multiple-entry visa within the previous 2 years;\n5 years, if the applicant has already used a 2-year multiple-entry visa within the previous 3 years.\nAirport transit visas and visas limited to particular countries are not taken into account when taking decisions on the issuing of multiple-entry visas with a long validity.\nVisas issued at the external borders\nExceptionally, a visa application for a maximum stay of 15 days, or to cover the time needed for transit, may be applied for at the external border of the Schengen country of destination.\nA non-EU national for whom the verification of hits resulting from automated checks in EU databases has not been completed is not, in principle, issued a visa at the external border. However, a visa with limited territorial validity for the territory of the issuing Member State may be issued for such persons in exceptional cases.\nDecisions on visa applications\nThe authority assesses whether the entry conditions set out in the Schengen Borders Code are met.\nA visa is refused if the applicant: presents a false travel document;gives inadequate justification for the intended stay;provides insufficient proof of means for the stay or for the return home;has been the subject of an alert in the Schengen information system set up under Regulation (EU) 2018/1860 (see summary) for the purpose of refusing entry;is considered a threat to the public policy, internal security, public health or internal relations of EU countries;presents insufficient travel medical insurance.\nThe general deadline for a decision is a maximum of 15 days, which may be extended up to a maximum of 45 days in individual cases, notably where further scrutiny of the application is needed.\nA decision on refusal and the reasons on which it is based is notified to the applicant using the standard form set out in Annex VI.\nPersons whose visa has been refused have the right to appeal.\nCooperation on readmission\nThe European Commission assesses cooperation by non-EU countries on readmission of irregular migrants, taking into account border management and prevention, control of migrant smuggling and the transit of irregular migrants.\nWhere a non-EU country is not cooperating, the Commission may submit a proposal for a Council decision to temporarily apply certain rules in a restrictive manner. Conversely, where a country is cooperating sufficiently, certain rules may be applied in a more generous manner.\nRespect for human dignity and fundamental rights\nAmending Regulation (EU) 2021/1134 also introduces stipulations that Member States’ consular and central authorities’ staff must fully respect human dignity and the fundamental rights and principles recognised by the EU’s Charter of Fundamental Rights when performing their duties. They shall not discriminate against persons on grounds of sex, racial or ethnic origin, religion or belief, disability, age or sexual orientation.\nAmendments and repeals\nAmending Regulation (EU) 2021/1134 also amends the VIS regulation set up under Regulation (EC) No 767/2008 (see summary) and the Schengen Borders Code, as well as Articles 9–17 of the convention implementing the Schengen Agreement and the Common Consular Instructions.\nThe regulation has been successively amended by Regulations (EU) No 977/2011, (EU) No 154/2012, (EU) No 610/2013, (EU) 2016/399, (EU) 2019/1155 and (EU) 2021/1134.\nFROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?\nRegulation (EC) No 810/2009 has applied since 5 April 2010.\nIt should be noted that amendments introduced by Regulation (EU) 2021/1134 are expected to be applied only from 2024.\nBACKGROUND\n              \nSee also:\nVisa policy (European Commission).\nMAIN DOCUMENT\n            \nRegulation (EC) No 810/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 July 2009 establishing a Community Code on Visas (Visa Code) (OJ L 243, 15.9.2009, pp. 1–58).\nSuccessive amendments to Regulation (EC) No 810/2009 have been incorporated into the original text.
