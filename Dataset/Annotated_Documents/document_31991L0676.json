Article 2 For the purpose of this Directive: (a) 'groundwater`: means all water which is below the surface of the ground in the saturation zone  and in direct contact with the ground or subsoil; (b) 'freshwater`: means naturally occurring water having a low concentration of salts, which is  often acceptable as suitable for abstraction and treatment to produce drinking water; (c) 'nitrogen compound`: means any nitrogen-containing substance except for gaseous molecular  nitrogen; (d) 'livestock`: means all animals kept for use or profit; (e) 'fertilizer`: means any substance containing a nitrogen compound or nitrogen compounds utilized  on land to enhance growth of vegetation; it may include livestock manure, the residues from fish  farms and sewage sludge; (f) 'chemical fertilizer`: means any fertilizer which is manufactured by an industrial process; (g) 'livestock manure`: means waste products excreted by livestock or a mixture of litter and waste  products excreted by livestock, even in processed form; (h) 'land application`: means the addition of materials to land whether by spreading on the surface  of the land, injection into the land, placing below the surface of the land or mixing with the  surface layers of the land; (i) 'eutrophication`: means the enrichment of water by nitrogen compounds, causing an accelerated  growth of algae and higher forms of plant life to produce an undesirable disturbance to the balance  of organisms present in the water and to the quality of the water concerned; (j) 'pollution`: means the discharge, directly or indirectly, of nitrogen compounds from  agricultural sources into the aquatic environment, the results of which are such as to cause  hazards to human health, harm to living resources and to aquatic ecosystems, damage to amenities or  interference with other legitimate uses of water; (k) 'vulnerable zone`: means an area of land designated according to Article 3 (2). Article 3 1.  Waters affected by pollution and waters which could be affected by pollution if  action pursuant Article 5 is not taken shall be identified by the Member States in accordance with  the criteria set out in Annex I. 2.  Member States shall, within a two-year period following the notification of this Directive,  designate as vulnerable zones all known areas of land in their territories which drain into the  waters identified according to paragraph 1 and which contribute to pollution. They shall notify the  Commission of this initial designation within six months. 3.  When any waters identified by a Member State in accordance with paragraph 1 are affected by  pollution from waters from another Member State draining directly or indirectly in to them, the  Member States whose waters are affected may notify the other Member States and the Commission of  the relevant facts. The Member States concerned shall organize, where appropriate with the Commission, the concertation  necessary to identify the sources in question and the measures to be taken to protect the waters  that are affected in order to ensure conformity with this Directive. 4.  Member States shall review if necessary revise or add to the designation of vulnerable zones as  appropriate, and at last every four years, to take into account changes and factors unforeseen at  the time of the previous designation. They shall notify the Commission of any revision or addition  to the designations within six months. 5.  Member States shall be exempt from the obligation to identify specific vulnerable zones, if  they establish and apply action programmes referred to in Article 5 in accordance with this  Directive throughout their national territory. Article 4 1.  With the aim of providing for all waters a general level of protection against  pollution, Member States shall, within a two-year period following the notification of this  Directive: (a) establish a code or codes of good agricultural practice, to be implemented by farmers on a  voluntary basis, which should contain provisions covering at least the items mentioned in Annex II  A; (b) set up where necessary a programme, including the provision of training and information for  farmers, promoting the application of the code(s) of good agricultural practice. 2.

(1)This Directive was notified to the Member States on 19 December 1991. ANNEX I CRITERIA FOR IDENTIFYING WATERS REFERRED TO IN ARTICLE 3 (1) A. Waters referred  to in Article 3 (1) shall be identified making use, inter alia, of the following criteria: 1. whether surface freshwaters, in particular those used or intended for the abstraction of  drinking water, contain or could contain, if action pursuant to Article 5 is not taken, more than  the concentration of nitrates laid down in accordance with Directive 75/440/EEC; 2. whether groundwaters contain more than 50 mg/l nitrates or could contain more than 50 mg/l  nitrates if action pursuant to Article 5 is not taken; 3. whether natural freshwater lakes, other freshwater bodies, estuaries, coastal waters and marine  waters are found to be eutrophic or in the near future may become euthropic if action pursuant to  Article 5 is not taken. B. In applying these criteria, Member States shall also take account of: 1. the pyhsical and environmental characteristics of the waters and land; 2. the current understanding of the behaviour of nitrogen compounds in the environment (water and  soil); 3. the current understanding of the impact of the action taken pursuant to Article 5. ANNEX II CODE(S) OF GOOD AGRICULTURAL PRACTICE A. A code or codes of good agricultural  practice with the objective of reducing pollution by nitrates and taking account of conditions in  the different regions of the Community should certain provisions covering the following items, in  so far as they are relevant:  1. periods when the land application of fertilizer is inappropriate;  2. the land application of fertilizer to steeply sloping ground;  3. the land application of fertilizer to water-saturated, flooded, frozen or snow-covered ground;  4. the conditions for land application of fertilizer near water courses;  5. the capacity and construction of storage vessels for livestock manures, including measures to  prevent water pollution by run-off and seepage into the groundwater and surface water of liquids  containing livestock manures and effluents from stored plant materials such as silage;  6. procedures for the land application, including rate and uniformity of spreading, of both  chemical fertilizer and livestock manure, that will maintain nutrient losses to water at an  acceptable level. B. Member States may also include in their code(s) of good agricultural practices the following  items:  7. land use management, including the use of crop rotation systems and the proportion of the land  area devoted to permanent crops relative to annual tillage crops;  8. the maintenance of a minimum quantity of vegetation cover during (rainy) periods that will take  up the nitrogen from the soil that could otherwise cause nitrate pollution of water;  9. the establishment of fertilizer plans on a farm-by-farm basis and the keeping of records on  fertilizer use; 10. the prevention of water pollution from run-off and the downward water movement beyond the reach  of crop roots in irrigation systems. ANNEX III MEASURES TO BE INCLUDED IN ACTION PROGRAMMES AS REFERRED TO IN ARTICLE 5 (4)  (a) 1. The measures shall include rules relating to: 1. periods when the land application of certain types of fertilizer is prohibited; 2. the capacity of storage vessels for livestock manure; this capacity must exceed that required  for storage throughout the longest period during which land application in the vulnerable zone is  prohibited, except where it can be demonstrated to the competent authority that any quantity of  manure in excess of the actual storage capacity will be disposed of in a manner which will not  cause harm to the environment; 3. limitation of the land application of fertilizers, consistent with good agricultural practice  and taking into account the characteristics of the vulnerable zone concerned, in particular: (a) soil conditions, soil type and slope; (b) climatic conditions, rainfall and irrigation; (c) land use and agricultural practices, including crop rotation systems; and to be based on a balance between: (i) the foreseeable nitrogen requirements of the crops, and (ii) the nitrogen supply to the crops from the soil and from fertilization corresponding to: - the amount of nitrogen present in the soil at the moment when the crop starts to use it to a  significant degree (outstanding amounts at the end of winter), - the supply of nitrogen through the net mineralization of the reserves of organic nitrogen in the  soil, - additions of nitrogen compounds from livestock manure, - additions of nitrogen compounds from chemical and other fertilizers. 2. These measures will ensure that, for each farm or livestock unit, the amount of livestock manure  applied to the land each year, including by the animals themselves, shall not exceed a specified  amount per hectare. The specified amount per hectare be the amount of manure containing 170 kg N. However: (a) for the first four year action programme Member States may allow an amount of manure containing  up to 210 kg N; (b) during and after the first four-year action programme, Member States may fix different amounts  from those referred to above. These amounts must be fixed so as not to prejudice the achievement of  the objectives specified in Article 1 and must be justified on the basis of objectives criteria,  for example: - long growing seasons, - crops with high nitrogen uptake, - high net precipitation in the vulnerable zone, - soils with exceptionally high denitrification capacity. If a Member State allows a different amount under subparagraph (b), it shall inform the Commission  which will examine the justification in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 9. 3. Member States may calculate the amounts referred to in paragraph 2 on the basis of animal  numbers. 4. Member States shall inform the Commission of the manner in which they are applying the  provisions of paragraph 2. In the light of the information received, the Commission may, if it  considers necessary, make appropriate proposals to the Council in accordance with Article 11. ANNEX IV REFERENCE METHODS OF MEASUREMENT Chemical fertilizer Nitrogen  compounds shall be measured using the method described in Commission Directive 77/535/EEC of 22  June 1977 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to methods of sampling and  analysis for fertilizers (1), as amended by Directive 89/519/EEC (2). Freshwaters, coastal waters and marine waters Nitrate concentration shall be  measured in accordance with Article 4a (3) of Council Decision 77/795/EEC of 12 December 1977  establishing a common procedure for the exchange of information on the quality of surface fresh  water in the Community (3), as amended by Decision 86/574/EEC (4).

The designation is reviewed and possibly revised at least every 4 years to take account of any changes that occur.\nEstablish mandatory action programmes for these areas, taking into account available scientific and technical data and overall environmental conditions.\nMonitor the effectiveness of the action programmes.\nTest the nitrate concentration in fresh ground and surface water at sampling stations, at least monthly and more frequently during flooding.\nCarry out a comprehensive monitoring programme and submit — every 4 years — a detailed report on the directive’s implementation. The report includes information on nitrate-vulnerable zones, results of water monitoring and a summary of the relevant aspects of codes of good agricultural practices and action programmes.\nDraw up a code of good agricultural practice, which farmers apply on a voluntary basis. It sets out various good practices, such as when fertiliser use is inappropriate.\nProvide training and information for farmers, where appropriate.\nThe European Commission provides a report every 4 years on the basis of the national information it has received. The latest report dates from 2018.\nDerogations\nThe directive sets upper limits for the amount of nitrogen from manure that can be applied annually at 170 kg/ha. Where Member States so request, and provided that they can justify scientifically that this will not lead to higher pollution, the Commission can adopt implementing acts (decisions, in this case, which are referred to as ‘derogations’) that allow higher maximum limits of nitrogen from manure to be applied in specific areas and under particular conditions. These derogations do not exempt the Member States in question from the directive’s water quality objectives, nor from any other of its measures.\nThe following derogation decisions are currently in force:\nImplementing Decision (EU) 2020/1074 granting a derogation requested by Denmark — valid 4 years, until 31 July 2024;\nImplementing Decision (EU) 2020/1073 granting a derogation requested by the Netherlands — valid 2 years, until 31 December 2021;\nImplementing Decision (EU) 2019/1325 granting a derogation requested by the United Kingdom with regard to Northern Ireland — valid 4 years, until 31 December 2022;\nImplementing Decision (EU) 2019/1205 granting a derogation requested by Belgium with regard to the region of Flanders — valid 4 years, until 31 December 2022;\nImplementing Decision (EU) 2018/209 granting a derogation requested by Ireland — valid 4 years, until 31 December 2021.\nFROM WHEN DOES THE DIRECTIVE APPLY?\n              \nIt has applied since 19 December 1991 and had to become law in the Member States by 19 December 1993.\nBACKGROUND\n              \nNitrogen is a vital nutrient that helps plants and crops to grow. However, high concentrations are harmful to people and nature, and the agricultural use of nitrates in organic and chemical fertilisers can be a major source of water pollution. Farming is responsible for over 50% of total nitrogen discharges into surface waters.\nFor more information, see:\nThe EU Nitrates Directive — factsheet (European Commission)\nThe Nitrates Directive (European Commission).\nKEY TERMS\n              \nEutrophication.
