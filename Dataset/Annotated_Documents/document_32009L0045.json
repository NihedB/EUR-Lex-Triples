{"celex_id": "32009L0045", "reference": "25.6.2009\nEN\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\nL 163/1\nDIRECTIVE 2009/45/EC OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL\nof 6 May 2009\non safety rules and standards for passenger ships\n(Recast)\n(Text with EEA relevance)\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 80(2) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the Commission,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee (1),\nHaving consulted the Committee of the Regions,\nActing in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty (2),\nWhereas:\n(1)\nCouncil Directive 98/18/EC of 17 March 1998 on safety rules and standards for passenger ships (3) has been substantially amended several times (4). Since further amendments are to be made, it should be recast in the interests of clarity.\n(2)\nWithin the framework of the common transport policy measures must be adopted to enhance safety in maritime transport.\n(3)\nThe Community is seriously concerned about shipping casualties in which passenger ships were involved resulting in a massive loss of life. Persons using passenger ships and high-speed passenger craft throughout the Community have the right to expect and to rely on an appropriate level of safety on board.\n(4)\nWork equipment and personal protective equipment of workers are not covered by this Directive, because the provisions of Council Directive 89/391/EEC of 12 June 1989 on the introduction of measures to encourage improvements in the safety and health of workers at work (5) and the relevant provisions of its relevant individual directives are applicable to the use of such equipment on passenger ships engaged on domestic voyages.\n(5)\nThe provision of maritime passenger transport services between Member States has already been liberalised by Council Regulation (EEC) No 4055/86 of 22 December 1986 applying the principle of freedom to provide services to maritime transport between Member States and between Member States and third countries (6). The application of the principle of freedom to provide services to maritime transport within Member States (maritime cabotage) has been provided for by Council Regulation (EEC) No 3577/92 (7).\n(6)\nTo attain a high level of safety, and to remove barriers to trade, it is necessary to establish harmonised safety standards at an appropriate level for passenger ships and craft operating domestic services. Standards for vessels operating international voyages are being developed within the International Maritime Organization (IMO). Procedures to request action at the IMO in order to bring the standards for international voyages into line with the standards of this Directive should be available.\n(7)\nIn view, in particular, of the internal market dimension of maritime passenger transport, action at Community level is the only possible way to establish a common level of safety for ships throughout the Community.\n(8)\nIn view of the principle of proportionality, a Directive is the appropriate legal instrument as it provides a framework for a uniform and compulsory application of the safety standards by Member States, while leaving to each Member State the right to decide the implementation tools that best fit its internal system.\n(9)\nIn the interests of improving safety and avoiding distortions of competition the common safety requirements should apply to passenger ships and high-speed passenger craft engaged on domestic voyages in the Community, irrespective of the flag they fly. It is, however, necessary to exclude some categories of ships for which the rules of this Directive are technically unsuitable or economically unviable.\n(10)\nPassenger ships should be divided into different classes depending upon the range and conditions of the sea areas in which they operate. High-speed passenger craft should be categorised in accordance with the provisions of the High-Speed Craft Code established by the IMO.\n(11)\nThe main reference framework for the safety standards should be the 1974 International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (the 1974 SOLAS Convention), as amended, which encompasses internationally agreed standards for passenger ships and high-speed passenger craft engaged on international voyages, as well as appropriate Resolutions adopted by the IMO and other measures complementing and interpreting that Convention.\n(12)\nThe various classes of both new and existing passenger ships require a different approach for establishing safety requirements guaranteeing an equivalent safety level in view of the specific needs and limitations of those various classes. It is appropriate to make distinctions in the safety requirements to be respected as between new and existing ships since imposing the rules for new ships on existing ships would involve such extensive structural changes as to make them economically unviable.\n(13)\nThe financial and technical implications arising from the upgrading of existing ships to the standards provided for by this Directive justify certain transitional periods.\n(14)\nIn view of the substantial differences in the design, construction and use of high-speed passenger craft compared to traditional passenger ships, such craft should be required to respect special rules.\n(15)\nShipborne marine equipment, complying with the provisions of Council Directive 96/98/EC of 20 December 1996 on marine equipment (8), when installed on board a passenger ship, should not be subject to additional tests since such equipment is already subject to the standards and procedures of that Directive.\n(16)\nDirective 2003/25/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 14 April 2003 on specific stability requirements for ro-ro passenger ships (9) introduced strengthened stability requirements for ro-ro passenger vessels operating on international services to and from Community ports, and this enhanced measure should also apply to certain categories of such vessels operating on domestic services under the same sea conditions. Failure to apply such stability requirements should be grounds for phasing out ro-ro passenger ships after a certain number of years of operation. In view of the structural modifications that the existing ro-ro passenger ships may need to undergo in order to comply with the specific stability requirements, those requirements should be introduced over a period of years in order to give the part of the industry affected sufficient time to comply: to that end, provision should be made for a phasing-in timetable for existing ships. This phasing-in timetable should not affect the enforcement of the specific stability requirements in the sea areas covered by the Annexes to the Stockholm Agreement of 28 February 1996.\n(17)\nIt is important to apply appropriate measures to ensure access in safe conditions for persons with reduced mobility to passenger ships and high-speed passenger craft operating on domestic services in the Member States.\n(18)\nSubject to control under the Committee procedure, Member States may adopt additional safety requirements if justified by local circumstances, permit the use of equivalent standards, or adopt exemptions from the provisions of this Directive under certain operating conditions, or adopt safeguard measures in exceptional dangerous circumstances.\n(19)\nRegulation (EC) No 2099/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 5 November 2002 establishing a Committee on Safe Seas and the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (COSS) (10) centralised the tasks of the committees established under the pertinent Community legislation on maritime safety, the prevention of pollution from ships and the protection of shipboard living and working conditions.\n(20)\nThe measures necessary for the implementation of this Directive should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission (11).\n(21)\nIn particular, the Commission should be empowered to adapt certain provisions of this Directive, including its Annexes, to take account of developments at international level and specifically amendments to International Conventions. Since those measures are of general scope and are designed to amend non-essential elements of this Directive, they must be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny provided for in Article 5a of Decision 1999/468/EC.\n(22)\nIn order to monitor the effective implementation and enforcement of this Directive, surveys should be carried out on new and existing passenger ships and craft. Compliance with this Directive should be certified by or on behalf of the Administration of the flag State.\n(23)\nIn order to ensure full application of this Directive, Member States should lay down a system of penalties for breach of the national provisions adopted pursuant to this Directive and should monitor compliance with the provisions of this Directive on the basis of provisions modelled on those laid down in Council Directive 95/21/EC of 19 June 1995 on port State control of shipping (12).\n(24)\nThe new elements introduced into this Directive only concern the committee procedures. They therefore do not need to be transposed by the Member States.\n(25)\nThis Directive should be without prejudice to the obligations of the Member States relating to the time-limits for transposition into national law and application of the Directives set out in Annex IV, Part B,\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:\nArticle 1\nPurpose\nThe purpose of this Directive is to introduce a uniform level of safety of life and property on new and existing passenger ships and high-speed passenger craft, when both categories of ships and craft are engaged on domestic voyages, and to lay down procedures for negotiation at international level with a view to a harmonisation of the rules for passenger ships engaged on international voyages.\nArticle 2\nDefinitions\nFor the purposes of this Directive:\n(a)\n‘International Conventions’ means the 1974 International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (the 1974 SOLAS Convention), as amended, and the 1966 International Convention on Load Lines, together with the Protocols and amendments thereto;\n(b)\n‘Intact Stability Code’ means the ‘Code on Intact Stability for all types of ships covered by IMO Instruments’ contained in IMO Assembly Resolution A.749(18) of 4 November 1993, as amended;\n(c)\n‘High-Speed Craft Code’ means the ‘International Code for Safety of High-Speed Craft’ contained in IMO Maritime Safety Committee Resolution MSC.36(63) of 20 May 1994, in its up-to-date version;\n(d)\n‘GMDSS’ means the Global Maritime Distress and Safety System as laid down in Chapter IV of the 1974 SOLAS Convention, as amended;\n(e)\n‘a passenger ship’ means a ship which carries more than 12 passengers;\n(f)\n‘ro-ro passenger ship’ means a ship carrying more than 12 passengers, having ro-ro cargo spaces or special category spaces, as defined in Regulation II-2/A/2 contained in Annex I;\n(g)\n‘high-speed passenger craft’ means a high-speed craft as defined in Regulation X/1 of the 1974 SOLAS Convention, as amended, which carries more than 12 passengers, with the exception of passenger ships engaged on domestic voyages in sea areas of Class B, C or D when:\n(i)\ntheir displacement corresponding to the design waterline is less than 500 m3; and\n(ii)\ntheir maximum speed, as defined in paragraph 1.4.30 of the High-Speed Craft Code, is less than 20 knots;\n(h)\n‘new ship’ means a ship the keel of which was laid or which was at a similar stage of construction on or after 1 July 1998; a ‘similar stage of construction’ means the stage at which:\n(i)\nconstruction identifiable with a specific ship begins; and\n(ii)\nassembly of that ship has commenced comprising at least 50 tonnes or 1 % of the estimated mass of all structural material, whichever is less;\n(i)\n‘existing ship’ means a ship which is not a new ship;\n(j)\n‘age’ means the age of the ship, expressed in terms of the number of years after the date of its delivery;\n(k)\n‘passenger’ means every person other than:\n(i)\nthe master and the members of the crew or other persons employed or engaged in any capacity on board a ship on the business of that ship; and\n(ii)\na child under one year of age;\n(l)\n‘length of a ship’, unless expressly provided otherwise, means 96 % of the total length on a water line at 85 % of the least moulded depth measured from the top of the keel, or the length from the fore side of the stem to the axis of the rudder stock on that waterline, if that be greater.

This should be supported by evidence to the Commission which confirms that an equivalent level of safety is achieved.\nEXISTING CLASS A AND B SHIPS OF 24 METRES IN LENGTH AND ABOVE:\nAll existing class A and B ships shall, in all loading conditions, satisfy the following stability criteria after due correction for the effect of free surface of liquids in tanks in accordance with the assumptions of paragraph 3.3 of IMO Resolution A.749 (18), or equivalent.\n(a)\nThe area under the curve of righting lever (GZ curve) shall not be less than:\n(i)\n0,055 metre-radians up to an angle of heel of 30 °;\n(ii)\n0,09 metre-radians up to an angle of heel of either 40 ° or the angle of flooding, i.e. the angle of heel at which the lower edges of any openings in the hull, superstructures or deckhouses, being openings that cannot be closed weathertight, are immersed, if that angle be less than 40 °;\n(iii)\n0,03 metre-radians between the angles of heel of 30 ° and 40 ° or between 30 ° and the angle of flooding if this angle is less than 40 °;\n(b)\nThe righting lever GZ shall be at least 0,20 metres at an angle of heel equal to or greater than 30 °.\n(c)\nThe maximum righting lever GZ shall occur at an angle of heel preferably exceeding 30 ° but not less than 25 °.\n(d)\nThe initial transverse metacentric height shall not be less than 0,15 metres.\nThe loading conditions to be considered in order to verify the compliance with the above stability criteria shall include at least those listed in paragraph 3.5.1.1 of IMO Resolution A.749 (18).\nAll existing ships of classes A and B having a length of 24 metres and over shall also comply with the additional criteria as given in IMO Resolution A.749(18), paragraph 3.1.2.6 (additional criteria for passenger ships) and paragraph 3.2 (Severe Wind and Rolling Criterion).\nWhere Member States consider the application of the Severe Wind and Rolling Criterion of A.749 (18) inappropriate, an alternative approach to ensuring satisfactory stability may be applied. This should be supported by evidence to the Commission which confirms that an equivalent level of safety is achieved.\n2   Watertight subdivision\nNEW CLASS B, C AND D AND EXISTING CLASS B SHIPS:\nEvery ship shall be subdivided by bulkheads, which shall be watertight up to the bulkhead deck, into watertight compartments the maximum length of which shall be calculated according to the specific requirements given below.\nInstead of those requirements, the regulations on subdivision and stability of passenger ships as an equivalent to Part B of Chapter II of the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea, 1960, as given in IMO Resolution A.265 (VIII) may be used, if applied in their entirety.\nEvery other portion of the internal structure which affects the efficiency of the subdivision of the ship shall be watertight.\n3   Floodable length (R 4)\nNEW CLASS B, C AND D AND EXISTING CLASS B SHIPS:\n.1\nThe floodable length at a given point is the maximum portion of the length of the ship, having its centre at the point in question, which can be flooded, under the assumption for permeability given below, without the ship being submerged beyond the margin line.\n.2\nIn the case of a ship not having a continuous bulkhead deck, the floodable length at any point may be determined to an assumed continuous margin line which at no point is less than 76 mm below the top of the deck at side to which the bulkheads concerned and the shell are carried watertight.\n.3\nWhere a portion of an assumed margin line is appreciably below the deck to which bulkheads are carried, the Administration of the flag State may permit a limited relaxation in the watertightness of those portions of the bulkheads which are above the margin line and immediately under the higher deck.\n4   Permissible length of compartments (R 6)\nNEW CLASS B, C AND D AND EXISTING CLASS B SHIPS:\nThe maximum permissible length of a compartment having its centre at any point in the ship's length is obtained from the floodable length by multiplying the latter by an appropriate factor called factor of subdivision.\n5   Permeability (R 5)\nNEW CLASS B, C AND D AND EXISTING CLASS B SHIPS:\nThe definite assumptions referred to in Regulation 3 relate to the permeability of the spaces below the margin line.\nIn determining the floodable length, the assumed average permeability of the spaces below the margin line shall be as indicated in the table in Regulation 8.3.\n6   Subdivision factor\nThe factor of subdivision shall be:\nFOR NEW CLASS B, C AND D SHIPS AND EXISTING CLASS B RO-RO PASSENGER SHIPS:\n1,0 when the number of persons the ship is certified to carry is less than 400, and\n0,5 when the number of persons the ship is certified to carry is 400 or more.\nExisting class B ro-ro passenger ships have to comply with this requirement not later than the date of compliance laid down in Regulation II-1/B/8-2, paragraph 2.\nFOR EXISTING CLASS B NON RO-RO PASSENGER SHIPS: 1,0\n7   Special requirements concerning ship subdivision (R 7)\nNEW CLASS B, C AND D AND EXISTING CLASS B SHIPS:\n.1\nWhere in a portion or portions of a ship the watertight bulkheads are carried to a higher deck than in the remainder of the ship and it is desired to take advantage of this higher extension of the bulkheads in calculating the floodable length, separate margin lines may be used for each such portion of the ship provided that:\n.1\nthe sides of the ship are extended throughout the ship's length to the deck corresponding to the upper margin line and all openings in the shell plating below this deck throughout the length of the ship are treated as being below a margin line, for the purpose of Regulation 15; and\n.2\nthe two compartments adjacent to the ‘step’ in the bulkhead deck are each within the permissible length corresponding to their respective margin lines, and, in addition, their combined length does not exceed twice the permissible length based on the lower margin line.\n.2\nA compartment may exceed the permissible length determined by the rules of Regulation 4 provided the combined length of each pair of adjacent compartments to which the compartment in question is common does not exceed either the floodable length or twice the permissible length, whichever is less.\n.3\nA main transverse bulkhead may be recessed provided that all parts of the recess lie inboard of vertical surfaces on both sides of the ship, situated at a distance from the shell plating equal to one fifth of the breadth of the ship, and measured at right angles to the centreline at the level of the deepest subdivision load line. Any part of a recess which lies outside these limits shall be dealt with as a step in accordance with paragraph .6.\n.4\nWhere a main transverse bulkhead is recessed or stepped, an equivalent plane bulkhead shall be used in determining the subdivision.\n.5\nWhere a main transverse watertight compartment contains local subdivision and the Administration of the flag State is satisfied that, after any assumed side damage extending over a length of 3,0 metres plus 3 % of the length of the ship or 11,0 metres, or 10 % of the length of the ship whichever is the less, the whole volume of the main compartment will not be flooded, a proportionate allowance may be made in the permissible length otherwise required for such compartment. In such a case the volume of the effective buoyancy assumed on the undamaged side shall not be greater than that assumed on the damaged side.\nAllowance under this paragraph will only be made if such allowance is not likely to prevent compliance with Regulation 8.\nNEW CLASS B, C AND D SHIPS:\n.6\nA main transverse bulkhead may be stepped provided that it meets one of the following conditions:\n.1\nthe combined length of the two compartments, separated by the bulkhead in question, does not exceed either 90 % of the floodable length or twice the permissible length, except that, in ships having a subdivision factor equal to 1, the combined length of the two compartments in question shall not exceed the permissible length;\n.2\nadditional subdivision is provided in way of the step to maintain the same level of safety as that secured by a plane bulkhead;\n.3\nthe compartment over which the step extends does not exceed the permissible length corresponding to a margin line taken 76 mm below the step.\n.7\nIn ships of 100 metres in length and upwards, one of the main transverse bulkheads abaft the forepeak shall be fitted at a distance from the forward perpendicular which is not greater than the permissible length.\n.8\nIf the distance between two adjacent main transverse bulkheads, or their equivalent plank bulkheads, or the distance between the transverse planes passing through the nearest stepped portions of the bulkheads, is less than 3,0 metres plus 3 % of the length of the ship, or 11,0 metres, or 10 % of the length of the ship, whichever is less, only one of these bulkheads shall be regarded as forming part of the subdivision of the ship.\n.9\nWhere the required subdivision factor is 0,50, the combined length of any two adjacent compartments shall not exceed the floodable length.\n8   Stability in damaged conditions (R 8)\nNEW CLASS B, C AND D AND EXISTING CLASS B SHIPS:\n.1.1\nSufficient intact stability shall be provided in all service conditions so as to enable the ship to withstand the final stage of flooding of any one main compartment which is required to be within the floodable length.\n.1.2\nWhere two adjacent main compartments are separated by a bulkhead which is stepped under the conditions of Regulation 7.6.1, the intact stability shall be adequate to withstand the flooding of those two adjacent compartments.\n.1.3\nWhere the required factor of subdivision is 0,50, the intact stability shall be adequate to withstand the flooding of any two adjacent compartments.\n.2.1\nThe requirements of subparagraph .1 shall be determined by calculations which are in accordance with paragraphs .3, .4 and .6 and which take into consideration the proportions and design characteristics of the ship and the arrangement and configuration of the damaged compartments. In making these calculations the ship is to be assumed in the worst anticipated service condition as regards stability.\n.2.2\nWhere it is proposed to fit decks, inner skins or longitudinal bulkheads of sufficient tightness to seriously restrict the flow of water, proper consideration is to be given to such restrictions in the calculations.\nNEW CLASS B, C AND D SHIPS AND EXISTING CLASS B RO-RO PASSENGER SHIPS AND EXISTING CLASS B NON RO-RO PASSENGER SHIPS, CONSTRUCTED ON OR AFTER 29 APRIL 1990:\n.2.3\nThe stability required in the final condition after damage, and after equalisation where provided, shall be determined as follows:\n.2.3.1\nThe positive residual righting lever curve shall have a minimum range of 15 ° beyond the angle of equilibrium. This range may be reduced to a minimum of 10 ° in cases where the area under the righting lever curve is that specified in subparagraph .2.3.2 multiplied by the ratio 15/range, where range is expressed in degrees.\n.2.3.2\nThe area under the righting lever curve shall be at least 0,015 m-rad, measured from the angle of equilibrium to the lesser of:\n.1\nthe angle at which progressive flooding occurs;\n.2\n22 ° (measured from upright) in the case of one-compartment flooding, or 27 ° (measured from the upright) in the case of the simultaneous flooding of two adjacent compartments.\n.2.3.3\nA residual righting lever is to be obtained within the range of positive stability, taking into account the greatest of the following heeling moments:\n.1\nthe crowding of all passengers towards one side;\n.2\nthe launching of all fully loaded davit-launched survival craft on one side;\n.3\ndue to wind pressure;\nas calculated by the formula:\nHowever, in no case is the righting lever to be less than 0,10 metres.\n.2.3.4\nFor the purpose of calculating the heeling moments in paragraph .2.3.3 the following assumptions shall be made:\n.1\nMoment due to crowding of passengers:\n.1.1\nfour persons per square metre;\n.1.2\na mass of 75 kg for each passenger;\n.1.3\npassengers shall be distributed on available deck areas towards one side of the ship on the decks where assembly stations are located and in such a way that they produce the most adverse heeling moment.\n.2\nMoment due to launching of all fully loaded davit-launched survival craft on one side:\n.2.1\nall lifeboats and rescue boats fitted on the side to which the ship has heeled after having sustained damage shall be assumed to be swung out fully loaded and ready for lowering;\n.2.2\nfor lifeboats which are arranged to be launched fully loaded from the stowed position, the maximum heeling moment during launching shall be taken;\n.2.3\na fully loaded davit-launched life-raft attached to each davit on the side to which the ship has heeled after having sustained damage shall be assumed to be swung out ready for lowering;\n.2.4\npersons not in the life-saving appliances which are swung out shall not provide either additional heeling or righting moment;\n.2.5\nlife-saving appliances on the side of the ship opposite to the side to which the ship has heeled shall be assumed to be in a stowed position.\n.3\nMoments due to wind pressure:\n.3.1\nclass B: a wind pressure of 120 N/m2 to be applied;\nclasses C and D: a wind pressure of 80 N/m2 to be applied;\n.3.2\nthe area applicable shall be the projected lateral area of the ship above the waterline corresponding to the intact condition;\n.3.3\nthe moment arm shall be the vertical distance from a point at one half of the mean draught corresponding to the intact condition to the centre of gravity of the lateral area.\n.2.4\nWhen major progressive flooding occurs, that is, when it causes a rapid reduction in the righting lever of 0,04 metres or more, the righting lever curve is to be considered as terminated at the angle the progressive flooding occurs and the range and the area referred to in .2.3.1 and .2.3.2 should be measured to that angle.\n.2.5\nIn cases where the progressive flooding is of limited nature that does not continue unabated and causes an acceptably slow reduction in righting lever of less than 0,04 metres, the remainder of the curve shall be partially truncated by assuming that the progressively flooded space is so flooded from the beginning.\n.2.6\nIn intermediate stages of flooding, the maximum righting lever shall be at least 0,05 metres and the range of positive righting levers shall be at least 7. In all cases, only one breach in the hull and only one free surface need be assumed.\nNEW CLASS B, C AND D AND EXISTING CLASS B SHIPS:\n.3\nFor the purpose of making damaged stability calculations the volume and surface permeabilities shall be as follows:\nSpaces\nPermeability\n(%)\nAppropriated to cargo or stores\n60\nOccupied by accommodations\n95\nOccupied by machineries\n85\nIntended for liquids\n0 or 95 (1)\nHigher surface permeabilities are to be assumed in respect of spaces which, in the vicinity of the damaged waterplane, contain no substantial quantity of accommodation or machinery and spaces which are not generally occupied by any substantial quantity of cargo or stores.\n.4\nAssumed extent of damage shall be as follows:\n.1\nlongitudinal extent: 3,0 metres plus 3 % of the length of the ship, or 11,0 metres or 10 % of the length of the ship, whichever is less;\n.2\ntransverse extent (measured inboard from the ship's side, at right angles to the centreline at the level of the deepest subdivision load line): a distance of one fifth of the breadth of the ship; and\n.3\nvertical extent: from the base line upwards without limit;\n.4\nif any damage of lesser extent than that indicated in .4.1, .4.2 or .4.3 would result in a more severe condition regarding heel or loss of metacentric height, such damage shall be assumed in the calculations.\n.5\nUnsymmetrical flooding is to be kept to a minimum consistent with efficient arrangements. Where it is necessary to correct large angles of heel, the means adopted shall, where practicable, be self-acting, but in any case where controls to cross-flooding fittings are provided they shall be operable from above the bulkhead deck. For new class B, C and D ships the maximum angle of heel after flooding but before equalisation shall not exceed 15 °. Where cross-flooding fittings are required the time for equalisation shall not exceed 15 minutes. Suitable information concerning the use of cross-flooding fittings shall be supplied to the master of the ship.\n.6\nThe final conditions of the ship after damage and, in the case of unsymmetrical flooding, after equalisation measures have been taken shall be as follows:\n.1\nin the case of symmetrical flooding there shall be a positive residual metacentric height of at least 50 mm as calculated by the constant displacement method;\n.2a\nunless provided otherwise in paragraph .6.2b, in the case of unsymmetrical flooding the angle of heel for one-compartment flooding shall not exceed 7 ° for class B ships (new and existing) and 12 ° for classes C and D ships (new).\nFor the simultaneous flooding of two adjacent compartments, a heel of 12 ° may be permitted for existing and new class B ships, provided that the factor of subdivision is nowhere greater than 0,50 in that part of the ship that is flooded;\n.2b\nfor existing class B non ro-ro passenger ships, constructed before 29 April 1990, in the case of unsymmetrical flooding, the angle shall not exceed 7 °, except that in exceptional cases the Administration may allow additional heel due to the unsymmetrical moment, but in no case shall the final heel exceed 15;\n.3\nin no case shall the margin line be submerged in the final stage of flooding. If it is considered that the margin line may become submerged during an intermediate stage of flooding, the Administration of the flag State may require such investigations and arrangements as it considers necessary for the safety of the ship.\n.7\nThe master of the ship shall be supplied with the data necessary to maintain sufficient intact stability under service conditions to enable the ship to withstand the critical damage. In the case of ships requiring cross-flooding, the master of the ship shall be informed of the conditions of stability on which the calculations of heel are based and shall be warned that excessive heeling might result should the ship sustain damage when in a less favourable condition.\n.8\nThe data referred to in paragraph .7 to enable the master to maintain sufficient intact stability shall include information which indicates the maximum permissible height of the ship's centre of gravity above keel (KG), or alternatively the minimum permissible metacentric height (GM), for a range of draughts or displacements sufficient to include all service conditions. The information shall show the influence of various trims taking into account the operational limits.\n.9\nEach ship shall have scales of draughts marked clearly at the bow and stern. In the case where the draught marks are not located where they are easily readable, or operational constraints for a particular trade make it difficult to read the draught marks, then the ship shall also be fitted with a reliable draught indicating system by which the bow and stern draughts can be determined.\n.10\nOn completion of loading of the ship and prior to its departure, the master shall determine the ship's trim and stability and also ascertain and record that the ship is in compliance with stability criteria in the relevant regulations. The determination of the ship's stability shall always be made by calculation. An electronic loading and stability computer or equivalent means may be used for this purpose.\n.11\nNo relaxation from the requirements for damage stability may be considered by the Administration of the flag State unless it is shown that the intact metacentric height in any service condition necessary to meet these requirements is excessive for the service intended.\n.12\nRelaxations from the requirements for damage stability shall be permitted only in exceptional cases and subject to the condition that the Administration of the flag State is to be satisfied that the proportions, arrangements and other characteristics of the ship are the most favourable to stability after damage which can practically and reasonably be adopted in the particular circumstances.\n8-1   Stability of ro-ro passenger ships in damaged conditions (R 8-1)\nEXISTING CLASS B RO-RO PASSENGER SHIPS:\n.1\nExisting class B ro-ro passenger ships shall comply with Regulation 8 not later than the date of the first periodical survey after the date of compliance prescribed below, according to the value of A/Amax as defined in the Annex of the Calculation Procedure to Assess the Survivability Characteristics of Existing Ro-Ro Passenger Ships when Using a Simplified Method Based Upon Resolution A.265 (VIII), developed by the Maritime Safety Committee at its 59th session in June 1991 (MSC/Circ. 574):\nValue of A/Amax\nDate of compliance\nless than 85 %\n1 October 1998\n85 % or more but less than 90 %\n1 October 2000\n90 % or more but less than 95 %\n1 October 2002\n95 % or more but less than 97,5 %\n1 October 2004\n97,5 % or more\n1 October 2005\n8-2   Special requirements for ro-ro passenger ships carrying 400 persons or more (R 8-2)\nNEW CLASS B, C AND D AND EXISTING CLASS B RO-RO PASSENGER SHIPS:\nNotwithstanding the provisions of Regulation II-1/B/8 and II-1/B/8-1:\n.1\nnew ro-ro passenger ships certified to carry 400 persons or more shall comply with the provisions of paragraph .2.3 of Regulation II-1/B/8, assuming the damage applied anywhere within the ship's length L; and\n.2\nexisting ro-ro passenger ships certified to carry 400 persons or more shall comply with the requirements of paragraph .1 not later than the date of the first periodical survey after the date of compliance prescribed in subparagraph .2.1, .2.2 or .2.3 which occurs the latest:\n.2.1\nValue of A/Amax\nDate of compliance\nless than 85 %\n1 October 1998\n85 % or more but less than 90 %\n1 October 2000\n90 % or more but less than 95 %\n1 October 2002\n95 % or more but less than 97,5 %\n1 October 2004\n97,5 % or more\n1 October 2010\n.2.2\nNumber of persons permitted to be carried:\n1 500 or more\n1 October 2002\n1 000 or more but less than 1 500\n1 October 2006\n600 or more but less than 1 000\n1 October 2008\n400 or more but less than 600\n1 October 2010\n.2.3\nAge of the ship equal or greater than 20 years:\nwhere the age of the ship means the time counted from the date on which the keel was laid or the date on which it was at a similar stage of construction or from the date on which the ship was converted to a ro-ro passenger ship.\n8-3   Special requirements for passenger ships, other than ro-ro passenger ships, carrying 400 persons or more\nCLASS B, C AND D SHIPS CONSTRUCTED ON OR AFTER 1 JANUARY 2003, OTHER THAN RO-RO PASSENGER SHIPS.\nNotwithstanding the provisions of Regulation II-1/B/8 passenger ships, other than ro-ro passenger ships, certified to carry more than 400 persons shall comply with the provisions of paragraphs 2.3 and 2.6 of Regulation II-1/B/8, assuming the damage applied anywhere within the ship's length L.\n9   Peak and machinery space bulkheads (R 10)\nNEW CLASS B, C AND D AND EXISTING CLASS B SHIPS:\n.1\nA forepeak or collision bulkhead shall be fitted which shall be watertight up to the bulkhead deck. This bulkhead shall be located at a distance from the forward perpendicular of not less than 5 % of the length of the ship and not more than 3 metres plus 5 % of the length of the ship.\n.2\nWhere any part of the ship below the waterline extends forward of the forward perpendicular, e. g. a bulbous bow, the distances stipulated in paragraph .1 shall be measured from a point either:\n.1\nat the mid-length of such extension; or\n.2\nat a distance 1,5 % of the length of the ship forward of the forward perpendicular; or\n.3\nat a distance 3 metres forward of the forward perpendicular,\nwhichever gives the smallest measurement.\n.3\nWhere a long forward superstructure is fitted, the forepeak or collision bulkhead shall be extended weathertight to the next full deck above the bulkhead deck. The extension shall be so arranged as to preclude the possibility of the bow door causing damage to it in the case of damage to, or detachment of, a bow door.\n.4\nThe extension required in paragraph .3 need not be fitted directly above the bulkhead below provided all parts of the extension are not located forward of the forward limit specified in paragraph .1 or in paragraph .2.\nHowever, in existing class B ships:\n.1\nwhere a sloping loading ramp forms part of the extension of the collision bulkhead above the bulkhead deck, the part of the ramp which is more than 2,3 metres above the bulkhead deck may extend no more than 1,0 metre forward of the forward limits specified in paragraphs .1 and .2;\n.2\nwhere the existing ramp does not comply with the requirements for acceptance as an extension to the collision bulkhead and the position of the ramp prevents the siting of such extension within the limits specified in paragraph .1 or paragraph .2, the extension may be sited within a limited distance aft of the aft limit specified in paragraph .1 or paragraph .2. The limited distance aft should be no more than is necessary to ensure non-interference with the ramp. The extension to the collision bulkhead shall open forward and comply with the requirements of paragraph .3 and shall be so arranged as to preclude the possibility of the ramp causing damage to it in the case of damage to, or detachment of, the ramp.\n.5\nRamps not meeting the above requirements shall be disregarded as an extension to the collision bulkhead.\n.6\nIn existing class B ships, the requirements of paragraph .3 and .4 apply as from the date of the first periodical survey after 1 July 1998.\n.7\nAn afterpeak bulkhead, and bulkheads dividing the machinery space, from the cargo and passenger spaces forward and aft, shall also be fitted and made watertight up to the bulkhead deck. The afterpeak bulkhead may, however, be stepped below the bulkhead deck, provided the degree of safety of the ship as regards subdivision is not thereby diminished.\n.8\nIn all cases stern tubes shall be enclosed in watertight spaces. The stern gland shall be situated in a watertight shaft tunnel or other watertight space separate from the stern tube compartment and of such volume that, if flooded by leakage through the stern gland, the margin line will not be submerged.\n10   Double bottoms (R 12)\nNEW CLASS B, C AND D AND EXISTING CLASS B SHIPS, AND NEW SHIPS CONSTRUCTED ON OR AFTER 1 JANUARY 2003 WITH A LENGTH OF 24 METRES AND ABOVE.\n.1\nIn new class B, C and D and existing class B ships, and new ships constructed on or after 1 January 2003 with a length of 24 metres and above, a double bottom shall be fitted extending from the forepeak bulkhead to the afterpeak bulkhead as far as this is practicable and compatible with the design and proper working of the ship.\n.1\nIn ships of 50 metres and upwards but less than 61 metres in length, a double bottom shall be fitted at least from the machinery space to the forepeak bulkhead, or as near thereto as practicable.\n.2\nIn ships of 61 metres and upwards but less than 76 metres in length, a double bottom shall be fitted at least outside the machinery space and shall extend to the fore and after peak bulkheads or as near thereto as practicable.\n.3\nIn ships of 76 metres in length and upwards, a double bottom shall be fitted amidships and shall extend to the fore and after peak bulkhead or as near as practicable.\n.2\nWhere a double bottom is required to be fitted its depth shall comply with the standards of a recognised organisation and the inner bottom shall be continued out to the ship's sides in such a manner as to protect the bottom to the turn of the bilge. Such protection will be deemed satisfactory if the line of intersection of the outer edge of the margin plate with the bilge plating is not lower at any part than a horizontal plane passing through the point of intersection with the frame line amidships of a transverse diagonal line inclined at 25 ° to the base line and cutting it at a point one half of the ship's moulded breadth from the middle line.\n.3\nSmall wells constructed in the double bottom in connection with drainage arrangements of holds, etc., shall not extend downwards more than necessary. The depth of the well shall in no case be more than the depth less 460 mm of the double bottom at the centreline, nor shall the well extend below the horizontal plane referred to in paragraph .2. A well extending to the outer bottom is, however, permitted at the after end of the shaft tunnel. Other wells (e.g. for lubricating oil under main engines) may be permitted by the Administration of the flag State if satisfied that the arrangements give protection equivalent to that afforded by a double bottom complying with this regulation.\n.4\nA double bottom need not be fitted in way of watertight compartments of moderate size used exclusively for the carriage of liquids, provided the safety of the ship, in the event of bottom or side damage, is not, in the opinion of the Administration of the flag State, thereby impaired.\n.5\nNotwithstanding paragraph .1 of this Regulation 10, the Administration of the flag State may permit a double bottom to be dispensed with in any part of the ship which is subdivided by a factor not exceeding 0,5, if satisfied that the fitting of a double bottom in that part would not be compatible with the design and proper working of the ship.\n11   Assigning, marking and recording of subdivision load lines (R 13)\nNEW CLASS B, C AND D AND EXISTING CLASS B SHIPS:\n.1\nIn order that the required degree of subdivision shall be maintained, a load line corresponding to the approved subdivision draught shall be assigned and marked on the ship's sides amidships. A ship having spaces which are specially adapted for the accommodation of passengers and the carriage of cargo alternatively may, if owners desire, have one or more additional load lines assigned and marked to correspond with the subdivision draughts which the Administration of the flag State may approve for alternative service conditions.\n.2\nThe subdivision load lines assigned and marked shall be recorded in the Passenger Ship Safety Certificate, and shall be identified by the notation C.1 if there is only one subdivision load line.\nIf there is more than one subdivision load line, the alternative conditions shall be identified by the notations C.2, C.3, C.4 etc. (2).\n.3\nThe freeboard corresponding to each of these load lines shall be measured at the same position and from the same deck line as the freeboards determined in accordance with the International Convention on Load Lines in force.\n.4\nThe freeboard corresponding to each approved subdivision load line and the conditions of service for which it is approved shall be clearly indicated on the Passenger Ship Safety Certificate.\n.5\nIn no case shall any subdivision load line mark be placed above the deepest load line in salt water as determined by the strength of the ship or the International Convention on Load Lines in force.\n.6\nWhatever may be the position of the subdivision load line marks, a ship shall in no case be loaded so as to submerge the load line mark appropriate to the season and locality as determined in accordance with the International Convention on Load Lines in force.\n.7\nA ship shall in no case be so loaded that the subdivision load line mark appropriate to the particular voyage and condition of service is submerged.\n12   Construction and initial testing of watertight bulkheads, etc. (R 14)\nNEW CLASS B, C AND D AND EXISTING CLASS B SHIPS:\n.1\nEach watertight subdivision bulkhead, whether transverse or longitudinal, shall be constructed in such a manner that it shall be capable of supporting, with a proper margin of resistance, the pressure due to the maximum head of water which it might have to sustain in the event of damage to the ship but at least the pressure due to a head of water up to the margin line. The construction of these bulkheads shall be in accordance with the standards of a recognised organisation.\n.2.1\nSteps and recesses in bulkheads shall be watertight and as strong as the bulkhead at the place where each occurs.\n.2.2\nWhere frames or beams pass through a watertight deck or bulkhead, such deck or bulkhead shall be made structurally watertight without the use of wood or cement.\n.3\nTesting main compartments by filling them with water is not compulsory. When testing by filling with water is not carried out, a hose test shall be carried out where practicable. This test shall be carried out in the most advanced stage of the fitting-out of the ship. Where a hose test is not practicable because of possible damage to machinery, electrical equipment insulation or out fitting items, it may be replaced by a careful visual examination of welded connections, supported where deemed necessary by means such as a dye penetrant test or ultrasonic leak test or an equivalent test. In any case, a thorough inspection of the watertight bulkheads shall be carried out.\n.4\nThe forepeak, double bottoms (including duct keels) and inner skins shall be tested with water to a head corresponding to the requirements of paragraph .1 of this Regulation 12.\n.5\nTanks which are intended to hold liquids, and which form part of the subdivision of the ship, shall be tested for tightness with water to a head up to the deepest subdivision load line or to a head corresponding to two thirds of the depth from the top of keel to the margin line in way of the tanks, whichever is the greater, provided that in no case shall the test head be less than 0,9 metres above the top of the tank; if testing by water is impracticable, air leak testing while the tanks are subjected to an air pressure of not more than 0,14 bar may be accepted.\n.6\nThe tests referred to in paragraphs .4 and .5 are for the purpose of ensuring that the subdivision structural arrangements are watertight and are not to be regarded as a test of the fitness of any compartment for the storage of oil fuel or for other special purposes for which a test of a superior character may be required depending on the height to which the liquid has access in the tank or its connections.\n13   Openings in watertight bulkheads (R 15)\nNEW CLASS B, C AND D AND EXISTING CLASS B SHIPS:\n.1   The number of openings in watertight bulkheads shall be reduced to the minimum compatible with the design and proper working of the ship; satisfactory means shall be provided for closing these openings.\n.2.1   Where pipes, scuppers, electrical cables, etc., are carried through watertight subdivision bulkheads, arrangements shall be made to ensure the watertight integrity of the bulkheads.\n.2.2   Valves not forming part of a piping system shall not be permitted in watertight subdivision bulkheads.\n.2.3   Lead or other heat-sensitive materials shall not be used in systems which penetrate watertight subdivision bulkheads, where deterioration of such systems in the event of fire would impair the watertight integrity of the bulkheads.\n.3.1   No doors, manholes, or access openings are permitted:\n.1\nin the collision bulkhead below the margin line;\n.2\nin watertight transverse bulkheads dividing a cargo space from an adjoining cargo space, except as provided for in paragraph .10.1 of this Regulation 13 and in Regulation 14.\n.3.2   Except as provided in paragraph .3.3, the collision bulkhead may be pierced below the margin line by no more than one pipe for dealing with fluid in the fore peak tank, provided that the pipe is fitted with a screw-down valve capable of being operated from above the bulkhead deck, the valve chest being secured inside the fore peak to the collision bulkhead. However, the fitting of this valve on the afterside of the collision bulkhead may be accepted provided that the valve is readily accessible under all service conditions and the space in which it is located is not a cargo space.\n.3.3   If the fore peak is divided to hold two different kinds of liquids, the collision bulkhead may be pierced below the margin line by two pipes each of which is fitted as required by paragraph .3.1, provided that there is no practical alternative to the fitting of such a second pipe and that, having regard to the additional subdivision provided in the forepeak, the safety of the ship is maintained.\n.4   Within spaces containing the main and auxiliary propulsion machinery including boilers serving the needs of propulsion not more than one door apart from the doors to shaft tunnels may be fitted in each main transverse bulkhead. Where two or more shafts are fitted the tunnels shall be connected by an intercommunicating passage. There shall be only one door between the machinery space and the tunnel spaces where two shafts are fitted and only two doors where there are more than two shafts. All these doors shall be of the sliding type and shall be so located as to have their sills as high as practicable.

It shall be possible to open and close the door by hand at the door itself from either side, and in addition, close the door from an accessible position above the bulkhead deck with an all-round crank motion or some other movement providing the same degree of safety acceptable to the Administration of the flag State. Direction of rotation or other movement is to be clearly indicated on all operating positions. The time necessary for the complete closure of the door, when operated by hand gear, shall not exceed 90 seconds with the ship in upright position;\n.5\nshall be provided with controls for opening and closing the door by power from both sides of the door and also for closing the door by power from the central operating console at the navigating bridge;\n.6\nshall be provided with an audible alarm, distinct from any other alarm in the area, which will sound whenever the door is closed remotely by power and which shall sound for at least 5 seconds but no more than 10 seconds before the door begins to move and shall continue sounding until the door is completely closed. In the case of remote hand operation it is sufficient for the audible alarm to sound only when the door is moving. Additionally, in passenger areas and areas of high ambient noise, the Administration of the flag State may require the audible alarm to be supplemented by an intermittent visual signal at the door; and\n.7\nshall have an approximately uniform rate of closure under power. The closure time, from the time the door begins to move to the time it reaches the completely closed position, shall in no case be less than 20 seconds and no more than 40 seconds with the ship in upright position.\n.7.2   The electrical power required for power-operated sliding watertight doors shall be supplied from the emergency switchboard either directly or by a dedicated distribution board situated above the bulkhead deck; the associated control, indication and alarm circuits shall be supplied from the emergency switchboard either directly or by a dedicated distribution board situated above the bulkhead deck and be capable of being automatically supplied by the transitional source of emergency electrical power in the event of failure of either the main or emergency source of electrical power.\n.7.3   Power-operated sliding watertight doors shall have either:\n.1\na centralised hydraulic system with two independent power sources each consisting of a motor and pump capable of simultaneously closing all doors. In addition, there shall be for the whole installation hydraulic accumulators of sufficient capacity to operate all the doors at least three times, i. e. closed-open-closed, against an adverse list of 15 °. This operating cycle shall be capable of being carried out when the accumulator is at the pump cut-in pressure. The fluid used shall be chosen considering the temperature liable to be encountered by the installation during its service. The power-operating system shall be designed to minimise the possibility of having a single failure in the hydraulic piping adversely affect the operation of more than one door. The hydraulic system shall be provided with a low-level alarm for hydraulic fluid reservoirs serving the power-operated system and a low gas pressure alarm or other effective means of monitoring loss of stored energy in hydraulic accumulators. These alarms are to be audible and visual and shall be situated on the central operating console at the navigating bridge; or\n.2\nan independent hydraulic system for each door with each power source consisting of a motor and pump capable of opening and closing the door. In addition, there shall be a hydraulic accumulator of sufficient capacity to operate the door at least three times, i. e. closed-open-closed, against an adverse list of 15 °. This operating cycle shall be capable of being carried out when the accumulators at the pump cut-in pressure. The fluid used shall be chosen considering the temperatures liable to be encountered by the installation during its service. A low gas pressure group alarm or other effective means of monitoring loss of stored energy in hydraulic accumulators shall be provided at the central operating console on the navigating bridge. Loss of stored energy indication at each local operating position shall also be provided; or\n.3\nan independent electrical system and motor for each door with each power source consisting of a motor capable of opening and closing the door.

A single failure in the electric or hydraulic power-operated systems excluding the hydraulic actuator shall not prevent the hand operation of any door.\n.7.4   Control handles shall be provided at each side of the bulkhead at a minimum height of 1,6 metres above the floor and shall be so arranged as to enable persons passing through the doorway to hold both handles in the open position without being able to set the power closing mechanism in operation accidentally. The direction of movement of the handles in opening and closing the door shall be in the direction of door movement and shall be clearly indicated. Hydraulic control handles for watertight doors in accommodation spaces shall, if only one action is required to start the door's closing movement, be so placed that children cannot operate them, e.g. behind panel doors with bolts placed at least 170 cm above deck level.\nNEW CLASS B, C AND D SHIPS AND EXISTING CLASS B SHIPS OF 24 METRES IN LENGTH AND OVER:\nOn both sides of the doors there shall be a plate with instructions as to how the door system is to be operated. On both sides of each door there shall also be a plate with text or pictures warning of the danger of remaining in the door opening when the door has begun its closing movement. These plates shall be made of durable material, and shall be firmly fixed. The text on the instruction or warning plate shall include information about the closing time of the door in question.\nNEW CLASS B, C AND D SHIPS OF 24 METRES IN LENGTH AND OVER:\n.7.5   As far as practicable, electrical equipment and components for watertight doors shall be situated above the bulkhead deck and outside hazardous areas and spaces.\n.7.6   The enclosures of electrical components necessarily situated below the bulkhead deck shall provide suitable protection against the ingress of water.\n.7.7   Electric power, control, indication and alarm circuits shall be protected against fault in such a way that a failure in one door circuit will not cause a failure in any other door circuit. Short circuits or other faults in the alarm or indicator circuits of a door shall not result in a loss of power operation of that door. Arrangements shall be such that leakage of water into the electrical equipment located below the bulkhead deck will not cause the door to open.\n.7.8   A single electrical failure in the power-operating or control system of a power-operated sliding watertight door shall not result in a closed door opening. Availability of the power supply should be continuously monitored at a point in the electrical circuit as near as practicable to each of the motors required by paragraph .7.3. Loss of any such power supply should activate an audible and visual alarm at the central operating console at the navigating bridge.\n.8.1   The central operating console at the navigating bridge shall have a ‘master mode’ switch with two modes of control: a ‘local control’ mode which shall allow any door to be locally opened and locally closed after use without automatic closure, and a ‘doors closed’ mode which shall automatically close any doors that are open. The ‘doors closed’ mode shall permit doors to be opened locally and shall automatically re-close the door upon release of the local control mechanism. The ‘master mode’ switch shall normally be in the ‘local control’ mode. The ‘door closed’ mode shall only be used in an emergency or for testing purposes.\n.8.2   The central operating console at the navigating bridge shall be provided with a diagram showing the location of each door, with visual indicators to show whether each door is open or closed. A red light shall indicate a door is fully open and a green light shall indicate a door is fully closed. When the door is closed remotely the red light shall indicate the intermediate position by flashing. The indicating circuit shall be independent of the control circuit for each door.\n.8.3   It shall not be possible to open any door remotely from the central control position.\nNEW CLASS B, C AND D AND EXISTING CLASS B SHIPS:\n.9.1   All watertight doors shall be kept closed during navigation except that they may be opened during navigation as specified in paragraphs .9.2 and .9.3. Watertight doors of width of more than 1,2 metres permitted by paragraph .11 may only be opened in the circumstances detailed in that paragraph. Any door which is opened in accordance with this paragraph shall be ready to be immediately closed.\n.9.2   A watertight door may be opened during navigation to permit the passage of passengers or crew, or when work in the immediate vicinity of the door necessitates it being opened. The door must be immediately closed when transit through the door is complete or when the task which necessitated it being open is finished.\n.9.3   Certain watertight doors may be permitted to remain open during navigation only if considered absolutely necessary; that is, being open is determined essential to the safe and effective operation of the ship's machinery or to permit passengers normally unrestricted access throughout the passenger area. Such determination shall be made by the Administration of the flag State only after careful consideration of the impact on ship operations and survivability. A watertight door permitted to remain thus open shall be clearly indicated in the ship's stability information and shall always be ready to be immediately closed.\nNEW CLASS B, C AND D SHIPS:\n.10.1   If the Administration of the flag State is satisfied that such doors are essential, watertight doors of satisfactory construction may be fitted in watertight bulkheads dividing cargo between deck spaces. Such doors may be hinged, rolling or sliding doors but shall not be remotely controlled. They shall be fitted at the highest level and as far from the shell plating as practicable, but in no case shall the outboard vertical edges be situated at a distance from the shell plating which is less than one fifth of the breadth of the ship, such distance being measured at right angles to the centreline at the level of the deepest subdivision load line.\n.10.2   Such doors shall be closed before the voyage commences and shall be kept closed during navigation; the time of opening such doors in port and of closing them before the ship leaves port shall be entered in the logbook. Should any of the doors be accessible during the voyage, they shall be fitted with a device which prevents unauthorised opening. When it is proposed to fit such doors, the number and the arrangements shall receive the special consideration of the Administration of the flag State.\n.11   Portable plates on bulkheads shall not be permitted except in machinery spaces. Such plates shall always be in place before the ship leaves port, and shall not be removed during navigation except in case of urgent necessity at the discretion of the master. The Administration of the flag State may permit not more than one power-operated sliding watertight door in each main transverse bulkhead larger than those specified in paragraph .7.1.2 to be substituted for these portable plates, provided these doors are closed before the ship leaves the port and remain closed during navigation except in case of urgent necessity at the discretion of the master. These doors need not meet the requirements of paragraph .7.1.4 regarding complete closure by hand-operated gear in 90 seconds. The time of opening and closing these doors, whether the ship is at sea or in port, shall be recorded in the logbook.\n14   Ships carrying goods vehicles and accompanying personnel (R 16)\nNEW CLASS B, C AND D AND EXISTING CLASS B SHIPS:\n.1\nThis regulation applies to passenger ships designed or adapted for the carriage of goods vehicles and accompanying personnel.\n.2\nIf in such a ship the total number of passengers, including persons accompanying vehicles, does not exceed N = 12 + A/25, where A = total deck area (square metres) of spaces available for the stowage of goods vehicles and where the clear height at the stowage position and at the entrance to such spaces is not less than 4 metres, the provisions of Regulation 13, paragraph .10, in respect of watertight doors apply except that the doors may be fitted at any level in watertight bulkheads dividing cargo spaces. Additionally, indicators are required on the navigating bridge to show automatically when each door is closed and all door fastenings are secured.\n.3\nWhen applying the provisions of this chapter to such a ship, N shall be taken as the maximum number of passengers for which the ship may be certified in accordance with this regulation.\n15   Openings in the shell plating below the margin line (R 17)\nNEW CLASS B, C AND D AND EXISTING CLASS B SHIPS:\n.1   The number of openings in the shell plating shall be reduced to the minimum compatible with the design and proper working of the ship.\n.2.1   The arrangement and efficiency of the means for closing any opening in the shell plating shall be consistent with its intended purpose and the position in which it is fitted.\n.2.2   Subject to the requirements of the International Convention on Load Lines in force, no side scuttles shall be fitted in such a position that its sill is below a line drawn parallel to the bulkhead deck at side and having its lowest point 2,5 % of the breadth of the ship above the deepest subdivision load line, or 500 mm, whichever is the greater.\n.2.3   All side scuttles the sills of which are below the margin line shall be of such construction as will effectively prevent any person opening them without the consent of the master of the ship.\n.2.4   Where in a between-deck, the sills of any of the sidescuttles referred to in paragraph .2.3 are below a line drawn parallel to the bulkhead deck at side and having its lowest point 1,4 metres plus 2,5 % of the breadth of the ship above the water when the ship departs from any port, all the sidescuttles in that between-deck shall be closed watertight and locked before the ship leaves port, and they shall not be opened before the ship arrives at the next port. In the application of this paragraph the appropriate allowance for fresh water may be made when applicable.\n.2.5   Sidescuttles and their deadlights which will not be accessible during navigation shall be closed and secured before the ship leaves port.\n.3   The number of scuppers, sanitary discharges and other similar openings in the shell plating shall be reduced to the minimum either by making each discharge serve for as many as possible of the sanitary and other pipes, or in any other satisfactory manner.\n.4   All inlets and discharges in the shell plating shall be fitted with efficient and accessible arrangements for preventing the accidental admission of water into the ship.\n.4.1   Subject to the requirements of the International Convention on Load Lines in force, and except as provided in paragraph .5, each separate discharge led through the shell plating from spaces below the margin line shall be provided with either one automatic non-return valve fitted with a positive means of closing it from above the bulkhead deck or with two automatic non-return valves without positive means of closing, provided that the inboard valve is situated above the deepest subdivision load line and is always accessible for examination under service conditions.\nWhere a valve with positive means of closing is fitted, the operating position above the bulkhead deck shall always be readily accessible and means shall be provided for indicating whether the valve is open or closed.\n.4.2   The requirements of the International Convention on Load Lines in force shall apply to discharges led through the shell plating from spaces above the margin line.\n.5   Machinery space main and auxiliary sea inlets and discharges in connection with the operation of machinery shall be fitted with readily accessible valves between the pipes and the shell plating or between the pipes and fabricated boxes attached to the shell plating. The valves may be controlled locally and shall be provided with indicators showing whether they are open or closed.\nNEW CLASS B, C AND D SHIPS:\n.1\nThe handwheels or handles of the sea cocks shall be easily accessible for operation. All valves which are used as seacocks shall close by clockwise movement of their handwheels.\n.2\nDischarge taps or valves on the side of the ship for blow-off water from boilers shall be located in easily accessible locations and not beneath deck plating.

For example, in category (12) a bulkhead need not be required between a galley and its annexed pantries provided the pantry bulkhead and decks maintain the integrity of the galley boundaries. A bulkhead is, however, required between a galley and a machinery space even though both spaces are in category (12).\n(6)  The ship's side, to the waterline in the lightest seagoing condition, superstructure and deckhouse sides situated below and adjacent to the life-rafts and evacuation slides may be reduced to A-30.\n(7)  Where public toilets are installed completely within the stairway enclosure, the public toilet bulkhead within the stairway enclosure can be of ‘B’ class integrity.\n(8)  Where spaces of categories 6, 7, 8 and 9 are located completely within the outer perimeter of the assembly station, the bulkheads of these spaces are allowed to be of ‘B-0’ class integrity. Control positions for audio, video and light installations may be considered as part of the assembly station.\n(9)  For clarification as to which applies, see Regulations 3 and 8.\n(10)  Where spaces are of the same numerical category and superscript b appears, a bulkhead or deck of the rating shown in the tables is only required when the adjacent spaces are for a different purpose, e.g. in category (9). A galley next to a galley does not require a bulkhead but a galley next to a paint room requires an ‘A-0’ bulkhead.\n(11)  Bulkheads separating the wheelhouse and chartroom from each other may be ‘B-0’ rating.\n(12)  See paragraph .2.3 and .2.4 of this Regulation.\n(13)  For the application of Regulation 2.1.2, ‘B-0’ and ‘C’, where appearing in table 5.1, shall be read as ‘A-0’.\n(14)  Fire insulation need not be fitted if the machinery space in category (7) has little or no fire risk.\n(15)  Where an asterisk appears in the tables, the division is required to be of steel or other equivalent material but is not required to be of ‘A’ class standard.\nIn ships, which are constructed on or after 1 January 2003, however, where a deck, except in a category (10) space, is penetrated for the passage of electric cables, pipes and ventilation ducts, such penetration shall be made tight to prevent the passage of flame and smoke. Divisions between control stations (emergency generators) and open decks may have air intake openings without means for closure, unless a fixed gas fire-fighting system is fitted.\nFor the application of Regulation 2.1.2. an asterisk, where appearing in table 5.2, except for categories (8) and (10), shall be read as ‘A-0’.\n(16)  Survival craft may be either lifeboats complying with section 4.5 or 4.6 or 4.7 of the LSA Code or life-rafts complying with the requirements of section 4.1 of the LSA Code and of either section 4.2 or 4.3 of the LSA Code. In addition, life-rafts on ro-ro passenger ships have also to comply with the requirements of Regulation III/5-1.2.\nWhen justified by the sheltered nature of the voyages and/or the favourable climatic conditions of the area of operation, the Administration of the flag State may accept, if this is not rejected by the host Member State:\n(a)\nopen reversible inflatable life-rafts not complying with the section 4.2 or 4.3 of the LSA Code provided that such life-rafts entirely comply with the requirements of Annex 10 of the High-Speed Craft Code;\n(b)\nlife-rafts not complying with the requirements of paragraphs 4.2.2.2.1 and 4.2.2.2.2 of the LSA Code on the insulation against cold of the floor of the life-raft.\nSurvival craft for existing B, C and D ships shall comply with the relevant regulations of the 1974 SOLAS Convention, as amended, for existing ships as amended at the date of adoption of this Directive. A marine evacuation system or systems complying with section 6.2 of the LSA Code may be substituted for the equivalent capacity of life-rafts and launching appliances required by the table.\n(17)  Survival craft shall, as far as practicable, be equally distributed on each side of the ship.\n(18)  The total number of survival craft shall be in accordance with the percentage mentioned in the table above and the aggregate capacity of a combination of survival craft and additional life-rafts shall be 110 % of the total number of persons (N) the ship is certified to carry. Sufficient number of survival craft has to be carried in order to ensure that in the event of any one survival craft being lost or rendered unserviceable, the remaining survival craft can accommodate the total number of persons the ship is certified to carry.\n(19)  The number of lifeboats and/or rescue boats, shall be sufficient to ensure that in providing for abandonment by the total number of persons the ship is certified to carry, no more than nine life-rafts need to be marshalled by each lifeboat or rescueboat.\n(20)  Rescue boats shall be served by their own launching appliances capable of launching and recovery.\nIf a rescue boat complies with the requirements of section 4.5 or 4.6 of the LSA Code, it may be included in the capacity of the survival craft specified in the table above.\nAt least one of the rescue boats on ro-ro passenger ships shall be a fast rescue boat complying with the requirements of Regulation III/5-1.3.\nWhen the Administration of the flag State considers that the installation of a rescue boat on board of a ship is physically impossible, such ship may be exempted from carrying a rescueboat, provided the ship meets all of the following requirements:\n(a)\nthe ship is arranged to allow a helpless person to be recovered from the water;\n(b)\nrecovery of the helpless person can be observed from the navigating bridge; and\n(c)\nthe ship is sufficiently manoeuvrable to close and recover persons in the worst intended conditions\n(21)  At least one lifebuoy on each side shall be equipped with a buoyant lifeline equal in length to not less than twice the height at which it is stowed above the waterline in the lightest seagoing condition or 30 metres, whichever is the greater.\nTwo lifebuoys shall be equipped with a self-activating smoke signal and a self-activating light; they shall be capable of quick release from the navigation bridge. The remainder of the lifebuoys shall be equipped with self-igniting lights, in compliance with the provisions of paragraph 2.1.2 of the LSA Code.\n(22)  Distress flares, complying with the requirements of section 3.1 of the LSA Code shall be stowed on the navigation bridge or steering position.\n(23)  Life jackets on board ro-ro passenger ships shall comply with the requirements of Regulation III/5-1.5.\n(24)  An inflatable life jacket shall be provided for each person that has to carry out work on board in exposed areas. These inflatable life jackets may be included in the total number of life jackets required by this Directive.\nANNEX II\nFORM OF PASSENGER SHIP SAFETY CERTIFICATE\nPASSENGER SHIP SAFETY CERTIFICATE\nANNEX III\nGUIDELINES FOR SAFETY REQUIREMENTS FOR PASSENGER SHIPS AND HIGH-SPEED PASSENGER CRAFT FOR PERSONS WITH REDUCED MOBILITY\n(as referred to in Article 8)\nIn applying the guidelines of this Annex, Member States shall follow the IMO circular MSC/735 of 24 June 1996 entitled ‘Recommendation on the design and operation of passenger ships to respond to elderly and disabled persons' needs’.\n1.   ACCESS TO THE SHIP\nThe ships should be constructed and equipped in such a way that a person with reduced mobility can embark and disembark easily and safely, and can be ensured access between decks, either unassisted or by means of ramps, elevators or lifts. Directions to such access should be posted at the other accesses to the ship and at other appropriate locations throughout the ship.\n2.

Directive 2009/45/EC thus repeals and replaces Directive 98/18/EC.\nIn 2017, following a review of the directive under the regulatory fitness and performance programme initiative (known as REFIT), Directive (EU) 2017/2108 was adopted. It amends Directive 2009/45/EC and clarifies and simplifies the rules and standards for passenger ships.\nKEY POINTS\nScope\nThe legislation applies to passenger vessels made of steel or an equivalent material and to high-speed passenger craft.\nPassenger vessel classification and areas of operation\nPassenger vessels are divided into 4 classes (A, B, C and D) according to the sea areas they may operate in.\nEU countries publish the list of sea areas and classes of vessel concerned, including any restricted periods, in a publicly available database.\nTechnical safety requirements\nThe legislation sets out detailed technical requirements on safety measures vessels must respect, such as:\nconstruction;\nstability;\nmachinery;\nelectrics;\nfire protection and life-saving.\nNational authorities may have additional safety requirements if they consider that specific local circumstances merit them.\nInspections and safety certificates\nEach passenger vessel registered in an EU country is inspected before it enters into service and at least once a year after that.\nAll passenger vessels that meet the safety standards are given an annual passenger ship safety certificate.\nNational authorities must apply penalties that are ‘effective, proportionate and dissuasive’ for any breach of the safety standards.\nExclusions\nThe legislation does not apply to certain types of vessels, such as:\nwarships;\nprimitive wooden ships;\noriginal or replica historical passenger ships;\nyachts with fewer than 12 passengers;\nvessels used exclusively in ports.\nAmending Directive (EU) 2017/2108\nThis amending directive:\nexcludes from the scope of Directive 2009/45/EC all existing and new passenger craft shorter than 24 metres — which will be subject to nationally defined safety standards (in May 2018, the European Commission presented a proposal to coordinate safety rules for small passenger ships of less than 24 metres in length)offshore maintenance vessels carrying workers to and from offshore installations and ship-carried tenders used to transfer more than 12 individuals from a passenger ship to the shore and backpleasure craft, and traditional boats and sailboats if they are equipped with additional mechanical propulsion;\nsimplifies the definitions of maritime zones C and D;\nclassifies passenger ships (A, B, C and D) depending on the sea area in which they can operate;\nrequires ships built in aluminum before 20 December 2017 to comply with its requirements by 22 December 2025. However, if an EU country has more than 60 aluminium-alloy passenger ships flying its flag on20 December 2017 it may exempt aluminium passenger vessels of classes B, C and D from the directive for 12 years after that date, provided that their safety levels are not compromised;\nrequires all new or existing passenger ships to carry a passenger ship safety certificate.\nFROM WHEN DOES THE DIRECTIVE APPLY?\n              \nDirective 2009/45/EC has applied since 15 July 2009.

These standards have been considerably strengthened since the ferry Estonia sank in the Baltic Sea in 1994.\nDirective 2009/45/EC is the most extensive EU legislative instrument in the area of passenger vessel safety. It is complemented by specific EU rules for roll-on/roll-off (ro-ro) passenger ships and high-speed craft, and the registration of persons on board ships.\nFor more information, see:\nSafety of passenger ships (European Commission).\nMAIN DOCUMENTS\n            \nDirective 2009/45/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 May 2009 on safety rules and standards for passenger ships (recast) (OJ L 163, 25.6.2009, pp. 1-140)\nSuccessive amendments to Directive 2009/45/EC have been incorporated into the original text.
