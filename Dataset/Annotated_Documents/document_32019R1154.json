{"celex_id": "32019R1154", "reference": "12.7.2019\nEN\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\nL 188/1\nREGULATION (EU) 2019/1154 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL\nof 20 June 2019\non a multiannual recovery plan for Mediterranean swordfish and amending Council Regulation (EC) No 1967/2006 and Regulation (EU) 2017/2107 of the European Parliament and of the Council\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 43(2) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee (1),\nActing in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure (2),\nWhereas:\n(1)\nThe objective of the Common Fisheries Policy (‘CFP’), as set out in Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council (3), is to ensure exploitation of marine biological resources that provides sustainable economic, environmental and social conditions.\n(2)\nThe Union is Party to the International Convention for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (‘the ICCAT Convention’).\n(3)\nAt the 2016 Annual Meeting of the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (‘ICCAT’) in Vilamoura, Portugal, the ICCAT Contracting Parties and Cooperating non-Contracting Parties, Entities or Fishing Entities recognised the need to address the alarming situation of swordfish (Xiphias gladius) in the Mediterranean Sea (‘Mediterranean swordfish’), which has been overfished over the last 30 years. To that end, including avoiding the collapse of the stock, and after analysing the scientific advice of the Standing Committee on Research and Statistics (SCRS), ICCAT adopted Recommendation 16-05 establishing a multiannual recovery plan for Mediterranean swordfish (‘ICCAT recovery plan’). In view of the fact that the current biology, structure and dynamic of the Mediterranean swordfish stock does not allow the achievement of levels of biomass capable of producing the maximum sustainable yield (MSY) in the short term, even if drastic and urgent management measures such as a total closure of the fishery were adopted, the ICCAT recovery plan is to cover the period 2017–2031. ICCAT Recommendation 16-05 entered into force on 12 June 2017 and is binding on the Union.\n(4)\nThe Union informed the ICCAT Secretariat by letter, in December 2016, that certain measures laid down in ICCAT Recommendation 16-05 were to enter into force in the Union in January 2017, in particular in relation to the closure period established from 1 January to 31 March, and the allocation of quotas for Mediterranean swordfish fisheries. All other measures laid down in ICCAT Recommendation 16-05, together with some of the measures already implemented, should be included in the recovery plan set out in this Regulation.\n(5)\nIn accordance with Article 29(2) of Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013, the positions of the Union in regional fisheries management organisations are to be based on the best available scientific advice so as to ensure that fishery resources are managed in accordance with the objectives of the CFP, in particular with the objective of progressively restoring and maintaining populations of fish stocks above biomass levels capable of producing MSY, even if in this particular case the date by which that objective has to be achieved is 2031, and with the objective of providing conditions for economically viable and competitive fishing capture and processing industry and land-based fishing related activity. At the same time account is taken of point (d) of Article 28(2) of Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013 which provides that a level playing field for Union operators vis-à-vis third-country operators is to be promoted.\n(6)\nThe ICCAT recovery plan takes into account the specificities of the different types of fishing gear and fishing techniques. When implementing the ICCAT recovery plan, the Union and Member States should endeavour to promote coastal fishing activities and the research on and use of fishing gear and techniques which are selective, so as to reduce by-catches of vulnerable species, and which have a reduced environmental impact, including gear and techniques used in traditional and artisanal fisheries, thereby contributing to a fair standard of living for local economies.\n(7)\nRegulation (EU) No 1380/2013 establishes the concept of minimum conservation reference sizes. In order to ensure consistency, the ICCAT concept of minimum sizes should be implemented into Union law as minimum conservation reference sizes.\n(8)\nPursuant to ICCAT Recommendation 16-05, Mediterranean swordfish that have been caught and are below minimum conservation reference size have to be discarded. The same applies to catches of Mediterranean swordfish exceeding the by-catch limits established by Member States in their annual fishing plans. For the purpose of the Union's compliance with its international obligations under ICCAT, Article 5a of Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/98 (4) provides for derogations from the landing obligation for Mediterranean swordfish in accordance with Article 15(2) of Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013. Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/98 implements certain provisions of ICCAT Recommendation 16-05 which lays down the obligation to discard Mediterranean swordfish for vessels that exceed their allocated quota or their maximum level of permitted by-catches. The scope of that Delegated Regulation includes vessels engaged in recreational fishing.\n(9)\nTaking into consideration that the recovery plan set out in this Regulation will implement ICCAT Recommendation 16-05, the provisions of Regulation (EU) 2017/2107 of the European Parliament and of the Council (5) concerning Mediterranean swordfish should be deleted.\n(10)\nFishing activities using driftnets have in the past undergone a rapid increase in terms of fishing effort and lack of sufficient selectivity. The uncontrolled expansion of those activities posed a serious risk for the target species and their use was prohibited for catching highly migratory fish, including swordfish, by Council Regulation (EC) No 1239/98 (6).\n(11)\nTo ensure compliance with the CFP, Union legislation has been adopted to establish a system of control, inspection and enforcement, which includes the fight against illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing. In particular, Council Regulation (EC) No 1224/2009 (7) establishes a Union system for control, inspection and enforcement with a global and integrated approach so as to ensure compliance with all the rules of the CFP. Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 404/2011 (8) lays down detailed rules for the implementation of Regulation (EC) No 1224/2009. Council Regulation (EC) No 1005/2008 (9) establishes a Community system to prevent, deter and eliminate IUU fishing. Those Regulations already include provisions that cover a number of the measures laid down in ICCAT Recommendation 16-05. It is therefore not necessary to include those provisions in this Regulation.\n(12)\nIn arrangements for the chartering of fishing vessels, the relationships between the owner, the charterer and the flag State are often unclear. Some operators engaging in IUU activities evade controls by abusing those arrangements. Chartering is prohibited by Regulation (EU) 2016/1627 of the European Parliament and of the Council (10) in the context of bluefin tuna fisheries. It is appropriate, as a preventive measure to protect a stock under recovery and for sake of consistency with Union law, to adopt a similar prohibition in the recovery plan set out in this Regulation.\n(13)\nUnion legislation should implement ICCAT recommendations in order to place Union and third country fishermen on an equal footing and to ensure that the rules can be accepted by all.\n(14)\nIn order to swiftly implement into Union law future ICCAT recommendations amending or supplementing the ICCAT recovery plan, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union should be delegated to the Commission in respect of amending the Annexes to this Regulation and certain provisions of this Regulation on deadlines for reporting information, time periods for closures, minimum conservation reference size, tolerance levels for incidental catches and by-catches, technical characteristics of fishing gear, percentage of quota uptake for the purpose of informing the Commission, as well as information to be provided on fishing vessels. It is of particular importance that the Commission carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level, and that those consultations be conducted in accordance with the principles laid down in the Interinstitutional Agreement of 13 April 2016 on Better Law-Making (11). In particular, to ensure equal participation in the preparation of delegated acts, the European Parliament and the Council receive all documents at the same time as Member States' experts, and their experts systematically have access to meetings of Commission expert groups dealing with the preparation of delegated acts.\n(15)\nIn order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of this Regulation, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission as regards the format for the annual report on the implementation of this Regulation submitted by the Member States. Those powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council (12).\n(16)\nThe delegated acts and implementing acts provided for in this Regulation should be without prejudice to the implementation of future ICCAT recommendations into Union law through the ordinary legislative procedure.\n(17)\nAnnex II to Council Regulation (EC) No 1967/2006 (13) allows for a maximum of 3 500 hooks that can be set or taken on board of vessels targeting swordfish, while ICCAT Recommendation 16-05 allows for a maximum of 2 500 hooks. In order to properly implement that recommendation into Union law it is necessary to amend Regulation (EC) No 1967/2006 accordingly.\n(18)\nSection 2 of Chapter III of Regulation (EU) 2017/2107 lays down certain technical and control measures as regards Mediterranean swordfish. The measures laid down in ICCAT Recommendation 16-05, which are implemented into Union law by this Regulation, are more restrictive or more precise to allow the recovery of the stock. Section 2 of Chapter III of Regulation (EU) 2017/2107 should therefore be deleted and replaced by the relevant measures laid down in this Regulation,\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nTITLE I\nGENERAL PROVISIONS\nArticle 1\nSubject matter\nThis Regulation lays down general rules for the implementation by the Union of a multiannual recovery plan for swordfish (Xiphias gladius) in the Mediterranean Sea (‘Mediterranean swordfish’) adopted by ICCAT, starting from 2017 and continuing until 2031.\nArticle 2\nScope\nThis Regulation applies to:\n(a)\nUnion fishing vessels, and Union vessels engaged in recreational fisheries, which:\n(i)\ncatch Mediterranean swordfish; or\n(ii)\ntranship or carry on board, including outside the ICCAT Convention area, Mediterranean swordfish;\n(b)\nthird country fishing vessels, and third country vessels engaged in recreational fisheries, which operate in Union waters and which catch Mediterranean swordfish;\n(c)\nthird country vessels which are inspected in Member States ports and which carry on board Mediterranean swordfish or fishery products originating from Mediterranean swordfish that have not been previously landed or transhipped at ports.\nArticle 3\nObjective\nBy way of derogation from Article 2(2) of Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013, the objective of this Regulation is to achieve a biomass of Mediterranean swordfish corresponding to MSY by 2031, with at least a 60 % probability of achieving that objective.\nArticle 4\nRelationship to other Union law\nThis Regulation applies in addition to the following Regulations or, where those Regulations so provide, by way of derogation therefrom:\n(a)\nRegulation (EC) No 1224/2009;\n(b)\nRegulation (EU) 2017/2403 of the European Parliament and of the Council (14);\n(c)\nRegulation (EU) 2017/2107.\nArticle 5\nDefinitions\nFor the purposes of this Regulation, the following definitions apply:\n(1)\n‘fishing vessel’ means any vessel equipped for commercial exploitation of marine biological resources;\n(2)\n‘Union fishing vessel’ means a fishing vessel flying the flag of a Member State and registered in the Union;\n(3)\n‘ICCAT Convention area’ means all waters of the Atlantic Ocean and adjacent seas;\n(4)\n‘Mediterranean Sea’ means maritime waters of the Mediterranean to the East of line 5°36′ West;\n(5)\n‘CPCs’ means Contracting Parties to the ICCAT Convention and Cooperating non-Contracting Parties, Entities or Fishing Entities;\n(6)\n‘fishing authorisation’ means an authorisation issued in respect of a Union fishing vessel entitling it to carry out specific fishing activities during a specified period, in a given area or for a given fishery under specific conditions;\n(7)\n‘fishing opportunity’ means a quantified legal entitlement to fish, expressed in terms of catches or fishing effort;\n(8)\n‘stock’ means a marine biological resource that occurs in a given management area;\n(9)\n‘fishery products’ means aquatic organisms resulting from any fishing activity or products derived therefrom;\n(10)\n‘discards’ means catches that are returned to the sea;\n(11)\n‘recreational fisheries’ means non-commercial fishing activities exploiting marine biological resources for recreation, tourism or sport;\n(12)\n‘vessel monitoring system data’ means data on the fishing vessel identification, geographical position, date, time, course and speed transmitted by satellite-tracking devices installed on board fishing vessels to the fisheries monitoring centre of the flag Member State;\n(13)\n‘landing’ means the initial unloading of any quantity of fisheries products from on board a fishing vessel to land;\n(14)\n‘transhipment’ means the unloading of all or any fisheries products on board a vessel to another vessel;\n(15)\n‘chartering’ means an arrangement by which a fishing vessel flying the flag of a Member State is contracted for a defined period by an operator in either another Member State or a third country without a change of flag;\n(16)\n‘longlines’ means a fishing gear which comprises a main line carrying numerous hooks on branch lines (snoods) of variable length and spacing depending on the target species;\n(17)\n‘hook’ means a bent, sharpened piece of steel wire;\n(18)\n‘rod and line’ means a fishing-line placed in a rod used by anglers and wound on a turning mechanism (reel) used to wind the line.\nTITLE II\nMANAGEMENT MEASURES, TECHNICAL CONSERVATION MEASURES AND CONTROL MEASURES\nCHAPTER 1\nManagement measures\nArticle 6\nFishing effort\n1.   Each Member State shall take the necessary measures to ensure that the fishing effort of fishing vessels flying its flag is commensurate with the fishing opportunities for Mediterranean swordfish available to that Member State.\n2.   The carrying-over of any unused quota for Mediterranean swordfish shall be prohibited.\nArticle 7\nAllocation of fishing opportunities\n1.   In accordance with Article 17 of Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013, when allocating the fishing opportunities available to them, Member States shall use transparent and objective criteria, including those of an environmental, social and economic nature, and shall also endeavour to distribute national quotas fairly among the various fleet segments, giving consideration to traditional and artisanal fishing, and to provide incentives to Union fishing vessels deploying selective fishing gear or using fishing techniques with reduced environmental impact.\n2.   Each Member State shall make provision for by-catch of swordfish within its Mediterranean swordfish quota and shall inform the Commission thereof when transmitting its annual fishing plan in accordance with Article 9. Such provision shall ensure that all dead Mediterranean swordfish are deducted from the quota.\n3.   Member States shall endeavour to allocate any increase in fishing opportunities resulting from the successful implementation of this Regulation to fishing vessels to which no quota for Mediterranean swordfish has previously been allocated and that fulfil the criteria for the allocation of fishing opportunities set out in Article 17 of Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013.\nArticle 8\nCapacity limitations\n1.   A capacity limitation by fishing gear type for fishing vessels shall apply for the duration of the recovery plan set out in this Regulation. Member States shall limit by fishing gear type the number of fishing vessels flying their flag and authorised to catch Mediterranean swordfish to the average yearly number of vessels flying their flag that fished for, retained on board, transhipped, transported or landed Mediterranean swordfish during the period 2013-2016.\n2.   Notwithstanding paragraph 1, Member States may decide to use the number of vessels flying their flag that fished for, retained on board, transhipped, transported or landed Mediterranean swordfish in 2016 for the purpose of calculating the capacity limitation, if that number is lower than the average yearly number of vessels during the period 2013–2016. That capacity limitation shall be applied by gear type for fishing vessels.\n3.   Member States may apply a tolerance of 5 % to the capacity limitation referred to in paragraph 1 for the years 2018 and 2019.\n4.   Member States shall inform the Commission by 1 March of each year of the measures taken to limit the number of fishing vessels flying their flag and authorised to catch Mediterranean swordfish. That information shall be included in the transmission of the annual fishing plans in accordance with Article 9.\nArticle 9\nAnnual fishing plans\n1.   Member States shall submit their annual fishing plans to the Commission by 1 March of each year. Such annual fishing plans shall be submitted in the format set out in the ICCAT Guidelines for submitting data and information, and shall include detailed information regarding the quota for Mediterranean swordfish allocated by fishing gear type, including quota allocated to recreational fisheries, where relevant, and to by-catches.\n2.   The Commission shall compile the annual fishing plans referred to in paragraph 1 and integrate them into a Union fishing plan. The Commission shall transmit that Union fishing plan to the ICCAT Secretariat by 15 March each year.\nCHAPTER 2\nTechnical conservation measures\nSection 1\nFishing seasons\nArticle 10\nClosure periods\n1.   Mediterranean swordfish shall not be caught, either as targeted species or as by-catch, retained on board, transhipped or landed during the closure period. The closure period shall be from 1 January to 31 March of each year.\n2.   In order to protect Mediterranean swordfish, a closure period shall apply to longline vessels targeting Mediterranean albacore (Thunnus alalunga) from 1 October to 30 November of each year.\n3.   Member States shall monitor the effectiveness of the closure periods referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 and shall submit to the Commission, at least two months and 15 days before the ICCAT annual meeting each year, all relevant information on appropriate controls and inspections carried out the previous year to ensure compliance with this Article. The Commission shall forward that information to the ICCAT Secretariat at least two months before the ICCAT annual meeting each year.\nSection 2\nMinimum conservation reference size, incidental catch and by-catch\nArticle 11\nMinimum conservation reference size for Mediterranean swordfish\n1.   By way of derogation from Article 15(1) of Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013, it shall be prohibited to catch, retain on board, tranship, land, transport, store, sell or display or offer for sale Mediterranean swordfish, including in recreational fisheries:\n(a)\nmeasuring less than 100 cm lower jaw to fork length (LJFL); or\n(b)\nweighing less than 11,4 kg of live weight, or 10,2 kg of gilled and gutted weight.\n2.   Only entire specimens of Mediterranean swordfish, without removal of any external part, or gilled and gutted specimens, may be retained on board, transhipped landed or carried in the first transport after landing.\nArticle 12\nIncidental catches of Mediterranean swordfish below the minimum conservation reference size\nNotwithstanding Article 11(1), fishing vessels targeting Mediterranean swordfish may retain on board, tranship, transfer, land, transport, store, sell or display or offer for sale incidental catches of Mediterranean swordfish below the minimum conservation reference size, provided such catches do not exceed 5 % by weight or number of specimens of the total Mediterranean swordfish catch of the fishing vessels concerned.\nArticle 13\nBy-catches\n1.   By-catches of Mediterranean swordfish shall not exceed at any time following a fishing operation the by-catch limit that Member States establish in their annual fishing plans for the total catch on board by weight or number of specimens.\n2.   By way of derogation from Article 15(1) of Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013, fishing vessels not targeting Mediterranean swordfish shall not retain on board Mediterranean swordfish exceeding that by-catch limit.\n3.   By way of derogation from Article 15(1) of Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013, if the quota for Mediterranean swordfish allocated to the flag Member State is exhausted, any Mediterranean swordfish caught alive shall be released.\n4.   Where the quota for Mediterranean swordfish allocated to the flag Member State is exhausted, the processing and commercialisation of dead Mediterranean swordfish shall be prohibited and all catches shall be recorded. Member States shall provide information on the quantity of such dead Mediterranean swordfish on an annual basis to the Commission which shall forward it to the ICCAT Secretariat, in accordance with Article 21.\nSection 3\nTechnical characteristics of the fishing gear\nArticle 14\nTechnical characteristics of the fishing gear\n1.   The maximum number of hooks that may be set by or carried on board fishing vessels targeting Mediterranean swordfish shall be fixed at 2 500 hooks.\n2.   By way of derogation from paragraph 1, a replacement set of 2 500 rigged hooks shall be allowed on board fishing vessels for trips longer than two days provided that it is duly lashed and stowed in lower decks so that it may not readily be used.\n3.   The hook size shall not be smaller than 7 cm in height.\n4.   The length of the pelagic longlines shall not exceed 30 nautical miles (55,56 km).\nCHAPTER 3\nControl measures\nSection 1\nRecord of vessels\nArticle 15\nFishing authorisations\n1.   Member States shall issue fishing authorisations to fishing vessels targeting Mediterranean swordfish and flying their flag, in accordance with the relevant provisions laid down in Regulation (EU) 2017/2403, in particular Articles 20 and 21 thereof.\n2.   Only Union vessels included in the ICCAT record of vessels, in accordance with the procedure laid down in Articles 16 and 17, shall be allowed to target, retain on board, tranship, land, transport or process Mediterranean swordfish, without prejudice to the provisions on by-catches laid down in Article 13.\n3.   Large-scale fishing vessels authorised by Member States shall be registered in the ICCAT record of vessels 20 metres in length overall or greater authorised to operate in the ICCAT Convention area.\nArticle 16\nInformation on vessels authorised to catch Mediterranean swordfish and albacore tuna in the current year\n1.

Each Member State with a quota for Mediterranean swordfish shall implement a national scientific observer programme for pelagic longline vessels flying that Member State's flag and targeting Mediterranean swordfish in accordance with this Article. The national observer programme shall comply with the minimum standards laid down in Annex I.\n2.   Each Member State concerned shall ensure that national scientific observers are deployed on at least 10 % of pelagic longline vessels over 15 metres in length overall flying that Member State's flag and targeting Mediterranean swordfish. The percentage coverage shall be measured by number of fishing days, sets, vessels or trips.\n3.   Each Member State concerned shall design and implement a scientific monitoring approach to collect the information on the activities of pelagic longline vessels 15 metres in length overall and below flying that Member State's flag. Each flag Member State shall present the details of that scientific monitoring approach to the Commission in its annual fishing plan referred to in Article 9 by 2020.\n4.   The Commission shall immediately submit the details of the scientific monitoring approach referred to in paragraph 3 to the ICCAT Standing Committee on Research and Statistics (SCRS) for evaluation.

Serious violations\n1.\nFor the purposes of these procedures, a serious violation means the following violations of the provisions of the ICCAT conservation and management measures adopted by ICCAT:\n(a)\nfishing without a license, permit or authorisation issued by the flag CPC;\n(b)\nfailure to maintain sufficient records of catch and catch-related data in accordance with the ICCAT's reporting requirements or significant misreporting of such catch or catch-related data;\n(c)\nfishing in a closed area;\n(d)\nfishing during a closed season;\n(e)\nintentional taking or retention of species in contravention of any applicable conservation and management measure adopted by ICCAT;\n(f)\nsignificant violation of catch limits or quotas in force pursuant to the ICCAT rules;\n(g)\nusing prohibited fishing gear;\n(h)\nfalsifying or intentionally concealing the markings, identity or registration of a fishing vessel;\n(i)\nconcealing, tampering with or disposing of evidence relating to investigation of a violation;\n(j)\nmultiple violations which taken together constitute a serious disregard of measures in force pursuant to ICCAT;\n(k)\nassault, resist, intimidate, sexually harass, interfere with, or unduly obstruct or delay an authorised inspector or observer;\n(l)\nintentionally tampering with or disabling the VMS;\n(m)\nsuch other violations as may be determined by ICCAT, once these are included and circulated in a revised version of these procedures;\n(n)\ninterference with the satellite monitoring system or operation of a vessel without a VMS;\n(o)\ntranshipment at sea.\n2.\nIn the case of any boarding and inspection of a fishing vessel during which the authorised inspectors observe an activity or condition that would constitute a serious violation, as defined in paragraph 1, the authorities of the flag State of the inspection vessel shall immediately notify the flag State of the fishing vessel, directly as well as through the ICCAT Secretariat. In such situations, the inspector should, also inform any inspection vessel of the flag State of the fishing vessel known to be in the vicinity.\n3.\nICCAT inspectors shall register the inspections undertaken and the infringements detected (if any) in the fishing vessel logbook.\n4.\nThe flag State CPC shall ensure that, following the inspection referred to in paragraph 2, the fishing vessel concerned ceases all fishing activities. The flag State CPC shall require the fishing vessel to proceed within 72 hours to a port designated by it, where an investigation shall be initiated.\n5.\nIn the case where an inspection has detected an activity or condition that would constitute a serious violation, the vessel should be reviewed under the procedures described in ICCAT Recommendation 11-18 Further Amending Recommendation 09-10 Establishing a List of Vessels Presumed to Have Carried Out Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated Fishing Activities in the ICCAT Convention Area, taking into account any response actions and other follow up.\nII.   Conduct of inspections\n6.\nInspections shall be carried out by inspectors designated by the Contracting Governments. The names of the authorised government agencies and individual inspectors designated for that purpose by their respective governments shall be notified to the ICCAT Commission.\n7.\nInspection vessels carrying out international boarding and inspection duties in accordance with this Annex shall fly a special flag or pennant approved by the ICCAT Commission and issued by the ICCAT Secretariat. The names of the vessels so used shall be notified to the ICCAT Secretariat as soon as practical in advance of the commencement of inspection activities. The ICCAT Secretariat shall make information regarding designated inspection vessels available to all CPCs, including by posting on its password-protected website.\n8.\nInspectors shall carry appropriate identity documentation issued by the authorities of the flag State, which shall be in the form shown in paragraph 21.\n9.\nSubject to the arrangements agreed under paragraph 16, a fishing vessel flagged to a Contracting Party and fishing for tuna or tuna-like fishes in the ICCAT Convention area outside waters under national jurisdiction shall stop when given the appropriate signal in the International Code of Signals by an inspection vessel flying the ICCAT pennant described in paragraph 7 and carrying an inspector unless the fishing vessel is actually carrying out fishing operations, in which case it shall stop immediately once it has finished such operations. The master of the fishing vessel shall permit the inspection party, as specified in paragraph 10, to board it and must provide a boarding ladder. The master shall enable the inspection party to make such examination of equipment, catch or gear and any relevant documents as an inspector deems necessary to verify compliance with ICCAT recommendations in force in relation to the flag State of the fishing vessel being inspected. Further, inspectors may ask for any explanations that they deem necessary.\n10.\nThe size of the inspection party shall be determined by the commanding officer of the inspection vessel taking into account relevant circumstances. The inspection party should be as small as possible to accomplish the duties set out in this Annex safely and securely.\n11.\nUpon boarding the fishing vessel, inspectors shall produce the identity documentation described in paragraph 8. Inspectors shall observe generally accepted international regulations, procedures and practices relating to the safety of the fishing vessel being inspected and its crew, and shall minimise interference with fishing activities or stowage of product and, to the extent practicable, avoid action which would adversely affect the quality of the catch on board. Inspectors shall limit their enquiries to the ascertainment of the observance of ICCAT recommendations in force in relation to the flag State of the fishing vessel concerned. In making the inspection, inspectors may ask the master of the fishing vessel for any assistance they may require. Inspectors shall draw up a report of the inspection in a form approved by the ICCAT Commission. Inspectors shall sign the report in the presence of the master of the fishing vessel who shall be entitled to add or have added to the report any observations which he or she may think suitable and must sign such observations.\n12.\nCopies of the report shall be given to the master of the fishing vessel and to the government of the inspection party, which shall transmit copies to the appropriate authorities of the flag State of the inspected fishing vessel and to the ICCAT Commission. Where any infringement of ICCAT recommendations is discovered, the inspector should, where possible, also inform any inspection vessel of the flag State of the fishing vessel known to be in the vicinity.\n13.\nResistance to inspectors or failure to comply with their directions shall be treated by the flag State of the inspected fishing vessel in a manner similar to such conduct committed with respect to a national inspector.\n14.\nInspectors shall carry out their duties under these arrangements in accordance with the rules set out in this Regulation, but they shall remain under the operational control of their national authorities and shall be responsible to them.\n15.\nContracting Governments shall consider and act on inspection reports, sighting information sheets as per ICCAT Recommendation 94-09 and statements resulting from documentary inspections of foreign inspectors under these arrangements on a similar basis in accordance with their national legislation to the reports of national inspectors. The provisions of this paragraph shall not impose any obligation on a Contracting Government to give the report of a foreign inspector a higher evidential value than it would possess in the inspector's own country. Contracting Governments shall collaborate in order to facilitate judicial or other proceedings arising from a report of an inspector under these arrangements.\n16.\n(a)\nContracting Governments shall inform the ICCAT Commission by 1 January each year of their provisional plans for conducting inspection activities under ICCAT Recommendation 16-05 in that calendar year and the ICCAT Commission may make suggestions to Contracting Governments for the coordination of national operations in this field including the number of inspectors and inspection vessels carrying inspectors;\n(b)\nthe arrangements set out in ICCAT Recommendation 16-05 and the plans for participation shall apply between Contracting Governments unless otherwise agreed between them, and such agreement shall be notified to the ICCAT Commission. Provided, however, that implementation of the scheme shall be suspended between any two Contracting Governments if either of them has notified the ICCAT Commission to that effect, pending completion of such an agreement.\n17.\n(a)\nThe fishing gear shall be inspected in accordance with the regulations in force for the subarea for which the inspection takes place. Inspectors will state the subarea for which the inspection took place, and a description of any violations found, in the inspection report;\n(b)\ninspectors shall have the authority to inspect all fishing gear in use or on board.\n18.\nInspectors shall affix an identification mark approved by the ICCAT Commission to any fishing gear inspected which appears to be in contravention of ICCAT recommendations in force in relation to the flag State of the fishing vessel concerned and shall record that fact in his/her report.\n19.\nInspectors may photograph the gears, equipment, documentation and any other element he/she considers necessary in such a way as to reveal those features which in their opinion are not in conformity with the regulation in force, in which case the subjects photographed should be listed in the report and copies of the photographs should be attached to the copy of the report to the flag State.\n20.\nInspectors shall, as necessary, inspect all catch on board to determine compliance with ICCAT recommendations.\n21.\nThe model Identity Card for inspectors is as follows:\ndimensions: width 10,4 cm, height 7 cm.", "summary": "Multiannual recovery plan for Mediterranean swordfish\nMultiannual recovery plan for Mediterranean swordfish\nSUMMARY OF:\nRegulation (EU) 2019/1154 on a multiannual recovery plan for Mediterranean swordfish\nWHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?\nIt lays down rules for the European Union (EU) implementation of the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas’ (ICCAT) multiannual recovery plan for swordfish in the Mediterranean Sea.\nThe aim is to achieve a maximum sustainable yield* of Mediterranean swordfish by 2031, with at least a 60% probability of achieving that target.\nKEY POINTS\n              \nThe regulation applies to:\nEU vessels carrying out commercial or recreational fishing, which catch, transship* or carry on board Mediterranean swordfish, whether inside or outside the ICCAT Convention area;\nnon-EU vessels carrying out commercial or recreational Mediterranean swordfish fishing in EU watersinspected in EU Member State ports with Mediterranean swordfish or fishery products on board.\nThe recovery plan started in 2017 and continues until 2031.\nManagement measures\nMember States must:\nensure that the fishing effort* of their vessels respects the fishing opportunities* they are given;\nuse transparent and objective criteria — notably environmental, social and economic criteria — when sharing out national quotas among their fleet and consider the needs of traditional and artisanal fishing;\nprovide for a maximum by-catch* of swordfish within their quota;\nlimit the number of vessels allowed to catch Mediterranean swordfish to the annual average number of vessels fishing between 2013 and 2016;\noperate national scientific observer programmes for pelagic longline vessels and ensure that observers are deployed on at least 10% of vessels over 15 metres in length (Annex I sets out the terms and duties of the programmes).\nTechnical conservation\nFishing is not allowed between 1 January and 31 March each year. An additional closure period applies to longline vessels targeting Mediterranean albacore between 1 October and 30 November.\nMediterranean swordfish less than 100 cm in length and weighing under 11.4 kg may not be caught, landed, stored, sold or displayed.\nVessels may not use more than 2,500 hooks and longlines must not exceed 30 nautical miles (55.56 km).\nControls\nFishing vessels:\nneed Member State authorisation and must be included in the ICCAT register;\nmust transmit uninterrupted data from their vessel monitoring system — even when in port — to national monitoring centres, which forward this information at least every 2 hours to the European Commission, which in turn sends it to the ICCAT secretariat;\nmay not be chartered to catch Mediterranean swordfish;\nmust keep a fishing logbook (Annex II sets out the data to be recorded) and provide this data to their national authorities;\nmay only land or transship catches of Mediterranean swordfish and by-catches in designated ports (transshipment at sea is prohibited) and must give the ports prior notification of their arrival.\nMember States must inform the Commission when 80% of a swordfish quota has been reached and thereafter report on catches on a weekly basis.\nInspections\nMember States must:\nestablish and implement annual inspection plans, which the Commission will integrate into an EU inspection plan;\ndeploy an inspection and control vessel whenever more than 50 of their vessels are catching swordfish;\nphysically inspect, either in port or at sea, vessels that break the rules.\nJoint international inspections are carried out according to the ICATT Scheme for Joint International Inspection (Annex III details how these operate).\nThe Commission may assign EU inspectors to accompany national inspectors.\nRecreational fisheries\nMember States must:\nestablish a recreational fisheries quota within their national quota;\nprohibit swordfish caught during recreational fishing from being sold or marketed;\nallow only rod and line vessels to participate in recreational fishing;\nrequire details of the vessels involved, their owners and catch data, including the weight of each swordfish caught.\nMember States must also submit a wide range of information — annual reports, fishing plans, details of authorised vessels, inspections made and data collected by scientific observers — to the Commission, which will forward much of it to the ICCAT secretariat.\nThe Commission:\nmay adopt implementing and delegated acts;\nreports to the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union on the recovery plan’s performance by 31 December 2025.\nThe regulation makes small amendments to:\nRegulation (EU) 2017/2107 on the management, conservation and control measures applicable in the ICCAT convention area by deleting articles 20 to 26;\nRegulation (EC) No 1967/2006 on the sustainable exploitation of fish stocks in the Mediterranean Sea (see summary) by reducing the number of hooks per vessels from 3,500 to 2,500.\nFROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?\n              \nIt has applied since 15 July 2019.\nBACKGROUND\nThe International Convention for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (see summary) provides for regional cooperation on the conservation and management of tunas and tuna-like species in the Atlantic Ocean and adjoining seas — and establishes ICCAT. The EU has been a contracting party to the ICCAT Convention since 14 November 1997.\nThe EU accounts for some 70% of the total catches of Mediterranean swordfish. Greece, Spain and Italy catch the most, with a further 10% shared between France, Croatia, Cyprus and Malta. Other countries, notably Algeria, Morocco, Tunisia and Turkey, also exploit the stock.\nThe regulation essentially implements the multiannual recovery plan adopted by ICCAT in 2016. However, it introduces some stronger control and monitoring requirements.\nKEY TERMS\n              \nMaximum sustainable yield: the maximum catch that can be taken from a stock without damaging its long-term health.\nTransship: transferring a catch from a vessel to another vessel.\nFishing effort: a measure of the amount of fishing through inputs such as days at sea, length of nets and number of hooks.\nFishing opportunities: a quantified legal entitlement to fish expressed by catches or fishing effort.\nBy-catch: unwanted fish and marine species caught unintentionally.\nMAIN DOCUMENT\n            \nRegulation (EU) 2019/1154 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 June 2019 on a multiannual recovery plan for Mediterranean swordfish and amending Council Regulation (EC) No 1967/2006 and Regulation (EU) 2017/2107 of the European Parliament and of the Council (OJ L 188, 12.7.2019, pp. 1–24)\nRELATED DOCUMENTS\n            \nRegulation (EU) 2017/2107 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 November 2017 laying down management, conservation and control measures applicable in the Convention area of the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT), and amending Council Regulations (EC) No 1936/2001, (EC) No 1984/2003 and (EC) No 520/2007 (OJ L 315, 30.11.2017, pp. 1–39)\nSuccessive amendments to Regulation (EU) 2017/2107 have been incorporated into the original text.
