{"celex_id": "32014R0517", "reference": "20.5.2014\nEN\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\nL 150/195\nREGULATION (EU) No 517/2014 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL\nof 16 April 2014\non fluorinated greenhouse gases and repealing Regulation (EC) No 842/2006\n(Text with EEA relevance)\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 192(1) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee (1),\nAfter consulting the Committee of the Regions,\nActing in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure (2),\nWhereas:\n(1)\nThe Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (‘IPCC’) of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (‘UNFCCC’), to which the Union is party (3), stated that, on the basis of existing scientific data, developed countries would need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 80 % to 95 % below 1990 levels by 2050 to limit global climate change to a temperature increase of 2 °C and thus prevent undesirable climate effects.\n(2)\nTo reach this target, the Commission adopted a Roadmap for moving to a competitive low carbon economy in 2050, which was noted by the Council in its Conclusions of 17 May 2011, and endorsed by the European Parliament in its Resolution of 15 March 2012. In that Roadmap, the Commission laid out a cost-effective way of achieving the necessary overall emission reductions in the Union by 2050. That roadmap establishes the sectoral contributions needed in six areas. Non-CO2 emissions, including fluorinated greenhouse gases but excluding non-CO2 emissions from agriculture, should be reduced by 72 % to 73 % by 2030 and by 70 % to 78 % by 2050, compared to 1990 levels. If based on the reference year 2005, a reduction in non-CO2 emissions, except those from agriculture, of 60 % to 61 % by 2030 is required. Fluorinated greenhouse gas emissions were estimated at 90 million tonnes (Mt) of CO2 equivalent in 2005. A 60 % reduction means that emissions would have to be reduced to approximately 35 Mt of CO2 equivalent by 2030. Given estimated emissions of 104 Mt of CO2 equivalent in 2030 based on the full application of current Union legislation, a further decrease of approximately 70 Mt of CO2 equivalent is required.\n(3)\nThe Commission report of 26 September 2011 on the application, effects and adequacy of Regulation (EC) No 842/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council (4) concluded that the current containment measures, if fully applied, have the potential to reduce emissions of fluorinated greenhouse gases. Those measures should therefore be maintained and clarified on the basis of the experience gained in implementing them. Certain measures should also be extended to other appliances in which substantial quantities of fluorinated greenhouse gases are used, such as refrigerated trucks and trailers. The obligation to establish and maintain records of equipment that contains such gases should also cover electrical switchgear. Given the importance of containment measures at the end of life of products and equipment containing fluorinated greenhouse gases, Member States should take account of the value of producer responsibility schemes and encourage their establishment, based on existing best practices.\n(4)\nThat report also concluded that more can be done to reduce emissions of fluorinated greenhouse gases in the Union, in particular by avoiding the use of such gases where there are safe and energy-efficient alternative technologies with no impact or a lower impact on the climate. A decrease of up to two thirds of the 2010 emissions by 2030 is cost-effective because proven and tested alternatives are available in many sectors.\n(5)\nThe European Parliament Resolution of 14 September 2011 on a comprehensive approach to non-CO2 climate-relevant anthropogenic emissions welcomed the Union’s commitment to support action on hydrofluorocarbons under the Montreal Protocol on substances that deplete the ozone layer (‘Montreal Protocol’) as a prime example of a non-market based approach to reducing greenhouse gas emissions. That Resolution also called for the exploration of ways to promote an immediate phase down of hydrofluorocarbons at international level through the Montreal Protocol.\n(6)\nTo encourage the use of technologies with no impact or lower impact on the climate, the training of natural persons who carry out activities involving fluorinated greenhouse gases should cover information on technologies that serve to replace and reduce the use of fluorinated greenhouse gases. Given that some alternatives to fluorinated greenhouse gases used in products and equipment to replace and reduce the use of fluorinated greenhouse gases can be toxic, flammable or highly pressurised, the Commission should examine existing Union legislation covering the training of natural persons for the safe-handling of alternative refrigerants and, if appropriate, should submit a legislative proposal to the European Parliament and to the Council to amend the relevant Union legislation.\n(7)\nCertification and training programmes should be established or adapted taking account of those established under Regulation (EC) No 842/2006 and may be integrated into the vocational training systems.\n(8)\nTo ensure coherence with monitoring and reporting requirements under the UNFCCC and with Decision 4/CMP.7 of the Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol to the UNFCCC, adopted by the seventh Conference of the Parties of the UNFCCC meeting in Durban on 11 December 2011, global warming potentials should be calculated in terms of the 100-year global warming potential of one kilogram of a gas relative to one kilogram of CO2. The calculation should, where possible, be based on the Fourth Assessment Report adopted by the IPCC.\n(9)\nEffective monitoring of fluorinated greenhouse gas emissions is critical for tracking progress towards the achievement of emission reduction targets and for assessing the impact of this Regulation. The use of consistent, high-quality data to report on fluorinated greenhouse gas emissions is essential to ensuring the quality of emissions reporting. The establishment of reporting systems by Member States of emissions of fluorinated greenhouse gases would provide coherence with Regulation (EU) No 525/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council (5). Data on leakage of fluorinated greenhouse gases from equipment collected by companies under this Regulation could significantly improve those emission reporting systems. In that way, it should be possible to check the consistency of the data used to derive emissions and to improve approximations based on calculations, leading to a better estimation of emissions of fluorinated greenhouse gases in the national greenhouse gases inventories.\n(10)\nGiven that there are suitable alternatives available, the current ban on using sulphur hexafluoride in magnesium die-casting and the recycling of magnesium die-casting alloys should be extended to facilities that use less than 850 kg of sulphur hexafluoride per year. Similarly, with an appropriate transitional period, the use of refrigerants with a very high global warming potential of 2 500 or more to service or maintain refrigeration equipment with a charge size of 40 tonnes of CO2 equivalent or more should be banned.\n(11)\nWhere suitable alternatives to the use of specific fluorinated greenhouse gases are available, bans on the placing on the market of new equipment for refrigeration, air-conditioning and fire protection that contains, or whose functioning relies upon, those substances should be introduced. Where alternatives are not available or cannot be used for technical or safety reasons, or where the use of such alternatives would entail disproportionate costs, it should be possible for the Commission to authorise an exemption to allow the placing on the market of such products and equipment for a limited period. In the light of future technical developments, the Commission should further assess bans on the placing on the market of new equipment for medium-voltage secondary switchgear and new small single split air-conditioning systems.\n(12)\nEquipment containing fluorinated greenhouse gases should be allowed to be placed on the market if the overall greenhouse gas emissions of that equipment, taking into account realistic leakage and recovery rates, are lower, during its lifecycle, than those that would result from equivalent equipment without fluorinated greenhouse gases, which has the maximum allowed energy consumption set out in relevant implementing measures adopted under Directive 2009/125/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (6). The regular and timely review of those implementing measures, in accordance with that Directive would help to ensure that those implementing measures continue to be effective and appropriate.\n(13)\nGradually reducing the quantities of hydrofluorocarbons that can be placed on the market has been identified as the most effective and cost-efficient way of reducing emissions of those substances in the long term.\n(14)\nTo implement the gradual reduction of the quantities of hydrofluorocarbons that can be placed on the Union market, the Commission should allocate quotas to individual producers and importers for the placing of hydrofluorocarbons on the market in order that the overall quantitative limit for the placing hydrofluorocarbons on the market is not exceeded. To protect the integrity of the gradual reduction of the quantities of hydrofluorocarbons placed on the market, hydrofluorocarbons contained in equipment should be accounted for under the Union quota system. Where hydrofluorocarbons contained in equipment have not been placed on the market prior to the charging of the equipment, a declaration of conformity should be required to prove that those hydrofluorocarbons are accounted for under the Union quota system.\n(15)\nInitially, the calculation of reference values and the allocation of quotas to individual producers and importers should be based on the quantities of hydrofluorocarbons that they reported as having been placed on the marked during the reference period from 2009 to 2012. However, in order not to exclude small undertakings, eleven per cent of the overall quantitative limit should be reserved for importers and producers who have not placed on the market 1 tonne or more of fluorinated greenhouse gases in the reference period.\n(16)\nBy regularly recalculating the reference values and quotas, the Commission should ensure that undertakings are allowed to continue their activities on the basis of the average volumes they placed on the market in recent years.\n(17)\nThe manufacturing process for some fluorinated gases can result in significant emissions of other fluorinated greenhouse gases produced as by-products. Such by-product emissions should be destroyed or recovered for subsequent use as a condition for the placing of fluorinated greenhouse gases on the market.\n(18)\nThe Commission should ensure that a central electronic registry is in place to manage quotas, for the placing of hydrofluorocarbons on the market, and the reporting, including the reporting on equipment placed on the market, in particular where the equipment is pre-charged with hydrofluorocarbons that have not been placed on the market prior to the charging, thus requiring verification, through a declaration of conformity and subsequent third party verification, that the quantities of hydrofluorocarbons are accounted for under the Union quota system.\n(19)\nTo maintain the flexibility of the market in bulk hydrofluorocarbons, it should be possible to transfer quotas allocated on the basis of reference values to another producer or importer in the Union or to another producer or importer which is represented in the Union by an only representative.\n(20)\nTo enable the monitoring of the effectiveness of this Regulation, the scope of the current reporting obligations should be extended to cover other fluorinated substances that have significant global warming potential or that are likely to replace the fluorinated greenhouse gases listed in Annex I. For the same reason the destruction of fluorinated greenhouse gases and the importation into the Union of those gases when contained in products and equipment should also be reported. De minimis thresholds should be set to avoid disproportionate administrative burden, in particular for small and medium-sized enterprises and micro-enterprises.\n(21)\nThe Commission should continuously monitor the effects of reducing the quantities of hydrofluorocarbons placed on the market, including its effects on the supply for equipment where the use of hydrofluorocarbons would result in lower life-cycle emissions than if an alternative technology was used. The Commission should produce a report on the availability of hydrofluorocarbons on the Union market by the end of 2020. A comprehensive review should be carried out by the Commission by the end of 2022 in time to adapt the provisions of this Regulation, in the light of its implementation and of new developments and international commitments, and to propose, if appropriate, further reduction measures.\n(22)\nIn order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of this Regulation, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission. Those powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council (7).\n(23)\nIn order to amend certain non-essential elements of this Regulation, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (‘TFEU’) should be delegated to the Commission. It is of particular importance that the Commission carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level. The Commission, when preparing and drawing up delegated acts, should ensure a simultaneous, timely and appropriate transmission of relevant documents to the European Parliament and to the Council.\n(24)\nSince it is adopted pursuant to Article 192(1) TFEU, this Regulation does not prevent Member States from maintaining or introducing more stringent protective measures that are compatible with the TFEU. Pursuant to Article 193 TFEU, Member States are to notify the Commission of any such measures.\n(25)\nThis Regulation amends and complements the subject matter of Regulation (EC) No 842/2006, which should therefore be repealed. However, in order to ensure a smooth transition from the old regime to the new regime, it is appropriate to provide that Commission Regulations (EC) No 1493/2007 (8), (EC) No 1494/2007 (9), (EC) No 1497/2007 (10), (EC) No 1516/2007 (11), (EC) No 303/2008 (12), (EC) No 304/2008 (13), (EC) No 305/2008 (14), (EC) No 306/2008 (15), (EC) No 307/2008 (16) and (EC) No 308/2008 (17) should remain in force and continue to apply unless and until repealed by delegated or implementing acts adopted by the Commission pursuant to this Regulation.\n(26)\nSince the objectives of this Regulation cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States but can rather, by reason of the transboundary nature of the environmental problem addressed and the effects of this Regulation on the intra-Union and external trade, be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives,\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nCHAPTER I\nGENERAL PROVISIONS\nArticle 1\nSubject-matter\nThe objective of this Regulation is to protect the environment by reducing emissions of fluorinated greenhouse gases.

A delegated act adopted pursuant to Articles 12(15) and 21(1) shall enter into force only if no objection has been expressed either by the European Parliament or the Council within a period of two months of notification of that act to the European Parliament and the Council or if, before the expiry of that period, the European Parliament and the Council have both informed the Commission that they will not object. That period shall be extended by two months at the initiative of the European Parliament or of the Council.\nArticle 23\nConsultation Forum\nIn implementing this Regulation, the Commission shall ensure a balanced participation of Member States’ representatives and representatives of civil society, including environmental organisations, representatives of manufacturers, operators and certified persons. To that end, it shall establish a Consultation Forum for those parties to meet and provide advice and expertise to the Commission in relation to the implementation of this Regulation, in particular with regard to the availability of alternatives to fluorinated greenhouse gases, including the environmental, technical, economic and safety aspects of their use. The rules of procedure of the Consultation Forum shall be established by the Commission and shall be published.\nArticle 24\nCommittee procedure\n1.   The Commission shall be assisted by a committee. That committee shall be a committee within the meaning of Regulation (EU) No 182/2011.\n2.   Where reference is made to this paragraph, Article 5 of Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 shall apply. Where the committee delivers no opinion, the Commission shall not adopt the draft implementing act and the third subparagraph of Article 5(4) of Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 shall apply.\nArticle 25\nPenalties\n1.   Member States shall lay down the rules on penalties applicable to infringements of this Regulation and shall take all measures necessary to ensure that they are implemented. The penalties provided for must be effective, proportionate and dissuasive.\nMember States shall notify those provisions to the Commission by 1 January 2017 at the latest and shall notify it without delay of any subsequent amendment affecting them.\n2.   In addition to the penalties referred to in paragraph 1, undertakings that have exceeded their quota for placing hydrofluorocarbons on the market, allocated in accordance with Article 16(5) or transferred to them in accordance with Article 18, may only be allocated a reduced quota allocation for the allocation period after the excess has been detected.\nThe amount of reduction shall be calculated as 200 % of the amount by which the quota was exceeded. If the amount of the reduction is higher than the amount to be allocated in accordance with Article 16(5) as a quota for the allocation period after the excess has been detected, no quota shall be allocated for that allocation period and the quota for the following allocation periods shall be reduced likewise until the full amount has been deducted.\nArticle 26\nRepeal\nRegulation (EC) No 842/2006 shall be repealed with effect from 1 January 2015, without prejudice to compliance with the requirements of that Regulation in accordance with the timetable set out therein.\nHowever, Regulations (EC) No 1493/2007, (EC) No 1494/2007, (EC) No 1497/2007, (EC) No 1516/2007, (EC) No 303/2008, (EC) No 304/2008, (EC) No 305/2008, (EC) No 306/2008, (EC) No 307/2008 and (EC) No 308/2008 shall remain in force and continue to apply unless and until repealed by delegated or implementing acts adopted by the Commission pursuant to this Regulation.\nReferences to Regulation (EC) No 842/2006 shall be construed as references to this Regulation and shall be read in accordance with the correlation table in Annex VIII.\nArticle 27\nEntry into force and date of application\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on the 20th day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nIt shall apply from 1 January 2015.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.\nDone at Strasbourg, 16 April 2014.\nFor the European Parliament\nThe President\nM.

From 2018 onwards, the maximum quantity referred to in Article 15(1) shall be calculated by applying the following percentages to the annual average of the total quantity placed on the market into the Union during period 2009 to 2012, and subsequently subtracting the amounts for exempted uses according to Article 15(2), on the basis of available data.\nYears\nPercentage to calculate the maximum quantity of hydrofluorocarbons to be placed on the market and corresponding quotas\n2015\n100 %\n2016–17\n93 %\n2018–20\n63 %\n2021–23\n45 %\n2024–26\n31 %\n2027–29\n24 %\n2030\n21 %\nThe maximum quantity, reference values and quotas for placing hydrofluorocarbons on the market referred to in Articles 15 and 16 shall be calculated as the aggregated quantities of all types of hydrofluorocarbons, expressed in tonne(s) of CO2 equivalent.\nThe calculation of reference values and quotas for placing hydrofluorocarbons on the market referred to in Articles 15 and 16 shall be based on the quantities of hydrofluorocarbons producers and importers have placed on the market in the Union during the reference or allocation period but excluding quantities of hydrofluorocarbons for the usage referred to in Article 15(2) during the same period, on the basis of available data.\nTransactions referred to in point (c) of Article 15(2) shall be verified in accordance with Article 19(6) regardless of the quantities involved.\nANNEX VI\nALLOCATION MECHANISM REFERRED TO IN ARTICLE 16\n1.   Determination of the quantity to be allocated to undertakings for which a reference value has been established under Article 16(1) and (3)\nEach undertaking for which a reference value has been established receives a quota corresponding to 89 % of the reference value multiplied by the percentage indicated in Annex V for the respective year.\n2.   Determination of the quantity to be allocated to undertakings that have submitted a declaration under Article 16(2)\nThe sum of the quotas allocated under point 1 is subtracted from the maximum quantity for the given year set out in Annex V to determine the quantity to be allocated to undertakings for which no reference value has been established and which have submitted a declaration under Article 16(2) (quantity to be allocated in step 1 of the calculation).\n2.1.   Step 1 of the calculation\nEach undertaking receives an allocation corresponding to the quantity requested in its declaration, but no more than a pro-rata share of the quantity to be allocated in step 1.\nThe pro-rata share is calculated by dividing 100 by the number of undertakings that have submitted a declaration. The sum of the quotas allocated in step 1 is subtracted from the quantity to be allocated in step 1 to determine the quantity to be allocated in step 2.\n2.2.   Step 2 of the calculation\nEach undertaking that has not obtained 100 % of the quantity requested in its declaration in step 1 receives an additional allocation corresponding to the difference between the quantity requested and the quantity obtained in step 1. However, this must not exceed the pro-rata share of the quantity to be allocated in step 2.\nThe pro-rata share is calculated by dividing 100 by the number of undertakings eligible for an allocation in step 2. The sum of the quotas allocated in step 2 is subtracted from the quantity to be allocated in step 2 to determine the quantity to be allocated in step 3.\n2.3.   Step 3 of the calculation\nStep 2 is repeated until all requests are satisfied or the remaining quantity to be allocated in the next phase is less than 500 tonnes of CO2 equivalent.\n3.   Determination of the quantity to be allocated to undertakings that have submitted a declaration under Article 16(4)\nFor the allocation of quotas for 2015 to 2017 the sum of the quotas allocated under points 1 and 2 is subtracted from the maximum quantity for the given year set out in Annex V to determine the quantity to be allocated to undertakings for which a reference value has been established and that have submitted a declaration under Article 16(4).\nThe allocation mechanism set out under points 2.1 and 2.2 applies.\nFor the allocation of quotas for 2018 and every year thereafter, undertakings that have submitted a declaration under Article 16(4) shall be treated in the same way as undertakings that have submitted a declaration under Article 16(2).\nANNEX VII\nDATA TO BE

fluorinated greenhouse gases\nWHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?\nIt is designed to mitigate climate change and protect the environment by reducing emissions of fluorinated greenhouse gases (F-gases) which are human-made greenhouse gases with a global warming effect up to 23,000 times that of carbon dioxide.\nIt aims to cut the F-gas emissions of the European Union (EU) by two thirds by 2030 compared with 2014 levels.\nKEY POINTS\n              \nThe regulation:\ncovers hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs)*, perfluorocarbons (PFCs)* and sulphur hexafluorides (SF6)*;\nlays down rules on the containment, use, recovery and destruction of F-gases;\nsets an overall yearly limit on the climate impact of HFCs, to be gradually reduced between 2015 and 2030.\nIt also lays down the following obligations.\nIntentional release of F-gases is prohibited, unless technically necessary for the intended use of a product. Manufacturers must do their utmost to limit emissions during the production, transport and storage of F-gases.\nOperators of equipment containing F-gases must take every precaution to avoid any leakage. They must ensure the equipment is regularly checked for leaks. The requirements vary according to the potential climate impact or whether the equipment is hermetically sealed.\nThe European Commission must report on the impact of the regulation by 31 December 2022.\nCertification and training programmes\nNational authorities are responsible for setting up certification and training programmes for businesses and people involved in installing, servicing, maintaining, repairing or decommissioning F-gases equipment and in recovering F-gases.\nBans on products containing F-gases\nThe regulation phases in bans from 2015 to 2025 on the sale of new items such as certain categories of fridges and freezers, air-conditioning systems, foams and aerosols containing F-gases where safer, more climate-friendly alternatives exist.\nAnnual limits for HFCs\nThe regulation seeks to reduce the climate impact of the use of HFCs over time. The annual limit for HFCs on the market in 2030 is 21% of 2009–2012 levels.\nTo ensure the limits are met, the Commission allocates annual quotas to producers and importers. These must not be exceeded.\nReporting\nProducers, importers, exporters, users of feedstock and businesses that destroy F-gases must report annually to the Commission.\nImporters of F-gases equipment must do the same and, from 2017, have had to provide evidence that the quantities of HFCs in their imported equipment are accounted for.\nKigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol\nThe regulation also ensures that the EU complies with its international obligations under the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol.\nThe Kigali Amendment added HFCs to the list of controlled substances under the Montreal Protocol (see summary). It entered into force on 1 January 2019. The phase-down of HFCs is expected to save around 80 gigatonnes of CO2 equivalents until 2050 and make a significant contribution to fighting climate change.\nAll 198 Montreal Protocol parties agreed to take steps to gradually reduce their production and use of HFCs. The first reduction step was to be taken by the EU and other developed countries in 2019. Most developing countries will start their phase-down in 2024.\nFROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?\n              \nIt has applied since 1 January 2015.\nBACKGROUND\nF-gases account for 2% of EU greenhouse gas emissions. F-gases are often replaceable by more climate-friendly alternatives.\nFor further information, see: EU legislation to control F-gases (European Commission).\nKEY TERMS\n              \nHFCs. Used as refrigerants, cleaning solvents and foam-blowing agents (such as fire extinguishers).\nPFCs. Used to manufacture semiconductors, as cleaning solvents and as foam-blowing agents.\nSF6. Used in high-voltage switch gear and magnesium production.\nMAIN DOCUMENT\n            \nRegulation (EU) No 517/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 April 2014 on fluorinated greenhouse gases and repealing Regulation (EC) No 842/2006 (OJ L 150, 20.5.2014, pp. 195–230).\nRELATED DOCUMENTS\n            \nCouncil Decision (EU) 2017/1541 of 17 July 2017 on the conclusion, on behalf of the European Union, of the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol on substances that deplete the ozone layer (OJ L 236, 14.9.2017, pp. 1–2).\nAmendment to the Montreal Protocol on substances that deplete the ozone layer (OJ L 236, 14.9.2017, pp. 3–13).\nlast update 09.11.2021", "tags": ["marketing standard", "air quality", "emission trading", "gas appliance", "climate change", "greenhouse gas", "environmental standard", "reduction of gas emissions"], "subjects": ["Protocol on Ireland/Northern Ireland", "Environment"], "split": "validation", "reference_annotations": {"32014R0517_p1": {"text": "regulation 517/2014 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL---of 16 April 2014---on fluorinated greenhouse gases and repealing regulation 842/2006", "triples": [" regulation 517/2014,  repealing,  regulation 842/2006"]}, "32014R0517_p4": {"text": "(5)  regulation 525/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 May 2013 on a mechanism for monitoring and reporting greenhouse gas emissions and for reporting other information at national and Union level relevant to climate change and repealing decision 280/2004/ec (OJ L 165, 18.6.2013, p. 13).", "triples": [" regulation 525/2013,  repealing,  decision 280/2004/ec"]}, "32014R0517_p5": {"text": "(18)  directive 2003/4/ec of the European Parliament and of the Council of 28 January 2003 on public access to environmental information and repealing Council directive 90/313/eec (OJ L 41, 14.2.2003, p. 26).", "triples": [" directive 2003/4/ec,  repealing,  directive 90/313/eec"]}, "32014R0517_p6": {"text": "(20)  directive 2006/40/ec of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 May 2006 relating to emissions from air conditioning systems in motor vehicles and amending Council directive 70/156/eec (OJ L 161, 14.6.2006, p. 12).", "triples": [" directive 2006/40/ec,  amending,  directive 70/156/eec"]}, "32014R0517_p7": {"text": "(21)  directive 2003/87/ec of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 October 2003 establishing a scheme for greenhouse gas emission allowance trading within the Community and amending Council directive 96/61/ec (OJ L 275, 25.10.2003, p. 32).", "triples": [" directive 2003/87/ec,  amending,  directive 96/61/ec"]}, "32014R0517_p8": {"text": "(22)  regulation 1907/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 December 2006 concerning the Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH), establishing a European Chemicals Agency, amending directive 1999/45/ec and repealing Council regulation 793/93 and Commission regulation 1488/94 as well as Council directive 76/769/eec and Commission directive 91/155/eec directive 93/67/eec directive 93/105/ec directive 2000/21/ec (OJ L 396, 30.12.2006, p. 1).", "triples": [" regulation 1907/2006,  amending,  directive 1999/45/ec", " regulation 1907/2006,  repealing,  regulation 793/93", " regulation 1907/2006,  repealing,  regulation 1488/94", " regulation 1907/2006,  repealing,  directive 76/769/eec", " regulation 1907/2006,  repealing,  directive 91/155/eec", " regulation 1907/2006,  repealing,  directive 93/67/eec", " regulation 1907/2006,  repealing,  directive 93/105/ec", " regulation 1907/2006,  repealing,  directive 2000/21/ec"]}}, "summary_annotations": {"32014R0517_p1": {"text": "regulation 517/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 April 2014 on fluorinated greenhouse gases and repealing regulation 842/2006 (OJ L 150, 20.5.2014, pp. 195–230).", "triples": [" regulation 517/2014,  repealing,  regulation 842/2006"]}}}
