{"celex_id": "32009R0392", "reference": "28.5.2009\nEN\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\nL 131/24\nREGULATION (EC) No 392/2009 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL\nof 23 April 2009\non the liability of carriers of passengers by sea in the event of accidents\n(Text with EEA relevance)\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 80(2) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the Commission,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee (1),\nHaving regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions (2),\nActing in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty (3), in the light of the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee on 3 February 2009,\nWhereas:\n(1)\nWithin the framework of the common transport policy, further measures need to be adopted in order to enhance safety in maritime transport. Those measures should include liability rules for damage caused to passengers, since it is important to ensure a proper level of compensation for passengers involved in maritime accidents.\n(2)\nThe Protocol of 2002 to the Athens Convention relating to the Carriage of Passengers and their Luggage by Sea, 1974 was adopted on 1 November 2002 under the auspices of the International Maritime Organisation (IMO). The Community and its Member States are in the process of deciding whether to accede to or ratify that Protocol. In any case, the provisions thereof incorporated by this Regulation should apply for the Community from no later than 31 December 2012.\n(3)\nThe Athens Convention relating to the Carriage of Passengers and their Luggage by Sea 1974, as amended by the Protocol of 2002 (the Athens Convention), applies to international transport only. The distinction between national and international transport has been eliminated within the internal market in maritime transport services and it is therefore appropriate to have the same level and nature of liability in both international and national transport within the Community.\n(4)\nThe insurance arrangements required under the Athens Convention must take into consideration the financial means of ship-owners and insurance companies. Ship-owners must be in a position to manage their insurance arrangements in an economically acceptable way and, particularly in the case of small shipping companies operating national transport services, account must be taken of the seasonal nature of their operations. When setting insurance arrangements under this Regulation, account should therefore be taken of the different classes of ship.\n(5)\nIt is appropriate to oblige the carrier to make an advance payment in the event of the death of or personal injury to a passenger, whereby advance payment does not constitute recognition of liability.\n(6)\nAppropriate information on rights being conferred on passengers should be provided to those passengers prior to their journey or, where that is not possible, at the latest on departure.\n(7)\nThe Legal Committee of the IMO adopted on 19 October 2006 the IMO Reservation and Guidelines for the Implementation of the Athens Convention (the IMO Guidelines) to address certain issues under the Athens Convention, such as, in particular, compensation for terrorism-related damage. As such, the IMO Guidelines may be considered a lex specialis.\n(8)\nThis Regulation incorporates and makes binding parts of the IMO Guidelines. To that end, where it occurs in the provisions of the IMO Guidelines, the verb ‘should’ should, in particular, be understood as ‘shall’.\n(9)\nThe provisions of the Athens Convention (Annex I) and of the IMO Guidelines (Annex II) should be understood, mutatis mutandis, in the context of Community legislation.\n(10)\nThe system of liability provided for by this Regulation should be extended step-by-step to the different classes of ship as set out in Article 4 of Council Directive 98/18/EC of 17 March 1998 on safety rules and standards for passenger ships (4). Account should be taken of the consequences for fares and the ability of the market to obtain affordable insurance coverage at the level required against the policy background of strengthening passengers' rights and the seasonal nature of some of the traffic.\n(11)\nThe matters covered by Articles 17 and 17bis of the Athens Convention fall within the exclusive competence of the Community in so far as those Articles affect the rules established by Council Regulation (EC) No 44/2001 of 22 December 2000 on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters (5). To that extent, these two provisions will form part of the Community legal order when the Community accedes to the Athens Convention.\n(12)\nFor the purposes of this Regulation, the expression ‘or is registered in a Member State’ should be considered to mean that the flag State for the purposes of bareboat charter-out registration is either a Member State or a contracting party to the Athens Convention. Necessary steps should be taken by the Member States and the Commission to invite the IMO to develop guidelines on the concept of bareboat charter-out registration.\n(13)\nFor the purposes of this Regulation, the expression ‘mobility equipment’ should be considered to mean neither luggage nor vehicles within the meaning of Article 8 of the Athens Convention.\n(14)\nThe measures necessary for the implementation of this Regulation should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission (6).\n(15)\nIn particular, the Commission should be empowered to amend this Regulation in order to incorporate subsequent amendments to the international conventions, protocols, codes and resolutions related thereto. Since those measures are of general scope and are designed to amend non-essential elements of this Regulation, inter alia, by supplementing it with new non-essential elements, they must be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny provided for in Article 5a of Decision 1999/468/EC.\n(16)\nThe European Maritime Safety Agency, established by Regulation (EC) No 1406/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council (7), should assist the Commission in preparing and drafting a progress report on the functioning of the rules laid down by this Regulation.\n(17)\nThe national authorities, particularly the port authorities, play a fundamental and vital role in identifying and managing the various risks in relation to maritime safety.\n(18)\nMember States have taken the firm commitment in their Statement on Maritime Safety of 9 October 2008 to express, no later than 1 January 2012, their consent to be bound by the International Convention on Limitation of Liability for Maritime Claims, 1976, as amended by the Protocol of 1996. Member States may make use of the option provided for in Article 15(3bis) of that Convention to regulate, by means of specific provisions of this Regulation, the system of limitation of liability to be applied to passengers.\n(19)\nSince the objective of this Regulation, namely to create a single set of rules governing the rights of carriers by sea and their passengers in the event of an accident, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore, by reason of its scale and effects, be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve that objective,\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nArticle 1\nSubject matter\n1.   This Regulation lays down the Community regime relating to liability and insurance for the carriage of passengers by sea as set out in the relevant provisions of:\n(a)\nthe Athens Convention relating to the Carriage of Passengers and their Luggage by Sea, 1974, as amended by the Protocol of 2002 (the Athens Convention) as set out in Annex I; and\n(b)\nthe IMO Reservation and Guidelines for Implementation of the Athens Convention adopted by the Legal Committee of the IMO on 19 October 2006 (the IMO Guidelines) as set out in Annex II.\n2.   Furthermore, this Regulation extends the application of those provisions to carriage of passengers by sea within a single Member State on board ships of Classes A and B under Article 4 of Directive 98/18/EC, and lays down certain supplementary requirements.\n3.   No later than 30 June 2013, the Commission shall, if appropriate, present a legislative proposal in order, inter alia, to extend the scope of this Regulation to ships of Classes C and D under Article 4 of Directive 98/18/EC.\nArticle 2\nScope\nThis Regulation shall apply to any international carriage within the meaning of point 9 of Article 1 of the Athens Convention and to carriage by sea within a single Member State on board ships of Classes A and B under Article 4 of Directive 98/18/EC, where:\n(a)\nthe ship is flying the flag of or is registered in a Member State;\n(b)\nthe contract of carriage has been made in a Member State; or\n(c)\nthe place of departure or destination, according to the contract of carriage, is in a Member State.\nMember States may apply this Regulation to all domestic sea-going voyages.\nArticle 3\nLiability and insurance\n1.   The liability regime in respect of passengers, their luggage and their vehicles and the rules on insurance or other financial security shall be governed by this Regulation, by Articles 1 and 1bis, Article 2(2), Articles 3 to16 and Articles 18, 20 and 21 of the Athens Convention set out in Annex I and by the provisions of the IMO Guidelines set out in Annex II.\n2.   The IMO Guidelines as set out in Annex II shall be binding.\nArticle 4\nCompensation in respect of mobility equipment or other specific equipment\nIn the event of loss of, or damage to, mobility equipment or other specific equipment used by a passenger with reduced mobility, the liability of the carrier shall be governed by Article 3(3) of the Athens Convention. The compensation shall correspond to the replacement value of the equipment concerned or, where applicable, to the costs relating to repairs.\nArticle 5\nGlobal limitation of liability\n1.   This Regulation shall not modify the rights or duties of the carrier or performing carrier under national legislation implementing the International Convention on Limitation of Liability for Maritime Claims, 1976, as amended by the Protocol of 1996, including any future amendment thereto.\nIn the absence of any such applicable national legislation, the liability of the carrier or performing carrier shall be governed only by Article 3 of this Regulation.\n2.   In respect of claims for loss of life or personal injury to a passenger caused by any of the risks referred to in paragraph 2.2 of the IMO Guidelines the carrier and the performing carrier may limit their liability pursuant to the provisions referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article.\nArticle 6\nAdvance payment\n1.   Where the death of, or personal injury to, a passenger is caused by a shipping incident, the carrier who actually performed the whole or a part of the carriage when the shipping incident occurred shall make an advance payment sufficient to cover immediate economic needs on a basis proportionate to the damage suffered within 15 days of the identification of the person entitled to damages. In the event of the death, the payment shall not be less than EUR 21 000.\nThis provision shall also apply where the carrier is established within the Community.\n2.   An advance payment shall not constitute recognition of liability and may be offset against any subsequent sums paid on the basis of this Regulation. It shall not be refundable, except in the cases set out in Article 3(1) or Article 6 of the Athens Convention or Appendix A to the IMO Guidelines, or where the person who received it is not the person entitled to damages.\nArticle 7\nInformation to passengers\nWithout prejudice to the obligations of tour operators set out in Council Directive 90/314/EEC of 13 June 1990 on package travel, package holidays and package tours (8), the carrier and/or performing carrier shall ensure that passengers are provided with appropriate and comprehensible information regarding their rights under this Regulation.\nWhere the contract of carriage is made in a Member State, that information shall be provided at all points of sale, including sale by telephone and via the Internet. Where the place of departure is in a Member State, that information shall be provided prior to departure. In all other cases, it shall be provided at the latest on departure. To the extent that the information required under this Article has been provided by either the carrier or the performing carrier, the other shall not be obliged to provide it. The information shall be provided in the most appropriate format.\nIn order to comply with the information requirement under this Article, the carrier and performing carrier shall provide passengers with at least the information contained in a summary of the provisions of this Regulation prepared by the Commission and made public.\nArticle 8\nReporting\nNo later than three years after the date of application of this Regulation, the Commission shall draw up a report on the application of this Regulation, which shall, inter alia, take into account economic developments and developments in international fora.\nThat report may be accompanied by a proposal for amendment of this Regulation, or by a proposal for a submission to be made by the Community before the relevant international fora.\nArticle 9\nAmendments\n1.   Measures designed to amend non-essential elements of this Regulation and relating to the incorporation of amendments to the limits set out in Article 3(1), Article 4bis(1), Article 7(1) and Article 8 of the Athens Convention to take account of decisions taken pursuant to Article 23 of that Convention, as well as corresponding updates to Annex I to this Regulation, shall be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny referred to in Article 10(2) of this Regulation.\nTaking into consideration the consequences for fares and the ability of the market to obtain affordable insurance coverage at the level required against the policy background of strengthening passengers' rights, as well as the seasonal nature of some of the traffic, by 31 December 2016, the Commission shall, on the basis of a suitable impact assessment, adopt a measure relating to the limits set out in Annex I for ships of Class B under Article 4 of Directive 98/18/EC. That measure, designed to amend non-essential elements of this Regulation, shall be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny referred to in Article 10(2) of this Regulation.\n2.   Measures designed to amend non-essential elements of this Regulation and relating to the incorporation of amendments to the provisions of the IMO Guidelines set out in Annex II shall be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny referred to in Article 10(2).\nArticle 10\nCommittee procedure\n1.   The Commission shall be assisted by the Committee on Safe Seas and the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (COSS) established by Regulation (EC) No 2099/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council (9).\n2.   Where reference is made to this paragraph, Article 5a(1) to (4) and Article 7 of Decision 1999/468/EC shall apply, having regard to the provisions of Article 8 thereof.\nArticle 11\nTransitional provisions\n1.   In respect of carriage by sea within a single Member State on board ships of Class A under Article 4 of Directive 98/18/EC, Member States may choose to defer application of this Regulation until four years after the date of its application.\n2.   In respect of carriage by sea within a single Member State on board ships of Class B under Article 4 of Directive 98/18/EC, Member States may choose to defer application of this Regulation until 31 December 2018.\nArticle 12\nEntry into force\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on the day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nIt shall apply from the date of the entry into force of the Athens Convention for the Community, and in any case from no later than 31 December 2012.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.\nDone at Strasbourg, 23 April 2009.\nFor the European Parliament\nThe President\nH.-G.

Except for the application of paragraph 8 of this Article and Article 8, cabin luggage includes luggage which the passenger has in or on his vehicle;\n7.\n‘loss of or damage to luggage’ includes pecuniary loss resulting from the luggage not having been re-delivered to the passenger within a reasonable time after the arrival of the ship on which the luggage has been or should have been carried, but does not include delays resulting from labour disputes;\n8.\n‘carriage’ covers the following periods:\n(a)\nwith regard to the passenger and his cabin luggage, the period during which the passenger and/or his cabin luggage are on board the ship or in the course of embarkation or disembarkation, and the period during which the passenger and his cabin luggage are transported by water from land to the ship or vice-versa, if the cost of such transport is included in the fare or if the vessel used for this purpose of auxiliary transport has been put at the disposal of the passenger by the carrier. However, with regard to the passenger, carriage does not include the period during which he is in a marine terminal or station or on a quay or in or on any other port installation;\n(b)\nwith regard to cabin luggage, also the period during which the passenger is in a marine terminal or station or on a quay or in or on any other port installation if that luggage has been taken over by the carrier or his servant or agent and has not been re-delivered to the passenger;\n(c)\nwith regard to other luggage which is not cabin luggage, the period from the time of its taking over by the carrier or his servant or agent on shore or on board until the time of its re-delivery by the carrier or his servant or agent;\n9.\n‘international carriage’ means any carriage in which, according to the contract of carriage, the place of departure and the place of destination are situated in two different States, or in a single State if, according to the contract of carriage or the scheduled itinerary, there is an intermediate port of call in another State;\n10.\n‘Organisation’ means the International Maritime Organisation;\n11.\n‘Secretary-General’ means the Secretary-General of the Organisation.\nArticle 1bis\nAnnex\nThe Annex to this Convention shall constitute an integral part of the Convention.\nArticle 2\nApplication\n1.   […] (1)\n2.   Notwithstanding paragraph 1 of this Article, this Convention shall not apply when the carriage is subject, under any other international convention concerning the carriage of passengers or luggage by another mode of transport, to a civil liability regime under the provisions of such convention, in so far as those provisions have mandatory application to carriage by sea.\nArticle 3\nLiability of the carrier\n1.   For the loss suffered as a result of the death of or personal injury to a passenger caused by a shipping incident, the carrier shall be liable to the extent that such loss in respect of that passenger on each distinct occasion does not exceed 250 000 units of account, unless the carrier proves that the incident:\n(a)\nresulted from an act of war, hostilities, civil war, insurrection or a natural phenomenon of an exceptional, inevitable and irresistible character; or\n(b)\nwas wholly caused by an act or omission done with the intent to cause the incident by a third party.\nIf and to the extent that the loss exceeds the above limit, the carrier shall be further liable unless the carrier proves that the incident which caused the loss occurred without the fault or neglect of the carrier.\n2.   For the loss suffered as a result of the death of or personal injury to a passenger not caused by a shipping incident, the carrier shall be liable if the incident which caused the loss was due to the fault or neglect of the carrier. The burden of proving fault or neglect shall lie with the claimant.\n3.   For the loss suffered as a result of the loss of or damage to cabin luggage, the carrier shall be liable if the incident which caused the loss was due to the fault or neglect of the carrier. The fault or neglect of the carrier shall be presumed for loss caused by a shipping incident.\n4.   For the loss suffered as a result of the loss of or damage to luggage other than cabin luggage, the carrier shall be liable unless the carrier proves that the incident which caused the loss occurred without the fault or neglect of the carrier.\n5.   For the purposes of this Article:\n(a)\n‘shipping incident’ means shipwreck, capsizing, collision or stranding of the ship, explosion or fire in the ship, or defect in the ship;\n(b)\n‘fault or neglect of the carrier’ includes the fault or neglect of the servants of the carrier, acting within the scope of their employment;\n(c)\n‘defect in the ship’ means any malfunction, failure or non-compliance with applicable safety regulations in respect of any part of the ship or its equipment when used for the escape, evacuation, embarkation and disembarkation of passengers, or when used for the propulsion, steering, safe navigation, mooring, anchoring, arriving at or leaving berth or anchorage, or damage control after flooding; or when used for the launching of life saving appliances; and\n(d)\n‘loss’ shall not include punitive or exemplary damages.\n6.   The liability of the carrier under this Article only relates to loss arising from incidents that occurred in the course of the carriage. The burden of proving that the incident which caused the loss occurred in the course of the carriage, and the extent of the loss, shall lie with the claimant.\n7.   Nothing in this Convention shall prejudice any right of recourse of the carrier against any third party, or the defence of contributory negligence under Article 6 of this Convention. Nothing in this Article shall prejudice any right of limitation under Articles 7 or 8 of this Convention.\n8.   Presumptions of fault or neglect of a party or the allocation of the burden of proof to a party shall not prevent evidence in favour of that party from being considered.\nArticle 4\nPerforming carrier\n1.   If the performance of the carriage or part thereof has been entrusted to a performing carrier, the carrier shall nevertheless remain liable for the entire carriage according to the provisions of this Convention. In addition, the performing carrier shall be subject and entitled to the provisions of this Convention for the part of the carriage performed by him.\n2.   The carrier shall, in relation to the carriage performed by the performing carrier, be liable for the acts and omissions of the performing carrier and of his servants and agents acting within the scope of their employment.\n3.   Any special agreement under which the carrier assumes obligations not imposed by this Convention or any waiver of rights conferred by this Convention shall affect the performing carrier only if agreed by him expressly and in writing.\n4.   Where and to the extent that both the carrier and the performing carrier are liable, their liability shall be joint and several.\n5.   Nothing in this Article shall prejudice any right of recourse as between the carrier and the performing carrier.\nArticle 4bis\nCompulsory insurance\n1.   When passengers are carried on board a ship registered in a State Party that is licensed to carry more than twelve passengers, and this Convention applies, any carrier who actually performs the whole or a part of the carriage shall maintain insurance or other financial security, such as the guarantee of a bank or similar financial institution, to cover liability under this Convention in respect of the death of and personal injury to passengers. The limit of the compulsory insurance or other financial security shall not be less than 250 000 units of account per passenger on each distinct occasion.\n2.   A certificate attesting that insurance or other financial security is in force in accordance with the provisions of this Convention shall be issued to each ship after the appropriate authority of a State Party has determined that the requirements of paragraph 1 have been complied with. With respect to a ship registered in a State Party, such certificate shall be issued or certified by the appropriate authority of the State of the ship's registry; with respect to a ship not registered in a State Party it may be issued or certified by the appropriate authority of any State Party. This certificate shall be in the form of the model set out in the annex to this Convention and shall contain the following particulars:\n(a)\nname of ship, distinctive number or letters and port of registry;\n(b)\nname and principal place of business of the carrier who actually performs the whole or a part of the carriage;\n(c)\nIMO ship identification number;\n(d)\ntype and duration of security;\n(e)\nname and principal place of business of insurer or other person providing financial security and, where appropriate, place of business where the insurance or other financial security is established; and\n(f)\nperiod of validity of the certificate, which shall not be longer than the period of validity of the insurance or other financial security.\n3.\n(a)\nA State Party may authorise an institution or an organisation recognised by it to issue the certificate. Such institution or organisation shall inform that State of the issue of each certificate. In all cases, the State Party shall fully guarantee the completeness and accuracy of the certificate so issued, and shall undertake to ensure the necessary arrangements to satisfy this obligation.\n(b)\nA State Party shall notify the Secretary-General of:\n(i)\nthe specific responsibilities and conditions of the authority delegated to an institution or organisation recognised by it;\n(ii)\nthe withdrawal of such authority; and\n(iii)\nthe date from which such authority or withdrawal of such authority takes effect.\nAn authority delegated shall not take effect prior to three months from the date on which notification to that effect was given to the Secretary-General.\n(c)\nThe institution or organisation authorised to issue certificates in accordance with this paragraph shall, as a minimum, be authorised to withdraw these certificates if the conditions under which they have been issued are not complied with. In all cases the institution or organisation shall report such withdrawal to the State on whose behalf the certificate was issued.\n4.   The certificate shall be in the official language or languages of the issuing State. If the language used is not English, French or Spanish, the text shall include a translation into one of these languages, and, where the State so decides, the official language of the State may be omitted.\n5.   The certificate shall be carried on board the ship, and a copy shall be deposited with the authorities who keep the record of the ship's registry or, if the ship is not registered in a State Party, with the authority of the State issuing or certifying the certificate.\n6.   An insurance or other financial security shall not satisfy the requirements of this Article if it can cease, for reasons other than the expiry of the period of validity of the insurance or security specified in the certificate, before three months have elapsed from the date on which notice of its termination is given to the authorities referred to in paragraph 5, unless the certificate has been surrendered to these authorities or a new certificate has been issued within the said period. The foregoing provisions shall similarly apply to any modification which results in the insurance or other financial security no longer satisfying the requirements of this Article.\n7.   The State of the ship's registry shall, subject to the provisions of this Article, determine the conditions of issue and validity of the certificate.\n8.   Nothing in this Convention shall be construed as preventing a State Party from relying on information obtained from other States or the Organisation or other international organisations relating to the financial standing of providers of insurance or other financial security for the purposes of this Convention. In such cases, the State Party relying on such information is not relieved of its responsibility as a State issuing the certificate.\n9.   Certificates issued or certified under the authority of a State Party shall be accepted by other States Parties for the purposes of this Convention and shall be regarded by other States Parties as having the same force as certificates issued or certified by them, even if issued or certified in respect of a ship not registered in a State Party. A State Party may at any time request consultation with the issuing or certifying State should it believe that the insurer or guarantor named in the insurance certificate is not financially capable of meeting the obligations imposed by this Convention.\n10.   Any claim for compensation covered by insurance or other financial security pursuant to this Article may be brought directly against the insurer or other person providing financial security. In such case, the amount set out in paragraph 1 applies as the limit of liability of the insurer or other person providing financial security, even if the carrier or the performing carrier is not entitled to limitation of liability. The defendant may further invoke the defences (other than the bankruptcy or winding up) which the carrier referred to in paragraph 1 would have been entitled to invoke in accordance with this Convention. Furthermore, the defendant may invoke the defence that the damage resulted from the wilful misconduct of the assured, but the defendant shall not invoke any other defence which the defendant might have been entitled to invoke in proceedings brought by the assured against the defendant. The defendant shall in any event have the right to require the carrier and the performing carrier to be joined in the proceedings.\n11.   Any sums provided by insurance or by other financial security maintained in accordance with paragraph 1 shall be available exclusively for the satisfaction of claims under this Convention, and any payments made of such sums shall discharge any liability arising under this Convention to the extent of the amounts paid.\n12.   A State Party shall not permit a ship under its flag to which this Article applies to operate at any time unless a certificate has been issued under paragraphs 2 or 15.\n13.   Subject to the provisions of this Article, each State Party shall ensure, under its national law, that insurance or other financial security, to the extent specified in paragraph 1, is in force in respect of any ship that is licensed to carry more than twelve passengers, wherever registered, entering or leaving a port in its territory in so far as this Convention applies.\n14.   Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 5, a State Party may notify the Secretary-General that, for the purposes of paragraph 13, ships are not required to carry on board or to produce the certificate required by paragraph 2 when entering or leaving ports in its territory, provided that the State Party which issues the certificate has notified the Secretary-General that it maintains records in an electronic format, accessible to all States Parties, attesting the existence of the certificate and enabling States Parties to discharge their obligations under paragraph 13.\n15.   If insurance or other financial security is not maintained in respect of a ship owned by a State Party, the provisions of this Article relating thereto shall not be applicable to such ship, but the ship shall carry a certificate issued by the appropriate authorities of the State of the ship's registry, stating that the ship is owned by that State and that the liability is covered within the amount prescribed in accordance with paragraph 1. Such a certificate shall follow as closely as possible the model prescribed by paragraph 2.\nArticle 5\nValuables\nThe carrier shall not be liable for the loss of or damage to monies, negotiable securities, gold, silverware, jewellery, ornaments, works of art, or other valuables, except where such valuables have been deposited with the carrier for the agreed purpose of safe-keeping in which case the carrier shall be liable up to the limit provided for in paragraph 3 of Article 8 unless a higher limit is agreed upon in accordance with paragraph 1 of Article 10.\nArticle 6\nContributory fault\nIf the carrier proves that the death of or personal injury to a passenger or the loss of or damage to his luggage was caused or contributed to by the fault or neglect of the passenger, the Court seized of the case may exonerate the carrier wholly or partly from his liability in accordance with the provisions of the law of that court.\nArticle 7\nLimit of liability for death and personal injury\n1.   The liability of the carrier for the death of or personal injury to a passenger under Article 3 shall in no case exceed 400 000 units of account per passenger on each distinct occasion. Where, in accordance with the law of the court seized of the case, damages are awarded in the form of periodical income payments, the equivalent capital value of those payments shall not exceed the said limit.\n2.   A State Party may regulate by specific provisions of national law the limit of liability prescribed in paragraph 1, provided that the national limit of liability, if any, is not lower than that prescribed in paragraph 1.

The Unit of Account mentioned in this Convention is the Special Drawing Right as defined by the International Monetary Fund. The amounts mentioned in Article 3(1), Article 4bis(1), Article 7(l) and Article 8 shall be converted into the national currency of the State of the court seized of the case on the basis of the value of that currency by reference to the Special Drawing Right on the date of the judgment or the date agreed upon by the parties. The value of the national currency, in terms of the Special Drawing Right, of a State Party which is a member of the International Monetary Fund, shall be calculated in accordance with the method of valuation applied by the International Monetary Fund in effect on the date in question for its operations and transactions. The value of the national currency, in terms of the Special Drawing Right, of a State Party which is not a member of the International Monetary Fund, shall be calculated in a manner determined by that State Party.\n2.   Nevertheless, a State which is not a member of the International Monetary Fund and whose law does not permit the application of the provisions of paragraph 1 may, at the time of ratification, acceptance, approval of or accession to this Convention or at any time thereafter, declare that the Unit of Account referred to in paragraph 1 shall be equal to 15 gold francs. The gold franc referred to in this paragraph corresponds to sixty-five and a half milligrams of gold of millesimal fineness nine hundred. The conversion of the gold franc into the national currency shall be made according to the law of the State concerned.\n3.   The calculation mentioned in the last sentence of paragraph 1, and the conversion mentioned in paragraph 2 shall be made in such a manner as to express in the national currency of the States Parties, as far as possible, the same real value for the amounts in Article 3(1), Article 4bis(1), Article 7(1) and Article 8 as would result from the application of the first three sentences of paragraph 1. States shall communicate to the Secretary-General the manner of calculation pursuant to paragraph 1, or the result of the conversion in paragraph 2, as the case may be, when depositing an instrument of ratification, acceptance, approval of or accession to this Convention and whenever there is a change in either.\nArticle 10\nSupplementary provisions on limits of liability\n1.   The carrier and the passenger may agree, expressly and in writing, to higher limits of liability than those prescribed in Articles 7 and 8.\n2.   Interest on damages and legal costs shall not be included in the limits of liability prescribed in Articles 7 and 8.\nArticle 11\nDefences and limits for carriers' servants\nIf an action is brought against a servant or agent of the carrier or of the performing carrier arising out of damage covered by this Convention, such servant or agent, if he proves that he acted within the scope of his employment, shall be entitled to avail himself of the defences and limits of liability which the carrier or the performing carrier is entitled to invoke under this Convention.\nArticle 12\nAggregation of claims\n1.   Where the limits of liability prescribed in Articles 7 and 8 take effect, they shall apply to the aggregate of the amounts recoverable in all claims arising out of the death of or personal injury to any one passenger or the loss of or damage to his luggage.\n2.   In relation to the carriage performed by a performing carrier, the aggregate of the amounts recoverable from the carrier and the performing carrier and from their servants and agents acting within the scope of their employment shall not exceed the highest amount which could be awarded against either the carrier or the performing carrier under this Convention, but none of the persons mentioned shall be liable for a sum in excess of the limit applicable to him.\n3.   In any case where a servant or agent of the carrier or of the performing carrier is entitled under Article 11 of this Convention to avail himself of the limits of liability prescribed in Articles 7 and 8, the aggregate of the amounts recoverable from the carrier, or the performing carrier as the case may be, and from that servant or agent, shall not exceed those limits.\nArticle 13\nLoss of right to limit liability\n1.   The carrier shall not be entitled to the benefit of the limits of liability prescribed in Articles 7 and 8 and Article 10(1), if it is proved that the damage resulted from an act or omission of the carrier done with the intent to cause such damage, or recklessly and with knowledge that such damage would probably result.\n2.   The servant or agent of the carrier or of the performing carrier shall not be entitled to the benefit of those limits if it is proved that the damage resulted from an act or omission of that servant or agent done with the intent to cause such damage, or recklessly and with knowledge that such damage would probably result.\nArticle 14\nBasis for claims\nNo action for damages for the death of or personal injury to a passenger, or for the loss of or damage to luggage, shall be brought against a carrier or performing carrier otherwise than in accordance with this Convention.\nArticle 15\nNotice of loss or damage to luggage\n1.   The passenger shall give written notice to the carrier or his agent:\n(a)\nin the case of apparent damage to luggage:\n(i)\nfor cabin luggage, before or at the time of disembarkation of the passenger;\n(ii)\nfor all other luggage, before or at the time of its re-delivery;\n(b)\nin the case of damage to luggage which is not apparent, or loss of luggage, within 15 days from the date of disembarkation or re-delivery or from the time when such re-delivery should have taken place.\n2.   If the passenger fails to comply with this Article, he shall be presumed, unless the contrary is proved, to have received the luggage undamaged.\n3.   The notice in writing need not be given if the condition of the luggage has at the time of its receipt been the subject of joint survey or inspection.\nArticle 16\nTime-bar for actions\n1.   Any action for damages arising out of the death of or personal injury to a passenger or for the loss of or damage to luggage shall be time-barred after a period of two years.\n2.   The limitation period shall be calculated as follows:\n(a)\nin the case of personal injury, from the date of disembarkation of the passenger;\n(b)\nin the case of death occurring during carriage, from the date when the passenger should have disembarked, and in the case of personal injury occurring during carriage and resulting in the death of the passenger after disembarkation, from the date of death, provided that this period shall not exceed three years from the date of disembarkation;\n(c)\nin the case of loss of or damage to luggage, from the date of disembarkation or from the date when disembarkation should have taken place, whichever is later.\n3.   The law of the Court seized of the case shall govern the grounds for suspension and interruption of limitation periods, but in no case shall an action under this Convention be brought after the expiration of any one of the following periods of time:\n(a)\na period of five years beginning with the date of disembarkation of the passenger or from the date when disembarkation should have taken place, whichever is later; or, if earlier;\n(b)\na period of three years beginning with the date when the claimant knew or ought reasonably to have known of the injury, loss or damage caused by the incident.\n4.   Notwithstanding paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 of this Article, the period of limitation may be extended by a declaration of the carrier or by agreement of the parties after the cause of action has arisen. The declaration or agreement shall be in writing.\nArticle 17\nCompetent jurisdiction (2)\nArticle 17bis\nRecognition and enforcement (2)\nArticle 18\nInvalidity of contractual provisions\nAny contractual provision concluded before the occurrence of the incident which has caused the death of or personal injury to a passenger or the loss of or damage to the passenger's luggage, purporting to relieve any person liable under this Convention of liability towards the passenger or to prescribe a lower limit of liability than that fixed in this Convention except as provided in Article 8, paragraph 4, and any such provision purporting to shift the burden of proof which rests on the carrier or performing carrier, or having the effect of restricting the options specified in Article 17, paragraphs 1 or 2, shall be null and void, but the nullity of that provision shall not render void the contract of carriage which shall remain subject to the provisions of this Convention.\nArticle 20\nNuclear damage\nNo liability shall arise under this Convention for damage caused by a nuclear incident:\n(a)\nif the operator of a nuclear installation is liable for such damage under either the Paris Convention of 29 July 1960 on Third Party Liability in the Field of Nuclear Energy as amended by its Additional Protocol of 28 January 1964, or the Vienna Convention of 21 May 1963 on Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage, or any amendment or Protocol thereto which is in force; or\n(b)\nif the operator of a nuclear installation is liable for such damage by virtue of a national law governing the liability for such damage, provided that such law is in all respects as favourable to persons who may suffer damage as either the Paris or the Vienna Conventions or any amendment or Protocol thereto which is in force.\nArticle 21\nCommercial carriage by public authorities\nThis Convention shall apply to commercial carriage undertaken by States or Public Authorities under contract of carriage within the meaning of Article 1.\n[Articles 22 and 23 of the Protocol of 2002 to the Athens Convention relating to the Carriage of Passengers and their Luggage by Sea, 1974]\nArticle 22\nRevision and amendment (3)\nArticle 23\nAmendment of limits\n1.   Without prejudice to the provisions of Article 22, the special procedure in this Article shall apply solely for the purposes of amending the limits set out in Article 3(1), Article 4bis(1), Article 7(1) and Article 8 of the Convention as revised by this Protocol.\n2.   Upon the request of at least one half, but in no case less than six, of the States Parties to this Protocol, any proposal to amend the limits, including the deductibles, specified in Article 3(1), Article 4bis(1), Article 7(1) and Article 8 of the Convention as revised by this Protocol shall be circulated by the Secretary General to all Members of the Organisation and to all States Parties.\n3.

Any amendment adopted in accordance with paragraph 5 shall be notified by the Organisation to all States Parties. The amendment shall be deemed to have been accepted at the end of a period of 18 months after the date of notification, unless within that period not less than one fourth of the States that were States Parties at the time of the adoption of the amendment have communicated to the Secretary General that they do not accept the amendment, in which case the amendment is rejected and shall have no effect.\n9.   An amendment deemed to have been accepted in accordance with paragraph 8 shall enter into force 18 months after its acceptance.\n10.

It introduces into European law the provisions of the 1974 Athens Convention on the carriage of passengers and their luggage by sea and guidelines from the International Maritime Organisation.\nKEY POINTS\nThe legislation applies to all ships flying an EU country flag, travelling to or from a European port, or under a European contract of carriage (i.e. a contract between the carrier and its passengers defining rights, duties and liabilities).\nThe legislation currently applies to both international and domestic voyages, but it does not apply to domestic voyages in the course of which the ship is less than 5 miles from the coastline.\nThe operators’ liability covers passengers and their luggage and vehicles, as well as mobility equipment for persons with reduced mobility.\nFor any injury or damage caused by a shipping incident (i.e. shipwreck, capsizing, collision or stranding, fire or explosion, or other defect of the ship), victims do not need to prove fault on the part of the carrier in order to be compensated.\nShip operators must make an advance payment to cover the immediate economic needs of a passenger who is killed or injured in a shipping incident. This payment does not imply the shipping company acknowledges liability.\nThe minimum advance payment for the death of a passenger is €21,000.\nShipping companies must provide passengers with understandable information on their rights.\nThis information must be available at all points of sale, including by phone and the internet, and provided before, or at the latest on, departure.\nThe European Commission, no later than 3 years after the legislation takes effect (31 December 2012), must produce a report on how it is being applied.\nEU governments may postpone application of the legislation for ships involved in purely domestic voyages covered by the regulation. For vessels which travel less than 20 miles from the shore, the deadline is 31 December 2018 at the latest. For all others, the deadline is 31 December 2016.\nSINCE WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?\n                     \nFrom 29 May 2009.\nFor more information, see Passenger rights on the European Commission’s website.\nREFERENCES\nAct\nEntry into force\nDeadline for transposition in the Member States\nOfficial Journal\nRegulation (EC) No 392/2009\n29.5.2009\n-\nOJ L 131, 28.5.2009, pp. 24-46\nlast update 30.09.2015", "tags": ["indemnification", "liability", "carriage of passengers", "maritime transport", "carrier", "maritime safety", "transport accident"], "subjects": ["Internal market - Principles", "Transport"], "split": "test", "reference_annotations": {}, "summary_annotations": {}}
