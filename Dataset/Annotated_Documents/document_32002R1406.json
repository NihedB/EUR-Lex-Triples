In order to be effective, such legislation must be applied in a proper and uniform manner throughout the Community. This will ensure a level playing field, reduce the distortion of competition resulting from the economic advantages enjoyed by non-complying ships and will reward the serious maritime players.(2) Certain tasks currently done at Community or national level could be executed by a specialised expert body. Indeed, there is a need for technical and scientific support and a high level of stable expertise to properly apply the Community legislation in the fields of maritime safety and ship pollution prevention, to monitor its implementation and to evaluate the effectiveness of the measures in place. There is a need therefore, within the Community's existing institutional structure and balance of powers, to establish a European Maritime Safety Agency (\"the Agency\").(3) In general terms, the Agency should represent the technical body providing the Community with the necessary means to act effectively to enhance overall maritime safety and ship pollution prevention rules. The Agency should assist the Commission in the continuous process of updating and developing Community legislation in the field of maritime safety and prevention of pollution by ships and should provide the necessary support to ensure the convergent and effective implementation of such legislation throughout the Community by assisting the Commission in performing the tasks assigned to the latter by existing and future Community legislation on maritime safety and ship pollution prevention.(4) For the proper achievement of the purposes for which the Agency is established, it is appropriate that the Agency carries out a number of other important tasks aimed at enhancing maritime safety and ship pollution prevention in the waters of the Member States. In this respect, the Agency should work with Member States to organise appropriate training activities on port State control and flag State related issues and to provide technical assistance related to the implementation of Community legislation. It should facilitate cooperation between the Member States and the Commission as provided for in Directive 2002/59/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 June 2002 establishing a Community vessel traffic monitoring and information system and repealing Council Directive 93/75/EEC(5), namely by developing and operating any information system necessary for the objectives of that Directive, and in the activities concerning the investigations related to serious maritime accidents. It should provide the Commission and the Member States with objective, reliable and comparable information and data on maritime safety and on ship pollution prevention to enable them to take any necessary initiatives to enhance the measures in place and to evaluate their effectiveness. It should place the Community maritime safety know-how at the disposal of the States applying for accession. It should be open to the participation of these States and to other third countries which have concluded agreements with the Community whereby they adopt and implement Community legislation in the field of maritime safety and prevention of pollution by ships.(5) The Agency should favour the establishment of better cooperation between the Member States and should develop and disseminate best practices in the Community. This in turn should contribute to enhancing the overall maritime safety system in the Community as well as reducing the risk of maritime accidents, marine pollution and the loss of human lives at sea.(6) In order properly to carry out the tasks entrusted to the Agency, it is appropriate that its officials carry out visits to the Member States in order to monitor the overall functioning of the Community maritime safety and ship pollution prevention system. The visits should be carried out in accordance with a policy to be established by the Agency's Administrative Board and should be facilitated by the authorities of the Member States.(7) The Agency should apply the relevant Community legislation concerning public access to documents and the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data. It should give the public and any interested party objective, reliable and easily understandable information with regard to its work.(8) For the contractual liability of the Agency, which is governed by the law applicable to the contracts concluded by the Agency, the Court of Justice should have jurisdiction to give judgment pursuant to any arbitration clause contained in the contract. The Court of Justice should also have jurisdiction in disputes relating to compensation for any damage arising from the non-contractual liability of the Agency.(9) In order to effectively ensure the accomplishment of the functions of the Agency, the Member States and the Commission should be represented on an Administrative Board entrusted with the necessary powers to establish the budget, verify its execution, adopt the appropriate financial rules, establish transparent working procedures for decision making by the Agency, approve its work programme, examine requests for technical assistance from Member States, define a policy for visits to the Member States and appoint the Executive Director. In the light of the highly technical and scientific mission and tasks of the Agency, it is appropriate for the Administrative Board to consist of one representative of each Member State and four representatives of the Commission, being members with a high level of expertise. In order further to ensure the highest level of expertise and experience in the Administrative Board and with a view to involving the sectors most closely concerned in the tasks of the Agency, the Commission should nominate independent professionals from these sectors as board members without the right to vote, on the basis of their personal merit and experience in the field of maritime safety and prevention of pollution by ships and not as representatives of particular professional organisations.(10) The good functioning of the Agency requires that its Executive Director be appointed on the grounds of merit and documented administrative and managerial skills, as well as competence and experience relevant for maritime safety and prevention of pollution by ships and that he/she performs his/her duties with complete independence and flexibility as to the organisation of the internal functioning of the Agency. To this end, the Executive Director should prepare and take all necessary steps to ensure the proper accomplishment of the working programme of the Agency, should prepare each year a draft general report to be submitted to the Administrative Board, should draw up estimates of the revenues and expenditure of the Agency and should implement the budget.(11) In order to guarantee the full autonomy and independence of the Agency, it is considered necessary to grant it an autonomous budget whose revenue comes essentially from a contribution from the Community.(12) Over the past years, as more decentralised agencies have been created, the budgetary authority has looked to improve transparency and control over the management of the Community funding allocated to them, in particular concerning the budgetisation of the fees, financial control, power of discharge, pension scheme contributions and the internal budgetary procedure (code of conduct). In a similar way, Regulation (EC) No 1073/1999 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 May 1999 concerning investigations conducted by the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF)(6) should apply without restriction to the Agency, which should accede to the Interinstitutional Agreement of 25 May 1999 between the European Parliament, the Council of the European Union and the Commission of the European Communities concerning internal investigations by the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF)(7).(13) Within five years from the date of the Agency having taken up its responsibilities, the Administrative Board should commission an independent external evaluation in order to assess the impact of this Regulation, the Agency and its working practices on establishing a high level of maritime safety and prevention of pollution by ships,HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:CHAPTER IOBJECTIVES AND TASKSArticle 1Objectives1.

The agency may also provide operational support concerning investigations where there have been deaths or serious injuries.\nSupport tasks\nEMSA only assumes these tasks if they create substantial added value, avoid duplication of effort and do not infringe on Member States’ rights and obligations. These tasks relate to environmental matters, the global monitoring for environment and security programme (now Copernicus) and inland waterways.\nEMSA visits and inspections\nEMSA visits Member States to assist the Commission and national administrations in:\nchecking whether EU rules are being implemented effectively;\nensuring a high and uniform level of safety. The agency carries out inspections with classification societies, as well as in non-EU countries regarding the training and certification of seafarers.\nStructure\nEMSA is an EU body and has legal personality. Its staff consists of officials recruited by the agency and EU officials and Member States’ civil servants temporarily assigned or seconded to the agency. It is headed by an executive director who is completely independent in the performance of his/her duties.\nIts administrative board comprises representatives from the Commission and each Member State, all of whom have a vote. It also includes representatives from Iceland and Norway, and professionals from four maritime sectors, none of whom can vote. Its term of office is 5 years and is renewable once.\nRelationship between EMSA and the European Border and Coast Guard\nRegulation (EU) 2016/1624, later replaced and repealed by Regulation (EU) 2019/1896 (see summary), set up a European Border and Coast Guard to ensure the effective implementation of integrated border management at the EU’s external borders, as well as those of the Schengen associate countries (Iceland, Norway and Switzerland).\nRegulation (EU) 2016/1625 amends Regulation (EC) No 1406/2002 to strengthen the cooperation between the EMSA, the European Border and Coast Guard Agency, the European Fisheries Control Agency (set up under Regulation (EU) 2019/473) and the national authorities carrying out coastguard functions, to increase maritime situational awareness and to support coherent and cost-efficient action. This involves: sharing information available in ship reporting systems and other information systems;providing surveillance and communication services;building capacity and establishing best practices, and training and exchanging staff;sharing information and cooperation on coastguard functions, including by analysing operational challenges and emerging risks in the maritime domain;sharing capacity by planning and implementing multipurpose operations and by sharing assets and other capabilities.\nFROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?\n              \nIt has applied since 25 August 2002.\nBACKGROUND\nTwo accidents (the Erika in 1999 and the Prestige in 2002) resulted in serious oil spills in European waters.
