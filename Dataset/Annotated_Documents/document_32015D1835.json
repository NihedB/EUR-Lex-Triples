{"celex_id": "32015D1835", "reference": "13.10.2015\nEN\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\nL 266/55\nCOUNCIL DECISION (CFSP) 2015/1835\nof 12 October 2015\ndefining the statute, seat and operational rules of the European Defence Agency\n(recast)\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on European Union, and in particular Articles 42 and 45 thereof,\nWhereas:\n(1)\nThe European Defence Agency (‘the Agency’) was established by Council Joint Action 2004/551/CFSP (1) to support the Council and Member States in their effort to improve the Union's defence capabilities in the field of crisis management and to sustain the European Security and Defence Policy.\n(2)\nThe European Security Strategy, endorsed by the European Council on 12 December 2003, identifies the establishment of a defence agency as an important element towards the development of more flexible and efficient European military resources.\n(3)\nThe report on the implementation of the European Security Strategy of 11 December 2008 endorses the Agency's leading role in the process of developing key defence capabilities for the Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP).\n(4)\nArticle 45 of the Treaty on European Union (TEU) provides for the adoption, by the Council, of a decision defining the Agency's statute, seat and operational rules, which should take account of the level of effective participation of the Member States in the Agency's activities.\n(5)\nThe Agency should contribute to the implementation of the Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP), in particular the CSDP.\n(6)\nThe structure of the Agency should enable it to respond to the operational requirements of the Union and its Member States for the CSDP and, where necessary to fulfil its functions, to cooperate with third countries, organisations and entities.\n(7)\nThe Agency should develop close working relations with existing arrangements, groupings and organisations such as those established under the Letter of Intent Framework Agreement (‘LoI Framework Agreement’), as well as the Organisation Conjointe de Coopération en matière d'Armement (OCCAR) and the European Space Agency (ESA).\n(8)\nFor the purpose of fulfilling its mission, the Agency should be able to cooperate, and to conclude appropriate arrangements, with the Union's institutions, bodies, offices and agencies.\n(9)\nIn accordance with Article 18(2) TEU, the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy (HR) should have a leading role in the Agency's structure and provide the essential link between the Agency and the Council.\n(10)\nIn the exercise of its role of political supervision and policy-making, the Council should issue guidelines or guidance to the Agency.\n(11)\nIn view of their nature, the conclusion of administrative arrangements between the Agency and third countries, organisations and entities should be approved by the Council acting unanimously.\n(12)\nWhen adopting guidelines, guidance and decisions in relation to the work of the Agency, the Council should meet at the level of Defence Ministers. Any guidelines, guidance or decisions adopted by the Council in relation with the Agency's work should be prepared in accordance with Article 240 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU).\n(13)\nThe competences of the Council's preparatory and advisory bodies, in particular those of the Committee of Permanent Representatives under Article 240 TFEU, the Political and Security Committee (PSC) under Article 38 TEU and the EU Military Committee (EUMC) should remain unaffected.\n(14)\nThe National Armaments Directors (NAD), Capability Directors, Research & Technology (R&T) Directors and Defence Policy Directors should receive reports and contribute on issues within their competence in the preparation of Council decisions relating to the Agency.\n(15)\nThe Agency should have the legal personality necessary to perform its functions and attain its objectives, while maintaining close links with the Council and fully respecting the responsibilities of the Union and its institutions.\n(16)\nIt should be provided that the budgets administered by the Agency may, on a case-by-case basis, receive contributions from the general budget of the Union, in full respect of the rules, procedures and decision-making processes applicable to it, including Article 41(2) TEU.\n(17)\nThe Agency, while being open to participation by all Member States, should also provide for the possibility of specific groups of Member States establishing ad hoc projects or programmes.\n(18)\nThe fact that these ad hoc projects and programmes fall within the functions and tasks attributed to the Agency is underpinned by the efforts made to clarify the status of these activities as integral components of the Agency's budget. It should ensure that only activities where the role of the Agency in administering projects or programmes in support of Member States brings an added value can benefit from the exemption in Article 3 of Protocol No 7 on the privileges and immunities of the European Union (‘Protocol No 7’), annexed to the TEU and the TFEU, and point (aa) of Article 151(1) of Council Directive 2006/112/EC (2). For such exemption to apply, the Agency has to have an added-value role. The exemption would therefore not extend to cases where that role merely entails goods or services being procured for the Member States.\n(19)\nSubject to a Council decision on the establishment of permanent structured cooperation, in accordance with Article 42(6) and Article 46 TEU and with Protocol No 10 on permanent structured cooperation established by Article 42 TEU (‘Protocol No 10’), annexed to the TEU and the TFEU, the Agency should support the implementation of permanent structured cooperation.\n(20)\nThe Agency should have decision-making procedures allowing it to fulfil its tasks efficiently, while respecting the national security and defence policies of participating Member States.\n(21)\nThe Agency should fulfil its mission in full respect of Article 40 TEU.\n(22)\nThe Agency should act in full compliance with the Council's security standards and rules. The Agency should apply the relevant Union legislation concerning public access to documents, as set out in Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council (3), and the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data as set out in Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council (4).\n(23)\nIn accordance with Article 5 of Protocol No 22 on the position of Denmark, annexed to the TEU and to the TFEU, Denmark does not participate in the elaboration and implementation of decisions and actions of the Union which have defence implications. Denmark will therefore not be bound by this Decision.\n(24)\nA number of amendments are to be made to Council Decision 2011/411/CFSP (5). In the interest of clarity, that Decision should be recast,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\nCHAPTER I\nESTABLISHMENT, MISSION AND TASKS OF THE AGENCY\nArticle 1\nEstablishment\n1.

The contribution of each Member State from whom a contribution is due shall be proportional to the share of that Member State's GNI in the total GNI aggregate of the Member States from whom a contribution is due.\n2.   Schedule for payment of contributions:\n(a)\nThe contributions intended to finance the Agency's general budget shall be paid by the participating Member States in three equal instalments, by 15 March, 15 June and 15 October of the financial year concerned.\n(b)\nWhen an amending budget is adopted, the necessary contributions shall be paid by the Member States concerned within 60 days of dispatch of the call for contributions.\n(c)\nEach Member State shall pay the bank charges relating to the payment of its own contributions.\n(d)\nIf the annual budget is not approved by 30 November, the Agency may issue, at the request of a Member State, an individual provisional call for contributions for that Member State.\nArticle 17\nManagement by the Agency of budgets associated with ad hoc activities\n1.

The financial provisions applicable to the Agency's general budget are set out in Council Decision 2007/643/CFSP (10). The Steering Board, acting by unanimity, shall review and amend these provisions, as necessary.\n2.   The Steering Board, acting on a proposal from the Chief Executive, shall as necessary adopt the implementing rules regarding the implementation and control of the general budget, notably as regards public procurement, without prejudice to relevant Union rules.

objectives and evaluate their capability commitments,\npromote the harmonisation of operational needs (e.g. by promoting and coordinating harmonisation of military requirements or by promoting cost-effective and efficient procurement by identifying and disseminating best practice),\nintroduce projects to fulfil military capability objectives and ensure coordination programmes are implemented by EU countries,\nsupport defence technology research and coordinate/plan joint research activities,\ncontribute to strengthening the EU defence sector’s industrial base to improve the effectiveness of military expenditure,\npursue coherence with other EU policies which have defence implications,\nfoster deeper defence cooperation between EU countries,\nprovide support for CSDP operations.\nGovernance of the EDA:\nThe EDA is headquartered in Brussels and is under the political supervision and the authority of the Council of the EU, to which it reports and from which it receives guidelines.\nThe High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy is the Head of Agency, who leads the Steering Board and provides the link between the EDA and the Council.\nThe Chief Executive of the EDA, assisted by the Deputy Chief Executive, is responsible for the oversight and coordination of the EDA's work. They are appointed by the Steering Board.\nThe decision-making body of the EDA is the Steering Board, which is comprised of Defence Ministers from each EU country (except for Denmark) and a European Commission representative. It meets at least twice a year to decide on matters including the annual budget, work programme and new initiatives.\nFunding:\nThe operating costs of the EDA are funded by EU countries (except for Denmark) in proportion to their gross national income (GNI).\nIndividual projects are funded separately by the participating EU countries.\nFROM WHEN DOES THE DECISION APPLY?\n              \nIt applies from 13 October 2015.\nBACKGROUND\n              \nThe EDA was established in 2004.
