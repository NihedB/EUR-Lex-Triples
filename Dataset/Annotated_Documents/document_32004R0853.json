This is particularly the case for food of animal origin, in which microbiological and chemical hazards have frequently been reported.\n(3)\nIn the context of the common agricultural policy, many Directives have been adopted to establish specific health rules for the production and placing on the market of the products listed in Annex I to the Treaty. These health rules have reduced trade barriers for the products concerned, contributing to the creation of the internal market while ensuring a high level of protection of public health.\n(4)\nWith regard to public health, these rules contain common principles, in particular in relation to the manufacturers' and competent authorities' responsibilities, structural, operational and hygiene requirements for establishments, procedures for the approval of establishments, requirements for storage and transport and health marks.\n(5)\nThese principles constitute a common basis for the hygienic production of food of animal origin, permitting the simplification of the existing Directives.\n(6)\nIt is desirable to achieve further simplification by applying the same rules wherever appropriate to all products of animal origin.\n(7)\nThe requirement in Regulation (EC) No /2004 (5) whereby food business operators carrying out any stage of production, processing and distribution of food after primary production and associated operations must put in place, implement and maintain procedures based on hazard analysis and critical control point (HACCP) principles also permits simplification.\n(8)\nTaken together, these elements justify a recasting of the specific hygiene rules contained in existing Directives.\n(9)\nThe principal objectives of the recasting are to secure a high level of consumer protection with regard to food safety, in particular by making food business operators throughout the Community subject to the same rules, and to ensure the proper functioning of the internal market in products of animal origin, thus contributing to the achievement of the objectives of the common agricultural policy.\n(10)\nIt is necessary to maintain and, where required to ensure consumer protection, to tighten detailed hygiene rules for products of animal origin.\n(11)\nCommunity rules should not apply either to primary production for private domestic use or to the domestic preparation, handling or storage of food for private domestic consumption. Moreover, where small quantities of primary products or of certain types of meat are supplied directly by the food business operator producing them to the final consumer or to a local retail establishment, it is appropriate to protect public health through national law, in particular because of the close relationship between the producer and the consumer.\n(12)\nThe requirements of Regulation (EC) No /2004 (6) are generally sufficient to ensure food safety in establishments carrying out retail activities involving the direct sale or supply of food of animal origin to the final consumer. This Regulation should generally apply to wholesale activities (that is, when a retail establishment carries out operations with a view to supplying food of animal origin to another establishment). Nevertheless, with the exception of the specific temperature requirements laid down in this Regulation, the requirements of Regulation (EC) No /2004 (6) should suffice for wholesale activities consisting only of storage or transport.\n(13)\nMember States should have some discretion to extend or to limit the application of the requirements of this Regulation to retail under national law. However, they may limit their application only if they consider that the requirements of Regulation (EC) No /2004 (6) are sufficient to achieve food hygiene objectives and when the supply of food of animal origin from a retail establishment to another establishment is a marginal, localised and restricted activity. Such supply should therefore be only a small part of the establishment's business; the establishments supplied should be situated in its immediate vicinity; and the supply should concern only certain types of products or establishments.\n(14)\nIn accordance with Article 10 of the Treaty, Member States are to take all appropriate measures to ensure that food business operators comply with the obligations laid down in this Regulation.\n(15)\nThe traceability of food is an essential element in ensuring food safety. In addition to complying with the general rules of Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 (7), food business operators responsible for establishments that are subject to approval in accordance with this Regulation should ensure that all products of animal origin that they place on the market bear either a health mark or an identification mark.\n(16)\nFood imported into the Community is to comply with the general requirements laid down in Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 or to satisfy rules that are equivalent to Community rules. This Regulation defines specific hygiene requirements for food of animal origin imported into the Community.\n(17)\nThe adoption of this Regulation should not reduce the level of protection provided by the additional guarantees agreed for Finland and Sweden on their accession to the Community and confirmed by Decisions 94/968/EC (8), 95/50/EC (9), 95/160/EC (10), 95/161/EC (11), 95/168/EC (12), 95/409/EC (13), 95/410/EC (14) and 95/41 I/EC (15). It should establish a procedure for the granting, for a transitional period, of guarantees to any Member State that has an approved national control programme which, for the food of animal origin concerned, is equivalent to those approved for Finland and Sweden. Regulation (EC) No 2160/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 November 2003 on the control of salmonella and other specified food-borne zoonotic agents (16) provides for a similar procedure in respect of live animals and hatching eggs.\n(18)\nIt is appropriate for the structural and hygiene requirements laid down in this Regulation to apply to all types of establishments, including small businesses and mobile slaughterhouses.\n(19)\nFlexibility is appropriate to enable the continued use of traditional methods at any of the stages of production, processing or distribution of food and in relation to structural requirements for establishments. Flexibility is particularly important for regions that are subject to special geographical constraints, including the outermost regions referred to in Article 299(2) of the Treaty. However, flexibility should not compromise food hygiene objectives. Moreover, since all food produced in accordance with the hygiene rules will normally be in free circulation throughout the Community, the procedure allowing Member States to exercise flexibility should be fully transparent. It should provide, where necessary to resolve disagreements, for discussion within the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health established by Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 and for the Commission to coordinate the process and take appropriate measures.\n(20)\nThe definition of mechanically separated meat (MSM) should be a generic one covering all methods of mechanical separation. Rapid technological developments in this area mean that a flexible definition is appropriate. The technical requirements for MSM should differ, however, depending on a risk assessment of the product resulting from different methods.\n(21)\nThere are interactions between food business operators, including the animal feed sector, and connections between animal health, animal welfare and public health considerations at all stages of production, processing and distribution. This requires adequate communication between the different stakeholders along the food chain from primary production to retail.\n(22)\nIn order to ensure proper inspection of hunted wild game placed on the Community market, bodies of hunted animals and their viscera should be presented for official post-mortem inspection at a game-handling establishment. However, to preserve certain hunting traditions without prejudicing food safety, it is appropriate to provide for training for hunters who place wild game on the market for human consumption. This should enable hunters to undertake an initial examination of wild game on the spot. In these circumstances, it is not necessary to require trained hunters to deliver all viscera to the game-handling establishment for post-mortem examination, if they carry out this initial examination and identity no anomalies or hazards. However, Member States should be allowed to establish stricter rules within their territories to take account of specific risks.\n(23)\nThis Regulation should establish criteria for raw milk pending the adoption of new requirements for its placing on the market. These criteria should be trigger values, implying that, in the event of any overshooting, food business operators are to take corrective action and to notify the competent authority. The criteria should not be maximum figures beyond which raw milk cannot be placed on the market. This implies that, in certain circumstances, raw milk not fully meeting the criteria can safely be used for human consumption, if appropriate measures are taken. As regards raw milk and raw cream intended for direct human consumption, it is appropriate to enable each Member State to maintain or establish appropriate health measures to ensure the achievement of the objectives of this Regulation on its territory.\n(24)\nIt is appropriate for the criterion for raw milk used to manufacture dairy products to be three times as high as the criterion for raw milk collected from the farm. The criterion for milk used to manufacture processed dairy products is an absolute value, whereas for raw milk collected from the farm it is an average. Compliance with the temperature requirements laid down in this Regulation will not halt all bacterial growth during transport and storage.\n(25)\nThe present recasting means that the existing hygiene rules can be repealed. Directive 2004/.../EC of the European Parliament and of the Council ofrepealing certain Directives on food hygiene and health conditions for the production and placing on the market of certain products of animal origin intended for human consumption (17) achieves this.\n(26)\nIn addition, the rules of this Regulation on eggs replace those of Council Decision 94/371/EC of 20 June 1994 laying down specific public health conditions for the putting on the market of certain types of eggs (18) which the repeal of Annex II to Council Directive 92/118/EEC (19) renders void.\n(27)\nScientific advice should underpin Community legislation on food hygiene. To this end, the European Food Safety Authority should be consulted whenever necessary.\n(28)\nTo take account of technical and scientific progress, close and effective cooperation should be ensured between the Commission and the Member States within the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health.\n(29)\nThe requirements of this Regulation should not apply until all parts of the new legislation on food hygiene have entered into force. It is also appropriate to provide for at least 18 months to elapse between entry into force and the application of the new rules, to allow the industries affected time to adapt.\n(30)\nThe measures necessary for the implementation of this Regulation should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission (20),\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nCHAPTER I\nGENERAL PROVISIONS\nArticle 1\nScope\n1.

Such national rules shall ensure the achievement of the objectives of this Regulation.\n5.\n(a)\nUnless expressly indicated to the contrary, this Regulation shall not apply to retail.\n(b)\nHowever, this Regulation shall apply to retail when operations are carried out with a view to the supply of food of animal origin to another establishment, unless:\n(i)\nthe operations consist only of storage or transport, in which case the specific temperature requirements laid down in Annex III shall nevertheless apply; or\n(ii)\nthe supply of food of animal origin from the retail establishment is to other retail establishments only and, in accordance with national law, is a marginal, localised and restricted activity.\n(c)\nMember States may adopt national measures to apply the requirements of this Regulation to retail establishments situated on their territory to which it would not apply pursuant to subparagraphs (a) or (b).\n6.   This Regulation shall apply without prejudice to:\n(a)\nrelevant animal and public health rules, including more stringent rules laid down for the prevention, control and eradication of certain transmissible spongiform encephalopathies;\n(b)\nanimal welfare requirements; and\n(c)\nrequirements concerning the identification of animals and the traceability of products of animal origin.\nArticle 2\nDefinitions\nThe following definitions shall apply for the purposes of this Regulation:\n1)\nthe definitions laid down in Regulation (EC) No 178/2002;\n2)\nthe definitions laid down in Regulation (EC) No /2004 (22);\n3)\nthe definitions laid down in Annex I; and\n4)\nany technical definitions contained in Annexes II and III.\nCHAPTER II\nFOOD BUSINESS OPERATORS' OBLIGATIONS\nArticle 3\nGeneral obligations\n1.   Food business operators shall comply with the relevant provisions of Annexes II and III.\n2.   Food business operators shall not use any substance other than potable water - or, when Regulation (EC) No /2004 (23) or this Regulation permits its use, clean water - to remove surface contamination from products of animal origin, unless use of the substance has been approved in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 12(2). Food business operators shall also comply with any conditions for use that may be adopted under the same procedure. The use of an approved substance shall not affect the food business operator's duty to comply with the requirements of this Regulation.\nArticle 4\nRegistration and approval of establishments\n1.   Food business operators shall place products of animal origin manufactured in the Community on the market only if they have been prepared and handled exclusively in establishments:\n(a)\nthat meet the relevant requirements of Regulation (EC) No /2004 (23), those of Annexes II and III of this Regulation and other relevant requirements of food law; and\n(b)\nthat the competent authority has registered or, where required in accordance with paragraph 2, approved.\n2.   Without prejudice to Article 6(3) of Regulation (EC) No /2004 (24), establishments handling those products of animal origin for which Annex III to this Regulation lays down requirements shall not operate unless the competent authority has approved them in accordance with paragraph 3 of this Article, with the exception of establishments carrying out only:\n(a)\nprimary production;\n(b)\ntransport operations;\n(c)\nthe storage of products not requiring temperature-controlled storage conditions; or\n(d)\nretail operations other than those to which this Regulation applies pursuant to Article l(5)(b).\n3.

Any Member State wishing to adopt national measures as referred to in paragraph 3 shall notify the Commission and other Member States. Each notification shall:\n(a)\nprovide a detailed description of the requirements that that Member State considers need to be adapted and the nature of the adaptation sought;\n(b)\ndescribe the foodstuffs and establishments concerned;\n(c)\nexplain the reasons for the adaptation, including, where relevant, by providing a summary of the hazard analysis carried out and any measures to be taken to ensure that the adaptation will not compromise the objectives of this Regulation; and\n(d)\ngive any other relevant information.\n6.   The other Member States shall have three months from the receipt of a notification referred to in paragraph 5 to send written comments to the Commission. In the case of adaptations arising from paragraph 4(b), this period shall, at the request of any Member State, be extended to four months. The Commission may, and when it receives written comments from one or more Member States shall, consult Member States within the committee referred to in Article 12(1). The Commission may decide, in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 12(2), whether the envisaged measures may be implemented, subject, if necessary, to appropriate amendments. Where appropriate, the Commission may propose general measures in accordance with paragraph 1 or 2 of this Article.\n7.   A Member State may adopt national measures adapting the requirements of Annex III only:\n(a)\nin compliance with a decision adopted in accordance with paragraph 6;\n(b)\nif one month after the expiry of the period referred to in paragraph 6, the Commission has not informed Member States that it has received written comments or that it intends to propose the adoption of a decision in accordance with paragraph 6; or\n(c)\nin accordance with paragraph 8.\n8.   A Member State may, of its own initiative and subject to the general provisions of the Treaty, maintain or establish national rules:\n(a)\nprohibiting or restricting the placing on the market within its territory of raw milk or raw cream intended for direct human consumption; or\n(b)\npermitting the use, with the authorisation of the competent authority, of raw milk not meeting the criteria laid down in Annex III, Section DC, as regards plate count and somatic cell count of the manufacture of cheeses with an ageing or ripening period of at least 60 days, and dairy products obtained in connection with the manufacture of such cheeses, provided that this does not prejudice the achievement of the objectives of this Regulation.\nArticle 11\nSpecific decisions\nWithout prejudice to the generality of Article 9 and Article 10(1), implementing measures may be laid down, or amendments to Annex II or III adopted, in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 12(2):\n1)\nto lay down rules for the transport of meat while it is warm;\n2)\nto specify, in respect of MSM, which calcium content is not significantly higher than that of minced meat;\n3)\nto lay down other treatments that may be applied in a processing establishment to live bivalve molluscs from class B or C production areas that have not been submitted to purification or relaying;\n4)\nto specify recognised testing methods for marine biotoxins;\n5)\nto lay down additional health standards for live bivalve molluscs in cooperation with the relevant Community Reference Laboratory, including:\n(a)\nlimit values and analysis methods for other marine biotoxins;\n(b)\nvirus testing procedures and virological standards; and\n(c)\nsampling plans and the methods and analytical tolerances to be applied to check compliance with the health standards;\n6)\nto lay down health standards or checks, where there is scientific evidence indicating that they are necessary to protect public health;\n7)\nto extend Annex III, Section VII, Chapter IX, to live bivalve molluscs other than pectinidae;\n8)\nto specify criteria for determining when epidemiological data indicate that a fishing ground does not present a health hazard with regard to the presence of parasites and, consequently, for determining when the competent authority may authorise food business operators not to freeze fishery products in accordance with Annex III, Section VIII, Chapter III, Part D;\n9)\nto lay down freshness criteria and limits with regard to histamine and total volatile nitrogen for fisheries products;\n10)\nto permit the use for the manufacture of certain dairy products of raw milk not meeting the criteria laid down in Annex III, Section IX, as regards its plate count and somatic cell count;\n11)\nwithout prejudice to Directive 96/23/EC (35), to fix a maximum permitted value for the combined total of residues of antibiotic substances in raw milk; and\n12)\nto approve equivalent processes for the production of gelatine or collagen.\nArticle 12\nCommittee procedure\n1.

APPLICATION OF THE IDENTIFICATION MARK\n1.\nThe identification mark must be applied before the product leaves the establishment.\n2.\nHowever, a new mark need not be applied to a product unless its packaging and/or wrapping is removed or it is further processed in another establishment, in which case the new mark must indicate the approval number of the establishment where these operations take place.\n3.\nAn identification mark is not necessary for eggs in respect of which Regulation (EC) No 1907/90 (1) lays down requirements concerning labelling or marking.\n4.\nFood business operators must, in accordance with Article 18 of Regulation (EC) No 178/2002, have in place systems and procedures to identify food business operators from whom they have received, and to whom they have delivered, products of animal origin.\nB.   FORM OF THE IDENTIFICATION MARK\n5.\nThe mark must be legible and indelible, and the characters easily decipherable. It must be clearly displayed for the competent authorities.\n6.\nThe mark must indicate the name of the country in which the establishment is located, which may be written out in full or shown as a two-letter code in accordance with the relevant ISO standard.\nIn the case of Member States, however, these codes are AT, BE, DE, DK, ES, FI, FR, GR, IE, IT, LU, NL, PT, SE and UK.\nFood business operators may continue to use stocks and equipment that they ordered before the entry into force of this Regulation until they are exhausted or require replacement.\n7.\nThe mark must indicate the approval number of the establishment. If an establishment manufactures both food to which this Regulation applies and food to which it does not, the food business operator may apply the same identification mark to both types of food.\n8.\nWhen applied in an establishment located within the Community, the mark must be oval in shape and include the abbreviation CE, EC, EF, EG, EK or EY.\nC.   METHOD OF MARKING\n9.\nThe mark may, depending on the presentation of different products of animal origin, be applied directly to the product, the wrapping or the packaging, or be printed on a label affixed to the product, the wrapping or the packaging. The mark may also be an irremovable tag made of a resistant material.\n10.\nIn the case of packaging containing cut meat or offal, the mark must be applied to a label fixed to the packaging, or printed on the packaging, in such a way that it is destroyed when the packaging is opened. This is not necessary, however, if the process of opening destroys the packaging. When wrapping provides the same protection as packaging, the label may be affixed to the wrapping.\n11.\nFor products of animal origin that are placed in transport containers or large packages and are intended for further handling, processing, wrapping or packaging in another establishment, the mark may be applied to the external surface of the container or packaging.\n12.\nIn the case of liquid, granulate and powdered products of animal origin carried in bulk, and fishery products carried in bulk, an identification mark is not necessary if accompanying documentation contains the information specified in paragraphs 6, 7 and, where appropriate, 8.\n13.\nWhen products of animal origin are placed in a package destined for direct supply to the final consumer, it is sufficient to apply the mark to the exterior of that package only.\n14.\nWhen the mark is applied directly to products of animal origin, the colours used must be authorised in accordance with Community rules on the use of colouring substances in foodstuffs.\nSECTION II: OBJECTIVES OF HACCP-BASED PROCEDURES\n1.\nFood business operators operating slaughterhouses must ensure that the procedures that they have put in place in accordance with the general requirements of Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No.../2004 (2) meet the requirements that the hazard analysis shows to be necessary and the specific requirements listed in paragraph 2.\n2.\nThe procedures must guarantee that each animal or, where appropriate, each lot of animals accepted onto the slaughterhouse premises:\n(a)\nis properly identified;\n(b)\nis accompanied by the relevant information from the holding of provenance referred to in Section III;\n(c)\ndoes not come from a holding or an area subject to a movement prohibition or other restriction for reasons of animal or public health, except when the competent authority so permits;\n(d)\nis clean;\n(e)\nis healthy, as far as the food business operator can judge; and\n(f)\nis in a satisfactory state as regards welfare on arrival at the slaughterhouse.\n3.\nIn the event of failure to comply with any of the requirements listed under paragraph 2, the food business operator must notify the official veterinarian and take appropriate measures.\nSECTION III: FOOD CHAIN INFORMATION\nFood business operators operating slaughterhouses must, as appropriate, request, receive, check and act upon food chain information as set out in this Section in respect of all animals, other than wild game, sent or intended to be sent to the slaughterhouse.\n1.\nSlaughterhouse operators must not accept animals onto the slaughterhouse premises unless they have requested and been provided with relevant food safety information contained in the records kept at the holding of provenance in accordance with Regulation (EC) No.../2004 (3).\n2.\nSlaughterhouse operators must be provided with the information no less than 24 hours before the arrival of animals at the slaughterhouse, except in the circumstances mentioned in point 7.\n3.\nThe relevant food safety information referred to in point 1 is to cover, in particular:\n(a)\nthe status of the holding of provenance or the regional animal health status;\n(b)\nthe animals' health status;\n(c)\nveterinary medicinal products or other treatments administered to the animals within a relevant period and with a withdrawal period greater than zero, together with their dates of administration and withdrawal periods;\n(d)\nthe occurrence of diseases that may affect the safety of meat;\n(e)\nthe results, if they are relevant to the protection of public health, of any analysis carried out on samples taken from the animals or other samples taken to diagnose diseases that may affect the safety of meat, including samples taken in the framework of the monitoring and control of zoonoses and residues;\n(f)\nrelevant reports about previous ante- and post-mortem inspections of animals from the same holding of provenance including, in particular, reports from the official veterinarian;\n(g)\nproduction data, when this might indicate the presence of disease; and\n(h)\nthe name and address of the private veterinarian normally attending the holding of provenance.\n4.\n(a)\nHowever, it is not necessary for the slaughterhouse operator to be provided with:\n(i)\nthe information referred to in point 3(a), (b), (f) and (h), if the operator is already aware of this information (for example, through a standing arrangement or a quality assurance scheme); or\n(ii)\nthe information referred to in point 3(a), (b), (f) and (g), if the producer declares that there is no relevant information to report.\n(b)\nThe information need not be provided as a verbatim extract from the records of the holding of provenance. It may be provided through electronic data exchange or in the form of a standardised declaration signed by the producer.\n5.\nFood business operators deciding to accept animals onto the slaughterhouse premises after evaluating the relevant food chain information must make it available to the official veterinarian without delay and, except in the circumstances mentioned in point 7, no less than 24 hours before the arrival of the animal or lot. The food business operator must notify the official veterinarian of any information that gives rise to health concerns before ante-mortem inspection of the animal concerned.\n6.\nIf any animal arrives at the slaughterhouse without food chain information, the operator must immediately notify the official veterinarian. Slaughter of the animal may not take place until the official veterinarian so permits.\n7.\nIf the competent authority so permits, food chain information may accompany the animals to which it relates to the slaughterhouse, rather than arriving at least 24 hours in advance, in the case of:\n(a)\nporcine animals, poultry or farmed game that have undergone ante-mortem inspection at the holding of provenance, if a certificate that the veterinarian has signed stating that he or she examined the animals at the holding and found them to be healthy accompanies them;\n(b)\ndomestic solipeds;\n(c)\nanimals that have undergone emergency slaughter, if a declaration, that the veterinarian has signed recording the favourable outcome of the ante-mortem inspection accompanies them; and\n(d)\nanimals that are not delivered directly from the holding of provenance to the slaughterhouse.\nSlaughterhouse operators must evaluate the relevant information. If they accept the animals for slaughter, they must give the documents mentioned in subparagraphs (a) and (c) to the official veterinarian. Slaughter or dressing of the animals may not take place until the official veterinarian so permits.\n8.\nFood business operators must check passports accompanying domestic solipeds to ensure that the animal is intended for slaughter for human consumption. If they accept the animal for slaughter, they must give the passport to the official veterinarian.\"\n(1)  Council Regulation (EEC) No 1907/90 of 26 June 1990 on certain marketing standards for eggs (OJ L 173, 6.7.1990, p. 5).
