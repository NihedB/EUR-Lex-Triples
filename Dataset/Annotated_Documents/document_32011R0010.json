{"celex_id": "32011R0010", "reference": "15.1.2011\nEN\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\nL 12/1\nCOMMISSION REGULATION (EU) No 10/2011\nof 14 January 2011\non plastic materials and articles intended to come into contact with food\n(Text with EEA relevance)\nTHE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,\nHaving regard to Regulation (EC) No 1935/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 October 2004 on materials and articles intended to come into contact with food and repealing Directives 80/590/EEC and 89/109/EEC (1), and in particular Article 5(1)(a), (c), (d), (e), (f), (h), (i) and (j) thereof,\nAfter consulting the European Food Safety Authority,\nWhereas:\n(1)\nRegulation (EC) No 1935/2004 lays down the general principles for eliminating the differences between the laws of the Member States as regards food contact materials. Article 5(1) of that Regulation provides for the adoption of specific measures for groups of materials and articles and describes in detail the procedure for the authorisation of substances at EU level when a specific measure provides for a list of authorised substances.\n(2)\nThis Regulation is a specific measure within the meaning of Article 5(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1935/2004. This Regulation should establish the specific rules for plastic materials and articles to be applied for their safe use and repeal Commission Directive 2002/72/EC of 6 August 2002 on plastic materials and articles intended to come into contact with foodstuffs (2).\n(3)\nDirective 2002/72/EC sets out basic rules for the manufacture of plastic materials and articles. The Directive has been substantially amended 6 times. For reasons of clarity the text should be consolidated and redundant and obsolete parts removed.\n(4)\nIn the past Directive 2002/72/EC and its amendments have been transposed into national legislation without any major adaptation. For transposition into national law usually a time period of 12 months is necessary. In case of amending the lists of monomers and additives in order to authorise new substances this transposition time leads to a retardation of the authorisation and thus slows down innovation. Therefore it seems appropriate to adopt rules on plastic materials and articles in form of a Regulation directly applicable in all Member States.\n(5)\nDirective 2002/72/EC applies to materials and articles purely made of plastics and to plastic gaskets in lids. In the past these were the main use of plastics on the market. However, in recent years, besides materials and articles purely made of plastics, plastics are also used in combination with other materials in so called multi-material multi-layers. Rules on the use of vinyl chloride monomer laid down in Council Directive 78/142/EEC of 30 January 1978 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to materials and articles which contain vinyl chloride monomer and are intended to come into contact with foodstuffs (3) already apply to all plastics. Therefore it seems appropriate to extend the scope of this Regulation to plastic layers in multi-material multi-layers.\n(6)\nPlastic materials and articles may be composed of different layers of plastics held together by adhesives. Plastic materials and articles may also be printed or coated with an organic or inorganic coating. Printed or coated plastic materials and articles as well as those held together by adhesives should be within the scope of the Regulation. Adhesives, coatings and printing inks are not necessarily composed of the same substances as plastics. Regulation (EC) No 1935/2004 foresees that for adhesives, coatings and printing inks specific measures can be adopted. Therefore plastic materials and articles that are printed, coated or held together by adhesives should be allowed to contain in the printing, coating or adhesive layer other substances than those authorised at EU level for plastics. Those layers may be subject to other EU or national rules.\n(7)\nPlastics as well as ion exchange resins, rubbers and silicones are macromolecular substances obtained by polymerisation processes. Regulation (EC) No 1935/2004 foresees that for ion exchange resins, rubbers and silicones specific measures can be adopted. As those materials are composed of different substances than plastics and have different physico-chemical properties specific rules for them need to apply and it should be made clear that they are not within the scope of this Regulation.\n(8)\nPlastics are made of monomers and other starting substances which are chemically reacted to a macromolecular structure, the polymer, which forms the main structural component of the plastics. To the polymer additives are added to achieve defined technological effects. The polymer as such is an inert high molecular weight structure. As substances with a molecular weight above 1 000 Da usually cannot be absorbed in the body the potential health risk from the polymer itself is minimal. Potential health risk may occur from non- or incompletely reacted monomers or other starting substances or from low molecular weight additives which are transferred into food via migration from the plastic food contact material. Therefore monomers, other starting substances and additives should be risk assessed and authorised before their use in the manufacture of plastic materials and articles.\n(9)\nThe risk assessment of a substance to be performed by the European Food Safety Authority (hereinafter the Authority) should cover the substance itself, relevant impurities and foreseeable reaction and degradation products in the intended use. The risk assessment should cover the potential migration under worst foreseeable conditions of use and the toxicity. Based on the risk assessment the authorisation should if necessary set out specifications for the substance and restrictions of use, quantitative restrictions or migration limits to ensure the safety of the final material or article.\n(10)\nNo rules have yet been set out at EU level for the risk assessment and use of colorants in plastics. Therefore their use should remain subject to national law. That situation should be reassessed at a later stage.\n(11)\nSolvents used in the manufacture of plastics to create a suitable reaction environment are expected to be removed in the manufacturing process as they are usually volatile. No rules have yet been set out at EU level for the risk assessment and use of solvents in the manufacture of plastics. Therefore their use should remain subject to national law. That situation should be reassessed at a later stage.\n(12)\nPlastics can also be made of synthetic or natural occurring macromolecular structures which are chemically reacted with other starting substances to create a modified macromolecule. Synthetic macromolecules used are often intermediate structures which are not fully polymerised. Potential health risk may occur from the migration of non- or incompletely reacted other starting substances used to modify the macromolecule or an incompletely reacted macromolecule. Therefore the other starting substances as well as the macromolecules used in the manufacture of modified macromolecules should be risk assessed and authorised before their use in the manufacture of plastic materials and articles.\n(13)\nPlastics can also be made by micro-organisms that create macromolecular structures out of starting substances by fermentation processes. The macromolecule is then either released to a medium or extracted. Potential health risk may occur from the migration of non- or incompletely reacted starting substances, intermediates or by-products of the fermentation process. In this case the final product should be risk assessed and authorised before its use in the manufacture of plastic materials and articles.\n(14)\nDirective 2002/72/EC contains different lists for monomers or other starting substances and for additives authorised for the manufacture of plastic materials and articles. For monomers, other starting substances and additives the Union list is now complete, this means that only substances authorised at EU level may be used. Therefore a separation of monomers or other starting substances and of additives in separate lists due to their authorisation status is no longer necessary. As certain substances can be used both as monomer or other starting substances and as additive for reasons of clarity they should be published in one list of authorised substances indicating the authorised function.\n(15)\nPolymers can not only be used as main structural component of plastics but also as additives achieving defined technological effects in the plastic. If such a polymeric additive is identical to a polymer that can form the main structural component of a plastic material the risk from polymeric additive can be regarded as evaluated if the monomers have already been evaluated and authorised. In such a case it should not be necessary to authorise the polymeric additive but it could be used on the basis of the authorisation of its monomers and other starting substances. If such a polymeric additive is not identical to a polymer that can form the main structural component of a plastic material then the risk of the polymeric additive can not be regarded as evaluated by evaluation of the monomers. In such a case the polymeric additive should be risk assessed as regards its low molecular weight fraction below 1 000 Da and authorised before its use in the manufacture of plastic materials and articles.\n(16)\nIn the past no clear differentiation has been made between additives that have a function in the final polymer and polymer production aids (PPA) that only exhibit a function in the manufacturing process and are not intended to be present in the final article. Some substances acting as PPA had already been included in the incomplete list of additives in the past. These PPA should remain in the Union list of authorised substances. However, it should be made clear that the use of other PPA will remain possible, subject to national law. That situation should be reassessed at a later stage.\n(17)\nThe Union list contains substances authorised to be used in the manufacture of plastics. Substances such as acids, alcohols and phenols can also occur in form of salts. As the salts usually are transformed in the stomach to acid, alcohol or phenol the use of salts with cations that have undergone a safety evaluation should in principle be authorised together with the acid, alcohol or phenol. In certain cases, where the safety assessment indicates concerns on the use of the free acids, only the salts should be authorised by indicating in the list the name as ‘… acid(s), salts’.\n(18)\nSubstances used in the manufacture of plastic materials or articles may contain impurities originating from their manufacturing or extraction process. These impurities are non-intentionally added together with the substance in the manufacture of the plastic material (non-intentionally added substance – NIAS). As far as they are relevant for the risk assessment the main impurities of a substance should be considered and if necessary be included in the specifications of a substance. However it is not possible to list and consider all impurities in the authorisation. Therefore they may be present in the material or article but not included in the Union list.\n(19)\nIn the manufacture of polymers substances are used to initiate the polymerisation reaction such as catalysts and to control the polymerisation reaction such as chain transfer, chain extending or chain stop reagents. These aids to polymerisation are used in minute amounts and are not intended to remain in the final polymer. Therefore they should at this point of time not be subject to the authorisation procedure at EU level. Any potential health risk in the final material or article arising from their use should be assessed by the manufacturer in accordance with internationally recognised scientific principles on risk assessment.\n(20)\nDuring the manufacture and use of plastic materials and articles reaction and degradation products can be formed. These reaction and degradation products are non-intentionally present in the plastic material (NIAS). As far as they are relevant for the risk assessment the main reaction and degradation products of the intended application of a substance should be considered and included in the restrictions of the substance. However it is not possible to list and consider all reaction and degradation products in the authorisation. Therefore they should not be listed as single entries in the Union list. Any potential health risk in the final material or article arising from reaction and degradation products should be assessed by the manufacturer in accordance with internationally recognised scientific principles on risk assessment.\n(21)\nPrior to the establishment of the Union list of additives, other additives than those authorised at EU level could be used in the manufacture of plastics. For those additives which were permitted in the Member States, the time limit for the submission of data for their safety evaluation by the Authority with a view to their inclusion in the Union list expired on 31 December 2006. Additives for which a valid application was submitted within this time limit were listed in a provisional list. For certain additives on the provisional list a decision on their authorisation at EU level has not yet been taken. For those additives, it should be possible to continue to be used in accordance with national law until their evaluation is completed and a decision is taken on their inclusion in the Union list.\n(22)\nWhen an additive included in the provisional list is inserted in the Union list or when it is decided not to include it in the Union list, that additive should be removed from the provisional list of additives.\n(23)\nNew technologies engineer substances in particle size that exhibit chemical and physical properties that significantly differ from those at a larger scale, for example, nanoparticles. These different properties may lead to different toxicological properties and therefore these substances should be assessed on a case-by-case basis by the Authority as regards their risk until more information is known about such new technology. Therefore it should be made clear that authorisations which are based on the risk assessment of the conventional particle size of a substance do not cover engineered nanoparticles.\n(24)\nBased on the risk assessment the authorisation should if necessary set out specific migration limits to ensure the safety of the final material or article. If an additive that is authorised for the manufacture of plastic materials and articles is at the same time authorised as food additive or flavouring substance it should be ensured that the release of the substance does not change the composition of the food in an unacceptable way. Therefore the release of such a dual use additive or flavouring should not exhibit a technological function on the food unless such a function is intended and the food contact material complies with the requirements on active food contact materials set out in Regulation (EC) No 1935/2004 and Commission Regulation (EC) No 450/2009 of 29 May 2009 on active and intelligent materials and articles intended to come into contact with food (4). The requirements of Regulations (EC) No 1333/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 December 2008 on food additives (5) or (EC) No 1334/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 December 2008 on flavourings and certain food ingredients with flavouring properties for use in and on foods and amending Council Regulation (EEC) No 1601/91, Regulations (EC) No 2232/96 and (EC) No 110/2008 and Directive 2000/13/EC (6) should be respected where applicable.\n(25)\nAccording to Article 3(1)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 1935/2004 the release of substances from food contact materials and articles should not bring about unacceptable changes in the composition of the food. According to good manufacturing practice it is feasible to manufacture plastic materials in such a way that they are not releasing more than 10 mg of substances per 1 dm2 of surface area of the plastic material. If the risk assessment of an individual substance is not indicating a lower level, this level should be set as a generic limit for the inertness of a plastic material, the overall migration limit. In order to achieve comparable results in the verification of compliance with the overall migration limit, testing should be performed under standardised test conditions including testing time, temperature and test medium (food simulant) representing worst foreseeable conditions of use of the plastic material or article.\n(26)\nThe overall migration limit of 10 mg per 1 dm2 results for a cubic packaging containing 1kg of food to a migration of 60 mg per kg food. For small packaging where the surface to volume ratio is higher the resulting migration into food is higher. For infants and small children which have a higher consumption of food per kilogram bodyweight than adults and do not yet have a diversified nutrition, special provisions should be set in order to limit the intake of substances migrating from food contact materials. In order to allow also for small volume packaging the same protection as for high volume packaging, the overall migration limit for food contact materials that are dedicated for packaging foods for infants and small children should be linked to the limit in food and not to the surface area of the packaging.\n(27)\nIn recent years plastic food contact materials are being developed that do not only consist of one plastic but combine up to 15 different plastic layers to attain optimum functionality and protection of the food, while reducing packaging waste. In such a plastic multi-layer material or article, layers may be separated from the food by a functional barrier. This barrier is a layer within food contact materials or articles preventing the migration of substances from behind that barrier into the food. Behind a functional barrier, non-authorised substances may be used, provided they fulfil certain criteria and their migration remains below a given detection limit. Taking into account foods for infants and other particularly susceptible persons, as well as the large analytical tolerance of the migration analysis, a maximum level of 0,01 mg/kg in food should be established for the migration of a non-authorised substance through a functional barrier. Substances that are mutagenic, carcinogenic or toxic to reproduction should not be used in food contact materials or articles without previous authorisation and should therefore not be covered by the functional barrier concept. New technologies that engineer substances in particle size that exhibit chemical and physical properties that significantly differ from those at a larger scale, for example, nanoparticles, should be assessed on a case-by-case basis as regards their risk until more information is known about such new technology. Therefore, they should not be covered by the functional barrier concept.\n(28)\nIn recent years food contact materials and articles are being developed that consist of a combination of several materials to achieve optimum functionality and protection of the food while reducing packaging waste. In these multi-material multi-layer materials and articles plastic layers should comply with the same compositional requirements as plastic layers which are not combined with other materials. For plastic layers in a multi-material multi-layer which are separated from the food by a functional barrier the functional barrier concept should apply. As other materials are combined with the plastic layers and for these other materials specific measures are not yet adopted at EU level it is not yet possible to set out requirements for the final multi-material multi-layer materials and articles. Therefore specific migration limits and the overall migration limit should not be applicable except for vinyl chloride monomer for which such a restriction is already in place. In the absence of a specific measure at EU level covering the whole multi-material multi-layer material or article Member States may maintain or adopt national provisions for these materials and articles provided they comply with the rules of the Treaty.\n(29)\nArticle 16(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1935/2004 provides that materials and articles covered by specific measures be accompanied by a written declaration of compliance stating that they comply with the rules applicable to them. To strengthen the coordination and responsibility of the suppliers at each stage of manufacture, including that of the starting substances, the responsible persons should document the compliance with the relevant rules in a declaration of compliance which is made available to their customers.\n(30)\nCoatings, printing inks and adhesives are not yet covered by a specific EU legislation and therefore not subject to the requirement of a declaration of compliance. However, for coatings, printing inks and adhesives to be used in plastic materials and articles adequate information should be provided to the manufacturer of the final plastic article that would enable him to ensure compliance for substances for which migration limits have been established in this Regulation.\n(31)\nArticle 17(1) of Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 28 January 2002 laying down the general principles and requirements of food law, establishing the European Food Safety Authority and laying down procedures in matters of food safety (7) requires the food business operator to verify that foods are compliant with the rules applicable to them. To this end and subject to the requirement of confidentiality, food business operators should be given access to the relevant information to enable them to ensure that the migration from the materials and articles to food complies with the specifications and restrictions laid down in food legislation.\n(32)\nAt each stage of manufacture, supporting documentation, substantiating the declaration of compliance, should be kept available for the enforcement authorities. Such demonstration of compliance may be based on migration testing. As migration testing is complex, costly and time consuming it should be admissible that compliance can be demonstrated also by calculations, including modelling, other analysis, and scientific evidence or reasoning if these render results which are at least as severe as the migration testing. Test results should be regarded as valid as long as formulations and processing conditions remain constant as part of a quality assurance system.\n(33)\nWhen testing articles not yet in contact with food, for certain articles, such as films or lids, it is often not feasible to determine the surface area that is in contact with a defined volume of food. For these articles specific rules should be set out for verification of compliance.\n(34)\nThe setting of migration limits takes into account a conventional assumption that 1kg of food is consumed daily by a person of 60 kg bodyweight and that the food is packaged in a cubic container of 6 dm2 surface area releasing the substance. For very small and very large containers the real surface area to volume of packaged food is varying a lot from the conventional assumption. Therefore, their surface area should be normalised before comparing testing results with migration limits. These rules should be reviewed when new data on food packaging uses become available.\n(35)\nThe specific migration limit is a maximum permitted amount of a substance in food. This limit should ensure that the food contact material does not pose a risk to health. It should be ensured by the manufacturer that materials and articles not yet in contact with food will respect these limits when brought into contact with food under the worst foreseeable contact conditions. Therefore compliance of materials and articles not yet in contact with food should be assessed and the rules for this testing should be set out.\n(36)\nFood is a complex matrix and therefore the analysis of migrating substances in food may pose analytical difficulties. Therefore test media should be assigned that simulate the transfer of substances from the plastic material into food. They should represent the major physico-chemical properties exhibited by food. When using food simulants standard testing time and temperature should reproduce, as far as possible, the migration which may occur from the article into the food.\n(37)\nFor determining the appropriate food simulant for certain foods the chemical composition and the physical properties of the food should be taken into account. Research results are available for certain representative foods comparing migration into food with migration into food simulants. On the basis of the results, food simulants should be assigned. In particular, for fat containing foods the result obtained with food simulant may in certain cases significantly overestimate migration into food. In these cases it should be foreseen that the result in food simulant is corrected by a reduction factor.\n(38)\nThe exposure to substances migrating from food contact materials was based on the conventional assumption that a person consumes daily 1 kg of food. However, a person ingests at most 200 g of fat on a daily basis. For lipophilic substances that only migrate into fat this should be taken into consideration. Therefore a correction of the specific migration by a correction factor applicable to lipophilic substances in accordance with the opinion of the Scientific Committee on Food (SCF) (8) and the opinion of the Authority (9) should be foreseen.\n(39)\nOfficial control should establish testing strategies which allow the enforcement authorities to perform controls efficiently making best use of available resources. Therefore it should be admissible to use screening methods for checking compliance under certain conditions. Non-compliance of a material or article should be confirmed by a verification method.\n(40)\nBasic rules on migration testing should be set out in this Regulation. As migration testing is a very complex issue, these basic rules can, however, not cover all foreseeable cases and details necessary for performing the testing. Therefore a EU guidance document should be established, dealing with more detailed aspects of the implementation of the basic migration testing rules.\n(41)\nThe updated rules on food simulants and migration testing provided by this Regulation will supersede those in Directive 78/142/EEC and the Annex to Council Directive 82/711/EEC of 18 October 1982 laying down the basic rules necessary for testing migration of the constituents of plastic materials and articles intended to come into contact with foodstuffs (10).\n(42)\nSubstances present in the plastic but not listed in Annex I to this Regulation have not necessarily been risk assessed as they had not been subject to an authorisation procedure. Compliance with Article 3 of Regulation (EC) No 1935/2004 for these substances should be assessed by the relevant business operator in accordance with internationally recognised scientific principles taking into account exposure from food contact materials and other sources.\n(43)\nRecently additional monomers, other starting substances and additives have received a favourable scientific evaluation by the Authority and should now be added to the Union list.\n(44)\nAs new substances are added to the Union list the Regulation should apply as soon as possible to allow for manufacturers to adapt to technical progress and allow for innovation.\n(45)\nCertain migration testing rules should be updated in view of new scientific knowledge. Enforcement authorities and industry need to adapt their current testing regime to these updated rules. To allow for this adaptation it seems appropriate that the updated rules only apply 2 years after the adoption of the Regulation.\n(46)\nBusiness operators are currently basing their declaration of compliance on supporting documentation following the requirements set out in Directive 2002/72/EC. Declaration of compliance need, in principle, only to be updated when substantial changes in the production bring about changes in the migration or when new scientific data are available. In order to limit the burden to business operators, materials which have been lawfully placed on the market based on the requirements set out in Directive 2002/72/EC should be able to be placed on the market with a declaration of compliance based on supporting documentation in accordance with Directive 2002/72/EC until 5 years after the adoption of the Regulation.\n(47)\nAnalytical methods for testing migration and residual content of vinyl chloride monomer as described in Commission Directives 80/766/EEC of 8 July 1980 laying down the Community method of analysis for the official control of the vinyl chloride monomer level in materials and articles which are intended to come into contact with foodstuffs (11) and 81/432/EEC of 29 April 1981 laying down the Community method of analysis for the official control of vinyl chloride released by materials and articles into foodstuffs (12) are outdated. Analytical methods should comply with the criteria set out in Article 11 of Regulation (EC) No 882/2004 (13) of the European Parliament and of the Council on official controls performed to ensure the verification of compliance with feed and food law, animal health and animal welfare rules. Therefore Directives 80/766/EEC and 81/432/EEC should be repealed.\n(48)\nThe measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nCHAPTER I\nGENERAL PROVISIONS\nArticle 1\nSubject matter\n1.

Sample preparation\nThe material or article shall be stored as indicated on the packaging label or under conditions adequate for the packaged food if no instructions are given. The food shall be removed from contact with the material or article before its expiration date or any date by which the manufacturer has indicated the product should be used for reasons of quality or safety.\n1.2.   Conditions of testing\nThe food shall be treated in accordance with the cooking instructions on the package if the food is to be cooked in the package. Parts of the food which are not intended to be eaten shall be removed and discarded. The remainder shall be homogenised and analysed for migration. The analytical results shall always be expressed on the basis of the food mass that is intended to be eaten, in contact with the food contact material.\n1.3.   Analysis of migrated substances\nThe specific migration is analysed in the food using an analytical method in accordance with the requirements of Article 11 of Regulation (EC) No 882/2004.\n1.4.   Special cases\nWhen contamination occurs from sources other than food contact materials this has to be taken into account when testing for compliance of the food contact materials, in particular for phthalates (FCM substance 157, 159, 283, 728, 729) referred to in Annex I.\nCHAPTER 2\nTesting for specific migration of materials and articles not yet in contact with food\n2.1.   Verification method\nVerification of compliance of migration into foods with the migration limits shall be carried out under the most extreme conditions of time and temperature foreseeable in actual use taking into account paragraphs 1.4, 2.1.1, 2.1.6 and 2.1.7.\nVerification of compliance of migration into food simulants with the migration limits shall be carried out using conventional migration tests according to the rules set out in paragraphs 2.1.1 to 2.1.7.\n2.1.1.   Sample preparation\nThe material or article shall be treated as described by accompanying instructions or by provisions given in the declaration of compliance.\nMigration is determined on the material or article or, if this is impractical, on a specimen taken from the material or article, or a specimen representative of this material or article. For each food simulant or food type, a new test specimen is used. Only those parts of the sample which are intended to come into contact with foods in actual use shall be placed in contact with the food simulant or the food.\n2.1.2.   Choice of food simulant\nMaterials and articles intended for contact with all types of food shall be tested with food simulant A, B and D2. However, if substances that may react with acidic food simulant or foods are not present testing in food simulant B can be omitted.\nMaterials and articles intended only for specific types of foods shall be tested with the food simulants indicated for the food types in Annex III.\n2.1.3.   Conditions of contact when using food simulants\nThe sample shall be placed in contact with the food simulant in a manner representing the worst of the foreseeable conditions of use as regard contact time in Table 1 and as regard contact temperature in Table 2.\nIf it is found that carrying out the tests under the combination of contact conditions specified in Tables 1 and 2 causes physical or other changes in the test specimen which do not occur under worst foreseeable conditions of use of the material or article under examination, the migration tests shall be carried out under the worst foreseeable conditions of use in which these physical or other changes do not take place.\nTable 1\nContact time\nContact time in worst foreseeable use\nTest time\nt ≤ 5 min\n5 min\n5 min < t ≤ 0,5 hour\n0,5 hour\n0,5 hours < t ≤ 1 hour\n1 hour\n1 hour < t ≤ 2 hours\n2 hours\n2 hours < t ≤ 6 hours\n6 hours\n6 hours < t ≤ 24 hours\n24 hours\n1 day < t ≤ 3 days\n3 days\n3 days < t ≤ 30 days\n10 days\nAbove 30 days\nSee specific conditions\nTable 2\nContact temperature\nConditions of contact in worst foreseeable use\nTest conditions\nContact temperature\nTest temperature\nT ≤ 5 °C\n5 °C\n5 °C < T ≤ 20 °C\n20 °C\n20 °C < T ≤ 40 °C\n40 °C\n40 °C < T ≤ 70 °C\n70 °C\n70 °C < T ≤ 100 °C\n100 °C or reflux temperature\n100 °C < T ≤ 121 °C\n121 °C (1)\n121 °C < T ≤ 130 °C\n130 °C (1)\n130 °C < T ≤ 150 °C\n150 °C (1)\n150 °C < T < 175 °C\n175 °C (1)\nT > 175 °C\nAdjust the temperature to the real temperature at the interface with the food (1)\n2.1.4.   Specific conditions for contact times above 30 days at room temperature and below\nFor contact times above 30 days at room temperature and below the specimen shall be tested in an accelerated test at elevated temperature for a maximum of 10 days at 60 °C. Testing time and temperature conditions shall be based on the following formula.\nt2 = t1 * Exp ((-Ea/R) * (1/T1-1/T2))\nEa is the worst case activation energy 80kJ/mol\nR is a factor 8,31 J/Kelvin/mol\nExp -9627 * (1/T1-1/T2)\nt1 is the contact time\nt2 is the testing time\nT1 is the contact temperature in Kelvin. For room temperature storage this is set at 298 K (25 °C). For refrigerated and frozen conditions it is set at 278 K (5 °C).\nT2 is the testing temperature in Kelvin.\nTesting for 10 days at 20 °C shall cover all storage times at frozen condition.\nTesting for 10 days at 40 °C shall cover all storage times at refrigerated and frozen conditions including heating up to 70 °C for up to 2 hours, or heating up to 100 °C for up to 15 minutes.\nTesting for 10 days at 50 °C shall cover all storage time at refrigerated and frozen conditions including heating up to 70 °C for up to 2 hours, or heating up to 100 °C for up to 15 minutes and storage times of up to 6 months at room temperature.\nTesting for 10 days at 60 °C shall cover long term storage above 6 months at room temperature and below including heating up to 70 °C for up to 2 hours, or heating up to 100 °C for up to 15 minutes.\nThe maximum testing temperature is governed by the phase transition temperature of the polymer. At the test temperature the test specimen should not undergo any physical changes.\nFor storage at room temperature testing time can be reduced to 10 days at 40 °C if there is scientific evidence that migration of the respective substance in the polymer has reached equilibration under this test condition.\n2.1.5.   Specific conditions for combinations of contact times and temperature\nIf a material or article is intended for different applications covering different combinations of contact time and temperature the testing should be restricted to the test conditions which are recognised to be the most severe on the basis of scientific evidence.\nIf the material or article is intended for a food contact application where it is successively subject to a combination of two or more times and temperatures, the migration test shall be carried out subjecting the test specimen successively to all the applicable worst foreseeable conditions appropriate to the sample, using the same portion of food simulant.\n2.1.6.   Repeated use articles\nIf the material or article is intended to come into repeated contact with foods, the migration test(s) shall be carried out three times on a single sample using another portion of food simulant on each occasion. Its compliance shall be checked on the basis of the level of the migration found in the third test.\nHowever, if there is conclusive proof that the level of the migration does not increase in the second and third tests and if the migration limits are not exceeded on the first test, no further test is necessary.\nThe material or article shall respect the specific migration limit already in the first test for substances for which in Annex I Table 1 column 8 or Table 2 column 3 the specific migration limit is set as non-detectable and for non-listed substances used behind a plastic functional barrier covered by the rules of point (b) of Articles 13(2) which should not migrate in detectable amounts.\n2.1.7.   Analysis of migrating substances\nAt the end of the prescribed contact time, the specific migration is analysed in the food or food simulant using an analytical method in accordance with the requirements of Article 11 of Regulation (EC) No 882/2004.\n2.1.8.   Verification of compliance by residual content per food contact surface area (QMA)\nFor substances which are unstable in food simulant or food or for which no adequate analytical method is available it is indicated in Annex I that verification of compliance shall be undertaken by verification of residual content per 6 dm2 of contact surface. For materials and articles between 500 ml and 10 l the real contact surface is applied. For materials and articles below 500 ml and above 10 l as well as for articles for which it is impractical to calculate the real contact surface the contact surface is assumed to be 6 dm2 per kg food.\n2.2.   Screening approaches\nTo screen if a material or article complies with the migration limits any of the following approaches can be applied which are considered more severe than the verification method described in section 2.1.\n2.2.1.   Replacing specific migration by overall migration\nTo screen for specific migration of non-volatile substances, determination of overall migration under test conditions at least as severe as for specific migration can be applied.\n2.2.2.   Residual content\nTo screen for specific migration the migration potential can be calculated based on the residual content of the substance in the material or article assuming complete migration.\n2.2.3.   Migration modelling\nTo screen for specific migration the migration potential can be calculated based on the residual content of the substance in the material or article applying generally recognised diffusion models based on scientific evidence that are constructed such as to overestimate real migration.\n2.2.4.   Food simulant substitutes\nTo screen for specific migration, food simulants can be replaced by substitute food simulants if it is based on scientific evidence that the substitute food simulants overestimate migration compared to the regulated food simulants.\nCHAPTER 3\nTesting for overall migration\nOverall migration testing shall be performed under the standardised testing conditions set out in this chapter.\n3.1.   Standardised testing conditions\nThe overall migration test for materials and articles intended for the food contact conditions described in column 3 of Table 3 shall be performed for the time specified and at the temperature specified in column 2. For test OM5 the test can be performed either for 2 hours at 100 °C (food simulant D2) or at reflux (food simulant A, B, C, D1) or for 1 hour at 121 °C. The food simulant shall be chosen in accordance with Annex III.\nIf it is found that carrying out the tests under the contact conditions specified in Table 3 causes physical or other changes in the test specimen which do not occur under worst foreseeable conditions of use of the material or article under examination, the migration tests shall be carried out under the worst foreseeable conditions of use in which these physical or other changes do not take place.\nTable 3\nStandardised testing conditions\nColumn 1\nColumn 2\nColumn 3\nTest number\nContact time in days [d] or hours [h] at Contact temperature in [°C]\nIntended food contact conditions\nOM1\n10 d at 20 °C\nAny food contact at frozen and refrigerated conditions.\nOM2\n10 d at 40 °C\nAny long term storage at room temperature or below, including heating up to 70 °C for up to 2 hours, or heating up to 100 °C for up to 15 minutes.\nOM3\n2 h at 70 °C\nAny contact conditions that include heating up to 70 °C for up to 2 hours, or up to 100 °C for up to 15 minutes, which are not followed by long term room or refrigerated temperature storage.\nOM4\n1 h at 100 °C\nHigh temperature applications for all food simulants at temperature up to 100 °C.\nOM5\n2 h at 100 °C or at reflux or alternatively 1 h at 121 °C\nHigh temperature applications up to 121 °C.\nOM6\n4 h at 100 °C or at reflux\nAny food contact conditions with food simulants A, B or C, at temperature exceeding 40 °C.\nOM7\n2 h at 175 °C\nHigh temperature applications with fatty foods exceeding the conditions of OM5.\nTest OM 7 covers also food contact conditions described for OM1, OM2, OM3, OM4, OM5. It represents the worst case conditions for fatty food simulants in contact with non-polyolefins. In case it is technically not feasible to perform OM 7 with food simulant D2 the test can be replaced as set out in paragraph 3.2.\nTest OM 6 covers also food contact conditions described for OM1, OM2, OM3, OM4 and OM5. It represents worst case conditions for food simulants A, B and C in contact with non-polyolefins.\nTest OM 5 covers also food contact conditions described for OM1, OM2, OM3, OM4. It represents the worst case conditions for all food simulants in contact with polyolefins.\nTest OM 2 covers also food contact conditions described for OM1 and OM3.\n3.2.   Substitute test for OM7 with food simulant D2\nIn case it is technically NOT feasible to perform OM7 with food simulant D2 the test can be replaced by test OM 8 or OM9. Both test conditions described under the respective test shall be performed with a new test sample.\nTest number\nTest conditions\nIntended food contact conditions\nCovers the intended food contact conditions described in\nOM 8\nFood simulant E for 2 hours at 175 °C and food simulant D2 for 2 hours at 100 °C\nHigh temperature applications only\nOM1, OM3, OM4, OM5, and OM6\nOM 9\nFood simulant E for 2 hours at 175 °C and food simulant D2 for 10 days at 40 °C\nHigh temperature applications including long term storage at room temperature\nOM1, OM2, OM3, OM4, OM5 and OM6\n3.3.   Repeated use articles\nWhere a material or article is intended to come into repeated contact with foods, the migration test shall be carried out three times on a single sample using another sample of the food simulant on each occasion.\nIts compliance shall be checked on the basis of the level of the migration found in the third test. However, if there is conclusive proof that the level of the migration does not increase in the second and third tests and if the overall migration limit is not exceeded on the first test, no further test is necessary.\n3.4.   Screening approaches\nTo screen if a material or article complies with the migration limits any of the following approaches can be applied which are considered more severe than the verification method described in sections 3.1. and 3.2.\n3.4.1.   Residual content\nTo screen for overall migration the migration potential can be calculated based on the residual content of migratable substances determined in a complete extraction of the material or article.\n3.4.2.   Food simulant substitutes\nTo screen for overall migration food simulants can be replaced if based on scientific evidence the substitute food simulants overestimate migration compared to the regulated food simulants.\nCHAPTER 4\nCorrection factors applied when comparing migration test results with migration limits\n4.1.   Correction of specific migration in foods containing more than 20 % fat by the Fat Reduction Factor (FRF)\nFor lipophilic substances for which in Annex I it is indicated in column 7 that the FRF is applicable the specific migration can be corrected by the FRF. The FRF is determined according to the formula FRF = (g fat in food/kg of food)/200 = (% fat × 5)/100.\nThe FRF shall be applied according to the following rules.\nThe migration test results shall be divided by the FRF before comparing with the migration limits.\nThe correction by the FRF is not applicable in the following cases:\n(a)\nwhen the material or article is or is intended to be brought in contact with food intended for infants and young children as defined by Directives 2006/141/EC and 2006/125/EC;\n(b)\nfor materials and articles for which it is impracticable to estimate the relationship between the surface area and the quantity of food in contact therewith, for example due to their shape or use, and the migration is calculated using the conventional surface area/volume conversion factor of 6 dm2/kg.\nThe application of the FRF shall not lead to a specific migration exceeding the overall migration limit.\n4.2.   Correction of migration into food simulant D2\nFor the food categories where in sub-column D2 of column 3 of Table 2 of Annex III the cross is followed by a figure the migration test result into food simulant D2 shall be divided by this figure.\nThe migration test results shall be divided by the correction factor before comparing with the migration limits.\nThe correction is not applicable to the specific migration for substances in the Union list in Annex I for which the specific migration limit in column 8 is ‘not detectable’ and for non-listed substances used behind a plastic functional barrier covered by the rules of Article 13(2)(b) which should not migrate in detectable amounts.\n4.3.   Combination of correction factors 4.1 and 4.2.\nThe correction factors described in 4.1 and 4.2 can be combined for migration of substances for which the FRF is applicable when testing is performed in food simulant D2 by multiplying both factors. The applied maximum factor shall not exceed 5.\n(1)  This temperature shall be used only for food simulants D2 and E. For applications heated under pressure migration testing under pressure at the relevant temperature may be performed. For food simulants A, B, C or D1 the test may be replaced by a test at 100 °C or at reflux temperature for duration of four times the time selected according to the conditions in Table 1.\nANNEX VI\nCorrelation tables\nDirective 2002/72/EC\nThis Regulation\nArticle 1(1)\nArticle 1\nArticle 1(2), (3) and (4)\nArticle 2\nArticle 1a\nArticle 3\nArticle 3(1), Article 4(1) and Article 5\nArticle 5\nArticle 4(2), Article 4a(1) and (4), Article 4d, Annex II (2) and (3) and Annex III (2) and (3)\nArticle 6\nArticle 4a(3) and (6)\nArticle 7\nAnnex II (4) and Annex III (4)\nArticle 8\nArticle 3(1) and Article 4(1)\nArticle 9\nArticle 6\nArticle 10\nArticle 5a(1) and Annex I (8)\nArticle 11\nArticle 2\nArticle 12\nArticle 7a\nArticle 13\nArticle 9(1) and (2)\nArticle 15\nArticle 9(3)\nArticle 16\nArticle 7 and Annex I (5a)\nArticle 17\nArticle 8\nArticle 18\nAnnex II (3) and Annex III (3)\nArticle 19\nAnnex I, Annex II, Annex IV, Annex IVa, Annex V Part B, and Annex VI\nAnnex I\nAnnex II (2), Annex III (2) and Annex V, Part A\nAnnex II\nArticle 8(5) and Annex VIa\nAnnex IV\nAnnex I\nAnnex V\nDirective 93/8/EEC\nThis Regulation\nArticle 1\nArticle 11\nArticle 1\nArticle 12\nArticle 1\nArticle 18\nAnnex\nAnnex III\nAnnex\nAnnex V\nDirective 97/48/EC\nThis Regulation\nAnnex\nAnnex III\nAnnex\nAnnex V", "summary": "Plastic materials and articles in contact with food\nPlastic materials and articles in contact with food\nSUMMARY OF:\nRegulation (EU) No 10/2011 on plastic materials and articles intended to come into contact with food\nSUMMARY\nWHAT DOES THIS REGULATION DO?\nPlastic materials and articles that come into contact with food may transfer toxic substances to them and may be a risk to human health.\nThe regulation introduces migration limits* for substances used in such packaging and lays down conditions for their use to ensure food safety.\nIt sets out the requirements for the manufacture and marketing of plastic materials and articles intended to come into contact with food. These requirements supplement the general rules laid down in Regulation (EC) No 1935/2004 on materials and articles used for food packaging.\nThe plastic materials and articles and parts thereof may be composed:\nexclusively of plastics;\nof several layers of plastics; or\nof plastics combined with other materials.\nThe regulation does not apply to ion exchange resins, rubber or silicones.\nKEY POINTS\nAuthorised substances\nThe regulation lists the substances that may be intentionally used in the manufacture of plastic materials and articles. The list includes:\nmonomers;\nadditives (excluding colorants);\npolymer production aids (excluding solvents); and\nmacromolecules obtained from microbial fermentation.\nNew substances are added to the list if the European Food Safety Authority issues a favourable opinion following an application and approval procedure.\nPlacing on the market\nTo be placed on the EU market, the plastic materials and articles in question must comply with:\nthe requirements for use, labelling and traceability set out in Regulation (EC) No 1935/2004;\nthe good manufacturing practice defined in Regulation (EC) No 2023/2006;\nrequirements regarding composition and the declaration on compliance (see below).\nThe Regulation's annexes set out the conditions of use for authorised substances and migration limits. All plastic materials and articles must comply with specific migration limits and overall migration limits.\nThe composition of each plastic layer of a material or article must comply with the Regulation. However, a layer which is not in direct contact with food may:\nnot comply with the restrictions and specifications of this Regulation (except for vinyl chloride monomer, as provided in Annex I);\nbe manufactured with substances not included on the list of authorised substances (these substances, however, must not be mutagenic*, carcinogenic* or toxic to reproduction, or be in nanoform*).\nThe manufacturer must draw up a written declaration (Annex IV). This must identify the materials, articles and products from the intermediate stages of their manufacture, as well as the substances themselves. It must be renewed when substantial changes in the composition or production occur.\nFROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?\n              \nIt applies from 4 February 2011.\nBACKGROUND\nFood Contact Materials - Introduction\nUnion Guidelines on Regulation (EU) No 10/2011 on plastic materials and articles intended to come into contact with food\nKEY TERMS\n* Migration limits: the maximum amount of substances that materials and articles may transfer to food. They are expressed in milligrams of substance per kilogram of food (mg/kg).\n* Mutagenic: a physical or chemical agent that changes the genetic material of an organism and thus increases the frequency of mutations above the natural background level.\n* Carcinogenic: an agent directly involved in causing cancer.\n* Nanoform: natural, incidental or manufactured substance containing particles, in an unbound state or as an aggregate or as an agglomerate and where, for 50% or more of the particles in the number size distribution, one or more external dimensions is in the size range 1 nanometre-100 nanometre (i.e. one billionth of a metre).\nACT\n            \nCommission Regulation (EU) No 10/2011 of 14 January 2011 on plastic materials and articles intended to come into contact with food (OJ L 12, 15.1.2011, pp. 1–89)\nThe successive amendments and corrections to Regulation (EU) No 10/2011 have been incorporated into the original text.
